He was represented before the ORG by Mr W. Tomczyk , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant , who had been a candidate for ORG , submitted a lustration declaration as required by LAW DATE on disclosing work for or service in the ORG \u2019s security services or collaboration with them DATE by persons exercising public functions ( ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub s\u0142u\u017cby w organach bezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stwa lub wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z nimi w latach DATE os\u00f3b pe\u0142ni\u0105cych funkcje publiczne \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) . In the declaration he admitted that he had served ( pe\u0142ni\u0142 s\u0142u\u017cb\u0119 ) in the ORG \u2019s security services . In the explanatory \u201c B \u201d section of the declaration he stated that he had been a company commander in ORG ( PERSON NORP Wewn\u0119trzna \u2013 \u201c the WSW \u201d ) .", "Afterwards , ORG ( ORG PERSON ) published information that the applicant had served in the ORG \u2019s security services within the meaning of the CARDINAL LAW . The applicant was elected as a member of ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) decided to institute proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case on the ground that he had lied in his lustration declaration by stating that he had served in the WSW , whereas in reality he had secretly cooperated with this service .", "On DATE ORG , acting as the firstinstance lustration court , found that the applicant had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the LAW and had therefore lied in his lustration declaration . The court established that in DATE , while serving in the army as a professional soldier , the applicant had been recruited as a secret collaborator with the military counter - intelligence service of the ORG . The applicant had thus lied in his declaration . He must have known that he had served as a commander of a platoon of ORG in PERSON ( PERSON ) and not the WSW .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision . He argued that he had admitted to having had ties with the security service \u2013 the ORG \u2013 but had mistakenly characterised the nature of his contacts as \u201c service \u201d . The applicant pointed to the lengthy period of time that had elapsed since the events in question and to the lack of clarity of the declaration , which he had had difficulties in filling out .", "On DATE ORG , acting as the secondinstance lustration court , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court reiterated that the purpose of the lustration declaration was to reflect the truth . The content of the declaration should be exhaustive and its form should comply with legal requirements . The court agreed with the firstinstance court that the applicant had denied having been an intentional and secret collaborator with the ORG , which had been the ORG \u2019s security service within the meaning of the law . Lastly , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s assertion that he had committed a mistake while filling out the declaration . The court found that there had been no mistake as to the facts because the applicant had obviously known that his place of service was ORG and not the ORG . Nor could he claim that there had been a mistake as to the law , as it had been his duty to acquaint himself with LAW and the explanatory note on the declaration .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal ( kasacja ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded . ORG followed the lower ORG findings that the applicant had undoubtedly been an intentional and secret collaborator with the secret service , the WSW . This collaboration had nothing in common with the official contacts the applicant had had with the ORG while serving in the army , but had been a secret collaboration initiated by his signing a collaboration declaration . ORG reiterated that the purpose of LAW had also been to disclose the past of politicians , who in a democratic ORG should be transparent and whose past should be known . Finally , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations that the form of the declaration had been confusing or open to contradictory interpretations . As a consequence of this judgment of ORG , on DATE the applicant lost his seat in ORG .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted that he had been notified of that decision on DATE .", "The relevant domestic law and practice concerning lustration proceedings in GPE are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no .
