The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the applicant , who has retired in the meantime , was a practising lawyer . For DATE he represented company ORG , which traded in cars . In DATE insolvency proceedings were commenced before the St ORG ( PERSON ) in respect of company H.", "CARDINAL . NORP In these proceedings the applicant asserted claims totalling CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL euros ( EUR ) . The liquidator only acknowledged claims in the amount of ORG GPE and refused to admit the remaining claim of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to the insolvency proceedings . According to the ORG , the liquidator acknowledged the applicant 's claims insofar as they related to services rendered to the insolvent company ORG He rejected the remainder of the applicant 's claim as it related to services rendered to other entities within the group of companies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) before the St ORG , requesting a declaratory decision that he was entitled to claim ORG CARDINAL from the company 's assets . He estimated the amount in dispute ( PERSON ) , which serves as the basis for calculating court fees , lawyers ' fees and other procedural costs , at LAW . Apparently this amount was what he expected to obtain as his quota in the insolvency proceedings . On the basis of this estimated amount in dispute , the applicant paid court fees of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE the PERSON Regional Court , of its own motion , fixed the amount in dispute at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , holding that the claim was of a pecuniary nature and could not therefore be the subject of an estimate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed claiming , inter alia , that the fixing of the amount in dispute violated his right of access to a court . He argued that since the liquidator had contested his claim , he had no choice other than to request a declaratory decision under section CARDINAL of LAW in order to participate in the insolvency proceedings , in which he could at best hope to obtain a small percentage of the overall amount claimed . It was excessive to take the overall amount claimed as the amount in dispute , because the ensuing court fees would exceed the amount he could realistically expect to obtain . The contested decision therefore prevented him in practice from pursuing his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It referred to its own established case - law and to ORG case - law which confirmed the view that in proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW the amount the claimant wished to assert in the insolvency proceedings had to be taken as the amount in dispute , without regard to the quota likely to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , without examining the merits .", "CARDINAL . At some later stage the applicant and the liquidator agreed to suspend the proceedings , apparently in order to reach an out - of - court settlement .

Subsequently , the applicant filed an application for rectification . He claimed that ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and not EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL should be taken as the basis for calculating the court fees . He repeated his argument that the request for a declaratory decision under section CARDINAL of LAW had been aimed solely at establishing whether he was entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings , in which he could at best expect to obtain a small percentage of the overall amount claimed . The court had therefore wrongly found that the claim at issue was of a pecuniary nature and that the amount in dispute should be equal to the amount claimed .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for rectification , stating that the costs officer was bound by the decision of DATE which had fixed the amount in dispute .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint for lack of prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant 's complaint as being unfounded . It referred to its established case - law according to which , in proceedings concerning a pecuniary claim , the amount of the claim was to be taken as the amount in dispute . Consequently , there was no scope for an assessment of the amount in dispute by the claimant . The court noted that this case - law also applied to proceedings under LAW . Again referring to its established case - law , ORG confirmed that the costs officer and the President of ORG were bound by the decision of DATE which had fixed the amount in dispute .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision was served on the applicant on DATE . The applicant paid the court fees in their entirety on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( PERSON ) deals with court fees in civil proceedings . According to section CARDINAL of that Act , the amount in dispute serves as the basis for calculation of the court fees , unless otherwise provided .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , court fees are fixed as a lump sum depending on the value in dispute .

In the above - mentioned case , ORG dealt with the claimant 's argument that it would be more appropriate to make an estimate of the amount in dispute . The court noted that as a general rule there was no scope for making an estimate of the amount in dispute where the subject of the action for a declaratory decision was a pecuniary claim . The question of whether a claim was recoverable or not was not material for fixing the amount in dispute , and in that respect there was no difference between proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW and other civil proceedings . Moreover , an action under section CARDINAL also had effects outside the insolvency proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the costs of proceedings concerning the admission of claims , section CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c The procedural costs are to be met from the estate in so far as the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator has participated in the contesting of claims .
