NORP The applicant , Mr Imrich Degro , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He was represented before the ORG by Mr I. Jur\u010di\u0161in , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an action against a private company alleging that it had sold him a car that had permanent defects . Accordingly , the applicant asked the court to order the defendant to replace the car or , alternatively , refund him the purchase price .", "CARDINAL . The action was granted by ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) on DATE and , following an appeal lodged by the defendant , its judgment was upheld by ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The order that the defendant replace the car or refund the purchase price became final and binding ( pr\u00e1voplatnos\u0165 ) on DATE , following service of ORG judgment on the parties . After the expiry of the period allowed for voluntary compliance with the order , the order became enforceable ( vykonate\u013enos\u0165 ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The defendant then filed a petition with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , requesting that the latter exercise his discretionary power to challenge the above - mentioned judgments by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie DATE \u201c extraordinary appeal \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time , presumably still in DATE , the ORG acceded to the request by challenging the contested judgments in ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) .", "CARDINAL . In his extraordinary appeal , the ORG relied on Article CARDINALf \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which permits such an appeal on the grounds that the challenged decision is based on an incorrect assessment of points of law .", "In particular , the ORG argued that the courts had misinterpreted the consumerprotection rule pertaining to the case . The rule provided that a consumer who purchased goods or a service that had a reparable defect had the same remedies available to him or her as when the goods or service had an irreparable defect , provided that the supplier of such goods or service had failed to repair the reparable defect within DATE of being asked to do so .", "According to the ORG , however , that rule was not applicable in a situation where DATE such as the applicant in the present case DATE had not used the remedy related to irreparable defects but had taken possession of the repaired goods despite the fact that the repair had been carried out after the statutory DATE period .", "CARDINAL . In his observations in reply , the applicant disagreed with the interpretation of the relevant rule by the ORG . It was far too restrictive and disregarded the object and purpose of the consumer protection legislation . He argued that the interpretation of that rule by the lower courts had been correct in his case : since the defendant had failed to observe the statutory DATE period for repairing the car , the applicant had been entitled to the remedies granted by those courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal by quashing the contested judgments and remitting the case to the first - instance court for re - examination , having fully endorsed the line of argument pursued by the ORG . ORG judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings are now pending at first instance .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG finds a complaint to be justified , it shall deliver a decision stating that the person \u2019s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph CARDINAL have been violated by a final decision , specific measure or other act and shall quash that decision , measure or act . If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which has violated the [ person \u2019s ] rights or freedoms to take the necessary action . At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order that authority to refrain from violating the [ person \u2019s ] fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision on a complaint ORG may grant appropriate financial compensation to a person whose rights under paragraph CARDINAL have been violated .", "CARDINAL . The liability for damage or other loss of a person who has violated the rights or freedoms as referred to in paragraph CARDINAL shall not be affected by ORG decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW , the parties to the proceedings are to contribute to the purpose of the proceedings , in particular by giving a truthful and complete description of all the relevant facts , adducing evidence , and abiding by the instructions of the court .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the parties to the proceedings are to adduce evidence to uphold their claims .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , as soon as a matter has been resolved by force of a final and binding decision or a judgment , it may not give rise to new proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , LAW DATE , CARDINAL DATE , with further references ) . Appeals on points of law have no automatic suspensive effect , as the power to suspend the enforceability of the impugned decision is entrusted to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Extraordinary appeals on points of law are regulated by the provisions of Articles CARDINALe et seq .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has the power to challenge a decision of a court by means of an extraordinary appeal . He or she may do so following the filing of a petition by a party to the proceedings or another person concerned or injured by the decision , provided that the ORG concludes that : the final and binding decision has violated the law ; the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of individuals , legal entities or the ORG requires that such an appeal be brought ; such protection can not be achieved by other means ; and the matter at hand is not excluded from judicial review ( Articles CARDINALe \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINALf \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An extraordinary appeal may only be lodged against a ruling in a decision which has been contested by the party to the proceedings or the person concerned or injured by that decision ( LAW ) . Unless a statute provides otherwise , the ORG is bound by the scope of the petition for an extraordinary appeal ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further conditions of admissibility of an extraordinary appeal are listed in LAW . They comprise ( a ) major procedural flaws within the meaning of LAW ( see , for example , GPE PERSON Springer GPE , a.s . v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , ( b ) other errors of procedure resulting in an erroneous decision on the merits , and ( c ) wrongful assessment of points of law .", "CARDINAL . An extraordinary appeal is to be lodged with ORG within DATE of the contested judicial decision becoming final and binding ( Article CARDINAL g ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the ORG concludes , following the filing of a petition by a party to the proceedings or another person concerned or injured by the impugned decision , that there is the risk of considerable economic loss or other serious irreparable consequences , the extraordinary appeal may be lodged without stating the reasons for appeal . The reasons must then be stated within DATE of the lodging of the extraordinary appeal with ORG , failing which the proceedings will be discontinued ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If the extraordinary appeal is accompanied by a request that the enforceability of the contested decision be suspended , its enforceability must be suspended following the lodging of the extraordinary appeal with ORG ( Article CARDINAL ha \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The duration of such a suspension is regulated by Article CARDINAL ha \u00a7 CARDINAL , pursuant to which the suspension ceases ( a ) when the request is dismissed or ( b ) with a decision on the extraordinary appeal , unless extended by ORG , DATE from the lodging of the extraordinary appeal with it .", "CARDINAL . A copy of the extraordinary appeal is to be sent to the parties to the proceedings for observations . The decision on the extraordinary appeal must be sent to the parties to the proceedings and to the ORG ( Article CARDINALi DATE and Article CARDINALj ) .", "CARDINAL .

In a decision ( uznesenie ) of DATE in an unrelated case ( no . ORG . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG dismissed a motion by ORG that certain provisions of the ORG concerning extraordinary appeals were contrary to LAW . That motion was lodged by ORG in the context of extraordinary appeal proceedings instituted by the ORG concerning the review of an administrative decision on a restitution claim ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "In its decision , ORG observed , inter alia , that the extraordinary appeal was an extraordinary means for ensuring that judicial decisions were not only formally final but also right in terms of content . A clear discrepancy between the degrees of respect shown for those CARDINAL principles in an individual case could justify an interference with the former principle for the benefit of the latter . However , that would be so only in instances of a striking violation of constitutional principles of procedure , the principle of a fair trial or a denial of justice , which were not amenable to correction by other means .", "According to ORG , for an extraordinary appeal to be acceptable its use had to be limited to instances of the most serious errors in procedure or its outcome ( linked to either factual or legal assessment ) , and to instances where other available legal remedies had been exhausted .", "Moreover , ORG held that by virtue of the power to lodge an extraordinary appeal , the ORG was a statutory intermediary for ensuring protection of the rights of the parties and other persons concerned or injured by the contested decision .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE in an unrelated case ( no . LAW . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning an individual complaint , ORG held , inter alia , that in extraordinary appeal proceedings before ORG the ORG did not have the standing of a party to the proceedings as such , but rather had a sui generis standing , similar to that of the parties . In such proceedings , the ORG had no subjective interest of his or her own . Rather , the protection from unlawful final and binding decisions pursued in those proceedings served the general interest .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE in another unrelated case ( no . LAW . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning an individual complaint , ORG observed , among other things , that individuals and legal entities that had petitioned the ORG to lodge an extraordinary appeal had no legal claim to have such an appeal lodged and that , conversely , the ORG was under no legal duty to accommodate the request . It was within the ORG \u2019s entire discretion to decide whether or not to lodge an extraordinary appeal . The extraordinary appeal was an extraordinary remedy . There was no legal right to have it lodged on one \u2019s behalf . A petition for an extraordinary remedy did not enjoy constitutional protection and was not covered by the catalogue of fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , in an unrelated case ( no . QUANTITY M Obdo V CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG rejected an extraordinary appeal by the ORG concerning a property dispute . It held that an extraordinary appeal was not admissible in circumstances where it was open to the party concerned to pursue its rights directly by way of an appeal on points of law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
