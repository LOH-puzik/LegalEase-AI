He requested exemption from court fees . In the statement of claim he gave his permanent address and another address specified for service of court correspondence .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the court ordered that the statement of claim be served on ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE G.P. , represented by a privatelyhired lawyer , replied to the claim .

On DATE the court requested the plaintiffs to submit additional information in respect of their request for exemption from court fees . The summons was sent to the applicant \u2019s permanent address , but it was not served on him as he was no longer living at that address . The summons was sent to the coplaintiff \u2019s permanent address and was served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court refused to grant an exemption as the plaintiffs had failed to submit the necessary information . This decision was sent to the applicant \u2019s permanent address .

On DATE the applicant and his co - plaintiff appealed against this decision . Their appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . On an unspecified date the applicant paid CARDINAL of the legal costs incurred by the defendant , in the amount of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant and the co - plaintiff claimed compensation from ORG . They submitted that ORG had breached LAW by setting the civil proceedings in motion despite the fact that their request for an exemption from court fees had not been decided at that time . The court had wrongly and unlawfully served the statement of claim on the defendant before the issue of exemption from the court fees had been decided . The defendant , relying on that service and assuming that there had been no impediment to proceeding with the case at that time , had incurred legal costs . The court had also failed to serve the refusal of exemption on the applicant properly , despite the fact that the applicant had already informed it of his address for service of judicial correspondence in his statement of claim . When this decision was ultimately served on them , the plaintiffs decided to withdraw their claim . Nonetheless , they had been obliged to pay in full the legal costs borne by the defendant .", "CARDINAL .

It further acknowledged that the plaintiffs had sustained damage as they had to reimburse the costs borne by the defendant .", "However , the court was of the view that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the damage had been caused exclusively by the court \u2019s procedural error in serving the summons . In their pleadings withdrawing their claim they had referred not only to the refusal of exemption but also to the fact that the defendant had left the country . Moreover , the plaintiffs had been obliged to pay the defendant \u2019s costs not because the court had refused to grant them an exemption , but because they had withdrawn their claim . They had therefore failed to show the existence of a normal causal link ( normalny zwi\u0105zek przyczynowy ) between the acts of ORG , represented by the court , and the uncontested damage which they had suffered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his co - plaintiff appealed against that decision , arguing that their obligation to reimburse the defendant \u2019s costs had arisen essentially because their statement of claim had been incorrectly served on the defendant . They had thereby been drawn into the litigation unlawfully and despite the fact that they had already requested exemption from the court fees in their statement of claim .", "CARDINAL . A hearing in the case was held on DATE . The applicant attended the hearing . The court informed him that the judgment on the merits of the case would be given on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
