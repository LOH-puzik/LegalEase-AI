SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , PERSON and their CARDINAL children are NORP nationals of GPE origin , born DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . It appears that the first applicant was born in GPE . The applicants currently live in GPE , GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant spouses and their CARDINAL eldest children entered GPE in DATE and requested asylum . In support of their application they maintained that , being GPE , they would be harassed and discriminated against upon return to GPE . Their request was refused by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on DATE .", "The spouses re - applied and included their other CARDINAL children , who were born in GPE in DATE and DATE .", "Their request was refused by ORG on DATE and this decision was upheld on appeal by ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) on DATE . At some point , leave to appeal was refused by ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) .", "Their request was also refused by ORG on DATE , and this decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to revoke the deportation order in respect of the first applicant .", "Originally , the applicants were to be deported to the then ORG and GPE .", "On DATE the NORP Government informed the ORG that the applicants had said that they were willing to cooperate in their return to GPE . They had not , however , submitted any documents regarding their identity . They had visited ORG in order to obtain travel documents , but GPE is not prepared to receive them as it can not find the applicants in its registers and the applicants have no identity papers which show that they are from GPE . The enforcement of the expulsion order will therefore be turned over to the police . To sum up , it was not possible to be more exact as regards the destination to which the applicants would be deported , but the efforts will be focused on GPE , unless the applicants show that some other country is prepared to receive them .", "The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien 's health status . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien 's home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "In the ORG 's ORG from GPE , DATE , the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees states as follows :", "\u201c III . Eligibility for International Protection", "All claims by asylum - seekers from GPE should be considered on the basis of their individual merits according to fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures .", "Some of the claims lodged by asylum - seekers from GPE may give rise to possible exclusion from refugee status . ORG considers that groups set out in this section face a particular risk of persecution or serious harm in GPE , including through cumulative discriminatory acts . This listing is not to be construed as exhaustive and is based on information available to the ORG at the time of writing .", "A. Main Groups at Risk", "CARDINAL . NORP and NORP in Minority Situations , and GPE", "GPE NORP and GPE NORP inhabiting areas where they are in the minority , and GPE Roma inhabiting any part of GPE , continue to face serious restrictions to their freedom of movement and the exercise of fundamental human rights , including serious societal and sometimes administrative discrimination that would limit in particular their ability to exercise their political , social and economic rights . Furthermore , there are reports of threats and physical violence perpetrated against these communities . The NORP and NORP minorities , due to their racial and ethnic characteristics , may be confused with ORG . Similarly to ORG , the NORP and NORP minorities often lack identity papers and are therefore placed in difficult circumstances with regard to access to social services , health care and education . Asylum applications from members of these communities should be assessed carefully in order to evaluate whether there is a need for international protection , based on a risk of persecution on grounds of actual or perceived race or nationality . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
