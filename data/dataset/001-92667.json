The aims of non penal activities of prosecutors , irrespective of their substantive or procedural differences , are much more concordant : ensuring rule of law ( integrity of democratic decisions , legality , observance of law , remedy against violation of law ) , protection of rights and liberties of persons ( mostly of those incapable to protect their rights \u2013 minors , persons with unknown domicile , mentally incapables ) , protection of assets and interests of ORG , protection of public interest ( or of public order ) , harmonisation of jurisdiction of courts ( special remedies against final court decisions in the best interest of law , action as parties in such proceedings of the highest court levels ) ...", "CARDINAL . ... [ T]he ORG is aware of occasional improper practice of public prosecutors acting outside the field of criminal justice assessed by the ORG or by certain ORG or criticised by other bodies of ORG . The most disconcerting events were in connection with rejection without reason of requests to start civil law court actions ; intervention in court proceedings without reasonable interest ( of ORG , of public interest or based on protection of rights ) violating the principle of equality of arms ; quashing of final judgment of courts violating the principle of legal certainty ( res judicata ) ; participation of prosecutors in panels of supreme courts confusing the decision - making role of judges with prosecutors tasks ; unlimited right to start litigation .", "CARDINAL .
