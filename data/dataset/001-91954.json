The applicant submitted an objection to the employer , which remained undecided . By a decision of DATE , the applicant was dismissed , since the new post had been terminated . On DATE the employer set this latter decision aside .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil claim against the employer , requesting the court to annul the reassignment decision . She claimed that the new post had not been stipulated in the employer 's Rules on Posts ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) and it did not correspond to her qualifications and work experience .", "On DATE ORG annulled the reassignment decision and ordered the employer to reinstate the applicant to a post corresponding to her qualifications . The court noted that , under the Rules , there had been CARDINAL requirements related to the new post : a certain level of education ( level \u201c IV \u201d ) and a particular type of education , leading to qualification as a \u201c caterer \u201d ( \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b ) . It found that while the applicant had the required level of education , the reassignment had been contrary to the employer 's collective agreement in that she did not satisfy the requirement as to the type of education : she had specialised in commerce ( \u0442\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 ) , but not in catering ( \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) . The court dismissed the employer 's argument that the applicant had been reassigned for disciplinary reasons , since no such reasons had been given in the reassignment decision . The claim value of the dispute was not specified in the introductory part of the first - instance court 's decision , as is usually the case .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the employer 's appeal , finding no grounds to depart from the reasons given by the lower court .", "On DATE the employer lodged an appeal on points of law ( \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) with ORG , arguing that the fact that the applicant did not have the type of education stipulated for the new post could not be the sole reason to declare the reassignment decision unlawful . It maintained that her reassignment had been carried out under the then Labour Act and the collective agreement , which required a particular level of education ( \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 ) , but not a particular type of education .", "In her reply submitted to ORG on DATE , the applicant argued that she had been reassigned because she had discovered some work - related irregularities . She did not raise any complaints about ORG competence to examine her case .", "On DATE ORG accepted the employer 's appeal and overturned the lower courts ' decisions .
