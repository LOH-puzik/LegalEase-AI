The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG f\u00fcr ORG ( \u201c ORG , hereafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) was founded in DATE . According to its statutes , the objective of the bank was the pooling and prudent management of the financial means of the trade unions and cooperative organisations . The majority shareholder at the time was ORG ( PERSON , hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ( PERCENT ) ) together with the ORG cooperatives ( PERCENT ) . After the ORG went bankrupt in DATE , ORG , a NORP bank , took over their shares . From DATE on , the ORG was the only shareholder . On DATE a merger between ORG and ORG , the NORP postal savings bank , which had been privatized some time before , created the largest retail bank in GPE . Due to what became known as \u201c the ORG affair \u201d in which high losses were incurred , ORG was sold on CARDINAL DATE to a consortium led by a GPE private equity firm , ORG", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG had gone into speculative transactions in the LOC which were conducted by PERSON , son of the then director of the board of management , PERSON . When it had become public that PERSON had been entrusted with ORG CARDINAL without his father seeking the formal approval of ORG , the NORP investments had been abandoned , but such transactions had been started again by PERSON successor , PERSON , with ORG approval DATE . These investments led to a massive loss of CARDINAL , with ORG risking insolvency in DATE . It seems that the ORG was only saved by a financial guarantee given by the ORG . The losses themselves were booked into offshore accounts in the LOC and accounts at GPE futures broker ORG . ORG concluded in a report in DATE that the transactions had not been in compliance with NORP banking laws .", "CARDINAL . Details of the above - described speculative investments became public in DATE when ORG \u2019s former partner ORG filed for bankruptcy in GPE . Shortly before the company went bankrupt , a personal loan of ORG MONEY was given to PERSON , the Chief Executive Officer of ORG . DATE PERSON was arrested in the GPE and charged with falsifying the account books . When the extent of the exposure to the LOC investments became known at DATE , ORG Chairman , PERSON , and PERSON , President of the ORG , the majority shareholder of ORG , both resigned . In DATE PERSON successor , PERSON , resigned as well .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since FAC held PERCENT of the shares in ORG , creditors of and shareholders in ORG who had suffered losses caused by the insolvency of the futures broker claimed compensation from ORG in the amount of MONEY . On DATE ORG agreed to pay CARDINAL in order to avoid prosecution in the GPE and to settle compensation claims after having acknowledged its role in ORG \u2019s collapse . A financial guarantee made by GPE stabilised the bank and made it possible to continue business .", "On DATE Parliament adopted the ORG - PSK Security Collateral Act ( ORG - PSK Sicherungsgesetz ) which granted ORG the possibility to take over liability in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( Haftungs\u00fcbernahme ) , as in the meantime considerable amounts had been withdrawn from giro and savings accounts at the bank . The LAW also contained the condition that the bank had to be sold to a third party .", "CARDINAL . The events involving ORG received extensive media coverage inside and outside GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was dissolved and elections were scheduled for DATE . On DATE the elections took place and ORG won the majority of seats in ORG ( PERSON ) . Together with ORG ( \u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei ) , which became the second - biggest group in ORG , it formed a coalition government . The swearing in ceremony ( GPE ) of the new government took place on DATE . In the meantime , in its first parliamentary session on DATE ORG decided to set up ORG ( GPE ) which had the task of investigating into the efficiency of the bodies controlling and monitoring the well functioning of the capital market in GPE . In this context the events leading to the difficulties of ORG and the role of ORG ( ORG ) were CARDINAL of the principal subject matters of the enquiry of the commission . The commission did not deliver a written report , since its activities ended prematurely on DATE , but in oral conclusions given by its president to ORG , the necessity of a reform of ORG was emphasized .", "CARDINAL . In DATE preliminary enquiries ( Vorerhebungen ) were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of breach of trust and fraud in aggravating circumstances in connection with his former position as director of the board of management of ORG . Investigations were also opened against several co - suspects .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was repeatedly questioned by ORG ( Bundeskriminalamt ) and ORG . The applicant , who was staying in his house in PERSON ( GPE ) , attended the interviews in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE preliminary investigations ( Voruntersuchungen ) were opened against the applicant and several co - suspects .", "CARDINAL . Further questioning of the applicant was scheduled for DATE . On DATE in the morning the applicant felt ill in the bathroom of his house in PERSON and was taken by ambulance to a hospital specialising in heart diseases . Subsequently , through his lawyer , he informed ORG of these events and stated that he could not appear for questioning in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The events surrounding the difficult financial situation of ORG and the preliminary investigations against leading managers of the bank were widely covered by the NORP media . In issue no . CARDINAL of the print magazine ORG , which came out on DATE , an article reporting on the applicant was published , stating that the illness which he claimed had prevented him from appearing for further questioning in GPE , had been a simple pretext for attempting to evade court proceedings in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the Investigating Judge at ORG , who had been made aware of the imminent publication of the above - mentioned article , issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant . According to the warrant there was a serious suspicion ( dringender PERSON ) against the applicant of having committed breach of trust , fraud in aggravating circumstances and offences under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Aktiengestz ) . He was suspected of having abused his power as director of the board of management of ORG when disposing of the bank \u2019s assets and causing damage in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . From DATE onwards he had concluded high - risk speculative transactions with Mr PERSON , in disregard of losses accrued from previous such transactions , and had circumvented internal safeguards , deceiving the statutory organs of the bank and its employees .", "CARDINAL . The Investigating Judge stated that in DATE the applicant had deceived other members of the board of directors and members of the supervisory board ( GPE ) by concealing from them that in DATE losses of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL had accrued . By deceiving them as to the actual financial situation of the bank he had induced them to agree to a lump sum settling of his own and his wife \u2019s pension claims against ORG as an employee of that company . On DATE he had received a payment of CARDINAL NORP Schillings ( ORG ) , causing a financial loss to ORG of the same amount . By employing the same means he had obtained a premium payment in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . Further , he had made ORG sell him a penthouse apartment in a prestigious building owned by the bank at a price far below the market value .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the balance sheets of ORG and its affiliated companies ( ORG ) were incorrect and dissimulated its real financial situation . There were significant omissions ; for example , the balance sheets did not report the above - mentioned losses resulting from high - risk transactions , and by using complex constructions avoided admitting the need for depreciation ( PERSON ) in the amount of ORG CARDINAL and continued to treat the losses as outstanding money .", "CARDINAL . The suspicion against the applicant was based on investigations by ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) , ORG and ORG , enquiries by ORG ( ORG ) , material obtained at house searches and various statements by witnesses which had incriminated the applicant . The Investigating judge referred , inter alia , to a detailed report by ORG according to which he had initiated large - scale investments in risky speculations in breach of the relevant provisions of law . From the transcripts of meetings of the board of directors and the supervisory board it appeared that he had obtained the consent of its members by concealing the risks incurred , and providing false information as to guarantees given and other circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The Investigating Judge based the warrant of arrest on the risk of the applicant absconding under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . Such a risk was considered to exist because although the applicant had attended interviews by the authorities in the past , he had not shown up for DATE . According to the accounts of his defence lawyer he suffered from a heart disease , had to stay at home and could only leave his house for medical consultations . Because of his ill health he had to cut short conversations and telephone calls frequently and would not be at the court \u2019s disposal for DATE . This account of the defence was , however , in striking contradiction ( eklatantem Widerspruch ) to statements by CARDINAL witnesses , who had given a different account of the applicant \u2019s conduct . They had stated in particular that they had seen the applicant driving his car and , at the same time , using his mobile phone . Further , the medical certificates submitted by the defence appeared rather neutral in that the doctors recommended that the applicant not leave \u201c the region \u201d . On the basis of the ORG statements and the medical certificates there was no good reason to doubt that the applicant had attempted to evade justice . Since the information on his conduct , in contrast to the alleged state of health of the applicant , would become public on DATE through the publication of an article in the print magazine News , it would also become clear to the applicant that this would cause the NORP authorities to react , thus increasing the risk of him absconding .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that warrant of arrest the applicant was arrested by the NORP police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at the Aix - en - Provence Appeal Court ( ORG ) asked for an order remanding the applicant in custody pending extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation chamber ( Chambre de l\u2019instruction ) at the Aix - en - ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release on bail in the amount of EUR CARDINAL on the condition that he remain on NORP territory and hand over his passport . It further decided to grant the request for extradition in principle but considered that before handing the applicant over to the NORP authorities a further medical report should be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation chamber found that there were no reasons to delay the implementation of the extradition request . The applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the cardiology department of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the investigation chamber to stay the implementation of the extradition order because of his bad health . According to a medical report the applicant was suffering from angina pectoris .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation chamber provisionally stayed the implementation of the extradition order .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicant \u2019s health had deteriorated , a bypass operation was scheduled for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , however , as a result of close co - operation between the NORP and the NORP authorities , the applicant was declared fit to travel and was immediately transported by a specially equipped airplane from the hospital in GPE to GPE , where he arrived on TIME .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant \u2019s arrival in GPE on DATE he was formally arrested by the NORP police on the basis of the warrant of arrest of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent investigating judge at ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . She noted that the applicant had not attended the interview scheduled for DATE at ORG ( Bundeskriminalamt ) and had been excused at short notice by his defence counsel , who had stated that the applicant had had a very serious heart attack , was in need of permanent medical care and not fit to travel . These claims were in contrast to the applicant \u2019s conduct before and during the extradition proceedings . In this connection the investigating judge referred to the same arguments relied on by ORG DATE . The investigating judge concluded that in view of these circumstances , it was necessary to keep the applicant in custody pending trial . The applicant filed a complaint against that decision .", "CARDINAL . While in detention the applicant was transferred to the cardio surgery department of ORG in GPE ( Allgemeines Krankenhaus ) where , on DATE , a triple bypass operation was carried out on him . On DATE , while still officially in detention on remand , the applicant was transferred to a rehabilitation centre .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had filed a complaint ( Beschwerde ) against the warrant of arrest . He submitted that the warrant of arrest was unlawful because there was neither a serious suspicion against him , nor a risk of him absconding ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . He had never gone into hiding and , with CARDINAL exception , had complied with all summonses for questioning by the NORP authorities . The CARDINAL exception , his failure to appear for questioning on DATE , had been caused by his bad health , which had been proven by medical certificates . The warrant had merely been based on the article published in News on DATE and the statements of the journalists , which were dubious . Furthermore , he was well integrated in GPE , had relatives and real estate there and his domicile in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that there was a serious suspicion against the applicant of having committed offences including fraud and breach of trust and referred to the results of the criminal investigations , to which the Investigating Judge had also referred in the warrant of arrest .", "CARDINAL . As regards the risk of absconding , ORG observed that the risk had to earned a high salary and received other payments before his retirement . In the course of the preliminary investigations some of the accounts held by the applicant or by foundations created by him had been frozen , but , even allowing for a particularly comfortable lifestyle , it was highly probable that the applicant still possessed financial means which would be sufficient for absconding and starting a new life elsewhere . In view of the particularly high amount of supposed damage , CARDINAL one billion euros , and the various offences the applicant was accused of , he risked a term of imprisonment of DATE in the event of conviction . This was certain to be seen as a particularly severe sanction by a person in the applicant \u2019s position .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the applicant had already taken steps to evade justice in GPE . ORG referred to the failure of the applicant to appear for questioning on DATE and the description of the serious state of the applicant \u2019s health , which was in contradiction to the detailed statements made by the CARDINAL journalists who had written the article in the print magazine News on DATE . After his arrest by the NORP police the applicant had not been admitted to hospital because of a serious heart attack , but in order to avoid any potential damage to his health . The applicant was released shortly afterwards and only DATE had entered a private clinic . There were no medical reports which , on the basis of a detailed diagnosis , proved that treatment in a hospital was indispensable .", "CARDINAL . Taking all these elements into account , it was considered that there was a risk of the applicant absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a \u201c fundamental rights complaint \u201d ( Grundrechtsbeschwerde ) with ORG . He submitted that the warrant of arrest issued against him had infringed his right to liberty and reiterated that there was no serious suspicion against him or a risk that he might abscond . He disputed in particular the assumptions that he had access to financial means besides the accounts which had been frozen and that his medical condition was not particularly serious .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( General - prokuratur ) filed observations on the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights complaint in which it asked ORG to dismiss the complaint . While the office accepted that the complaint was admissible , since the warrant of arrest had been one of the elements which had led to the applicant \u2019s arrest in GPE even though he had been released in the meantime , it was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant replied to ORG Office \u2019s submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the fundamental rights complaint . ORG agreed with ORG that the complaint was admissible . As regards the merits of the complaint , it observed that there was a serious suspicion against the applicant and there was also a risk that he might abscond . It was possible that the applicant had sufficient financial means at his disposal because , on the basis of the file , he had received considerable payments in the past , only a part of which were in the accounts which had been frozen . ORG agreed with ORG that there were other factors indicating a risk of the applicant absconding . ORG found that the steps taken by the doctors treating the applicant in GPE had been intended as preventive measures ( vorbeugende PERSON ) . The reference to the statement of the journalists had merely been a supplementary indication , but not a decisive element . It was therefore not relevant that on DATE their statements had been shown to be untrue . Since ORG had to examine the impugned decision on the basis of the elements known to ORG on DATE , those developments and others , such as medical reports obtained after that date , could not be taken into account . ORG had correctly applied the relevant provisions because a risk of absconding was also considered to exist when a suspect whose place of residence was known had tried to evade justice by deliberately delaying extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while extradition proceedings were pending against him in GPE , the applicant filed a request for the lifting of the warrant of arrest with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed this request . It observed , inter alia , that a risk of the applicant absconding existed as he had not turned up for questioning in GPE on DATE and had argued that a severe illness had prevented him from attending , while witnesses had observed him in situations in GPE which were not compatible with his alleged serious state of health . This being so , there was no doubt that the applicant had tried to evade justice in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint against ORG decision of DATE . He argued in particular that the statements of the witnesses who had allegedly seen him driving a car were untrue and that his state of health was serious , a fact which had been confirmed by recent examinations by specialists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint of CARDINAL DATE and referred at length to a previous decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It added that the risk of absconding had actually increased in the meantime , because on DATE ORG had filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and , on the basis of this indictment , he risked a lengthy term of imprisonment . The fact that he was at present staying in another member state of ORG did not remove the risk of him absconding , since the fact that he was outside the jurisdiction of the NORP authorities rendered in any event his prosecution by the NORP authorities more difficult .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fundamental rights complaint against ORG decision of DATE . He stressed that there was no risk of him absconding because the seriousness of his medical condition had meanwhile been confirmed by several specialists who had examined him in GPE . These reports had led ORG at the Aix - en - ORG to ask that court to suspend the applicant \u2019s extradition . These facts were , however , disregarded by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights complaint against ORG decision of DATE . ORG found that the applicant had essentially repeated the arguments he had made in his previous fundamental rights complaint of DATE , which had been answered by the court in its decision of DATE . In addition , ORG found that ORG had sufficiently dealt with the medical reports submitted in the extradition proceedings . The mere fact that the applicant had derived different conclusions from them did not render the assessment by ORG arbitrary .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant filed another request for the warrant of arrest issued against him to be lifted . He maintained that no serious suspicion of his having committed a criminal offence existed and that there was no risk of him absconding . Because of his serious medical condition , which had been sufficiently clarified by various medical reports , such a risk had to be excluded . Moreover , as long as he had been fit to do so he had voluntarily cooperated with the NORP judicial authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request . ORG observed that the bill of indictment against the applicant had been drawn up in the meantime , on DATE , and the suspicion against him had therefore grown . As regards the risk of absconding , it referred to statements by witnesses who had seen the applicant after he had refused to attend an interview in GPE on DATE , and who had seen him behaving in a way which did not correspond to his allegedly serious medical condition . In addition , the medical reports showed that the applicant was suffering from a heart condition but not to an extent which would make absconding impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , quoting at length its previous decisions of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fundamental rights complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights complaint as inadmissible . It found that under the relevant act it was an essential condition for filing a fundamental rights complaint that detention of the person lodging the complaint had actually been ordered by a criminal court . No complaint could be raised by a person already released . In the present case the applicant had already been released by the NORP courts at the time the court of second instance gave its decision and since the warrant of arrest was no longer being enforced by detention , he could not file a fundamental rights complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested again ORG to lift the warrant of arrest issued against him on DATE . He submitted that on DATE ORG at the Aix - en - ORG had applied to ORG to have the applicant \u2019s extradition postponed because he was not fit to travel . On DATE the investigation chamber at ORG granted ORG request and decided to stay the enforcement of the extradition order . In such circumstances the warrant of arrest was no longer justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release of DATE as it was not persuaded by the applicant \u2019s argument that he was not fit to travel because he suffered from a serious heart condition . It found that shortly after a supposed heart attack , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant had returned to his house instead of staying at the hospital . On DATE he had been capable of returning to his house from a clinic in GPE and , according to a statement by witness ORG , taken on DATE , the latter had seen the applicant driving his car on DATE . Moreover the transfer of the applicant to a cardiology department at a hospital following his arrest in GPE had only been ordered as a preventive measure . Also , the medical reports obtained by the NORP courts only referred to coronary insufficiency and occasional cardiac disrhytmia but denied that there had been a myocardial infarct or that there was a risk of ischaemia . According to these reports the pain the applicant complained of probably had other , possibly psychological , causes , and his transport from GPE to GPE would be compatible with his state of health . These findings were not affected by statements by medical surgeons appointed by the applicant as these were also in contradiction to the findings of the official court - appointed expert . Moreover , in its decision of QUANTITY DATE the Aix - en - Provence Appeal Court , when ordering release on bail , had not denied that there was a risk of the applicant absconding . The decision of the Aix - en - Provence Appeal Court of DATE to postpone the applicant \u2019s extradition could not be interpreted as a finding that the applicant was not fit to travel , but merely meant that for medical reasons the enforcement of the extradition order was postponed . The conclusion drawn by the applicant that since he was not fit to travel he could not abscond was not logical , as there was a difference between the authorities taking responsibility for and running the risk associated with his transport and he himself taking a possible medical risk in his own interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested release from detention . He submitted that the medical reports obtained hitherto showed the seriousness of his heart condition and that the reports of CARDINAL journalists , who had alleged in an article to have seen him driving a car , were untrue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request for release . It found that the risk of the applicant absconding persisted and endorsed the reasons given by the investigating judge . It added that the applicant had used his precarious state of health as a means to evade justice in GPE . According to a report by medical expert ORG of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant suffered from coronary heart disease , angina pectoris and hypertension and normocardial atrial fibrillation . The treatment prescribed was medicamentous and in addition a quick and as complete as possible regeneration of his blood flow was recommended . That report concluded that at the time of his transport to GPE , the applicant had been fit to travel and be questioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a triple bypass heart operation was carried out on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . He submitted that from the medical reports in the file it must have been clear that his heart condition had been serious from the outset . In his report of CARDINAL DATE doctor ORG had confirmed that his arterial constriction of PERCENT had made a bypass operation indispensable . In view of this medical data , the argument that there was a risk of him absconding had to be discounted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints of CARDINAL DATE ( against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ) , DATE ( against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ) and of DATE ( against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE on ordering detention on remand ) . ORG also decided that the applicant \u2019s detention could be extended until DATE . In the same decision ORG dismissed objections by the applicant and some of his co - accused against the bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE on his detention on remand , ORG found that the reasons provided in support of the finding that there was a risk of the applicant absconding , as set out in its previous decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , were still valid . There were reasons to assume that the applicant had substantial financial means besides the funds in his frozen accounts and he had made steps to evade justice in GPE , as was clear from his previous conduct . On DATE of court hearings in GPE he had regularly entered the hospital but always left soon after , which showed that his real intention had been to hinder his extradition to GPE . This was also confirmed by the medical report of doctor ORG , according to which the applicant \u2019s state of health had been stable , notwithstanding the necessity of a bypass operation , and that he had been fit to travel and that he could have attended court hearings . Moreover the court noted that the applicant \u2019s transport to GPE by airplane had gone smoothly and that it had not been necessary to use the medical equipment on board . Those considerations , together with those already mentioned in the previous decisions , and the fact that the bill of indictment against the applicant had meanwhile become final , confirmed that a risk of him absconding existed . It was true that , on DATE , a bypass operation on the applicant had been carried out and that as a result his mobility had been reduced , but only for the very short period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fundamental rights complaint ( Grundrechtsbeschwerde)against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the fundamental rights complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG observed first that its task in reviewing a decision on the existence of a risk of absconding consisted essentially in examining whether the existence of such a risk could , in an non - arbitrary manner , be deduced from the facts on which the decision was based . ORG decision could not be considered irrational or arbitrary . That court had based its decision on CARDINAL essential facts , namely , that the applicant risked a particularly high sentence if convicted , that not all of his financial means were in his frozen accounts and that he had known links abroad . These elements themselves indicated a particularly high risk of his absconding . The fact that the applicant had actually taken concrete steps to evade justice in GPE by pretending that he was not fit to travel although this had not been true , at least for a certain period , were only additional considerations which had been confirmed by the statements of doctor ORG , a court - appointed expert . A risk of absconding existed if a suspect , by whatever means , attempted to hinder criminal proceedings in GPE or to delay them . The question of whether events which occurred after the impugned decision had been taken might require the report of the expert doctor ORG to be supplemented could be left open , because they only concerned one element among those which had already provided a sound basis for the decision .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant , while officially in detention on remand , stayed at the GPE rehabilitation centre . On DATE he was moved to GPE prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a new request for release from detention . He submitted that all the experts who had examined him in GPE and later in GPE DATE with the exception of DATE had agreed that his heart condition was serious and that a coronary bypass operation was indispensable . That opinion had been shared by the director of the hospital in the GPE detention centre who had ordered the transfer of the applicant to a public hospital for urgent medical treatment . At that hospital he had undergone an urgent triple bypass operation on DATE . Since it had now been objectively proven that the applicant had never pretended to be ill but had , from the very beginning , suffered from a serious heart disease , there was no longer any basis for the presumption that he might abscond and thus detaining him .", "DATE . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant and in the same decision ordered that his detention continue until DATE . As regards the existence of a serious suspicion against him , the court referred to the charges against the applicant as described in detail in the bill of indictment of DATE , which had meanwhile become final . It also referred to the contents of ORG decision of DATE on the applicant \u2019s detention . As regards the heart disease which , in the applicant \u2019s view , would prevent him from fleeing , ORG referred to the report by the court appointed medical expert doctor ORG , according to which a risk of the applicant absconding could not be excluded by his state of health . ORG was still persuaded that the applicant had used his heart disease , which undoubtedly existed , as a pretext in order to avoid standing trial in GPE . ORG also found that other factors , which had already been discussed in detail in the court \u2019s previous decisions , confirmed the existence of a risk of the applicant absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In the same decision it extended his detention until DATE . As to the existence of a serious suspicion against him and the reasons for finding that there was a risk of him absconding , ORG referred to its previous decisions on appeals brought by the applicant and quoted extensively from them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fundamental rights complaint with ORG against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the fundamental rights complaint . Referring to the findings in its CARDINAL previous decisions on complaints by the applicant , ORG found that ORG had based its decision on facts which it had argued logically and coherently and from which it could deduct without any arbitrariness the existence of a risk of the applicant absconding . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a further request for release with ORG , submitting that there were no specific reasons which would justify detention on remand and that he should be released on bail . Further medical certificates dated CARDINAL DATE and DATE , which he had obtained in the meantime , showed that he had not been fit for questioning on DATE or since that date . Accordingly , his detention on remand was not justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing on review of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand ( GPE ) . It decided that the applicant \u2019s detention should continue and that the decision would be valid until DATE . As regards the existence of a serious suspicion against him and the risk of him absconding , ORG referred to the detailed findings in the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The court still based its findings regarding the applicant \u2019s state of health on the report of the court - appointed expert doctor ORG , who had concluded that the applicant had been fit to travel at the time of his extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and extended the validity of the detention order until DATE . It found that , as explained in detail in its previous decisions , a serious suspicion of the applicant having committed criminal offences existed . Further , it confirmed that there was a risk of him absconding . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument that he had no further means besides the funds in his frozen accounts , it noted that a further investment hitherto unknown had meanwhile been discovered , which cast doubt on the veracity of that contention . Taking all those circumstances into account , ORG considered that the real reason the applicant had delayed his extradition to GPE was not anxiousness about his health , but an attempt to evade justice in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fundamental rights complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . He submitted that before his arrest in GPE he had not made any attempt to abscond . His serious heart condition DATE and in view of his bypass operation there could no longer be any doubt that his heart disease was not serious and genuine \u2013 had been the only reason he had not attended an interview with the NORP authorities on DATE . As he had always considered the warrant of arrest issued against him unlawful , the fact that he had used all means provided for by NORP and NORP law in order to oppose its enforcement could not be held against him . ORG had based its findings concerning a risk of him absconding on mere assumptions and , in doing so , had disregarded all the medical facts which had been attested by the various heart specialists who had examined him . Also , the statements of the CARDINAL journalists , which had initially led to the warrant of arrest being issued against him , had been untrue .
