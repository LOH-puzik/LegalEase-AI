He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Ms M. Karadjova , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant was registered as a sole trader with the trade name \u201c PERSON GPE and obtained a value - added tax ( GPE ) registration also on an unspecified date .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife was registered as a sole trader with ORG with the trade name \u201c Rita-CARDINAL-Margarita Poryazova \u201d ( the \u201c sole trader \u201d ) .", "On DATE the applicant was authorised to represent the sole trader under a power of attorney , which granted him , inter alia , the following powers :", "\u201c ... to represent [ the sole trader ] before all bodies , organisations , firms , companies , traders , juridical and private persons in connection with all legal relationships of my [ sole trader ] , as well as to negotiate , send and receive offers , draft and sign contracts on my behalf , whereby for the purposes of the present power of attorney he has the power to sign on my behalf [ whatever ] is necessary ... \u201d", "On DATE the sole trader obtained a VAT registration .", "On DATE the applicant filed the sole trader \u2019s ORG return for DATE with the tax authorities . At the time of making the filing he was verbally informed that the ORG return was incomplete , that following an amendment of LAW the sole trader \u2019s VAT registration was subject to termination and that he had to make additional filings in order to complete that procedure . The applicant did not make an additional filing or a correction of the tax return .", "On an unspecified date he was invited by the tax authorities to present the additional documents and to make the necessary filings in order to terminate the VAT registration of the sole trader .", "The applicant made those filings on CARDINAL DATE and the VAT registration of the sole trader was terminated on DATE . At the same time , the tax authorities made a preliminary finding of a tax filing violation in respect of the applicant \u2019s failure to comply with the ORG filing requirements in respect of the sole trader .", "On the basis of the preliminary finding of CARDINAL DATE , ORG issued a penal decree of CARDINAL DATE against the applicant in the capacity of \u201c manager of the sole trader \u201d . It found that , in respect of the sole trader , he had failed ( CARDINAL ) to inform the tax authorities that as a result of its activities and turnover during DATE the sole trader no longer met the prerequisites for having a VAT registration , ( CARDINAL ) to make an accurate NORP filing for the tax period ending on DATE and ( CARDINAL ) to return the VAT registration certificate of the sole trader . A fine of CARDINAL old NORP levs [ ORG : MONEY ( ORG ) ] was imposed on the applicant . He was served with a copy of the penal decree on DATE .", "The applicant , using the title of \u201c manager of the sole trader \u201d , appealed against the penal decree on DATE . He claimed that the sole trader \u2019s business activities had been in decline for some time and that they had ceased after DATE . Nevertheless , the applicant noted that he had continued to file , on behalf of the sole trader , the required DATE ORG statements with the tax authorities for DATE . Considering that he had made adequate attempts to comply with the sole trader \u2019s VAT filing requirements and arguing that no losses had resulted for the ORG budget from his alleged filing infraction , the applicant claimed that the fine imposed was excessive . He also considered that it was imposed in reference to the wrong provision of LAW , namely that it referred to paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , while it should have referred to LAW .", "A hearing was conducted before ORG on DATE . The applicant was represented by counsel who stated that he maintained the grounds of the appeal as filed on DATE . In disputing the grounds and merits of imposing the fine on the applicant his counsel referred to him as the \u201c manager of the sole trader \u201d .", "In a judgment of DATE , DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found the actions of the applicant , as \u201c manager of the sole trader \u201d , to have violated the provisions of LAW and the regulations for its implementations by having failed to file all the required documents and statements in order to terminate the VAT registration , that ORG had correctly classified the offence of the applicant . It also considered that the size of the fine was properly set , insofar as the relevant provisions did not provide for an adjustment of the amount .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment on DATE , referring to himself as the \u201c manager \u201d of the sole trader . He argued that he was wrongly fined BGL CARDINAL when for the offence in question the applicable fine was allegedly BGL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . He also claimed that ORG had allegedly been confused between the provisions of LAW and the regulations for its interpretation , that it had wrongly examined the grounds for his appeal and had therefore come to the wrong conclusions .", "At a hearing on DATE , at which a prosecutor took part , the applicant reiterated his previous arguments and claimed that LAW envisaged that the registered entities should be fined but not their representatives . The applicant did not claim nor argue that he was not a legal representative of the sole trader .", "By final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found that the applicant , in his capacity of \u201c manager of the sole trader \u201d , had not complied with the tax filings requirements under LAW and had not presented all the required documents for the termination of the VAT registration of the trader . It also found that the fine was correctly determined because its size was in reference to an offence committed in respect of the tax period ending on DATE .", "By amendment of DATE the prerequisites for maintaining a registration under LAW were amended . Accordingly , special provisions were introduced for those persons and entities which no longer met the new requirements ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE of the Final Provisions of the Act ) detailing the procedure , deadlines and filing requirements for terminating their registrations and for returning their VAT registration certificates . For non - compliance with these requirements , LAW of FAC envisaged a fixed fine of BGL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for the offenders .", "The imposing of fines under LAW by way of penal decree and the appeals against them followed the procedure under LAW ( section CARDINAL ) .", "LAW ( DATE ) was abolished with the entry into force , as of DATE , of FAC ( DATE ) .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , as in force at DATE , envisaged a sanction applied directly on the sole trader or entity for failing to register or de - register under the LAW or to inform the tax authorities of any changes affecting such registration . The sanction was in the range from CARDINAL new NORP levs ( approximately from ORG CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that for offences perpetrated in the course of commercial activities the persons liable to be penalised under LAW are the employees or officers who perpetrated them or the managers who ordered them or allowed the offences to be committed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
