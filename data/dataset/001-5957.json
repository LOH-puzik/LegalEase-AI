THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In his statement of DATE , taken by the police , NORP had stated that a gold chain had been stolen from him by a person who he knew as PERSON . He described PERSON as \u201c CARDINAL \u2019\u2019 he has got a flat top afro hair and is slim \u201d .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and charged with robbing NORP of his gold chain . In an interview with the police DATE , he had admitted that he had been at the LOC known as \u201c ORG \u201d when the incident occurred on DATE . He alleged that another man called \u201c Blue \u201d had taken the chain and that he had talked to NORP , saying that he would try to get it back for him .", "On DATE , the applicant was remanded in custody .", "On DATE , the committal proceedings took place before ORG . The charges were read and explained to the applicant , who was represented . NORP gave evidence and described the person who robbed him as being black , pretty tall and having a flat - top hair cut . He however stated that , \u201c At the time I did n\u2019t know the person who robbed me ; I \u2019d never seen him before at that time . \u201d Questions were put to NORP in cross - examination by the applicant \u2019s counsel . The applicant was asked whether he wished to say anything in answer to the charge , to which he made no reply . The applicant was also given an opportunity to give evidence and to call witnesses . He did not do so . The applicant was committed for trial and detained on remand by order of the magistrates .", "On DATE at the trial at ORG , prosecuting counsel from ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) offered no evidence in support of the prosecution . According to the statement of claim issued by the applicant in later civil proceedings , prosecuting counsel informed the court that he had only just received the papers and that there were problems with them , referring to the identification of the applicant . After a short adjournment he asked for time to take a further statement from the victim PERSON then returned to the court and offered no evidence against the applicant . The applicant was released from custody .", "On DATE , the applicant issued proceedings against the ORG claiming damages for negligence . He alleged that the prosecution had failed to take reasonable care in assessing whether there was , at the committal proceedings on DATE , sufficient evidence against the applicant .", "On DATE the ORG issued an application to strike out the applicant`s claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action .", "On DATE a Deputy High Court Judge struck out the applicant`s statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action , following the ORG of PERSON case - law to the effect that there was no general duty of care owed by ORG in relation to its prosecutions ( GPE - daf v. the Commissioner of Police for the LOC [ DATE ] ORG , see below in Relevant Domestic Law and Practice ) . The judge was of the opinion that the applicant`s case involved \" a point of law of general importance \" and issued a certificate , pursuant to LAW ) of ORG DATE entitling the applicant to \" leapfrog \" , i.e. to petition ORG directly .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG for leave to appeal . Leave to appeal was refused on DATE .", "In GPE and GPE , there is no single tort which imposes liability to pay compensation for civil wrongs . Instead there are a series of separate torts , for example , trespass , conversion , conspiracy , negligence and defamation .", "Negligence arises in specific categories of situations . These categories are capable of being extended . There are CARDINAL elements to the tort of negligence : a duty of care , breach of the duty of care and damage . The duty of care may be described as the concept which defines the categories of relationships in which the law may impose liability on a defendant in damages if he or she is shown to have acted carelessly . To show a duty of care , the claimant must show that the situation comes within an existing established category of cases where a duty of care has been held to exist . In novel situations , in order to show a duty of care , the claimant must satisfy a CARDINAL test , establishing that :", "\u2013 damage to the claimant was foreseeable ;", "\u2013 the claimant was in an appropriate relationship of proximity to the defendant ; and", "\u2013 it is fair , just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant .", "These criteria apply to claims against private persons as well as claims against public bodies . The leading case is ORG v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) .", "If the courts decide that as a matter of law there is no duty of care owed in a particular situation , that decision will ( subject to the doctrine of precedent ) apply in future cases where the parties are in the same relationship .", "In the case of GPE - daf v. the Commissioner of Police for the LOC [ DATE ] ORG , ORG decided that no duty of care in negligence was owed by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) to defendants in fulfilling its statutory duty in prosecuting crime .", "The case concerned CARDINAL plaintiffs , who had been arrested , charged and arrested in custody for serious offences and after periods of DATE respectively the ORG had discontinued the proceedings against them . They had instituted proceedings against the ORG claiming inter alia that the ORG had been negligent in failing to act with reasonable diligence in concluding that they were either innocent / or the prosecution bound to fail . The claims were struck out by the judge on the basis that they disclosed no reasonable cause of action . Their appeals to ORG were dismissed . In the leading judgment , Lord Justice PERSON referred to the CARDINAL criteria laid down in GPE ( cited above ) and had regard to the considerations as to whether the ORG should be treated differently in tort from private citizens and corporations . He noted that the ORG was a public law enforcement agency acting for the public as a whole and that , having regard to the torts of malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office , a citizen aggrieved by a prosecutor \u2019s decision had potentially extensive private law remedies for a deliberate abuse of power .", "\u201c That brings me to the policy factors which , in my view , argue against the recognition of a duty of care by the ORG to those it prosecutes . While it is always tempting to yield to an argument based on the protection of civil liberties , I have come to the conclusion that the interests of the whole community are better served by not imposing a duty of care on the ORG . In my view , such a duty of care would tend to have an inhibiting effect on the discharge by the ORG of its central function of prosecuting crime . It would in some cases lead to a defensive approach by prosecutors of their multifarious duties . It would introduce a risk that prosecutors would act so as to protect themselves from claims of negligence . The ORG would have to spend valuable time and use scarce resources in order to prevent law suits in negligence against the ORG . It would generate a great deal of paper to guard against the risks of law suits . The time and energy of ORG lawyers would be diverted from concentrating on their prime function of prosecuting offenders . That would be likely to happen not only during the prosecution process but also when the ORG is sued in negligence by aggrieved defendants . The ORG would be constantly enmeshed in an avalanche of interlocutory civil proceedings and civil trials . That is a spectre that would bode ill for the efficiency of the ORG and the quality of our criminal justice system . \u2026", "Recognising that individualised justice to private individuals or trading companies who are aggrieved by careless decisions of ORG lawyers militates in favour of the recognition of a duty of care , I concluded that there are compelling considerations , rooted in the welfare of the whole community , which outweigh the dictates of individualised justice . I would rule that there is no duty of care owed by the ORG to those it prosecutes . In so ruling I have considered whether a distinction between operational and discretionary lapses , with potential liability in the former but not the latter , should be made . Whatever the merit of such a distinction in other areas of the law , I would reject it in regard to the ORG as impractical and unworkable and not capable of avoiding the adverse consequences for the ORG on which I have rested my decision . Subject to CARDINAL qualification , my conclusion that there is no duty of care owed by the ORG to those it prosecutes is intended to be of general application . The qualification is that there may be cases of which NORP v. the Chief Constable for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All E.R. CARDINAL was an example , where the ORG assumes by conduct a responsibility to a particular defendant \u2026 And it is trite law that such an assumption of responsibility may generate legal duties . \u2026 \u201d", "At the relevant time , LAW rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG provided that a claim could be struck out if it disclosed no reasonable cause of action . This jurisdiction has been described as being reserved for \u201c plain and obvious cases \u201d , in which a claim was \u201c obviously unsustainable \u201d .", "In applications to strike out , the courts proceeded on the basis that all the allegations set out in the claimant \u2019s pleadings were true . The question for the courts was whether , assuming that the claimant could substantiate all factual allegations at trial , the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action .", "The striking out procedure , now contained in the Part CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG in force since DATE , is regarded as an important feature of LANGUAGE civil procedure , performing the function of securing speedy and effective justice , inter alia by allowing it to be decided promptly which issues need full investigation and trial and disposing summarily of the others . By means of this procedure , it can be determined at an early stage , with minimal cost to the parties , whether the facts as pleaded reveal a claim existing in law .", "The ORG is a statutory public law enforcement agency set up by LAW DATE to prosecute criminal offences . It is an autonomous and independent body which reviews police decisions to prosecute and conducts prosecutions on behalf of the ORG . The ORG is headed by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and is answerable to ORG through the Attorney General .", "The conduct of ORG Prosecutors is regulated by the Code for ORG , issued under LAW . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that review of the police decision to prosecute is a continuing process , so that ORG prosecutors are required to take into account any change in circumstances .", "Before bringing a prosecution , a ORG prosecutor had , at the relevant time , to be satisfied that it fulfilled CARDINAL sets of criteria set out in the code , firstly concerning evidential sufficiency and , secondly , concerning the public interest . The first required that that a Crown Prosecutor be satisfied that there was enough evidence to provide a \u201c realistic prospect of conviction \u201d . This involved an assessment whether a jury or bench of magistrates , properly directed in accordance with law , would be more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged . ORG was required to draw on his experience of how the evidence was likely to \u201c stand up \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Under the public interest criteria , ORG had , inter alia , to consider the very serious harm the stigma of a conviction could cause very young adults and take into account any change in the complainant / victim \u2019s attitude , e.g. the expression of a wish , after the initial complaint , that no action should be taken ( paragraphs CARDINAL(iii ) , QUANTITY ) and CARDINALff ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
