On DATE , in the context of an appeal for judicial review , the relevant Minister filed a memorial concluding that the birth certificates of PERSON and PERSON were fraudulent . With regard to the alleged violations of ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention , he responded that it had already been shown that the applicant had abandoned his wife and putative children , that the parent - child relationship had not been established and that the applicant had not shown that he had maintained ties with them . The applicant responded by arguing that an anomaly in the referencing of the birth certificates was not sufficient to establish the doubtful authenticity or fraudulent nature of the documents submitted by his wife . He noted firstly , with regard to PERSON \u2019s birth certificate , \u201c that it was not certain that the certificate sought by the authorities was related to the document in question , given that the first component of its reference number seemed to be made up of CARDINAL figures , rather than QUANTITY ( \u201c ? CARDINAL \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which would be more coherent , given the date it had been drawn up , in DATE \u201d . He argued that the Minister did not explain how ORG had issued LAW ( dated DATE , referring to his wife and his CARDINAL children ) and official travel documents permitting his family to travel internationally . He pointed out that he had submitted to the court correspondence from ORG , dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE , drawn up in the context of the checks conducted with a view to issuing those travel documents ( travel document for the child PERSON , issued on CARDINAL DATE following the favourable opinion of CARDINAL DATE ) . He added that the authenticity of the other documents submitted to the court had not been called into question , namely the declaration of PERSON \u2019s birth , issued by ORG in GPE , and the declaration of PERSON \u2019s birth , issued by ORG , nor that of the travel documents for his first CARDINAL children , drawn up on DATE . Lastly , he indicated that other evidence submitted to the court , photographs and bank transfer statements , invalidated ORG arguments as to the reality of his ties with his wife and children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG drew up a \u201c certifiate of parenthood \u201d , stating that the applicant and his wife were the legitimate parents of the children known as PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer informed him that a hearing had taken place before the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat on DATE ; the public rapporteur had proposed that his appeal be dismissed and had suggested that judicial rectification of the civil - status documents of the children concerned be carried out in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , served on CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat rejected the appeal . It pointed out that the transcripts of the certificates , obtained by the NORP authorities in the NORP civil - status offices for the purpose of verifying the civil - status documents of the CARDINAL children born in that country , had shown that CARDINAL totally different birth certificates had been issued under the same reference numbers , and concerned third parties . It considered that even if the fraudulent nature of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL certificates had not been demonstrated , this did not create any doubt as to evidence of the inauthenticity of the second certificate , and concluded that \u201c in those circumstances , neither the submission of declarations of birth from ORG and ORG , not the allegation that this discrepancy originated in dysfunctions within the NORP civil - status authorities , allow for the fraudulent nature of CARDINAL of the documents thus produced to be set aside \u201d . Lastly , it specified that the fraudulent nature of CARDINAL of the submitted documents was such as to entail refusal of all of the requested visas .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychologist from the ORG inter - mouvements aupr\u00e8s des \u00e9vacu\u00e9s ( ORG ) certified that the applicant \u2019s psychological health had deteriorated , and described a worsening state of depression . She submitted that \u201c in addition to the traumatic events experienced in his country , [ the applicant ] is currently developing reactional depression as a result of the separation from his family , which has lasted for DATE ... Although he was simultaneously actively engaged in preparing a professional insertion plan , the applicant is finding it increasingly difficult to take the necessary steps and is sliding into a form of apathy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer confirmed that the appeal had been dismissed and informed him that the public rapporteur \u2019s closing arguments were not available in writing .", "CARDINAL . Following that decision , the applicant contacted ORG and the Director of the OFPRA . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the former replied that , according to the information communicated by the NORP delegation , ORG in GPE was willing to issue a visa to his wife and to CARDINAL of his children , PERSON and PERSON . With regard to the birth certificate for his daughter PERSON , he was advised to submit a request to the GPE tribunal de grande instance for a supplementary judgment relating to a birth certificate . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Director of the OFPRA wrote to the ORG , which had also received the applicant \u2019s file ; he was considering transferring his refugee status to another country . In that letter , the Director pointed out that his department , by a memorandum of DATE , had certified his family situation to the sub - directorate for visas in GPE , the only administrative body with competence for the family reunification of foreigners .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife brought proceedings before ORG , seeking to obtain a supplementary judgment concerning PERSON \u2019s civil status . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that court declared that it did not have jurisdiction . On DATE she brought proceedings before the GPE tribunal de grande instance for the same purpose .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , following a further request by the applicant \u2019s family , the consular authorities refused to issue long - stay visas .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , new checks carried out in DATE established that it had been possible to authenticate PERSON \u2019s birth certificate but the doubtful authenticity of the birth certificate produced for PERSON , which had been double - checked , had prompted the consular authorities to maintain their refusal to issue visas to the whole family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings before ORG against the decision of DATE . His request was implicitly refused .", "B. Facts which occurred after communication of the application", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the urgent - applications judge at ORG seeking an order for a stay of execution of ORG implicit decision to refuse his request . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , the urgent - applications judge ordered a stay of execution of that decision on the ground that the reasons for the rejection had not been communicated . He added :", "\u201c ... further , as the evidence stands , although there is uncertainty as to the parent - child relationship in respect of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL children , PERSON , [ the applicant ] refers , without however submitting it , to a supplementary judgment which purportedly substantiates his allegations ; having regard to the length of time that the applicant has been separated from his family , the criterion of urgency is met ; ... it is appropriate to direct the Minister to re - examine the visa application within DATE of notification of the present order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE ORG lawyer forwarded to him , and to the NORP authorities , the original copy of a judgment delivered by the NORP tribunal de grande instance on DATE , reconstituting the birth certificate for the child PERSON . That judgment indicates that , on DATE following PERSON \u2019s birth , a declaration of birth had been duly drawn up by the doctor at ORG and handed to her mother , for the purpose of having the child \u2019s birth certificate issued by the LOC district office . However , as the applicant \u2019s wife had been unaware of the rules in force in GPE for this administrative procedure , she had entrusted this declaration of birth to a third party , who had demanded and obtained from her the sum of MONEY ( CFA ) in order to obtain the birth certificate ; this third party had given her a document presented as birth certificate no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , allegedly drawn up and signed by the mayor of PERSON . The tribunal de grande instance specified that since this document was a forgery PERSON \u2019s birth certificate had never been issued , and it ordered that this step be taken .", "CARDINAL .
