NORP The applicant , ATV NORP , is a broadcasting company established under NORP PERSON with its seat in GPE . It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company aired a broadcast as part of a society programme that showed the then Federal Minister for Health , Families and Youth , PERSON , and her partner , GPE , entering a restaurant in GPE . The report concerned mainly the Minister \u2019s presence at a charity DATE an exhibition of contemporary art in a gourmet restaurant and the sale of towels for the benefit of female sport cycling . The commentary referred to the Minister \u2019s own forthcoming cookery book on roast pork and the chef \u2019s creations for the TIME .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report started with the Minister arriving , with her new partner at her side . The introductory commentary stated that they were currently GPE \u2019s most observed couple , but rarely appeared in public together . However , TIME the divorced Minister and her new partner , GPE , a senior manager with NORP railways , came to H. restaurant in GPE together to \u201c do good and eat well \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP Overlaying images of the couple entering the restaurant and PERSON greeting people , the voice - over continued , stating that PERSON looked fabulous and showed no trace of the difficulties she had successfully left behind her in DATE . On the other hand GPE , the new man at her side , was not entirely prepared for the media \u2019s interest : DATE was in DATE , division manager with a company of the NORP railways and in the middle of divorce proceedings . Because of the pending court proceedings , GPE did not want to pose officially next to his new love .", "CARDINAL . The images showed DATE entering beside PERSON , later stepping aside and stroking a puppy . PERSON also cuddled the puppy and expressed her love for animals in the direction of the camera .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged an action under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) claiming that the commentary stating that \u201c GPE was the new man at PERSON \u2019s side \u201d , that \u201c he was in the middle of divorce proceedings \u201d and that \u201c because of the pending proceedings he did not want to pose at his new love \u2019s side \u201d had violated his most intimate personal sphere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ruled that the statement that GPE was \u201c in the middle of divorce proceedings \u201d , and that these proceedings were pending , infringed his most intimate personal sphere . The court ordered the applicant company to pay compensation in the amount of CARDINAL ( ORG ) , to publish the operative part of the judgment and to bear the costs of the proceedings . However , it dismissed DATE \u2019s claim that the statement that he was \u201c the new man at PERSON \u2019s side \u201d and refused to pose with \u201c his new love \u201d compromised his privacy .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the media had already reported on PERSON \u2019s new relationship in DATE . The print media had also reported that DATE was still married at the time and that divorce proceedings were pending . DATE had , however , lodged proceedings under LAW against those publications in CARDINAL cases with ORG alone . GPE never gave interviews on his personal situation and did not pose for press photographs with PERSON had been seen in public with PERSON when they went out to dinner on several occasions , or attended several smaller parties and QUANTITY weddings .", "CARDINAL . The court found the statement on the pending divorce proceedings to be compromising , since the end of a relationship was often considered a personal failure and resulted in adverse reactions from the public , ranging from pity to malice . Divorce proceedings were not public . Pending divorce proceedings had thus no public consequence ; only the divorce itself publicly testified to the end of a marriage . While other media had reported on DATE \u2019s failed marriage before the airing of the broadcast , that had happened without his consent . Furthermore , he had objected to those reports by initiating court proceedings against them . Therefore , the applicant company could not argue that the facts broadcast had already been spread by other media .", "CARDINAL . As concerns the reference to the relationship between GPE and PERSON , the court found that , from their appearing together at the charity dinner , the media could assume that GPE would consent to the reporting . That assumed consent did not include the statements on his pending divorce . The mere fact that PERSON was the Minister for ORG and Youth did not suffice to bring the private person GPE into the public arena .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant company and DATE appealed against this judgment . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Wien ) partly followed DATE \u2019s appeal and declared in addition that GPE had also been hurt in his most intimate personal sphere by the statement that he was \u201c the new man at PERSON \u2019s side , but did not want to pose with his new love \u201d . The applicant company was ordered to pay compensation in the amount of EUR CARDINAL and to publish the operative part of the judgment . It was also ordered to bear the costs of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to case - law according to which the \u201c intimate personal sphere \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , not only encompassed events and situations confined to home , but also a \u201c private area within a public space \u201d ( \u201c GPE ) meaning that private events in a public space were nevertheless not open for just anyone . When the applicant company thus complained that PERSON and GPE had appeared in public before the charity dinner , the court referred to this concept of \u201c private area within a public space \u201d . The mere fact that the relationship between GPE and PERSON had been witnessed in public before was not decisive for determining whether a specific media report was capable of compromising GPE , or not . The allegation of an extramarital affair must be considered to affect adversely the intimate sphere within the meaning of LAW , as must the statement on pending divorce proceedings , and in this context the information on a \u201c new partner \u201d and a \u201c new love \u201d . ORG reiterated that the phrase \u201c pending divorce proceedings \u201d clearly has a different meaning from \u201c finality of divorce \u201d , since a couple could still decide to discontinue divorce proceedings . However , according to the jurisprudence of the civil courts , the intention to divorce was part of a person \u2019s intimate sphere . In response to the applicant company \u2019s argument that GPE himself had demonstrated the end of his marriage in public by appearing with PERSON , ORG found that such appearances were not comparable to those of public figures within the context of their political work or state functions , but needed to be seen as belonging to that already - mentioned \u201c private area within a public space \u201d . Those appearances had not had any official character and did not allow the conclusion that GPE had opened up his private life to the public arena . They could also not be interpreted as consent to exclusive media reporting \u2013 not only on the couple attending a charity dinner , but also on their conducting an extramarital affair , being partners and in love , while divorce proceedings in respect of DATE were still pending .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the applicant company \u2019s argument that reporting on DATE as being the Minister \u2019s new partner was inseparable from reporting on the Minister herself . It observed that the media were entitled to report on ORG conduct , considering that she was appointed by ORG which represented a conservative image on families , that her credibility was at stake and that this was a matter of public interest . However , this did not mean that the media also had the right to violate her partner \u2019s private sphere . Indeed , GPE himself was not a public figure . It would have been sufficient , to satisfy the public interest in the Minister \u2019s conduct , to report that she maintained an apparently sexual relationship with a married man . However , it had not been necessary to reveal the identity of that married man . The report in question exceeded the necessary information and also included details on DATE \u2019s marriage .", "CARDINAL . ORG altered the decision of ORG concerning the statement that GPE was the \u201c new man at PERSON \u2019s side and refused to pose with his new love \u201d because this statement had to be seen in the context of the whole broadcast and not separately . Therefore , it was also an infringement of his most intimate personal sphere . That judgment was served on the applicant company \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company did not file a request under LAW of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) to ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . By an amendment of DATE which entered into force on DATE under the heading \u201c Renewal of criminal proceedings \u201d ( PERSON ) , LAW ( GPE ) was introduced , which provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If it is established in a judgment of ORG that there has been a violation of ORG [ ORG ] no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) or of one of its Protocols on account of a decision [ GPE ] or order [ GPE ] of a criminal court , a retrial shall be held on application in so far as it can not be ruled out that the violation might have affected the decision in a manner detrimental to the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . All applications for a retrial shall be decided by ORG . Those who are affected by the determined violation as well as ORG are entitled to file an application . LAW shall be applicable analogously . The application is to be filed at ORG . If ORG files an application , those who are affected , if the CARDINAL affected files an application ORG , shall be heard . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Proceedings shall be applicable analogously . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on an application under Article CARDINALa by a convicted person in a case in which no application to the ORG had been filed previously and no judgment of the ORG had been delivered ( file no . CARDINAL Os QUANTITY ) :", "\u201c ... In the present case there are no indications that a decision or order of a criminal court which had an adverse effect on the applicant had been found to be in violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention by ORG in respect of the applicant . However , this does not render the application inadmissible .", "LAW required each ORG to provide any person , who shows with some plausibility that there has been a violation of his or her rights under LAW and its Protocols , with an effective remedy , in other words , to ensure that there is a national instance examining whether there has been a violation of a LAW right . Article LAW must not be interpreted as permitting a retrial only in cases where a violation of Convention rights has already been established in a judgment against GPE by ORG .", "ORG , as the highest instance in GPE in criminal matters established by LAW , sees itself called upon to fulfil the obligations under the LAW by ensuring that in the field of criminal law the spirit of the LAW is respected also in cases in which no judgment was issued against GPE by the ORG .", "ORG has previously detected lacunae in the law ( planwidrige L\u00fccke ) as regards the protection of human rights and has used its powers to close them .", "...", "A judgment by the ORG which establishes a violation of the rights under the ORG is a necessary and sufficient precondition for a renewal of the criminal proceedings under LAW . But also the legal practice and case - law of ORG concerning criminal proceedings have changed significantly since the entry into force of this provision . There is therefore a lacuna in law that has to be closed . This must be done by interpreting the relevant law in a way , that a judgment by the ORG is no longer a precondition for the renewal of the criminal proceedings under LAW . In fact , this can be done by ORG itself deciding on a violation of the rights and freedoms under the LAW upon an application under LAW of LAW . Also ORG previous case - law does not conflict with this result .", "This extensive understanding of the provisions dealing with the renewal of criminal proceedings had been necessary not only because of the recent developments in human rights :", "ORG was not involved in any of the CARDINAL cases , in which the ORG found a violation of the right to freedom of expression under LAW , even though this could have been possible by means of a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) or an extraordinary reopening under LAW ( ausserordentliche PERSON ) . Therefore , in all these cases ORG had not been given the opportunity to fulfil its function as the highest instance in criminal matters as foreseen by LAW . Therefore , this court did not have the opportunity to examine the question of a possible violation of human rights . On the one side , there are proceedings before ORG ) in which an allegation of a violation of the rights and freedoms under the LAW can be raised . On the other side , as it is in this case of relevance , ORG \u2013 as the highest instance in criminal matters \u2013 has the duty to observe the compliance not only with the fundamental rights guaranteed at the level of ordinary law but also with rights guaranteed at the level of constitutional law ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , LAW ) of LAW ) . ORG has the power to deal in an effective way with alleged violations of human rights committed by the lower courts in proceedings on a plea of nullity , a request for the renewal of proceedings , a fundamental rights complaint ( Grundrechtsbeschwerde ) and proceedings under LAW ( Fristsetzungsantrag ) of LAW ( PERSON ) . These remedies give ORG the possibilities set out by LAW not only to follow the ORG \u2019s caselaw but also to take , itself , the initiative for influencing the development of human rights law on its own .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment , ORG further stated that it would apply the criteria set out in LAW on the admissibility of an application also in respect of a request for renewal of criminal proceedings under LAW , in particular the DATE time - limit , also in a case which had not been previously examined by the ORG and in which no judgment of the ORG had been issued .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since then , ORG has decided in several cases on requests lodged under LAW as from DATE ( for example the decision of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALb ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALh ; of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALp ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALy ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINAL m ) . In all of these cases ORG confirmed its leading decision of CARDINAL DATE and developed further its case - law in regard to the admissibility of the applications under LAW of LAW . Among these were cases concerning LAW ( for example the decision of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALy ) . In cases where ORG found a violation of rights guaranteed under the LAW , it quashed the lower court \u2019s decisions and ordered that a fresh decision be taken ( for example the decision of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALh ; of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL g ; of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALi ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated in its case - law that victims of crimes and private prosecutors ( GPE ) , as well as public prosecutors , are not entitled to this remedy ( see , inter alia , ORG decisions of DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINALf and of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINAL t ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
