On DATE ORG found PERSON and PERSON . guilty of inflicting bodily injuries on the applicant \u2019s husband , causing his death .

It also found that the applicant \u2019s husband had been suffering from chronic alcoholism and had been very aggressive towards the other cellmates . It found that the injuries had been inflicted by the persons who were held in the same cell with the applicant \u2019s husband , who had been defending themselves against his aggressive behaviour , which had been caused by his alcohol - related dependence ( delirium tremens ) . The court stated that the applicant \u2019s husband had sustained the following injuries on DATE : a cerebral haemorrhage , haemorrhage of both eyelids , left auricle and lips , a broken nose , an injury to the lower eyelid , abrasion of the lumbar region , a haemorrhage of the right kidney capsule and bruises to the lumbar region , all of which amounted to \u201c moderate bodily injuries \u201d for the purposes of assessing the impact on his health .

On DATE ORG made a separate ruling concerning shortcomings in the work of investigation . It noted that the allegations of the applicant as to signs of torture had not been fully checked at the pre - trial stage and therefore the court had had to order an additional forensic examination to verify the applicant \u2019s allegations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , although that examination could have been carried out at the pre - trial stage .", "CARDINAL .

According to the Government , the relevant notification had been sent to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following amendments to LAW , which entered into force on DATE and introduced CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction in lieu of CARDINAL , ORG ( now ORG ) examined the case as a second , appellate instance on DATE . PERSON , who had allegedly found out about the hearing by chance , was not allowed to present his arguments to ORG , since he was not legal counsel for the applicant or any other party , while the procedural figure of public accuser , in which capacity Mr PERSON had entered the proceedings in the first instance , had been completely abolished following the above - mentioned amendments to LAW . The court , in the absence of the parties , upheld the judgment of DATE with minor amendments .

After a judgment had been given by a first - instance court , the parties had DATE to lodge an appeal in cassation .", "CARDINAL . The Code defined the roles of \u201c public accuser \u201d and \u201c public defender \u201d , which were introduced in NORP times with the aim of achieving a more active participation of the public in criminal proceedings . Under LAW representatives of non - governmental organisations and groups of employees could participate in judicial proceedings ( not at the stage of investigation ) both on the side of the prosecution and on the side of the defence . The court could rule to allow a representative of an NGO to participate as a \u201c public accuser \u201d in the court hearings on behalf of his or her organisation . Under the said Article the public accuser was entitled to give testimonies , to examine evidence , make requests , express his or her opinion about the requests of other participants in the proceedings , to request withdrawals , to take part in the court deliberations , and give his or her opinion . The public accuser was not entitled to appeal against a judgment of a court in a criminal case in which he or she had participated . The role of public accuser was complementary to that of the prosecutor and the representative of the aggrieved party .", "CARDINAL . Following LAW of DATE ( which entered into force on DATE ) , criminal proceedings are examined at CARDINAL or CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction depending on the seriousness of the case . If the case was first decided in a local court , the decision is appealable to the regional court of appeal and then to ORG , as a court of cassation . The LAW also repealed the provisions concerning the roles of \u201c public accuser \u201d and \u201c public defender \u201d in their entirety ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
