On DATE the investigator appointed to deal with his case formally charged the applicant with aggravated embezzlement of public funds and forgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand for DATE on the grounds that the charges were serious and that the applicant might abscond and pervert the course of justice .

These cases were joined to the ORG case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , revoked the detention order of DATE . The court found that there was no evidence that the applicant would abscond or pervert the course of justice if released . In particular , the applicant had his permanent residence in GPE and financially supported his wife and a child living in GPE . He had never failed to respond to a summons or attempted to obstruct the investigation . Moreover , the court found that , when ordering the applicant \u2019s detention , the prosecution had not taken into account the fact that the applicant suffered from a number of serious illnesses .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE the applicant lived with his partner and their son in GPE whilst being registered in Dnipropetrovs\u2019k . He had CARDINAL registered addresses ( in GPE and GPE ) , CARDINAL international passports ( CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP : ordinary and official ) and had an account with an NORP bank , and was therefore likely to abscond if released . Moreover , ORG held that the first - instance court had overlooked the fact that the applicant in his appeal had requested the \u201c replacement of the preventive measure \u201d rather than the \u201c annulment of the detention order \u201d and , therefore , this appeal fell outside the scope of judicial review at the investigation stage .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the appeal was examined by ORG in the presence of the prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s lawyer . The court held that , although the domestic law allowed the detention of a defendant charged with aggravated embezzlement of public funds on the sole basis of the gravity of the charges , the other grounds provided for by the law should also be taken into account . ORG found , in particular , that there was no compelling evidence that if released the applicant would abscond or pervert the course of justice . The applicant had permanent residence in GPE and could not lawfully leave it since his international passport had expired . The applicant lived with his wife and CARDINAL children in GPE . He also financially supported his father and mother - in - law , who lived in GPE . Moreover , the applicant suffered from serious health problems . ORG considered the medical experts\u2019 report produced by the prosecution , to the effect that the applicant was fit for detention in the remand facilities , unreliable in the light of the fact that during his detention in the GPE the applicant had not been administered any of the drugs prescribed for him . On the basis of the above findings the ORG quashed the detention orders of DATE and DATE . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General lodged a request for supervisory review against this decision .", "CARDINAL .

The judge considered that the case was ready for trial and decided that the applicant was to remain in detention on remand .

At a hearing on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , stating that there were no new circumstances warranting a re - evaluation of the preventive measure imposed . The court also granted the prosecution \u2019s motion to adjourn the hearing until DATE to allow the new prosecutor to familiarise himself with the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Svyatoshynsky Court of its own motion decided that further pre - trial investigation was necessary .

On an unspecified date the prosecution appealed against the remittal of the case for further investigation , considering that it was ready for examination on the merits .

This decision was not appealed against by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s similar administrative complaint against the ORG was declared inadmissible on DATE by ORG on the ground that such complaints fell to be examined in the criminal proceedings which at that time were pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL .
