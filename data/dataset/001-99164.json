The applicants are NORP nationals and live in G\u00f6tene . The first applicant ( born in DATE ) is of NORP origin while the second applicant ( born in DATE ) originates from the GPE . She arrived in GPE in DATE and later obtained NORP nationality . In DATE the first and the second applicant married . Their CARDINAL children , PERSON ( born in DATE ) , PERSON ( born in DATE ) and C. ( born in DATE ) , have been raised bilingually , speaking NORP and NORP .", "CARDINAL . In DATE A. told personnel at her school that she , her mother and her siblings were being beaten at home by her father and that he looked at her in a strange way . She was afraid to go home with her father . The school contacted the social services but , after a meeting with the first and second applicants , the matter was dismissed as fabrications by A. However , the first and second applicants agreed to PERSON seeing the school psychologist . It would seem that her contact with the psychologist lasted only for a short time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant 's sister , PERSON , contacted ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) of ORG and informed them that PERSON had called her to ask for help to leave home . According to ORG had told her that her father used to beat her and her siblings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ran away from her mother while in town , with the intent of travelling to see I. However , the second applicant stopped her at the train station and a violent argument erupted between mother and daughter . The police were called and they were taken to the police station where the social services intervened . PERSON told the authorities that her father beat her and treated her in a degrading manner . She insisted that she wanted to go to stay with ORG After the social services had discussed the matter with the first and second applicants , they agreed to a voluntary placement of A. in a family home , as long as she was not going to stay with ORG since the first applicant had a very poor relationship with his sister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first and second applicants met with the social services and were informed that an investigation had been opened into the family 's situation and that it concerned all CARDINAL children . They stated that they were a normal family and that they had no idea why PERSON was behaving in such a way . The social services proposed that the second applicant live with her children away from their home during the investigation since the suspicions about ill - treatment were not directed against her . This offer was declined and the first and second applicants refused to consent to the younger children being placed in a family home .", "CARDINAL . After DATE at a family home , A. was transferred to PERSON , an evaluation home ( utredningshem ) , to receive professional help and have her situation examined . She told personnel at the home that the first applicant had sexually abused her since DATE and that he regularly beat her , treated her in an abusive manner and insulted her . This information was reported to the police and an investigation into the matter was opened . When questioned by the police , PERSON maintained her allegations . However , the first applicant denied all accusations against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , under section CARDINAL of the Act with Special Provisions on ORG ( ORG med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , CARDINAL - hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , immediately to take all CARDINAL children into public care on a provisional basis . It considered that , on the basis of the information given by PERSON , she and her younger siblings had to be protected from their father and receive professional care and support . A. had expressed a strong fear of her father and of her own reactions to possible demands from her parents . She had also alleged that her father physically abused her and her younger siblings and that he controlled and verified everything in the family , from telephone calls to the women 's menstrual cycles . The council further noted that the parents had refused to let the social services meet and talk to B. and C. A meeting between the parents and the authorities had also been rendered impossible as the parents had insisted that their lawyer be present and he had been too busy . In ORG view , it was absolutely necessary to talk to the parents as well as to the children to assess the family 's situation .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants stated that they had invited the social services to visit their home but that this invitation had been declined .", "CARDINAL . B. and C. were kept at school by the social services on DATE while their parents were informed about the immediate public care decision . The first applicant contacted his friend , who was also the family 's legal representative , for advice and the parents were then allowed to talk briefly to PERSON and C. on the telephone . The children were apparently very agitated . They were initially placed in a home for care and residence but , on DATE , they were moved to an evaluation home called GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants opposed the measure , as they claimed that the accusations were groundless and that PERSON and C. were fine and happy at home . As concerned A. , they agreed to her staying at the evaluation home in order to clarify her behaviour and for her to receive appropriate help . Moreover , they requested that the children undergo a medical examination to establish their state of health and to verify whether they had been abused .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal representative , assigned to defend the children 's best interest , supported the provisional care order and , on DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of Mariestad confirmed the decision of ORG . The first and second applicants did not appeal against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . Prior to ORG judgment , all CARDINAL children had undergone medical examinations focusing on their general health only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for a permanent care order in respect of the CARDINAL children , in accordance with section QUANTITY of LAW . ORG had carried out an investigation into the family 's situation , based on conversations with A. and people in her circle such as teachers and relatives and the first and second applicants had also been heard . From the investigation , the council made the assessment that ORG 's account of sexual and other abuse was very credible , noting that she had given specific examples of the abuse , and that she had been raised in an environment entirely controlled by her father . She was in a poor mental state and she did not want to have any contact with her parents . In light of the investigation 's result , the council maintained that the children had been ill - treated at home and that there was a clear risk of impairment to their health and development if they were not protected .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants opposed the measure , insisting that there was no need for the CARDINAL younger children to be in care and that , since they had agreed to voluntary care for A. , there was no need for compulsory measures .", "CARDINAL . The children 's legal representative agreed that it would be in the best interest of the children to be placed in public care on a permanent basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing during which it found that the investigation into the situation of the CARDINAL younger children was insufficient and further examination was needed . Hence , it adjourned the case in relation to them but proceeded with the case in regard to A. , since the evaluation home had carried out an in - depth social , psychological and psychiatric examination of her . According to this examination , she showed different personalities and had not developed a will of her own or a sense of \u201c self \u201d because of the insecure and unpredictable living conditions which she had endured for DATE . She had difficulties relating emotionally , socially and physically to other persons , had a very strong fear of being abandoned and was in constant need of another person to confirm her actions , decisions and thoughts . She also wavered between feeling that she had done the right thing to tell of the abuse and regretting it and just wanting to return home . She had difficulties trusting adults but there was nothing to indicate that she was making up stories . She was in need of all - embracing professional help in a secure environment for a long time .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants maintained that A. was fabricating stories and that no abuse had occurred in their home . However , they agreed that she was in need of help but contended that it could be provided on a voluntary basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a permanent care order for A. It found that she was in a very difficult situation and had serious problems which had been caused by bad conditions at home . Moreover , it considered that , in order to ensure that her treatment was not interrupted or jeopardised , it was necessary to take her into public care permanently as care on a voluntary basis could , at any time , be interrupted by her parents . The judgment was not appealed against and , consequently , gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE was transferred to another evaluation home , PERSON , which was to provide care and treatment for her as well as establishing co - operation with her parents on matters such as contact with relatives and others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case concerning B. and C. A social and psychological examination of the children had been carried out at the evaluation home and ORG had finalised its investigation . From these evaluations , it appeared that C. was very attached to her older brother and gave the impression of being very insecure and younger than her actual age . It was not possible to give a clear answer as to whether or not she had been exposed to a specific kind of abuse but , on the basis of her emotional development and her behaviour at the evaluation home , it was found that the parents had exposed her to some form of abuse or ill - treatment . With regard to PERSON , the evaluation showed that he was ambitious and responsible but that he was under a lot of pressure as he identified with his parents and was unwilling to talk about his situation . Moreover , on several occasions , he had hidden in a closet when someone was angry with him because he had been afraid to be yelled at or beaten by the personnel . Both children had mentioned that they had been beaten by their father and that they had seen him beat PERSON and they gave specific examples of such incidents . Although the abuse committed against the children had not caused physical damage , it was found that it could potentially have caused permanent psychological damage and even more so since their mother had not intervened to protect them . However , apparently , both children had promised their parents not to talk about their home situation and were keen to keep this promise , which had prolonged their evaluation . It was concluded that both children were in need of long - term qualified care outside their home to deal with their negative experiences and be protected from their father .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants disputed the findings and questioned whether the evaluation had been carried out in an objective manner . In any event , they claimed that the psychological assessments had been inadequate and they insisted that they had never ill - treated their children and that any indications to that effect from the children were fabrications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted permanent care orders for B. and C. It had regard to the fact that it had found the conditions in the home to have caused PERSON 's serious health - related disturbances and noted that this , naturally , also had a bearing on the assessment in relation to the younger children . It further found no reason to question the methodology used by the specialists at the evaluation home and considered that their conclusions showed that the conditions in the applicants ' home had not been good and that B. 's and C. 's health and development had been hampered and risked being even further impaired if they did not get adequate and appropriate help and support . In this respect , the court observed that the children had shown unusual behaviour for their age , sometimes sexualised , and had made astonishing remarks about violence . They had also , in various ways , expressed that they were not allowed by their parents to talk about their home situation .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , requesting that the care order be repealed and that PERSON and C. be returned home immediately , since there were no reasons to keep them in public care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor decided to discontinue the preliminary investigation relating to A. 's accusations of sexual abuse by her father . This decision was in part due to the fact that she had retracted substantial parts of her accusations .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeal and submitted , inter alia , that PERSON 's withdrawal of her accusations against her father did not necessarily mean that they were untrue . According to the council , it was very common for children who had told about poor home conditions later to alter or retract their statements when they realised what consequences these statements might entail for their family . In any event , the younger children had not withdrawn what they had said during police interviews and their behaviour and statements supported that various forms of abuse had occurred in their home . The children needed to be placed in family homes , receive psychiatric help and to re - establish contact with their parents .", "CARDINAL . The children 's legal representative also contested the appeal , noting that since contact had been re - established between the parents and B. and C. , the children had changed in a negative way . PERSON 's need to control had returned , he gave daily reports to his parents and he took on adult responsibilities . Still , it was important that the contact had been restored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case where witnesses for both parties were heard and a video recording of a police interview with A. held on DATE was shown to the court at the request of the first and second applicants . Written evidence was also invoked , including copies of police interviews held with PERSON and C.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment in full . It first noted that the DATE Act was protective legislation , intended to prevent children from being seriously harmed either through their own lifestyle or through detrimental circumstances in their home environment . In the latter case , a balance had to be struck between the parents ' right to raise their children and the child 's right to be protected from harm . The court then observed that , in the present case , the parents and the social services had given completely contradictory information about the children and their situation . However , it noted that all CARDINAL children had , at some point , told both police officers and personnel at the evaluation homes that their father had exposed them to physical , psychological and verbal violence . In the court 's view , there was no reasonable explanation why all QUANTITY children would tell lies about their parents . Moreover , professionals at the evaluation homes had observed and assessed the children 's behaviour and had found them to be afraid of being beaten or otherwise badly treated . Thus , the court concluded that , even though A. had retracted substantial parts of her accusations , the material in the case still supported the view that PERSON and C. had been the victims of such ill - treatment in their home that there was a substantial risk to their health and development unless they got proper care outside their home .", "CARDINAL . The parents appealed against the judgment to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) but later withdrew their appeal . Consequently , on DATE , the court struck the case out of its list of cases and ORG judgment gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG , in accordance with LAW , re - examined the need for public care of the CARDINAL children and found that it should be continued . In relation to A. , it was found that she had a very deep split in her personality which could often be seen in children who had been in a position of strong negative dependence on a parent . Her behaviour reflected a traumatic up - bringing . Moreover , she had been in need of very close contact with aunt PERSON who , in turn , had set down limits to their contact . A. had reacted strongly to this and had felt let down . In DATE she had called her father once but had reacted very strongly to their conversation . After this she did not want to say more about the abuse and she no longer knew if she wanted to maintain what she had previously said , although she did not deny that it was true . Turning to B. , it was observed that he had been involved in adult conflicts and family secrets by his parents which was a heavy burden for him and that he was afraid of his father 's and others ' anger . He had developed positively at GPE and needed continued care and protection from his father . C. had lived in a strictly controlled environment with secrets and both physical and mental abuse and , although she had improved at the evaluation home , she was in need of continuous care and protection . Moreover , although the parents had been encouraged to suggest relatives from the mother 's side with whom the children could have contact , they had not done so .", "CARDINAL . Following the discontinuation of the preliminary investigation on DATE , the first and second applicants requested ORG to reconsider its decision and end the public care of all CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , ORG maintained the permanent care order of the children as it considered that they needed care and treatment outside their home . It observed that PERSON had called her father and her parents ' previous legal representative , who was also a long standing personal friend of her parents , on several occasions during DATE leading up to the police interview on DATE , when she retracted substantial parts of her accusations against her father . During the conversations with her father , she had cried and been very upset but once the police interview was over she had become much calmer , almost cheerful .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and his and the second applicant 's legal counsel were present at both of ORG meetings . However , they did not appeal against any of the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again re - examined the need for public care of the CARDINAL children to continue and found that it was necessary as they were in great need of professional help and support from secure adults . It also decided to move PERSON to another evaluation home upon her own request and to move PERSON and C. to a family home . It was observed that the first and second applicants had refused to meet staff at ORG to be informed about the care provided to A. and how she was doing . They had also refused to meet PERSON at a \u201c neutral \u201d place in GPE , apparently because they wanted the legal proceedings to end first . However , the first applicant had spoken very frequently with her on the telephone and PERSON had become very involved in the proceedings concerning both her and her younger siblings which hindered the progress of her treatment and care . She had also stated that her father had never abused her and that she did not need any care .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants appealed against this decision to ORG and requested that the care orders be terminated in respect of all CARDINAL children . In any event , they demanded that all access restrictions between them and their children be lifted and that they be told where their children were being kept ( see below under \u201c Access restrictions \u201d ) . They maintained that the children had always been well treated at home . Moreover , they claimed that the younger children had been ill - treated at the evaluation home and had suffered from being there . In this respect , they considered it discriminatory that B. and C. had not been allowed to speak NORP with their mother on the telephone and that relatives from their mother 's side had not been allowed any contact with them . They invoked witness statements supporting their claims and an assessment made by a specialist in this field , PERSON , which strongly criticised the social services ' handling of the case . In particular , he considered that the social services ' investigation lacked basic objectivity , was influenced by the investigators ' own views and beliefs that abuse had taken place in the applicants ' home and that there was a complete absence of willingness or efforts to consider or find alternative explanations to the children 's behaviour .", "CARDINAL . A new legal representative had been nominated for the children and he supported the parents ' appeal . He stated that during the conversations that he had had with B. and C. there was no doubt that they wished to return home to their parents . He was very critical of the first police interview with A. and noted that no one in the family 's home town had ever seen the children being hurt .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the applicants ' claims and submitted that all persons involved in assessing the children had found that they had psychological problems and had showed deficient behaviour at the evaluation homes . Moreover , the investigation into the children 's situation had started with information from the children themselves and should therefore be taken seriously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case , where several witness were heard , including Dr B. Edvardsson . A. was given the opportunity to express her views on the matter , before the court but in a separate room . She stated that she had been under the influence of her aunt , PERSON , and that it was PERSON who had incited her falsely to accuse her father .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG repealed ORG decision and ordered that the public care of all CARDINAL children be terminated . The judgment was enforceable immediately even if it was appealed against . The court found that , since the children no longer maintained their earlier statements concerning violence and bad conditions at home , higher demands had to be required of the investigations and evaluations of the children than earlier . It then considered that part of the criticism expressed by PERSON against the social services ' investigations and assessments of the children was justified and raised doubts as to their conclusions . Moreover , it noted that , although the social services had attached much weight to the information provided by ORG , she had not been heard before the courts . On the contrary , the witnesses who had been heard had all stated that they found the family to be normal and to have good home conditions . Thus , having regard to all circumstances , the court concluded that there was no longer sufficient support to believe that the deficient home conditions which had formed the basis of the care orders had ever existed . Therefore it was not justified to keep the children in public care .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , the first and second applicants , together with their legal representative , fetched PERSON and C. from their family home and then the second applicant travelled with them to relatives in another country .", "CARDINAL . However , already on DATE , ORG had appealed against ORG judgment and requested that it be suspended until ORG had considered the case . The request was granted by the court on DATE and PERSON was therefore not allowed to leave the evaluation home .", "CARDINAL . ORG alleged before ORG that the children were in continued need of care and professional treatment . This was particularly so since the parents had refused to co - operate with the social services throughout the process and did not ensure the best interests of their children .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants disputed the claims and referred to the lower court 's judgment , which they considered to reflect correctly the situation . They further maintained that the social services ' accusations against them were untrue and that their home had been open . However , the authorities had not listened to them and had confronted them with ready - made decisions . Moreover , they stated that the only reason why they had not seen A. since the hearing before ORG was that the social services had not permitted it .", "CARDINAL . The children 's legal representative supported the parents ' stance and considered that there existed no grounds whatsoever on which to continue the public care of the children . He further requested that A. be heard by the court .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG rejected the representative 's request on the ground that A. had already been heard before the lower court , that it had the recording of this hearing and that no new circumstances had been invoked which justified hearing the child anew .", "CARDINAL . After having held an oral hearing where , among others , ORG testified , ORG , on DATE , decided to repeal the lower court 's judgment and uphold ORG decision to continue the public care of the CARDINAL children . The court found that the children were in need of continued , professional care outside their home ; A. in order to work through the traumas that she had experienced in her home environment and PERSON and C. in order to learn to control their aggression and deal with their negative experiences . It further considered that all CARDINAL children were in need of protection from the negative influence of their parents who had their own , and not their children 's , best interest at heart . This was manifested in their lack of co - operation with the social services to facilitate the children 's return home and the very limited amount of time which they had spent with their children since they had been in public care . In this respect , it was noted that the parents had not taken the opportunity to visit A. when they had been offered to do so after she had been taken into public care . Thus , the court concluded that the children 's care orders should be maintained .", "CARDINAL . The parents appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reviewed the public care of the children in accordance with LAW and decided that it should continue . It noted that it had little information on the younger children 's whereabouts following DATE but the fact that they were kept in hiding by their parents could mean an additional risk to their health and development . As concerned PERSON , it was observed that she had become very involved in the proceedings and that her parents allowed and encouraged her to participate instead of relieving her of that burden . The council was firm in its view that PERSON was in need of long - term professional treatment and care outside her home .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants appealed against the decision , stating that ORG decision lacked reasoning , and maintaining that there had never existed any grounds on which to take the children into public care . They submitted a report , dated DATE , by a psychologist , PERSON , who had met with the whole family during DATE and had gone through all the material relevant to the case . In the report , it was noted that the children felt that they had not been listened to by the authorities or the personnel at the evaluation homes but that , instead , they had been pressured by them . Dr PERSON found no proof that the children had been traumatised in their home . On the contrary , she considered that the trauma for B. and C. had taken place when they had suddenly been separated from their parents without understanding why and then , for DATE , had not been allowed to talk to their parents . Moreover , they had not benefited from normal schooling and they had not been well cared for at the evaluation homes . In conclusion , she observed that the children denied that any abuse had taken place at home or that there had otherwise been any problems . They had expressed a strong wish to return home , which ORG agreed would be best for them .", "CARDINAL . The children 's legal representative also appealed against ORG decision , claiming that there were no grounds on which to continue the public care . He stated that , on PERSON 's own initiative , she had been examined by a gynaecologist , which had shown that she had never been sexually abused . A certificate to this effect was submitted to the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeals and submitted that the assessments made at the evaluation homes had shown that the children were unwell . Thus , it was not so important to know if PERSON actually had been the victim of sexual abuse since , in any event , the council had not dwelt on the reason why the children were unwell , but had focused on providing them with qualified care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG reversed ORG decision and ordered the immediate termination of the care orders . It first observed that the criticism which it had noted already in its previous judgment concerning the investigations and evaluations of the children remained . It then had regard to the report made by ORG and observed that it corresponded to what PERSON had said during the oral hearing , notably that there had been a lack of interest from the personnel at the evaluation home and the social services once she had withdrawn substantial parts of her accusations against her father . The court considered that PERSON had given a mature and trustworthy impression and that there were no longer any concrete grounds for keeping her in public care . With regard to PERSON , the court took into account that they had now lived with their mother for DATE and , since it had found that the investigation no longer showed that the situation in the home was deficient , it was not in the children 's best interest to remain in public care . On DATE left the evaluation home .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not appeal against this judgment and so it gained legal force . The council considered that all CARDINAL children were still in need of care and protection but that since none of them were de facto in public care anymore , it was found to be in their best interest not to appeal against the court 's judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE that B. and C. were moved to GPE , ORG decided to prohibit all contact , including by telephone , between the parents and PERSON and C. They were allowed to write letters to each other and the parents were to be given continuous information concerning the children from the personnel at GPE . The council was of the opinion that the first and second applicants had a negative influence on the children and would try to hinder their speaking to or trusting the authorities . PERSON had expressed a worry about how to handle certain \u201c family secrets \u201d and what his father would approve of him telling . This decision was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to prolong the prohibition of all contact between the parents and the CARDINAL younger children until ORG had decided whether or not to grant the permanent care order . It considered that it was clear that , in relation to their parents , the children felt obliged to pretend to be on their father 's side against the authorities and they had been told not to trust anyone outside the family . Moreover , there was a real risk that the parents would interfere in the investigation and try to influence the children negatively if they were allowed direct contact . Thus , it was in the best interest of B. and C. not to see or talk to their parents . However , they were free to write letters to each other whenever they wanted . This decision was not appealed against either .", "CARDINAL . According to the report from GPE , of DATE , B. and C. had continuously received letters from their parents and had replied to them when they wanted to . The first applicant had called PERSON on a regular basis to hear how the children were doing but the second applicant had never called . Moreover , both children had spoken warmly about their relatives on their mother 's side but , since they lived in GPE , it was considered that they could not contribute in providing structure and stability in the children 's everyday life . PERSON and C. had had some telephone contact with their paternal grandfather but he had announced that he no longer wished to have contact with them . They had regular contact with aunt I.", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant requested that the children be given language lessons in NORP at the evaluation homes in order to keep up their mother tongue and also that they be allowed to visit the NORP church . It would appear that these requests were never formally treated by ORG but that , in practice , they were rejected as the children were allowed neither to speak their mother tongue nor to have contact with the NORP church .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again prolonged the prohibition of all contact between the parents and the CARDINAL younger children but , at the same time , decided that co - operation between the social services and the parents should be commenced concerning how contact between the parents and children could take place . It was noted that both children were developing well at GPE , that they had contact with some relatives and that the possibility of establishing contact with more of their relatives was being explored . The children were also encouraged to write letters to their parents but often chose not to , since they were afraid that their parents would be angry if they said how they were doing at the evaluation home . The first and second applicants were dissatisfied with the situation but could envisage refraining from contact with their children for as long as the police investigation was on - going in order to avoid potential accusations that they influenced the children .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE , the prohibition on the parents ' contact with B. and C. was ended by ORG as a direct consequence of the cancellation of the preliminary investigation on DATE . It was decided that contact should be initiated immediately between the parents and the CARDINAL children and the ORG staff were given the task of finding an agreement on how these contacts should be pursued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the parents were informed that they were allowed to telephone B. and C. It would appear that the second applicant and the children were told not to speak NORP with each other since the personnel supervising the conversations did not understand . Moreover , in DATE , it was decided that the children should have no further contact with aunt PERSON in order to avoid further pressure on them , since the first and the second applicants opposed the contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to move PERSON and C. from GPE to V\u00e5rsol , a home for care and residence . At the same time , it decided that the location of the children should be kept secret from the first and second applicants and that all contact with the children , including by telephone , should again be prohibited . However , contact in writing would be allowed , but only via the social services . The reasons for the decision were , essentially , that the first and second applicants had not followed the guidelines concerning contact with the children given by the social services and that the contacts had had a very negative effect on , in particular , PERSON , who had become very unstable , difficult to handle and controlling towards his little sister . C. had also reacted negatively and had been heard to tell her parents several times on the telephone that they should not beat her if she moved back home . To begin with , the parents had called every day and , after restrictions imposed by the evaluation home because of PERSON 's negative change in behaviour , they called CARDINAL times per week . At DATE the social services had proposed that the parents meet staff from GPE and the responsible social worker to be informed about the children 's development , schooling and health and to plan the meetings with the children . The goal was to ensure that the meetings would be positive for the children , who had expressed a strong wish to see their parents . The parents refused this preparatory meeting on the ground that the staff had already labelled the first applicant and therefore they did not wish to have any contact with staff or other adults in the children 's vicinity . They wanted a priest , who was close to the family , to visit the children , which was arranged . In DATE the first applicant , together with CARDINAL others , came unannounced to GPE , accusing the staff of mistreating the children . On DATE the children 's cousin , on their mother 's side , was to make a scheduled visit to the children but the first and second applicants arrived , unannounced , with him . Still , the staff decided to invite them all in to visit the children for TIME but wanted to talk to the parents alone first . PERSON wanted to join them , the staff refused , but the first applicant allegedly did not respect this and said that they had no secrets from PERSON The meeting then became agitated and it was decided that the parents and cousin should take the children out for a pizza and then return . Upon return , the situation became chaotic with the children screaming and refusing to re - enter the home . The cousin threatened a member of the staff and police were called . In these circumstances , it was considered that the children needed to be protected from the negative and destabilising influence of their parents to be able to get some peace and benefit from the care .
