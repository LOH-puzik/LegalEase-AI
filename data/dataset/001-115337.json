He was represented before the ORG by Mr T. Ekbrand , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant , who originates from GPE , moved to GPE in DATE and met his former wife , PERSON , during a visit to GPE . They married in DATE , and DATE PERSON moved to GPE . In DATE they had a daughter , Y. In DATE , X filed for divorce . ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) granted the divorce and gave the applicant and X joint custody of Y. It further decided that Y should live with X and granted the applicant contact rights DATE .", "In DATE , on the third contact occasion , the applicant took Y to GPE and arranged a travel ban for X , making it impossible for her to leave GPE if she were to travel there . X contacted the NORP police . In NORP custody proceedings launched by ORG relatives , the NORP authorities took a temporary decision that PERSON \u2019s mother should care for Y but that Y had to remain in the country . However , despite the authorities\u2019 decision , PERSON \u2019s brother took Y to GPE where she was reunited with X in DATE .", "The applicant remained in GPE until DATE when he voluntarily returned to GPE . He was arrested upon return and , on DATE , ORG convicted him of gross unlawful separation of a child from his / her legal guardian ( grov egenm\u00e4ktighet med barn ) and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "When the applicant was released on parole , ORG , on DATE , issued restraining orders against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis X and Y for DATE under LAW ( lagen om bes\u00f6ksf\u00f6rbud , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , after having held an oral hearing , decided not to deviate from the assessment of the public prosecutor .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) for LOC which , on DATE , rejected the appeal . The applicant did not appeal against this decision to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) .", "On DATE , ORG decided to extend the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y for DATE .", "The applicant again appealed to ORG which , on DATE , decided not to deviate from the assessment of the public prosecutor .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further appeal , and , on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal since the original decision had already become time - barred .", "It appears that at DATE the applicant initiated civil proceedings in which he requested contact rights with Y every second DATE TIME in the presence of an assistant from ORG ( GPE ) .", "On DATE , ORG held a preparatory hearing in the presence of the applicant , X and their legal counsel . In order to make a better assessment , the court requested ORG to submit relevant information concerning the parties before proceeding with the case .", "On DATE , ORG presented the following information based on individual meetings with the applicant , X and Y.", "The applicant considered that he had been punished twice for his criminal conduct since , even after fully serving his sentence , he was being denied any contact with Y.", "As to X , she described how Y had been abducted at a time when she was still being breastfed . The applicant \u2019s mother had by then already travelled to GPE , which showed that the criminal act had been planned . When Y had returned to GPE , she had forgotten NORP and had been frightened of airports and suitcases . X had had to seek psychological help . During his stay in GPE , the applicant had initiated legal proceedings there to the effect that she and her mother were sentenced to , respectively , DATE and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant had never sent any letters or gifts to Y.", "As concerned Y , she questioned why the applicant had not kept in contact with her during DATE he had remained in GPE . She now felt it was too late . She considered that it was the applicant \u2019s fault that she and X could never visit their relatives in GPE . She was sure that X would assist her if , in the future , she wished to establish contact with the applicant . For the moment she did not wish to have any contact with him , not even letters .", "On DATE , in an interim decision , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for contact rights while the proceedings were ongoing . It noted that the court had decided on a restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y and that Y had clearly expressed her wish not to have any contact with the applicant . Considering Y \u2019s age , there were no reasons to assume that this did not correspond to her own true will .", "On DATE , ORG again decided to extend the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y for DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , requesting primarily that the decision be reversed , secondly that it be to some extent limited to enable him to visit Y every second DATE for TIME , and thirdly that it be limited to enable him to contact Y through internet . His latter claims depended on whether or not the court granted him any contact rights in the ongoing proceedings . Before the court he stated that there was no risk that he would harass or commit any criminal acts against Y. The purpose of the restraining order could be fulfilled in a less restrictive way so that it did not infringe his possible contact rights . He had fully respected the previous restraining orders . His crime had been committed DATE and he now realised that it had been wrong to take Y to GPE . It was in Y \u2019s best interest to have contact with both of her parents .", "In response to the applicant \u2019s appeal , the public prosecutor argued that Y did not wish to have any contact with the applicant and that the restraining order allowed Y to feel safe and to live a normal life without fear of being abducted again .", "On DATE , ORG found that there were still reasons to maintain the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y even if his crime had been committed a long time before .", "The applicant appealed to ORG and ORG , which on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , decided to refuse leave to appeal .", "On DATE , ORG again decided to extend the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y for DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , maintained his previous submissions and added that Y was influenced by X , who had systematically tried to make her afraid of the applicant . Y had only been DATE when the applicant had taken her to GPE . She could not possibly be afraid of such acts DATE . The applicant had never harmed Y. He had sent her gifts and money but they had never reached her . He had not had any contact with her for DATE .", "In response to the applicant \u2019s appeal , the public prosecutor argued that the restraining order did not prevent Y from having contact with the applicant if she so wished . It was up to her to decide whether or not she wanted to receive anything from the applicant . Y , who was now DATE , did not wish to have any contact with the applicant . There were no reasons to go against her will . The crime that the applicant had committed was serious . The applicant had not presented any new circumstances .", "On DATE , ORG , after having held an oral hearing , found that there were still reasons to maintain the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y even if his crime had been committed a long time earlier .", "In the meantime , it would appear that , on DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s request , ORG had decided to dismiss the civil proceedings concerning contact rights .", "The applicant appealed against the restraining order to ORG which , on DATE , decided to refuse leave to appeal . ORG , on DATE , dismissed a further appeal since the original decision had already become time - barred .", "On DATE , ORG again decided to extend the restraining order against the applicant vis - \u00e0 - vis Y for DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG and submitted the following . DATE had passed since he had committed the criminal act upon which the restraining order was based . A decision which made all contact between a child and its parent impossible breached FAC as well as LAW . Y was now DATE and it would be practically impossible to abduct her against her will . His only wish was to be granted limited contact rights in the presence of an assistant from the social welfare authority or merely be granted contact with Y through internet . The purpose of the restraining order was to prevent him from abducting NORP Since Y had a need for a good relationship with both her parents , it was disproportionate to prevent all contact between her and the applicant .", "On DATE , ORG , after having held an oral hearing , lifted the restraining order . It stated that although the crime committed by the applicant was serious , it had been committed only once , DATE . Moreover , the applicant had continuously respected the restraining order and the circumstances had changed over DATE . Therefore , in the court \u2019s view , there was no longer any risk of future harassment or criminal acts against Y , on the part of the applicant .", "It appears that , at DATE , the applicant initiated new civil proceedings where he requested contact rights with Y. In DATE , during a preparatory hearing at ORG , the applicant and X agreed that the applicant should write a letter to Y in order to explain why he had stayed away from her and that the letter should be handed to her by an assistant from ORG . Y would thereafter have the opportunity to respond if she so wished .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case are laid down in LAW , as in force at the relevant time . According to LAW , an order prohibiting a person from visiting or in other ways contacting another person or follow that person ( \u201c restraining order \u201d ) may be issued if , due to special circumstances , there is a risk that the person against whom the order is issued will commit criminal acts , persecute or severely harass the protected person . In the risk assessment , special attention should be paid to whether or not the person against whom the order is decided has previously committed criminal acts against any person \u2019s life , health , peace or tranquillity . According to LAW , restraining orders should be provided with necessary limitations due to the particular circumstances in the individual case . The basic prerequisite for a restraining order is that there is a clear risk that the protected person will face criminal acts , persecution or other forms of severe harassment ( travaux pr\u00e9paratoires , prop . CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In the risk assessment , one should consider the nature of any previous crimes committed , whether there are several criminal acts and whether they were committed on CARDINAL or several occasions ( ibid , p. CARDINAL ) . According to LAW , a restraining order shall be issued for a fixed time period , maximum DATE . It may be extended for maximum DATE at a time .", "A decision to extend a restraining order demands a full investigation , which should have regard to the fact that the interference with the affected person \u2019s freedom of movement may be perceived as more severe the longer it lasts . As to a request for extension of the restraining order , special attention should be given to whether or not the affected person has complied with the order . If previous criminal acts have formed the basis of the risk assessment , one should reassess whether these acts still provide a basis to conclude that there is a clear risk of future criminal acts in view of the time that has passed ( ORG decision of DATE , ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) .", "Appeal against a prosecutor \u2019s decision to issue a restraining order lies to ORG . The person concerned has the right to be granted an oral hearing upon request ( Sections DATE of the LAW ) . Appeal against ORG final decision lies to ORG . Since DATE , an examination of the case on the merits before ORG requires leave to appeal . The same applies to an appeal to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act on ORG , lagen om domstols\u00e4renden , CARDINAL ) .", "As to the issue of contact rights , the Children and Parents Code ( f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrabalken , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) stipulates that the best interest of the child shall be the primary consideration in the determination of all questions concerning custody , residence and contact . In the assessment of what is in the best interest of the child , particular attention shall be paid to the child \u2019s need for close and good contact with both parents . The risk of the child being abused , unlawfully removed or detained , or otherwise suffering harm shall be taken into account . In the determination of questions concerning custody , residence and contact , regard shall be had to the wishes of the child , taking into account the child \u2019s age and maturity ( LAW , LAW ) , of the Code ) .", "In cases concerning contact rights , the court can , if it finds it necessary , decide upon such rights temporarily while the proceedings are pending . The court may also request ORG to submit relevant information in order to be better placed to make an assessment . The ORG shall , if appropriate , collect information from the parents and the child before reporting to the court ( LAW , LAW , of the LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
