SLOVAKIA (No. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Art. 5-1;Violation of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . DATE he was the Director of ORG ( PERSON informa\u010dn\u00e1 slu\u017eba ) , the NORP intelligence service . In DATE he was elected as a member of ORG ( the ORG ) for a DATE term .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to give an explanation to a police investigator on DATE . On DATE the investigator arrested the applicant and issued a decision in which he accused him of incitement to commit murder , abuse of authority and the mishandling of information classified as a ORG secret . The decision stated that the applicant was suspected of having prevented the proper investigation of the offence of abduction of the son of the then President of GPE abroad ( for further details concerning that case see also PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the decision referred to an extensive investigation including several statements of experts , documentary evidence obtained from ORG , the examination of CARDINAL witnesses including CARDINAL witnesses whose identity was not disclosed and other evidence . The information thus obtained sufficiently justified the conclusion that the applicant , in his capacity as Director of ORG , had taken the action described below with a view to ( i ) preventing the offence of abduction of the President \u2019s son in DATE from being elucidated , ( ii ) threatening PERSON , a former member of ORG , who had confirmed the involvement of the secret service in that offence and who had later been forced to hide abroad and ( iii ) preventing witness NORP from maintaining contact with PERSON and killing the former . The applicant was accused of offering MONEY ( SKK ) to S. to kill NORP In that context , the applicant was suspected of having arranged for the monitoring of several persons and had transmitted the information thus obtained to S. despite the fact that it had been classified as \u201c strictly secret \u201d . S. had asked CARDINAL persons to kill NORP After the first attempt had failed , the perpetrators had activated , in DATE , an explosive device which had been attached to NORP \u2019s car . The car had caught fire and NORP had died inside . The investigator \u2019s decision referred to a different set of proceedings brought against CARDINAL persons accused of having activated the device .", "CARDINAL . The applicant immediately filed a complaint against the decision which a public prosecutor dismissed on DATE . The public prosecutor requested that the applicant be remanded in custody pursuant to LAW ( a ) , ( b ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , in the presence of CARDINAL lawyers , was heard by a judge of the Bratislava I ORG . The applicant stated that he knew neither NORP nor the persons allegedly involved in his killing . His deprivation of liberty was arbitrary . The evidence on which the investigator relied had not been obtained in accordance with the relevant provisions of the criminal law and , as such , it could not be used in proceedings before a court . The applicant also complained that the investigator had not allowed him or his lawyers to consult the file without relying on any relevant reason . The judge informed the applicant that he would not put the file at his disposal as , at that stage of proceedings , such action was within the power of the investigator .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge remanded the applicant in custody with effect from DATE . The judge did not accept that there was a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding or influencing witnesses within the meaning of LAW ( a ) and ( b ) of LAW . However , the decision stated , with reference to LAW , that the applicant was charged with an offence carrying a minimum prison sentence of DATE . The court \u2019s decision also stated that the investigator had violated the applicant \u2019s right to be presumed innocent by holding that his actions had met the constituent elements of the offences in issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a complaint which he supplemented several times . He alleged that ORG judge had not allowed him or his counsel to consult the case file and that the evidence available had not been obtained in accordance with the procedural requirements and did not justify his being accused of the offences in issue . The applicant also submitted that the relevant events had occurred in DATE and that , subsequently , public authorities had influenced public opinion , indicating that the applicant was responsible for the events in question . Furthermore , the first - instance court had disregarded the applicant \u2019s own position , namely that the prosecuting authorities were biased and had striven to remand him in custody by all means . The applicant relied on the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested permission to consult the file . ORG permitted them to do so from TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision on his detention on remand at a meeting held on DATE , apparently shortly after the applicant \u2019s counsel had consulted the file . The court met in camera ; the relevant law excluded both the applicant and the public prosecutor from attending .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision stated that the applicant had been remanded in custody in accordance with the applicable procedural rules and that his detention was justified under LAW . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that he had been accused of the offences in issue arbitrarily , the decision stated that ORG had thoroughly examined the evidence included in the file . It noted that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were at the initial stage only and concluded that the evidence available at that time justified the suspicion that the offences in issue had been committed . The applicant \u2019s detention was not arbitrary . As to the applicant \u2019s objections to the conduct of the criminal proceedings , ORG pointed out that they fell within the competence of the public prosecutor in charge of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bratislava I ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of the GPE I ORG refused to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . The decision stated , inter alia , that there had been relevant reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention on remand when the GPE I ORG had delivered the above decisions of DATE and DATE . The file contained evidence both against the applicant and in his favour . The former type of evidence had been taken in DATE in the context of criminal proceedings against CARDINAL other persons . As such it could not be used in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant . It was not clear why the investigator had not re - examined the witnesses concerned in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant . The reliability of certain statements could be cast into doubt as they had been made by persons linked to organised crime .", "CARDINAL . The judge further held that in the period after DATE no evidence had been obtained in support of the accusation against the applicant . Thus during DATE the applicant was detained the investigator and the prosecutor had failed to gather sufficient evidence capable of strengthening the suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence imputed to him . On the contrary , the evidence obtained in the course of DATE was in favour of the applicant . The ground for his detention had therefore ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor ordered the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Special Prosecution Service at ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings on the ground that the facts underlying the proceedings had not occurred . The decision stated , inter alia , that the file contained no relevant evidence indicating that the applicant had committed the offence imputed to him . There was no proof that the accused persons in the other set of proceedings had committed the offence which , according to the accusation , the applicant had allegedly incited them to commit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an extraordinary briefing was held at which the Minister of the ORG provided details concerning the arrest of the applicant . The Minister read out extracts from the decision by which the applicant had been accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE PERSON with nationwide distribution published an article about the case . It reported on the Minister \u2019s statements at the above briefing . Reference was also made to a statement by a public prosecutor who had pointed out that the decision on the applicant \u2019s guilt or innocence lay with a court and had expressed the view that the existing evidence was sufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON published an interview with the investigator who had accused the applicant of the above offences . The investigator stated that the police had had sufficient evidence , comprising both witness statements and documents , to bring criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON reported on statements made by the public prosecutor in charge of the applicant \u2019s case . According to those statements , CARDINAL witness had confirmed that the applicant had offered him SKK CARDINAL for the killing of the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . Finally , on DATE PERSON published an article about the judge of the Bratislava I ORG who had remanded the applicant in custody . The article indicated that the judge had been aware that the applicant had been summoned to appear before a police investigator on DATE . At that time the judge had been on duty and he had had a premonition that \u201c something would happen \u201d . The judge expressed the view that the case had fallen to be dealt with by him by pure chance . The judge had had only one day to study the file , which comprised CARDINAL pages . The hearing of the applicant prior to his detention on remand had lasted TIME . The judge confirmed that , according to documents included in the file , CARDINAL witness had confirmed that the applicant had asked him to eliminate a witness against him for SKK CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG . He alleged a violation of his rights under LAW , DATE and under LAW , CARDINAL of the Convention . He also relied on several constitutional provisions .", "CARDINAL . As regards the proceedings leading to the Bratislava I ORG decision to remand him in custody , the applicant complained that the judge had not allowed him and his counsel to consult the case file , indicating that such a decision was within the competence of the investigator . The applicant thus could not show that his accusation had been based on evidence which had been obtained by unlawful means and which , for that reason , could not be used in proceedings before a court . The judge had not examined whether relevant reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention had existed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further complained that the judge of the Bratislava I ORG had subsequently given an interview in which he had made comments on the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty and disclosed details from the case file . The applicant affirmed that those statements had been made in the context of a campaign launched against him . His rights to a fair hearing and to be presumed innocent had thereby been violated .", "CARDINAL . As regards the decision given by ORG on DATE , the applicant complained that the principle of equality of arms had been breached as he had not had sufficient time , after his counsel had consulted the file , to supplement his complaint against the decision on his detention on remand . He had been accused on the strength of evidence obtained contrary to the relevant provisions of LAW in that it had been taken previously within the framework of another set of proceedings . That had been a deliberate attempt to diminish his ability to defend himself . That evidence could not be used in proceedings before courts , including proceedings concerning his detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint . The decision stated that ORG lacked the power to review the factual findings of ordinary courts in matters relating to detention on remand . ORG found that in the context of the criminal proceedings brought against him the applicant risked a minimum prison term of DATE . The material condition for his detention on remand under LAW had therefore been made out . Both courts had examined the file and concluded that the evidence available justified the suspicion that the applicant had been involved in the offences concerned . However , a \u201c reasonable suspicion \u201d that a person had committed an offence did not require the existence of proof . In respect of this part of the applicant \u2019s complaint ORG concluded that it lacked the power to substitute the decision - making of the ordinary courts on the applicant \u2019s detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further declared manifestly ill - founded the complaints under LAW and LAW . It noted that the applicant had been assisted by CARDINAL advocates during his examination by the judge of ORG . He had had an adequate opportunity to defend his rights . As to the alleged violation of LAW , ORG held that it had been open to the applicant to bring proceedings with a view to challenging the lawfulness of his detention on remand . However , he had not availed himself of that right . There was no causal link between the conduct of the ordinary courts in the proceedings in issue and the applicant \u2019s right under LAW . As regards the principle of equality of arms enshrined in LAW , it was not applicable to proceedings in which the courts deprive a person of liberty for the purpose of his or her criminal prosecution .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG noted that the applicant had filed his complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention about the statements made by ORG judge DATE after he had learned about the article in issue . In that respect , the statutory time - limit had not been respected .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL gives the accused person the right to consult the file with certain restrictions enumerated therein . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that , at the pretrial stage , the public prosecutor or the police authority can only refuse a person access to a file concerning him or her for exceptional reasons .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that an accused person can be remanded in custody where he or she is prosecuted for an offence punishable with a minimum prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that a complaint is available against a decision to remand a person in custody .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , where the facts established sufficiently justify the conclusion that a criminal offence was committed by a particular person , the investigator or police authority shall deliver a decision , without delay , accusing that person of the offence in issue . The accused is to be notified of the decision within DATE and not later than at the beginning of his or her first examination .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG practice ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , when considering whether reasons for remanding a person in custody exist , the authorities may have regard exclusively to circumstances and findings which have their basis in the procedural steps aimed at the establishment of evidence and which are relevant for the conclusion that a statutory reason exists for detaining a person in custody .", "CARDINAL . In decision PERSON CARDINAL of DATE ORG held that the detention on remand of a person under LAW is lawful where the accused person is prosecuted for an offence punishable with a minimum prison term of DATE provided that a justified suspicion exists that the person concerned committed the offence imputed to him or her . The above minimum prison term as such does not render an accused person \u2019s detention mandatory in each case . LAW CARDINAL permits a decision not to remand such an accused person in custody where it is", "CARDINAL . In decision NtvI-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ORG expressed the view that the minimum prison term set out in LAW could be the sole reason for a person \u2019s detention only for a limited time , in particular at the initial stage of criminal proceedings . If a person was detained for longer , further relevant reasons were required ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
