With her second husband , PERSON , she had CARDINAL children . PERSON was born in DATE , PERSON in DATE , ORG in DATE and PERSON on DATE . In DATE PERSON gave birth to her last child .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the relations between PERSON and PERSON deteriorated . In DATE M. instituted divorce proceedings and requested to be afforded parental rights over the children . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) granted parental rights over the CARDINAL younger children , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , to PERSON and over the CARDINAL older children to her first husband . ORG appealed against the decision , but withdrew the appeal in DATE . In DATE PERSON moved with the CARDINAL children to live withher present husband . On DATE the ORG pronounced PERSON divorce from her first husband . The applicants have been married since DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON applied to ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr Kinder , ORG und PERSON ) for family aid . In order to be granted the aid , the applicants agreed to have their family situation assessed by a psychological expert . In DATE ORG instructed PERSON to draw up an expert report . The expert met PERSON and CARDINAL of her children on DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE at the applicants ' home .", "CARDINAL . Being of the opinion that the questions put to the children by the expert were irrelevant for the purposes of family aid and having regard to the expert 's objection to PERSON attending the meetings with the children 's teachers , the applicants refused to co \u2013 operate with the expert any longer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert submitted his report to ORG . According to this report , the deficiencies in the children 's care and home conditions risked jeopardising their development seriously . There was a damaging cycle of events in which the applicants were unreasonably harsh with their children on repeated occasions and had beaten them . The children needed to be in a secure long - term placement and any further contact between them and the applicants would have to be avoided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for an interim injunction ( einstweilige Anordnung ) withdrawing the applicants ' parental rights over the CARDINAL children , namely their CARDINAL children , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , and CARDINAL of the children born during PERSON first marriage , namely PERSON , PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i. e. on DATE , ORG , without hearing the parents or their children , issued the requested interim injunction . The applicants were ordered to hand over the children forthwith to ORG . The officer in charge of enforcing the decision was authorised to use force if necessary to collect the children . Relying notably on the findings of the expert report , ORG found that the parents ' inability to give the children satisfactory care and education and an abusive exercise of parental authority jeopardised the physical , mental and psychological well - being of all of the children to the extent that their separation from the applicants appeared to be the only possible solution to protect them . ORG referred to the relevant provisions of LAW ( Articles DATE and DATE - see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG supplemented its decision of DATE , prohibiting all access between the applicants and their children and the CARDINAL children of the first marriage , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . The whereabouts of the children were not to be communicated to the applicants . ORG further prohibited all access between the CARDINAL other children of the first marriage and PERSON . She was also forbidden to come QUANTITY to the CARDINAL other children 's residence or their schools . ORG considered that the expert opinion was sufficient evidence to show that the separation of the parents from their children was necessary for the protection of the children . It had further been shown that the parents would object and try by all means to exert pressure upon the children . In order to avoid stress to the children , these measures were necessary in their best interests . The parents were urged to recognise their own deficiencies in respect of the care and the physical and psychological well - being of the children and take into account the clearly expressed need of the children for a change in their situation . The parents were invited to accept - at least for the time being - the measures taken and to contribute as far as possible to a calming of the general situation . This was only possible if the parents accepted the existing circumstances . The approach of ORG met in part the expressly stated wishes of the children . ORG concluded that the momentarily inevitable measures were proportionate to the urgent needs and the objective interests of all of the children .", "CARDINAL . The children were taken on DATE TIME from CARDINAL different schools , a nursery and from home and were placed in CARDINAL foster homes . The DATE youngest daughter , PERSON , was taken from the hospital and since that time has lived with a foster family .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE Dr PERSON , a gynaecologist and head physician at the PERSON hospital in GPE , complained to ORG about the conduct of the authorities . He stated that , according to a telephone call of DATE , the CARDINAL children of PERSON as well as the newborn child in the hospital were to be removed from their mother without her knowledge . His patient was to be informed of the measure after her child had been taken from the nursery . Staff members were asked to take the child downstairs to the hospital 's entrance and place it in a taxi .", "He , as the head physician , and the medical hospital staff were surprised and shocked by the lack of warning and considered this conduct an affront to both PERSON and the medical staff . Since DATE PERSON had been taken care of by the medical staff of the hospital . She had always given the impression of a being highly responsible person . She had come regularly to the preventive medical check - ups during her pregnancy . When she was accompanied by her children , the children behaved well , were friendly and well brought - up . There were no signs that they were in any way neglected or ill - treated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicants that the children had been granted financial assistance in the sum of ORG DATE and that the parents had to contribute to these fees according to their financial means .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against ORG decision of DATE . They submitted that it was difficult to understand that in the context of family aid an expert opinion on the parents ' ability to bring up their children had been drawn up and that they had not been informed about this opinion . The contested decision was unexpected and had been given at a moment when PERSON was in a critical state of health , having given birth to her daughter DATE . They proposed witnesses who would confirm that the children had not been ill - treated , but were being brought up with love and understanding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the applicants assisted by a lawyer , PERSON first husband , representatives of ORG , a representative of a nursery and the expert PERSON The CARDINAL witnesses of the applicants ' own choosing were not heard and had to leave the courtroom .", "ORG instructed PERSON to proceed with the assessment of the remaining children and to finalise his report . It further appointed a new expert , PERSON , to assess the applicants ' capacity to bring up their children .", "CARDINAL . In the following interviews to prepare the assessment , the applicants asked the expert make a tape - recording of the interviews . Upon the expert 's refusal to do so , the applicants were unwilling to continue to co - operate with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicants ' appeal against the decision of DATE . It noted that ORG had had regard to the report submitted by ORG in connection with its request of DATE to revoke the applicants ' parental rights and to the expert opinion submitted by PERSON and that ORG had considered that the impugned measure was justified . The expert had concluded that the basic needs of the children were not satisfied and that patterns of violence and permanent shortcomings of all kinds determined the children 's day - to - day life . It was thus necessary to put an end to the risk to which the well - being of the children appeared to be exposed . A new expert opinion was to be expected by DATE . ORG found that the applicants ' appeal could therefore be dismissed without holding a hearing . It was against the best interests of the children to take them out of the new environment in which they were building up new contacts , and to restore them to their former family , there being the risk that they would be taken to a new environment again shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the judge at ORG for bias .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicants ' request for an interim injunction .", "ORG found that the applicants ' constitutional complaint was neither inadmissible nor manifestly ill - founded . There were doubts in particular whether the courts had breached the applicants ' right to a fair hearing and their right to respect for their family life . However , if the requested interim injunction was issued and if later the constitutional complaint had to be dismissed , the children would have to be taken from the applicants again and placed somewhere else . Having regard to the fact that the expert opinion was to be drawn up by DATE , the applicants should await the outcome of the main proceedings rather than have the children run the risk of being separated from their parents again later . It had to be assumed that the competent courts would conduct the main proceedings speedily having regard to the time element in these matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the challenge to the judge and on DATE another to the expert PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed a lawyer of ORG as curator ad litem ( PERSON ) to represent the children in the proceedings . It instructed the already appointed experts to submit the results of their investigations obtained so far and discharged them from any further expert activity . It appointed a new expert , Professor PERSON , with a view to determining whether separating the children from the family was the only way of eliminating all danger for them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Professor PERSON interviewed the applicants at their home . The interview lasted for TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , set aside the decisions of ORG DATE and ORG of DATE and referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicants complained about the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE , ORG declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible , since the applicants had failed to appeal against these decisions in accordance with section CARDINAL of GPE ( PERSON \u00fcber die ORG der freiwilligen PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the constitutional complaint was admissible , ORG considered that , in accordance with the principles established in its case - law , the decisions of ORG and ORG violated the applicants ' family rights as guaranteed by LAW , first sentence , of the basic PERSON , taken together with LAW ( see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law \u201d below ) .", "There were serious doubts whether the courts had respected the importance of parental rights when giving their decisions and whether they had sufficiently taken into account the principle of proportionality . The question whether the evidence established that there was a risk of harm to the children had not been adequately considered . ORG and ORG had merely referred to the report of ORG and the expert opinion . It did not appear from their decisions whether the expert 's conclusions were based on reliable facts . An assessment of the applicants ' submissions and considerations as to the possibility of ordering alternative measures , that would not have required the total revocation of parental rights , had not been made . Both ORG and ORG had failed to question the children or give the persons taking part in the proceedings the opportunity to be heard .", "The measures which had been ordered had led to a drastic change in the lives of all the persons concerned and constituted a particularly serious interference with parental rights . However , no inquiries had been made , even by telephone , before the decision was taken . No reasons were given justifying the urgency of the matter .", "ORG had no information on the possible effects of its decision , since ORG and the expert had not commented on this issue . When examining the advantages and disadvantages of a family measure it was , however , relevant to consider that a separation of the children from their parents could jeopardise the development of the children , in particular in DATE of life .", "The courts had also failed to clarify the contradiction between the findings in the expert opinion according to which the applicants were not ready to co - operate and the fact that PERSON herself had asked to be granted child - rearing guidance . Furthermore there was no indication whether and to what extent the applicants had refused any contact or help offered by ORG and it was not clear which \u201c specific measures granting assistance \u201d ( einzelne ORG ) had been carried out in the past and why they were not successful .", "ORG should have first clarified the questions which arose and in the meantime could have taken alternative provisional measures if there was serious reason to believe that the welfare of the children was at risk .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , it could not be excluded that , prior to the termination of the proceedings on the merits , which had to be dealt with as a priority , ORG would issue another emergency decision . If so , ORG was directed to examine carefully whether , in the light of the evidence obtained in the meantime , the continued separation of the children from the applicants was still justified and whether a repeated change of the children 's place of residence would be in their best interests . If ORG found that the present situation were to be maintained , it would have to consider whether the applicants should be granted a right of access , restricted or subject to conditions if necessary , and whether , in strict accordance with the principle of proportionality , the effects of such a decision should be limited in time .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and DATE CARDINAL of the children , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , were interviewed by the judge at ORG at the respective institutions where they were placed .", "CARDINAL . According to TIME of FAC of DATE , PERSON declared that he wished to return to his parents . He knew that there were certain reasons for placing him and his siblings in a different environment and confirmed that he had had too much work and strain at home . He sent his greetings to his brothers and sisters .", "CARDINAL . Nico , PERSON and PERSON were interviewed in another foster home . PERSON stated that he wished to know whether his parents and his \u201c favourite \u201d father ( Lieblingsvater ) were all right . He asked why he could not join his \u201c favourite \u201d father and whether somebody , his parents , his father or PERSON , could not come to see him . PERSON and PERSON were with him and , according to them , were all right . PERSON had let him know that she too wished to return home . He stated that he was fine . Asked about his dreams , he said that he wished to go to his \u201c favourite \u201d father who was very nice , better than his stepfather . In reply to the question whether the judge should leave a message , he dictated the following letter on a dictaphone : \u201c Dear PERSON ( his favourite brother ) , ( his favourite sisters PERSON and PERSON ) , dear PERSON , what a pity that we do n't see each other ...

PERSON regretted that \u201c poor PERSON was all on her own without any member of the family . She would never bear this . She had to protect PERSON and PERSON . That was her duty as the elder sister . PERSON was beaten very often in that place . She did not know the reason . In reply to a question , she stated that she was doing her homework thoroughly and that she was doing well in school . At home she had almost fallen asleep when doing her homework . When asked what message the judge could pass on , she said that she did not like the place and that she wished to return home . However , the staff did not believe her . She did not really like them . She did not want to go to another institution . She wished to go home . If she were not allowed to go home , she should at least be authorised to see everybody , her brothers and sisters , parents and stepfather . She missed taking PERSON to bed sometimes . Having been told that PERSON wished to return to his \u201c favourite \u201d father , PERSON replied that , unlike PERSON , she loved both her father and her stepfather .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a consequence of the decision of ORG , ORG set down for hearing on DATE the request of ORG of DATE to provisionally revoke the parental rights of the applicants over the children . It transferred to ORG the right to decide where the children should live ( Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht ) . ORG found that the best interests of the children did not require a modification of the present situation before a decision on the merits was given . ORG considered that its decision of DATE prohibiting the applicants all access to the children was still relevant , since it had not been set aside by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing attended inter alia by the applicants assisted by a lawyer , PERSON first husband , the curator ad litem , a lawyer and representatives of ORG , the experts PERSON and Professor PERSON and the children 's paediatrician PERSON Professor PERSON gave details of her visit to the applicants ' home on DATE and resumed the content of the interview . Having studied the extensive files concerning the applicants and PERSON 's report , Professor PERSON could not confirm that the findings in the report were erroneous . She expressed the view that the children should not be returned to the applicants .", "The children 's paediatrician , PERSON , stated that all the children had been his patients since their birth except the daughter born in DATE . Although he knew about the children 's problems , in particular the difficulties with PERSON , the applicants made a quite positive impression on him . It was a big family with many children . However , the applicants were loving parents who took great care of their children . There was no indication that the children had been beaten or otherwise abused .", "The curator ad litem was opposed to contacts between the applicants and the children .", "CARDINAL . By an interim injunction of DATE , namely DATE , ORG provisionally transferred the custody ( Personensorge ) over the children to ORG and confirmed its decision of DATE . The expert was instructed to add to her report . She was requested to comment in particular on whether , in the best interest of the children , it was necessary to maintain the access prohibition , whether the children should be granted access to the older children of the first marriage , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , and if appropriate , in what way such contact could be arranged while keeping the children 's place of residence secret .", "CARDINAL . ORG relied in particular on the findings of the expert PERSON that the separation of the applicants from their children had to be maintained . The applicants were incapable of bringing up their children because of their own basic and irreparable educational deficiencies and their abuse of parental authority . The children were emotionally disturbed and presented unusual patterns of behaviour . They had been beaten and locked up . Furthermore the CARDINAL older children of the first marriage had approved the separation of the younger children from their mother and had refused any contact with her . The sole reason why PERSON was intent on giving a positive impression of herself was to obtain support from others . However , any such support was foredoomed .", "ORG noted that Professor PERSON had not yet submitted her report . However , she had confirmed the findings of the expert PERSON and had stated at the hearing of DATE that there was no alternative to separating the children from the applicants . According to her , PERSON had never been willing to call her own behaviour into question . She satisfied her own needs only and refused to accept child - rearing guidance with a view to reducing her own deficiencies . In fact , she had admitted not having undergone therapy in DATE . Professor PERSON had found that PERSON 's expert opinion could not be objected to .", "ORG considered that the numerous written statements of witnesses submitted by the applicants confirming that the children had not been beaten or ill - treated did not constitute sufficient evidence in their favour . Harm , such as verbal cruelty , could be of a psychological nature . The statement made by PERSON that she wished to return to the applicants did not reflect her real intention , but resulted from a conflict of loyalty .", "ORG further compared the situation described in an expert report drawn up in DATE with the present situation : PERSON was always well - dressed while her husband looked tired and worn out . It concluded that PERSON was not aware of her problems . She aggravated with each new pregnancy the emotional deficiencies of the children . This had been confirmed by Professor PERSON after a discussion with the applicants on DATE .", "ORG affirmed that its decision of DATE was based on its experience in cases where coercive measures had to be taken . Had the parents been warned of the requested measure , they would have offered resistance , as was shown by their own reaction and the excessive reaction of the media in the case . An enforcement of the court decisions with the intervention of the authorities and the police would have been contrary to the best interests of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged Professor PERSON for bias . They complained that she had intentionally delayed the preparation of her expert report in order to separate the children from their parents for a longer period . She could not be relied upon to act in the best interests of the children . Without having seen them , she had recommended at the hearing before ORG of DATE that they be separated from the applicants . Her unfriendly conduct vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicants , when interviewing them at their home on DATE , and the reference to files dating from PERSON divorce problems in DATE confirmed the view that she was not impartial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged the judge at ORG for bias . They referred to previous decisions given by that judge in favour of ORG , allegedly in contrast to expert recommendations .", "On DATE the judge declined to stand down .", "On DATE the applicants ' lawyer again challenged the judge at ORG and Professor PERSON for bias .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the challenge to the judge on the ground that the applicants ' allegations were unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE CARDINAL of the children living with their father , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , were heard separately by ORG . They were opposed to seeing their mother .", "CARDINAL . By a decision on the merits of DATE , ORG withdrew the applicants ' parental rights over their CARDINAL children and the CARDINAL children of the first marriage previously living with them and prohibited access to them until DATE . It relied on Articles DATE , DATE and DATE LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The authorities were compelled to take the contested measures , which were justified under LAW of LAW , and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the health and the rights of the children within the meaning of LAW . It found that the domestic situation was difficult and that the children were in danger . The applicants , in particular PERSON , were inflexible and incapable of understanding the children 's needs and with her it would be impossible to implement any educative measures .
