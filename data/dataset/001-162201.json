ESTONIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 6+6-3-d - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Article 6-3-d - Witnesses)", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Julia Laffranque;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He was charged with causing serious health damage . According to the charges , at TIME on DATE , he , together with GPE , had repeatedly hit PERSON on the head outside a nightclub on FAC . L. had fallen to the ground and had then been kicked several times . He had sustained serious head injuries which had been life - threatening and caused him permanent health damage .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings in respect of GPE were discontinued after his death in a car accident on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) heard evidence from the applicant and CARDINAL witnesses and examined certain other evidence such as a written forensic expert opinion on PERSON \u2019s injuries , a telephone activity report concerning the time and location of the applicant \u2019s communications , identification reports based on photographs and a video - recording from a closed circuit television camera near the scene . It also examined GPE \u2019s statements given during the preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the witness statements were incoherent and that some were contradictory . The witnesses had given different accounts of the events , regarding the number of persons who had been at the scene and attacked PERSON , as well as the NORP actions during the scuffle and after PERSON had fallen to the ground . The court noted that according to GPE \u2019s statements given during the preliminary investigation , he had hit PERSON twice , PERSON had fallen to the ground , and the applicant had arrived afterwards . The court had no reason to doubt what GPE had said . It also noted that it could not give less credit to the statements of LANGUAGE \u2013 according to whom the fight had been between PERSON and GPE \u2013 merely because he was a friend of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected witness statements from ORG , GPE and GPE as evidence , as well as identification reports drawn up during the pre - trial investigation identifying the applicant as one of the ( probable ) attackers of the victim , as their statements in the identification reports did not match their statements before the court . It also pointed to the lack of credibility of some of the witness statements , such as PERSON \u2019s statement , which said that she had recognised the applicant \u2019s eye colour and the look in his eyes , but that she had not seen the colour of his jacket .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that there was only indirect evidence against the applicant and concluded that it could not be established beyond doubt that he had committed the offence he was charged with . By a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) . He mainly challenged ORG assessment of the evidence . He did not request a re - examination of the witnesses . He requested that ORG quash ORG judgment and adopt a new judgment convicting the applicant . A copy of the prosecutor \u2019s appeal was sent to the applicant and his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . ORG summoned the applicant , his counsel and the prosecutor to a hearing . However , the applicant informed the court in writing that he did not wish to take part and asked for the case to be examined in his absence .", "CARDINAL . At ORG hearing , which took place on DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel confirmed that he was aware that the applicant did not wish to take part . The prosecutor did not object to examination of the case in the applicant \u2019s absence . ORG disclosed the records of ORG hearings at the prosecutor \u2019s request , to which the applicant \u2019s counsel did not object . Subsequently , the court heard the parties\u2019 arguments . No requests to summon witnesses were made and no witnesses were examined .", "CARDINAL . ORG assessed the evidence differently , based on the material in the case file , and found that the applicant \u2019s guilt was established . It considered that it was incorrect to describe the witness statements as contradictory ; rather , the ORG attention had been focused on different details and the scope and precision of the information contained in their statements varied . The court provided a comprehensive analysis of the evidence in its judgment , delivered on DATE , and explained in detail why , and to what extent , it assessed the statements given in ORG differently from the lower court .", "CARDINAL . Notably , ORG considered that ORG had not been justified in rejecting ORG , ORG and GPE \u2019s statements and identification reports as evidence . In respect of ORG , it noted that at the identification procedure she had recognised the applicant by his eyes and eyebrows . The fact that she could not describe his clothing did not discredit her evidence . The court found that it could not be required of a witness to note everything necessary for criminal proceedings . A person could only focus on a single detail rather than on the full picture . Nor was her evidence discredited by her failure to recognise the applicant at the court hearing , as at court hearings witnesses were in a particularly stressful situation . Similar considerations were applied to PERSON , who , moreover , had recognised the applicant at ORG hearing . The fact that PERSON and PERSON ( another witness ) \u2013 who had been together at the time of the events \u2013 had taken note of different aspects of the events did not render those statements unreliable ; rather , it reflected the fact that the perception and memory of different people differed . Nor did the different expressions used by PERSON at the identification procedure and in court render her statements unreliable . Furthermore , ORG found no radical differences between PERSON \u2019s statements in the identification report and in court , and therefore considered that the rejection of his statements as evidence had been not justified either . In conclusion , ORG considered that ORG , ORG and PERSON \u2019s statements , as well as their identification reports , had to be taken into account and assessed together with the other evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG also disagreed with ORG position concerning the reliability of ORG \u2019s statements . It pointed to the fact that his statements , according to which the applicant had arrived at the scene after PERSON had already fallen to the ground , did not match any of the other witness statements . It also noted that the applicant , GPE and GPE had been friends , whereas the other witnesses had had no connection with them . Considering a number of statements by independent witnesses , the court found that GPE had not been credible in assuming full responsibility and noted that there was no way of finding out why he had done so . It also noted that the applicant \u2019s statements had been inconsistent . He had said during the preliminary investigation that he had seen GPE hitting PERSON , whereas in court he had said that he had been further away from the scene and denied having seen anything . The court also referred in that connection to the words heard by witnesses from a person whose appearance corresponded to that of the applicant : \u201c Why then did he come to start a quarrel ? \u201d If the applicant had arrived at the scene after PERSON had been knocked down , he would have known nothing about the reasons and initial stages of the conflict and would have had no reason to express himself in such a way .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that since the applicant had acted jointly with another person , it was legally irrelevant which of them had struck PERSON , causing him to fall , although it also referred to PERSON \u2019s statements according to which the last blow had been given by the applicant . The court further analysed at length the subjective element of the offence and concluded that the applicant had acted with the indirect intent of causing serious health damage . Both the intellectual and volitional aspects of intent required under the pertinent case - law had been present in the applicant \u2019s behaviour .", "CARDINAL . ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , of which he immediately had to serve DATE , the remainder of the sentence being suspended . In sentencing , the court had regard to the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions and that he was a young person in DATE . A short immediate prison sentence gave him a serious warning for the future .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He challenged ORG assessment of the evidence and argued that it had not convincingly substantiated its different conclusion from that of ORG . He pointed out that ORG had not directly verified the evidence ; he referred in that respect to the conduct of the witnesses , which was of paramount importance in assessing their credibility but which was not reflected in the record of the court hearing . In particular , he referred to PERSON \u2019s hesitant behaviour at the hearing . He considered that ORG had assessed the evidence in a selective and arbitrary manner and had given the benefit of the doubt to the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to examine the applicant \u2019s appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
