They did so extensively . The hearings took up a great deal of time . The shortest hearing of an unidentified witness lasted TIME ( CARDINAL ) ; the longest TIME ( BRZCARDINAL ) . The hearings of witnesses PERSON and PERSON each lasted TIME . This information may perhaps be of use in assessing the suggestion that was made on DATE to ORG , that all the witnesses should be heard by ORG in DATE .", "Where a witness did not answer a question , this is also indicated in the text of his statement .", "The statements were recorded in very great detail and in fact cover all the matters raised - also by the defence - , in a factual and where necessary even literal transcript . Once the text existed in draft form , those present were invariably given the opportunity to make comments , request clarification and put further questions . Where necessary the statement was then amended , clarified and expanded - always , of course , within the limits of what the witness really wanted to say . And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out , it is my belief that the advocate - general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings . Those present really did have the opportunity for TIME on each occasion . If they so desired , those present had several chances to put questions to a witness . Unlike what normally happens at court hearings , everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions . Questions were barred only on substantive grounds ( see the records for details ) , not by reason of the time taken for the interrogations .", "In the light of recent case - law in the matter of statements by unidentified witnesses , I think it is right for me to make known my findings regarding the statements of the unidentified witnesses heard in this case . I , the investigating judge , and the registrar , are the only persons who attended all the hearings from start to finish .", "I stand by my official record of findings dated DATE where the witnesses referred to in it are concerned [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . I would now add the following :", "All the \u2018 numbered ORG made their identities known to me . It was clear to me that all CARDINAL were different persons .", "Their statements indicated such a knowledge of the facts that I am entirely convinced that I was talking to the witnesses referred to by numbers in the documents . I have no reason to doubt their reliability . Nor at any time did I have the impression that I was being lied to . On the contrary , each and every CARDINAL of them was very much to the point . The persons facing me wore serious expressions . The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake , especially for the accused persons involved . The calm , quiet manner in which , for example , ORG and BRZCARDINAL related their experiences in GPE ( in which connection I expressly leave it to ORG to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators ) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused . All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness , which , in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [ CARDINAL of the defence lawyers ] in particular , did not bother me .", "If all the statements are laid side by side , some differences of detail can be observed . I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable . Rather , in so far as I have observed any differences , I would describe them rather as the \u2018 extraneous ORG which in my experience practically always affects statements by witnesses . Of course it is ultimately for ORG to decide on the value of the statements .", "The reasons for the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous in the instant case are given in the records of the hearings . It seems to me that I am now affording the ORG an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments . I think that the text of the recent judgments of ORG of the GPE also compels me , as the judge conducting the questioning , to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous . I am also concerned to inform ORG that I am aware that the ORG is called to take the final decision in these matters . I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity . I have had regard in this connection to the nature of these cases and to the nature of the activities of the anonymous witnesses concerned .", "I take the liberty of observing - while expressly leaving aside the question whether these accused persons are the perpetrators - that the instant case tellingly illustrates the fact that there are evidently people for whom human lives do not count when it comes to evading responsibility for exceptionally serious crimes which they may have committed .", "I can understand that there are major objections to revealing the names and appearance of members of arresting teams , observation teams and arresting units to the public at large . By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance . At the same time , I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses ( who are no longer anonymous to myself ) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision . It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the \u2018 numbered ORG acted carelessly . Rather , in my opinion , the opposite was true .", "During the last hearing of the witness PERSON , [ CARDINAL of the defence lawyers ] asked me to record that , in their view , the witness answered not only the questions of the defence but also questions by the investigating judge in a ponderous , deliberate manner that was hard to follow . I have been asked to endorse that opinion . I decline to do so . The witness PERSON was wary in his answers , which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly . It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred DATE previously should not be reproached for failing , in his answers to those questions , to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [ the CARDINAL lawyers ] in particular subjected him on CARDINAL DATE , together and in tandem . Furthermore , I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question , especially if he has already replied under oath on DATE . The witness PERSON kept a cool head , and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality . As far as I can judge at the present time , I regard him as a reliable witness . Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness , if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "The witness PERSON informed me on DATE that on CARDINAL DATE the persons numbered BRZCARDINAL and BRZCARDINAL were in the car with DATE . He gave me this information following a request by the defence .", "I think I ought not to omit to mention , with regard to the witness Engelen , that throughout TIME of insistent questioning he certainly did not strike me as untruthful . In my judgment , PERSON is a simple , friendly and very obliging man . Perhaps I can illustrate the impression I had of him by recording that , after the interrogation had gone on for a considerable time , I thought it opportune to ask the unusual question whether the witness could read . I do not exclude the possibility that he is not entirely aware of the great importance of an exact and consistent account of what he saw .", "In the second paragraph on the first page of the statement by the witness Engelen , I suggested to him that the confrontation had occurred on DATE . The date should be CARDINAL DATE . [ CARDINAL of the defence lawyers ] pointed this out to me later and I think he is right .", "...", "( signed ) PERSON", "DATE \"", "CARDINAL .

Before ORG he stated that on the latter occasion he had been allowed to re - read his earlier statement , but that he was no longer sure whether he could still recognise either the weapon or the man who had fired it . He also said that he had not been threatened in connection with the case .", "On DATE the lawyer acting for the applicant PERSON brought forward CARDINAL persons chosen for their excellent eyesight ( both having participated in the Olympic games as members of the GPE rifle - shooting team ) , and who had participated in a reconstruction of the shooting in light and weather conditions similar to those obtaining at the time of the crime . These witnesses both stated that they had been unable to distinguish the features of the persons acting the parts of the perpetrators at the distances at which it had been alleged that the accused had been seen by PERSON .

ORG refuses the request made by counsel at the hearing to have these witnesses heard in open court , even if this request should be understood to imply that the witnesses might be disguised , since the possibility that the witnesses may be recognised in open court can not be excluded .", "Of the arguments for continuing the anonymity of the witnesses , ORG considers particularly persuasive the personal safety of these witnesses and their families , and it makes no difference that these witnesses have not yet been threatened . As already noted in ORG interlocutory decision of DATE , the present case concerns extremely serious crimes , the [ attempted murder ] having been committed so as to evade recognition and arrest by the police , the perpetrators having been prepared to sacrifice a number of human lives . In these circumstances , the risk run by the witnesses identified only by a number and their families if their anonymity is lifted or insufficiently guaranteed is decisive . In so far as anonymous witnesses have refused to answer questions this was done in order not to disclose methods of investigation or to maintain the anonymity of other investigating officers involved in the case . \"", "ORG considered the statements of the anonymous police officers to be corroborated by each other and by the evidence available from non - anonymous sources .
