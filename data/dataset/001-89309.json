CARDINAL , such that the judge had to consider whether PERSON had suffered discrimination contrary to the provisions of LAW . He held that residence , applied as a criterion for the differential treatment of citizens , was a ground within the scope of LAW ; like domicile and nationality , it was an aspect of personal status . This was not contested by the Secretary of ORG . PERSON went on , however , to dismiss the claim following the reasoning of ORG in JW and ORG v GPE ( no . CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , Decisions and Reports ( GPE ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) and Corner v GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , unpublished ) , holding that the applicant was not in a comparable position to pensioners in countries attracting up - rating . The differing economic conditions in each country , including local social security provision and taxation , made it impossible simply to compare the amount in sterling received by pensioners .", "CARDINAL . PERSON found that , in the alternative , even if the applicant could claim to be in an analogous position to a pensioner in GPE or a country where up - rating was paid subject to a bi - lateral agreement , the difference in treatment could be justified . He considered that the Government had a considerable margin of appreciation , that there was a lack of consistency in ORG practice , and that the limitation had been publicised for some time . He declined to accept that the payment of an up - rated pension in CARDINAL country ( or several ) meant that there was an obligation under LAW to pay up - rated pensions to all pensioners living abroad . He found that the illogicality in the scope of bilateral agreements reflected their political nature , the relative complexity of the issue , and historical factors . He therefore concluded that the \u201c remedy of the expatriate GPE pensioners who do not receive up - rated pensions is political , not judicial . The decision to pay them up - rated pensions must be made by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG , which dismissed her appeal on DATE ( R ( Carson and PERSON ) v Secretary of ORG for Work and Pensions [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . For similar reasons to ORG , ORG Justice PERSON , Laws and PERSON ) found that , since LAW No . CARDINAL conferred no right to acquire property , the failure to up - rate PERSON pension gave rise to no violation of that provision .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint under LAW in conjunction with LAW , ORG noted that the Secretary of ORG accepted that place of residence constituted a \u201c status \u201d for the purposes of the LAW . However , it found that the applicant was in a materially different position to those she contended were her comparators . In this connection it was significant that the legislative scheme was entirely geared toward the impact of price inflation in GPE , such that it would be \u201c inescapable that [ an annual up - rate ] being awarded across the board to all ... pensioners [ in PERSON position ] would have random effects . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered , in the alternative , the question of justification and found that the \u201c true \u201d justification of the refusal to pay the up - rate was that PERSON and those in her position \u201c had chosen to live in societies , more pointedly economies , outside GPE where the specific rationale for the uplift may by no means necessarily apply . \u201d ORG thus considered the decision to be objectively justified without reference to what they accepted would be the \u201c daunting cost \u201d of extending the up - rate to those in PERSON position . Moreover , the cost implications were \u201c in the context of this case a legitimate factor going in justification for the Secretary of ORG 's position , \u201d because to accept PERSON arguments would be to lead to a judicial interference in the political decision as to the deployment of public funds which was not mandated by LAW DATE , the jurisprudence of this ORG or by a \u201c legal imperative \u201d which was sufficiently pressing to justify confining and circumscribing the elected Government 's macro - economic policies .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG , relying on LAW read together with LAW . Her appeal was dismissed on DATE by a majority of CARDINAL ( R ( Carson and PERSON ) v. NORP Secretary of ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The majority ( Lords PERSON of GPE , PERSON , PERSON of PERSON and PERSON of Gestinghope ) accepted that a retirement pension fell within the scope of LAW No . CARDINAL and that LAW was thus applicable . They further assumed that a place of residence was a personal characteristic and amounted to \u201c any other status \u201d within the meaning of LAW , and was thus a prohibited ground of discrimination . However , because a person could choose where to live , less weighty grounds were required to justify a difference of treatment based on residence than one based on an inherent personal characteristic , such as race or sex .", "CARDINAL . The majority observed that in certain cases it was artificial to treat separately the questions , first , whether an individual complaining of discrimination was in an analogous position to a person treated more favourably and , secondly , whether the difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified . In the present case , the applicant was not in an analogous , or comparable position , to a pensioner resident in GPE or resident in a country with a bilateral agreement with GPE . GPE pension was CARDINAL element in an interconnected system of taxation and social security benefits , designed to provide a basic standard of living for the inhabitants of GPE . It was funded partly from ORG of those currently in employment and their employers , and partly out of general taxation . The pension was not means tested , but pensioners with a high income from other sources paid some of it back to the ORG in income tax . Those with low incomes might receive other benefits , such as income support . The provision for index - linking was intended to preserve the value of the pension in the light of economic conditions , such as the cost of living and the rate of inflation , within GPE . Quite different economic conditions applied in other countries : for example , in GPE , where PERSON lived , although there was virtually no social security , the cost of living was much lower , and the value of the rand had dropped in DATE compared to sterling .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , who gave one of the majority opinions , put the arguments as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The denial of a social security benefit to PERSON on the ground that she lives abroad can not possibly be equated with discrimination on grounds of race or sex . It is not a denial of respect for her as an individual . She was under no obligation to move to GPE . She did so voluntarily and no doubt for good reasons . But in doing so , she put herself outside the primary scope and purpose of the GPE social security system . Social security benefits are part of an intricate and interlocking system of social welfare which exists to ensure certain minimum standards of living for the people of this country . They are an expression of what has been called social solidarity or fraternit\u00e9 ; the duty of any community to help those of its members who are in need . But that duty is generally recognised to be national in character . It does not extend to the inhabitants of foreign countries . That is recognised in treaties such as ORG ( Minimum Standards ) Convention DATE ( article CARDINAL ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , who appeared for PERSON , accepted the force of this argument . He agreed in reply that she could have no complaint if GPE had rigorously applied the principle that GPE social security is for GPE residents and paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad . And he makes no complaint about the fact that she is not entitled to other social security benefits like jobseeker 's allowance and income support . But he said that it was irrational to recognise that she had an entitlement to a pension by virtue of her contributions to ORG and then not to pay her the same pension as GPE residents who had made the same contributions .", "CARDINAL . The one feature upon which PERSON seizes as the basis of her claim to equal treatment ( but only in respect of a pension ) is that she has paid the same national insurance contributions . That is really the long and the short of her case . In my opinion , however , concentration on this single feature is an over - simplification of the comparison . The situation of the beneficiaries of GPE social security is , to quote ORG in PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL , ' characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations of which it would be artificial to isolate CARDINAL specific aspect ' .", "CARDINAL . In effect PERSON argument is that because contributions are a necessary condition for the retirement pension paid to GPE residents , they ought to be a sufficient condition . No other matters , like whether one lives in GPE and participates in the rest of its arrangements for taxation and social security , ought to be taken into account . But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy . National insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions , comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme . In fact the link is a rather tenuous one . National insurance contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and ORG ( the rest comes from ordinary taxation ) . If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit , PERSON should be entitled to all contributory benefits , like maternity benefit and job - seekers allowance . But she does not suggest that she is .", "CARDINAL . The interlocking nature of the system makes it impossible to extract CARDINAL element for special treatment . The main reason for the provision of state pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money . They are not means - tested , but that is only because means - testing is expensive and discourages take - up of the benefit even by people who need it . So state pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not . On the other hand , they are subject to tax . So the state will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension . On the other hand , those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support , a non - contributory benefit . So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support .", "CARDINAL . None of these interlocking features can be applied to a non - resident such as PERSON . She pays no GPE income tax , so the state would not be able to recover anything even if she had substantial additional income . ( Of course I do not suggest that this is the case ; I have no idea what other income she has , but there will be expatriate pensioners who do have other income ) . Likewise , if she were destitute , there would be no saving in income support . On the contrary , the pension would go to reduce the social security benefits ( if any ) to which she is entitled in her new country .", "ORG and private pensions", "CARDINAL . It is , I suppose , the words ' insurance ' and ' contributions ' which suggest an analogy with a private pension scheme . But , from the point of view of the citizens who contribute , national insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund . The difference is only a matter of public accounting . And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions , there is no particular reason why they should be . In fact ( mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary ) there are proposals for change . Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non - contributory ' citizen 's pension ' payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age . But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of national insurance contributions to fund the citizen 's pension like all the other non - contributory benefits . On PERSON argument , however , a change to a non - contributory pension would make all the difference . Once the retirement pension was non - contributory , the foundation of her argument that she had ' earned ' the right to equal treatment would disappear . But she would have paid exactly the same national insurance contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much ( or as little ) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have DATE .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons it seems to me that the position of a non - resident is materially and relevantly different from that of a GPE resident . I do not think , with all respect to my noble and learned friend , Lord PERSON , that the reasons are subtle and arcane . They are practical and fair . Furthermore , I think that this is very much a case in which ORG is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment . It can not be the law that GPE is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home . Once it is accepted that the position of PERSON is relevantly different from that of a GPE resident and that she therefore can not claim equality of treatment , the amount ( if any ) which she receives must be a matter for ORG . It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she can not claim to be treated equally . And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid , ORG must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds . To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the DATE increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense : every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else .", "CARDINAL . I think it is unfortunate that the argument for the Secretary of ORG placed such emphasis upon such matters as the variations in rates of inflation in various countries which made it inappropriate to apply the same increase to pensioners resident abroad . It is unnecessary for the Secretary of ORG to try to justify the sums paid with such nice calculations . It distracts attention from the main argument . Once it is conceded , as PERSON accepts , that people resident outside the GPE are relevantly different and could be denied any pension at all , ORG does not have to justify to the courts the reasons why they are paid CARDINAL sum rather than another . Generosity does not have to have a logical explanation . It is enough for the Secretary of ORG to say that , all things considered , ORG considered the present system of payments to be a fair allocation of available resources .", "CARDINAL . The comparison with residents in treaty countries seems to me to fail for similar reasons . PERSON was able to point to government statements to the effect that there was no logical scheme in the arrangements with treaty countries . They represented whatever the GPE had from time to time been able to negotiate without placing itself at an undue economic disadvantage . But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment . The situation of a GPE expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not . The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of GPE nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable , or at least not unduly burdensome . It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country ( for example , as it has with the ORG countries ) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , dissenting , found that PERSON could properly be compared to other contributing pensioners living in GPE or other countries where their pensions were up - rated . He continued :", "\u201c How persons spend their income and where they do so are matters for their own choice . Some may choose to live in a country where the cost of living is low or the exchange rate favourable , a course not uncommon in previous generations , which may or may not carry with it disadvantages , but that is a matter for their personal choice . The common factor for purposes of comparison is that all of the pensioners , in whichever country they may reside , have duly paid the contributions required to qualify for their pensions . If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others , that in my opinion constitutes discrimination for the purposes of LAW", "Lord PERSON therefore considered that the appeal turned on the question of justification . He accepted that the courts should be slow to intervene in questions of macro - economic policy . He further accepted that , had the Government put forward sufficient reasons of economic or ORG policy to justify the difference in treatment , he should have been properly ready to yield to its decision - making power in those fields . However , in the present case the difference in treatment was not justified : as ORG itself accepted , the reason all pensions were not up - rated was simply to save money , and it was not fair to target the applicant and others in her position .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , GPE pension is a contributory benefit payable from pensionable age to an individual who , for a requisite number of DATE during his or her \u201c working life \u201d , has paid or been credited with contributions to ORG ( see ORG DATE : \u201c the DATE LAW ) . ORG , payable by earners , employers and others under LAW , together with taxation , provide funds for the payment of a number of benefits , including the state retirement pension , job - seekers ' allowance , incapacity benefit , maternity allowance and survivors ' benefits .

Reciprocal agreements are not entered into solely to allow for payment of DATE up - rating increases to recipients of GPE pensions resident abroad . Cover under reciprocal agreements varies .
