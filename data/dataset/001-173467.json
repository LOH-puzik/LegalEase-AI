The first applicant , who worked in a nearby flower shop , came to the scene and found the second applicant lying on the floor , covered in blood .", "CARDINAL . An on - site inspection of the crime scene was carried out on TIME by the military police and it was videotaped . The report drawn up by them indicates that ORG was dressed in civilian clothes .

The second applicant sought damages in connection with the life - threatening injuries he had sustained in the incident of DATE , while the first applicant sought damages on account of the stress and fear she had suffered because of the event in question . The applicants argued that ORG had been on duty at the time when he had exploded the grenade , that he had been dressed in his military uniform and that his mother had obtained a survivor \u2019s pension after his death under a decision which stated that he had died on duty ( specifically , \u201c at work \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings it was established that the second applicant had sustained numerous injuries to his head , face , chest , belly and lower extremities and that he was suffering from permanent consequences , such as frequent headaches , pain throughout his body , impaired hearing , double vision , fatigue and incapacity for work .", "CARDINAL . Their claim was allowed on DATE . That judgment was quashed by ORG on DATE . The first - instance court again allowed the claim on DATE . However , on DATE ORG , after an appeal lodged by the defendant , overturned the judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . The relevant part of that judgment reads :", "\u201c The first - instance court established the following :", "- ORG was a member of the NORP army \u2013 a military serviceman ;", "- ORG used an GPE grenade , which served a military purpose and was registered for [ use by ] the members of the NORP army ;", "- the decision of CARDINAL DATE ... issued by ORG stated that the mother of ORG , who had been a NORP Homeland War veteran , obtained the right to a survivor \u2019s pension because [ ORG ] had been [ serving in the ] military when he had caused the damage , and the reasoning of that decision stated that he had died because of an injury sustained at work ;", "- ORG had not been on duty .", "On the basis of the thus - established facts the first - instance court concluded that the defendant was liable because the said decision of ORG stated that the death of [ ORG ] , as an active military serviceman , had occurred while [ he had been ] carrying out his official duties ...", "The first - instance court also concluded that there had been a failure on the part of the defendant [ to carry out a weapons ] check under section CARDINAL of the Instruction on the Allocation , Distribution , Carrying and Use of Official Short Weapons . Had the correct check ( for which the military police were responsible under section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned Instruction ) [ been exercised in respect of ] the carrying of weapons DATE namely the grenade [ held by ORG ] without a proper licence or an identity document , DATE and the grenade been taken [ from ORG ] , the damage most likely would not have occurred .", "However , this court considers that these facts , as established [ by the first - instance court ] , do not serve as a sufficient basis for concluding that the requirements for the defendant to be held liable for the concrete damage have been met .", "First of all , ORG \u2019s GPE right to obtain a survivor \u2019s pension on the basis of a decision of ORG is not decisive for the defendant \u2019s liability for damage since the right to a survivor \u2019s pension was obtained on the basis of ORG \u2019s status as a NORP Homeland War DATE that is to say an insured military person . The fact that the reasoning of that decision ... states that the \u2018 insured party \u2019s death occurred because of an injury sustained at work\u2019 is not relevant for an assessment of the defendant \u2019s liability in these civil proceedings .", "An assessment of the facts shows that ORG was not on duty on the critical evening ; that the GPE grenade was not given to him by his military unit ( [ according to ] a letter from ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) ; that the record of the on - site inspection carried out on DATE of [ ORG \u2019s ] death does not show that FAC was wearing a uniform ; and that nothing proved that the grenade in question was the property of the defendant ( that ORG had unlawfully obtained the grenade from the defendant ) , regardless of the fact that such a grenade serves a military purpose and is registered for [ use by ] members of the NORP army ; [ therefore , ] this court finds that the conclusion of the first - instance court regarding ... the liability of the defendant is not correct .", "Lastly , this court considers ... in respect of the failure of the defendant to carry out a check on the carrying of weapons and to seize [ weapons ] where there is no licence [ to carry them ] , as the basis of the defendant \u2019s liability , that there is no proof ... that the military police had a duty to carry out a check in the pizza parlour in question on the critical TIME or that the competent authorities knew that ORG possessed a grenade and failed to seize it from him . Therefore , this court finds that the requirements for the defendant \u2019s liability are not met ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
