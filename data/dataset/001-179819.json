The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband asked the national authorities to restore his property rights to a house and a plot of land in GPE which had belonged to his grandfather before nationalisation . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband specified his initial request and asked to have the plot of land restored in natura to him if possible , or to provide him with another plot of land in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The property rights of the applicant \u2019s husband were restored to some LOC ( a storehouse ) in GPE in DATE and it was decided to pay him monetary compensation for the other premises that had not been returned to him in natura .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed GPE that the property rights of the applicant \u2019s husband would be restored to QUANTITY of land for residential purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE informed ORG that a plot of land of CARDINAL.CARDINAL hectares had been formed near the buildings owned by the applicant \u2019s husband .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE City ORG established as a legal fact that the grandmother of the applicant \u2019s husband had owned a plot of land in GPE measuring QUANTITY \u201d ( sieksnis \u2013 QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed GPE that the property rights of the applicant \u2019s husband would be restored and that he was a candidate to receive a plot of land measuring QUANTITY in natura . In DATE ORG issued a document stating that the applicant \u2019s husband had a right to a plot of land of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the authorities replied to the applicant husband \u2019s letter asking why only a plot of land of QUANTITY instead of QUANTITY had been formed near the house , and stated that the plot of land QUANTITY where the LOC had been situated , would be divided for several co - owners of the LOC and the rest of the land would be returned to the applicant \u2019s husband by the means he chose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband died and the applicant became his heir .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son , as the representative of the applicant , asked the authorities to restore the property rights of his father to the plot of land of CARDINAL hectares by paying compensation in securities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the property rights of the applicant \u2019s husband were restored in natura to QUANTITY of land and it was provided that compensation of MONEY ( ORG ) would be paid in securities for the remaining QUANTITY of land . On DATE this decision was changed and it was decided to restore the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s property rights to a plot of land of QUANTITY in natura and to pay compensation in securities for the plot of land of QUANTITY , amounting to approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , claiming that the compensation in securities , established by the national authorities , was unjust , and asking to have the value of the plot of land measuring CARDINAL hectares recalculated . In DATE the applicant applied to have the administrative proceedings suspended and to have the matter of calculation of compensation referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that ORG had calculated the compensation in accordance with the methodology approved by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , the calculation of the municipality provided that the market value of the plot was approximately EUR CARDINAL and the market value of the plot as calculated by ORG was approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The court stated that in comparison with these numbers , the value of the plot of land provided by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was CARDINAL times lower , and it could not conform to the principle of equal value . Moreover , in accordance with the methodology approved by the Government , the calculation was the same for plots of land in the city centre and outside the city . The court thus decided to suspend the administrative proceedings and to refer the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG informed the applicant that the relevant laws had been changed and that she could change the form of restoration of the property rights to QUANTITY of land . Instead of securities she could choose CARDINAL of the following : to be assigned a new plot of land of equivalent value to the one held previously ; to have the liabilities to the ORG legally voided ; to be assigned a new plot of land for individual construction ; to receive monetary compensation . It appears that the applicant did not reply to this letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was included on the list of persons to receive a plot of land for construction of an individual house .", "CARDINAL . After the matter had been resolved by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE . The court analysed the domestic regulation regarding the calculation of the value of the land and observed that this matter had been referred to ORG , which held that the methodology approved by the Government setting down the principles of calculation of the value of the land was in accordance with the law . ORG also held that the PERSON on the Restoration of Citizens\u2019 Ownership Rights to Existing Real Property had been changed and persons could , before DATE , choose other means to restore their property rights than by payment of securities . If no other means were chosen , the property rights had to be restored by paying monetary compensation . The court further observed that the authorities had suggested the applicant choose other means to have her property rights restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that in DATE it had been decided to include the applicant on the list of persons to receive a plot of land for construction of an individual house . The decision the applicant complained of , that is to say the calculation of the compensation to be paid in securities , had not been of legal importance to the applicant because the Law on the Restoration of Citizens\u2019 Ownership Rights to Existing Real Property had been changed and it had become impossible to restore the property rights in securities . The decision to restore the applicant \u2019s property rights by paying her compensation in securities had to be changed to monetary compensation . Because the applicant had been included on the list of persons to receive a new plot of land for individual construction , she could use another way to restore her property rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision . The court also emphasised the argument of ORG that , in calculating the compensation , it was justified to pay heed not only to the market value of the property but also to its value at the time of nationalisation and to the changes in the quality and the value of property . ORG also held that the applicant had complained about the length of the court proceedings . The court held that the applicant had lodged the complaint on DATE ; it had been accepted by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG had decided to apply to ORG , which had adopted its decision on DATE . The proceedings in the administrative case had recommenced on DATE and the decision had been adopted on DATE . Given the complexity of the case and referral of the matter to ORG , the length of proceedings had not breached the reasonable time requirement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s son , as the applicant \u2019s representative , that on DATE it had become possible to restore the property rights by receiving a plot of forest of equal value . The applicant was asked to express her wish before DATE . It appears that she never replied to this letter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
