The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally indicted by the GPE municipal prosecutor for having , DATE and DATE , repeatedly physically and mentally abused his wife while he was drunk . He was accused of having subjected her to verbal abuse , hit her on the head with his hand and fist , slapped her , held her by the throat , tried to strangle her , thrown her against the furniture or onto the ground , pushed her down stairs and kicked her . He was further accused of having hit the children , gambled away the household \u2019s money on gaming machines and smashed the crockery . As a result , his wife had sustained haematomas , bruising and a fractured nose and had been obliged to seek medical assistance on that account on DATE , DATE and DATE , following assaults committed on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The applicant had allegedly sought to undermine his wife psychologically in order to control her . According to the prosecutor , the applicant had thus committed the \u201c continuing \u201d criminal offence ( trvaj\u00edc\u00ed trestn\u00fd \u010din ) of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article CARDINALa \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL(b ) of LAW , given that his conduct prior to the introduction of that offence on DATE had amounted to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article CARDINALa of the Criminal Code and assault occasioning bodily harm under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof , committed DATE and DATE , as described in the bill of indictment , which also referred to the fact that the abuse had occurred repeatedly . It sentenced him to a suspended term of DATE years\u2019 imprisonment and placed him on probation for DATE . The applicant was also placed under supervision and ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol dependency . The court based its decision on the statements given by the applicant , the victim ( his wife ) and several witnesses , including the couple \u2019s CARDINAL children DATE who reported , among other incidents , CARDINAL instances of the applicant verbally insulting his wife , CARDINAL instances of the applicant grabbing his wife by the arms and strangling her , and verbal and/or physical assaults committed by the applicant on his wife at DATE intervals DATE and on documentary evidence and expert reports . It also took into account the fact that the applicant had confessed to quarrels and physical violence in his relationship with his wife ; he admitted in particular that he had sometimes slapped his wife or hit her with his fist .", "The court adopted the classification of the offence as abuse of a person living under the same roof within the meaning of LAW and CARDINAL(b ) of LAW as in force since DATE , taking the view that this classification also extended to the acts committed by the applicant prior to that date since they had been punishable at the material time and amounted at least to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article CARDINALa of the Criminal Code . Lastly , the court considered that , owing to the duration of the conduct in question , the offence committed in the present case presented a relatively high degree of danger which justified a sentence ranging from DATE imprisonment under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINALa of LAW . Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances ( in particular the fact that the applicant had confessed and that he had no previous convictions ) , it imposed a suspended sentence situated at the lower end of the range .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant in which he contested the facts as established by ORG and the unilateral assessment of the evidence . ORG found no defects in the previous proceedings and considered that the classification of the applicant \u2019s conduct was in conformity with the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as manifestly illfounded an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant in which he complained that the trial court had applied LAW even to his conduct prior to DATE , when the offence of abuse had not yet existed in domestic law . On this point ORG noted , referring to its ruling PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , that where there was , as in the case at hand , a \u201c continuation of the criminal offence \u201d ( pokra\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed v trestn\u00e9m \u010dinu ) , which was considered to constitute a single act , its classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence . That law therefore also applied to the earlier acts , provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law . In the instant case ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s conduct prior to the amendment of LAW on DATE had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article PERSON or Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . After having examined the file it also concluded that the accused \u2019s actions as described in the operative part of the first - instance court judgment disclosed all the legal elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of LAW and CARDINAL(b ) of LAW . Concerning the continuation of the offence , ORG noted that the abuse itself amounted to ill - treatment characterised by a certain duration . For the offence to be regarded as having continued over a long period of time it had to have lasted for DATE . As the applicant had perpetrated the offence in question DATE until DATE , that is , over a period of DATE , his conduct certainly disclosed the material element of continuation of the offence of abuse under LAW ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as manifestly ill - founded a constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant in which he complained that the proceedings had been unfair and that LAW had been applied retroactively , to his detriment . Referring to the ruling of ORG and to its relevant case - law , ORG held that the decisions given by the courts in the present case had been logical and coherent and had not had any retroactive effect prohibited by LAW .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant committed another offence while on probation and did not undergo any treatment for his alcohol dependency , he was required to serve the prison sentence imposed by the judgment of DATE . He began serving his prison sentence on DATE . According to the Government , he was granted conditional release on CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
