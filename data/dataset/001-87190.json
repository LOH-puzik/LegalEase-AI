The second applicant , Mr ORG Wenger , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The second applicant is Professor of Economics at ORG . He is a founding member of ORG Verein zur F\u00f6rderung der PERSON ) which is committed to protecting the rights of minority shareholders in joint stock companies . The first applicant worked as a student assistant for his department .", "On DATE the first applicant , represented by ORG , a scientific assistant to the second applicant , bought CARDINAL shares in the M. company . DATE and DATE the second applicant bought CARDINAL shares in that same company . They paid MONEY ( ORG ) per share .", "On DATE the management of the B. company , which was to take over the M. company , offered to pay ordinary shareholders of the M. company an indemnity of DEM CARDINAL per share in order to avoid actions instituted by them . The first applicant accepted that offer and made a profit amounting to CARDINAL . The second applicant accepted the offer for part of his shares .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant under LAW and LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) to search the first applicant \u2019s home in GPE ( her principal residence ) , her parent \u2019s home in GPE ( her secondary residence ) and herself . It further issued another warrant to search the second applicant \u2019s home in GPE , his office at ORG and himself . Both applicants were suspected of prohibited insider trading .", "ORG ordered the search and seizure of all documents and electronic storage media concerning the purchase of shares in the PERSON company DATE and DATE . In the second applicant \u2019s case , it further ordered the search and seizure of documents concerning telephone conversations with members of the B. company , and in the first applicant \u2019s case documents concerning information given to her either by the second applicant or by his scientific assistant A. in respect of the purchase of the shares .", "ORG observed that in a ORG meeting on ORG CARDINAL DATE the M. company decided to merge with a company affiliated to the B. company . ORG , which was founded by the second applicant and was represented during the meeting by his scientific assistant PERSON , objected to the decision and threatened to institute proceedings in court to set it aside , as no offer for a takeover of ordinary shares ( as opposed to preference shares ) was to be made to the shareholders of the M. company . Following negotiations with the holding company B. , the latter publicly announced on CARDINAL DATE a takeover offer of DEM CARDINAL per share also to those holding ordinary shares in the M. company .", "ORG found that both the fact that negotiations were being conducted concerning a takeover offer and the content of those negotiations were insider information which was likely to lead to a higher stock rate when made public . The first applicant , who had not previously held any stocks in the PERSON company , had bought CARDINAL shares in that company on CARDINAL DATE . As she had been a scientific assistant to the second applicant , there was a suspicion that this insider information had been disclosed to her either by the second applicant or by A. , with whom she had been working in another company , and that she had used that information when buying the shares in the PERSON company . The second applicant , who had not previously held any shares in the PERSON company , had bought a total of CARDINAL shares DATE and DATE . As he had spoken to the managing directors of the B. company on the telephone during that period , there was a suspicion that he had obtained knowledge of the planned offer to shareholders and had used that information when buying shares in the M. company .", "The search warrants were subsequently executed . The first applicant \u2019s home in GPE was searched in her presence , and her GPE home was broken into and searched in their absence and a number of objects and documents seized . The police also searched the second applicant \u2019s office and his home , the latter in the presence of his then DATE father with whom he was living , and seized several documents and his laptop .", "On DATE the second and the first applicant respectively lodged an appeal against the search warrant and the seizures with ORG . They claimed that these measures had been unlawful . They had not had knowledge of the takeover offer made to ordinary shareholders in the LOC company before that offer had been made public . This had already been confirmed by the B. company on the request of ORG for ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr den ORG ) prior to the issuing of the search warrants .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first and second ORG appeal against the search and seizure orders as ill - founded . It found that ORG had rightly considered that there had been a suspicion of prohibited insider trading and had sufficiently specified the persons and rooms to be searched and the evidence to be searched for . The orders had not been disproportionate . Search and seizure had been appropriate and necessary measures . Awaiting the collection of further evidence , such as witness testimonies , would have entailed the risk that the evidence searched for could no longer be secured ; nor had issuing a search warrant against the first applicant been disproportionate , as the criminal investigations concerned a wider serious offence and had been instituted against several suspects who could have colluded , which made it necessary to coordinate the investigation measures taken . ORG further found that the seizure of the objects and documents in question had been lawful as they were possibly relevant for the criminal proceedings .", "On DATE the first and the second applicant each lodged a complaint with ORG against the decisions taken by LOC and ORG . Relying notably on LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , they complained about the searches and seizures , which they considered to breach their right to respect for their home and to be arbitrary .", "In CARDINAL decisions adopted on DATE ORG declined to consider the first applicant \u2019s ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and the second applicant \u2019s ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) constitutional complaints as they were ill - founded .", "ORG found that the criminal courts had not breached the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home as protected by LAW . The criminal courts\u2019 finding that there had been a suspicion of prohibited insider trading had not been arbitrary . After the ORG meeting on DATE it had not been certain whether or not a takeover offer would be made to ordinary shareholders . Nonetheless , the applicants had bought shares in the LOC company after this meeting and shortly before the public announcement of the takeover offer . The first applicant had bought the shares in cooperation with an assistant of the second applicant . In his capacity as a member of ORG , the second applicant had voiced his support for a takeover offer to be made to the ordinary shareholders as well and had been in contact by telephone with the management of the companies concerned .", "ORG further found that it had not been arbitrary for the criminal courts to consider the searches as proportionate . The evidence to be searched for in accordance with the warrants was suitable to establish the circumstances in which the shares had been bought . The possibility that evidence proving knowledge of insider information would be found could not be excluded . Having regard to comparable cases , it had also not been arbitrary to consider the search ordered against the first applicant as proportionate despite the fact that she had CARDINAL shares . The possible damage caused amounted to CARDINAL and there had been a suspicion against several persons who could have colluded .", "The decisions were served on the applicants on DATE . They are at issue in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL lodged with this ORG by the first applicant and application no . DATE brought by the second applicant .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation proceedings against the applicants . It found that the evidence collected was insufficient to secure their conviction of insider trading .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant under LAW and LAW for the search of the second applicant \u2019s home and cars in GPE , of his office at ORG and of himself on suspicion of prohibited insider trading . It ordered the search and seizure of all documents and electronic storage media concerning the purchase and sale of shares in the A. company by the second applicant and further co - defendants in DATE .", "ORG found that the A. company had informed its shareholders on DATE that the PERSON limited liability company wanted to take over the shares of the minority shareholders of the A. company and was offering them an indemnity of some ORG CARDINAL per share . On DATE an increased offer of an indemnity of ORG CARDINAL per share was made public . The second applicant had purchased CARDINAL shares of the A. company for some ORG CARDINAL on DATE . He was suspected of having obtained knowledge of the A.B. company \u2019s intention to offer an indemnity in the higher amount from a third person ( S. ) , who had negotiated with him with a view to obtaining his agreement to sell the shares he already had , and to have used that knowledge when purchasing the shares on CARDINAL DATE . His profit amounted to some ORG CARDINAL .", "The search warrant was executed on DATE , at the same time as warrants that had been issued against several other persons . No suspicious objects or documents were found or seized .", "On DATE the second applicant appealed against the search warrant . He claimed that there had not been a reasonable suspicion of insider trading against him at the time the warrant had been issued , as PERSON had already told the investigation authorities that he had not informed him of the planned increased offer of an indemnity . He had bought the shares as he had previously received the public report of the A. company concerning the planned takeover of the shares of the minority shareholders and thus considered the purchase of shares to yield profits .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal against the search warrant as ill - founded . Referring to the exhaustive report and the documents submitted by ORG for ORG ( Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienst - leistungsaufsicht ) to ORG , it found that there had been a sufficient factual basis for a suspicion of insider trading when ORG issued the search warrant . In particular , the fact that PERSON had proposed to others to persuade the second applicant to accept an offer of indemnity and that the latter had bought further shares DATE before the higher offer of indemnity was made public was sufficient to ground the suspicion of insider trading . Moreover , the documents to be seized had been described in sufficient detail in the search warrant . In view of the gravity of the offence the second applicant was suspected of , the search order had also not been disproportionate . The decision was served on the second applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the second applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained about the renewed search and argued that this measure had violated his right to respect for his home and had been arbitrary .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the second applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the second applicant had failed sufficiently to substantiate his complaint , which was therefore inadmissible . It argued that the second applicant had not informed the court of the contents of the report drawn up by ORG for ORG to which the criminal courts had referred in their decisions ordering the search . He should have done so as he had contested that there had been a sufficient suspicion of insider trading . Apart from this , the second applicant had also informed the court only selectively about the evidence on which the criminal courts had founded their suspicion against him . ORG was thus not in a position to review the criminal courts\u2019 assessment . Moreover , the second applicant had failed to explain why it should have been obvious to the criminal courts that he could have had knowledge of the facts relevant for the trend in the share price from other sources . He does not appear to have informed the criminal courts that he had received the report of the A. company . In view of this , it could be left open whether the decisions of the criminal courts had violated the second applicant \u2019s fundamental rights .", "The decision was served on the second applicant on DATE . It is at issue in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL lodged by him with this ORG .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation proceedings against the second applicant . It found that , even though it was likely that the second applicant had been informed of the increased takeover offer which was to be made either by PERSON or by one of his co - defendants and had bought the shares by using that knowledge , the investigations , including the search of the second applicant \u2019s home , had not yielded any evidence to prove that he was guilty of insider trading .", "On DATE ORG issued a further warrant to search the home , cars and person of the first applicant and of PERSON , both qualified as witnesses , on suspicion of prohibited insider trading by the second applicant and others in respect of shares in the A. company .", "The search order was executed on DATE without any evidence being found .", "On DATE ORG granted an appeal by PERSON against the search warrant issued against him . It found that the warrant had been unlawful as the searches conducted on DATE of , inter alia , the second applicant \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s homes had not produced any results confirming the suspicion against them . Moreover , PERSON , heard as a witness on DATE , had denied having informed the second applicant of the intention to offer minority shareholders a higher indemnity . It was therefore unclear which relevant evidence should have been found when searching PERSON \u2019s home after that date . On the contrary , on DATE ORG dismissed as ill - founded the appeal lodged by the first applicant against the search warrant issued against her .", "On DATE ORG , allowing the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , quashed the decisions of LOC . It found that these decisions violated the first applicant \u2019s right to respect for her home . The search warrant issued by ORG was not sufficiently reasoned in that it did not explain why evidence against the suspects could be found in her home . Moreover , the search warrant against the first applicant , who was not suspected of an offence , was disproportionate as , at the time the warrant was issued , there was no longer a strong suspicion against the suspects and it was not likely that evidence would be found in the first applicant \u2019s home .", "LAW stipulates that the home is inviolable . In accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , searches may be authorized only by a judge or , when time is of the essence , by other authorities designated by law , and may be carried out only in the manner prescribed therein .", "LAW , on searches in respect of the suspect , provides that a search of the home and other LOC and of the person and the belongings of the suspect of a criminal offence may be made for the purpose of his apprehension or if it may be presumed that the search will lead to the discovery of evidence .", "Pursuant to LAW , searches may only be ordered by a judge or , in case of urgency ( Gefahr i m Verzug ) , also by the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the officials assisting it .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) insiders shall be prohibited from taking advantage of their knowledge of insider information to acquire or dispose of insider securities for their own account or for the account or on behalf of a third party . Likewise , a third party who has knowledge of inside information shall be prohibited from taking advantage of that knowledge to acquire or dispose of insider securities for his own account or for the account or on behalf of others ( section QUANTITY ) of LAW ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , any person who acquires or disposes of an insider security in contravention of a prohibition under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) or CARDINAL ) shall be liable to up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment or to a fine ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
