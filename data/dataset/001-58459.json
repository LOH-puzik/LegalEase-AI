On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , sitting with CARDINAL professional and CARDINAL lay judges ( ORG ) , having held an oral hearing in the presence of ORG , the applicant and his official defence counsel , ordered that the applicant be detained in an institution for mentally ill offenders ( GPE geistig abnorme PERSON ) , pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . ORG found that the applicant had intimidated numerous persons by threats of murder , but that he could not be held responsible because he was suffering from a mental illness . The applicant had , in several letters addressed to judicial authorities and lawyers , respectively , stated his intention to murder particular judges and lawyers , mentioning also either his \" list of death \" or details of the threatened offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision , ORG noted that the applicant had CARDINAL previous convictions , inter alia , of intimidation , coercion , bodily injury and property offences . The offences at issue in the pending proceedings had started in the context of civil proceedings , which had been instituted by ORG ( GPE ) , claiming compensation for damages of NORP schillings ( ORG ) CARDINAL caused by the applicant in the context of a burglary . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) had decided against the applicant . The applicant had filed counter - claims for compensation in respect of an illness suffered while serving a prison sentence and had threatened terrorist attacks . Following the institution of criminal proceedings against him concerning this threat , the applicant addressed written threats of murder to various persons involved in these criminal proceedings , in particular to judges and lawyers .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , having heard CARDINAL psychiatric experts , ORG considered that the applicant suffered from a mental illness , namely paranoia querulans . He had a system of fixed ideas and a missionary devotion to the implementation of his plans . His mental disturbances , combined with the further symptoms of aggressiveness , his cruelty and recklessness , entailed a high risk for third persons . ORG regarded a faculty opinion on these matters as unnecessary , taking into account that the CARDINAL experts largely concurred in their opinions and that there were no contradictions or shortcomings , within the meaning of the relevant provision of LAW ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG considered that it had not been required to hear the judges and other victims concerned , as requested by the applicant . In this respect , ORG observed that the question of whether these persons had in fact been intimidated was irrelevant for legal reasons , the offence of intimidation being committed in case of threats of such a nature as to intimidate third persons in general , if the offender intended to intimidate . ORG , having regard to the details stated in the applicant 's various letters , found that his threats of murder were of such a nature as to intimidate third persons in general , and he had in fact intended to intimidate the persons concerned . Considering his mental illness , there was also a risk of further offences of the same kind .", "CARDINAL . The written judgment was served upon the applicant 's official defence counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG held the hearing on the plea of nullity and the appeal in the absence of the applicant , who was represented by his official defence counsel . ORG rejected the plea of nullity as well as the appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its judgment , found that the rejection by the trial court of the applicant 's requests for the taking of evidence did not impair the rights of the defence . In particular , ORG confirmed the reasoning of the trial court that the applicant had failed to show any contradictions or shortcomings in the expert opinions which would be the only reason to justify a faculty opinion . Moreover , the question of whether the victims had in fact been intimidated had been irrelevant . ORG also confirmed the legal qualification of the offences committed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG proceeded of its own motion to an examination of the applicant \u2019s appeal . While noting that the applicant had not submitted any grounds of appeal , it examined the arguments challenging the trial court \u2019s findings as to his dangerousness in the future , which he had submitted in his plea of nullity .

A first instance court judgment given by ORG , sitting with lay judges , can be challenged by a plea of nullity to ORG on the specific grounds enumerated in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . ORG task is mainly to control the correct application of the criminal law , but in so doing it is - as a general rule - bound by the trial court \u2019s finding of fact .", "CARDINAL .

The sentence as such can be challenged by way of an appeal . It may concern both points of law ( in particular whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been correctly taken into account ) and factors relating to the assessment of the sentence . Where the substance of an appeal is examined , a public hearing must normally be held .", "CARDINAL . As regards the personal appearance of the accused at a public appeal hearing , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW provides :", "\u201c An accused who is detained shall always be summoned and an accused who is detained shall also be brought before the court if he has made a request to this effect in his appeal or counter - statement , or otherwise if his personal presence appears necessary in the interests of justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
