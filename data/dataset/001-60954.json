The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , then aged DATE , was convicted , after a guilty plea , of culpable homicide . The court was satisfied on the oral evidence of CARDINAL consultant psychiatrists that the applicant was suffering from \u201c mental deficiency \u201d , a mental disorder within the meaning of ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE and such as would warrant his detention ( sections CARDINAL and PERSON ) ) . It ordered that he be detained in a mental hospital under a hospital order . It also made an order restricting his discharge from detention without limit of time ( sections GPE ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) . Although CARDINAL doctor gave the opinion that the applicant suffered from a psychopathic or personality disorder , this was not the basis for the detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant escaped from the ORG hospital but was recaptured DATE .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , he was no longer regarded as suffering from a mental deficiency . The sole medical basis for his detention since that date has been a diagnosis of anti - social personality or psychopathic disorder .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , patients under a restriction order were provided with the opportunity of applying DATE to the sheriff to obtain discharge . According to ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the criteria for admission for both civil and criminal patients were amended . LAW provided that where the mental disorder from which the person suffered was a persistent one manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct ( that is , a psychopathic or anti - social personality disorder ) , he could only be detained where medical treatment was likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition . This reflected general medical pessimism as to the benefits of medical treatment for psychopaths . The sheriff was required to release a restricted patient where the patient was not suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment , or it was not necessary for the health and safety of the patient or the protection of other persons that he receive such treatment ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to an open hospital . On DATE he reoffended , was arrested and remanded to prison . He was charged on a summary complaint with the assault and attempted abduction of an DATE child . Psychiatric reports were obtained from CARDINAL consultant psychiatrists . In their reports of CARDINAL DATE , both referred to the applicant \u2019s personality disorder but neither considered him to be suffering from mental disorder making it appropriate for him to receive hospital treatment . He was found sane and fit to plead . Accordingly , on conviction of assault and attempted abduction by a sheriff on DATE , he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , not to a hospital disposal .", "CARDINAL . On completion of his sentence in prison , the applicant was recalled to the ORG hospital by the Secretary of ORG on the basis of the DATE hospital and restriction orders , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . This had been on the recommendation of a consultant psychiatrist consulted by the Secretary of ORG , who in his report of CARDINAL DATE found that there was no continuing evidence of mental subnormality or of any evidence of mental illness other than persistent abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct . While he was not convinced that the applicant \u2019s period of treatment in the open hospital had improved his behaviour in any consistent fashion , the only possible reason to continue his detention in hospital was to attempt to modify his aggressive and seriously irresponsible conduct . In his view the only appropriate type of hospital management would be the more secure and structured organisation within the ORG hospital . It was further noted that the incident with the child raised grave doubts concerning the safety to other people of allowing the applicant to be released from institutional care and it was for that reason that he recommended the applicant \u2019s return to the ORG hospital . On DATE , on DATE of the applicant \u2019s release from prison , the applicant was transferred back to the ORG hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought discharge from hospital on a number of occasions . DATE and DATE he obtained some CARDINAL reports from CARDINAL psychiatrists , the majority of which were to the effect that he did not suffer from a mental disorder of a nature or degree justifying continued detention as he was not treatable . Some of the reports indicated that the continuing detention was leading , or was likely to lead , to a deterioration of his condition and that he required rehabilitation from his institutionalisation . DATE and DATE , CARDINAL psychiatric reports on the applicant were prepared for government agencies by CARDINAL psychiatrists , in which varying opinions were also given as to the applicant \u2019s amenability to treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeals to the sheriff on CARDINAL DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL DATE for absolute or conditional discharge were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a further appeal with the sheriff under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . DATE , psychiatric reports were prepared . On DATE and DATE , the sheriff heard evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sheriff rejected the applicant \u2019s application for discharge . He noted that it was common ground that the onus of proof lay on the applicant to satisfy him , on the balance of probabilities , that the conditions in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) or ( b ) were made out ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below , paragraph CARDINAL ) . He had before him the written and oral evidence of CARDINAL consultant psychiatrists . He found that they were unanimous that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder , namely a persistent and permanent psychopathic / anti - social personality disorder , manifested by abnormally aggressive and seriously irresponsible behaviour . In the event of the applicant being released , he found there was a very high risk of his reoffending and that any such offence was likely to have a sexual connotation . He accepted that the evidence was such that the applicant \u2019s disorder would not be likely to justify his admission to hospital had his original offence been committed in DATE and noted that the majority of the opinions were to the effect that the applicant \u2019s condition was not curable and that the medical treatment provided by the ORG hospital had not alleviated and would not alleviate his condition . However , he nonetheless found that the applicant \u2019s disorder was severe and that it was appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment . He stated that nowhere in the LAW did it state that a criminal ordered by ORG to be detained without limit of time should be discharged if his condition was not being alleviated . However , in any event , he agreed with PERSON , the medical officer responsible for the applicant , who stated in his report :", "\u201c ... in the structured setting of the ORG hospital in a supervised environment [ the applicant \u2019s ] anger management improves , resulting in his being less physically aggressive . There is evidence that when this structure or supervision is lessened [ the applicant ] poses more of a danger to others e.g. his abuse of parole ... Medical treatment has alleviated his condition and should continue to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The sheriff also referred to PERSON report which stated :", "\u201c At that time ( DATE ) he was emotionally immature and illiterate . Since then there have been marked improvements in his educational attainments . He has benefited from nursing and medical care in the stable environment provided by the ORG hospital . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The sheriff concluded :", "\u201c The majority medical opinion is that rehabilitation should take place in another hospital . It is a matter for PERSON to consider whether he can prepare the applicant for a transfer ; and it is for PERSON to decide and not for me to advise . Presumably rehabilitation will alleviate his condition . ... I am told that psychiatrists would DATE be unlikely to recommend admission to the ORG hospital . However , the applicant was properly admitted and detained and I have not been satisfied that he is now not suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No appeal lay against the sheriff \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG received notice that the applicant had applied for legal aid to challenge the sheriff \u2019s decision by way of judicial review application . In DATE legal aid was refused . On DATE the Secretary of ORG received intimation of the applicant \u2019s fresh application for legal aid . On DATE legal aid was granted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a petition with ORG of ORG for judicial review of the sheriff \u2019s decision , claiming that the sheriff had erred in law or that he had reached a decision on the appeal which was irrational having regard to the evidence . A hearing took place on DATE before Lord PERSON . On DATE Lord PERSON dismissed the petition , finding that the sheriff \u2019s conclusion that it was appropriate that the applicant should be liable to be detained in hospital for treatment was entirely justifiable . He dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that the sheriff had imposed an excessively high burden of proof on the applicant , considering that the sheriff had applied the proper standard and had made a positive finding that he was satisfied that it was appropriate for the applicant to be detained for treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant renewed his application to the Inner House of ORG . On DATE the case was sisted ( adjourned ) to enable the applicant to apply for legal aid . On DATE ORG granted legal aid . On DATE the applicant applied to end the adjournment . On DATE the ORG recalled the sist . On DATE a hearing was set for CARDINAL DATE . The hearing took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG allowed the appeal and quashed the decision of the sheriff . It held that in the case of a psychopath the discharge criteria in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act incorporated the \u201c treatability \u201d criterion in section CARDINAL of the Act , namely the criterion that , in the case of a person suffering from a mental disorder manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct , the medical treatment must be such as was likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in his condition . Having reviewed the evidence , it found that the sheriff had wrongly concluded that the applicant was treatable and that the sheriff was obliged to discharge a restricted psychopathic patient who was not treatable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG appealed to ORG . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the parties agreed to an extension of time to lodge court documents . On DATE the case was set down for hearing on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following that hearing , on DATE , ORG allowed the appeal . In their judgment , the ORG agreed with ORG that the treatability criterion was incorporated into the discharge criteria in section CARDINAL but rejected its approach to the evidence . They held that treatment which alleviated the symptoms and manifestations of the underlying medical disorder of a psychopath was treatment within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , even if the treatment did not cure the disorder itself . They found that the Inner House , on a judicial review application , was not entitled to substitute its own opinion as to the applicant \u2019s treatability for that of the sheriff , although it could have done so on an appeal .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON said , inter alia :", "\u201c It is clear that there was a difference of opinion between the CARDINAL psychiatrists who gave evidence before the sheriff . The sheriff recognised this and stated that \u2018 the majority opinion among the witnesses was that the medical treatment provided by the ORG hospital had not alleviated and would not alleviate his condition\u2019 . But the sheriff referred to the evidence of PERSON , who was in favour of an absolute discharge of the [ applicant ] , and who stated that \u2018 PERSON plans for anger management etc . would be regarded by him as treatment\u2019 . And it is clear ... that the sheriff accepted the opinion of PERSON , who was the responsible medical officer for the [ applicant ] that the anger management of the [ applicant ] in the structured setting of the ORG hospital in a supervised environment resulted in his being less physically aggressive . In other words , it was PERSON opinion that the symptoms of his underlying condition were alleviated and this led the sheriff to the conclusion that medical treatment \u2018 should ORG to alleviate his condition .", "Therefore in my view contrary to the opinion of the ORG the Lord PERSON was right to decide that , given the evidence which was before the sheriff , it would be wrong to hold that no sensible sheriff could have reached the decision which he did . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON adverted to the danger which could arise under the mental health provisions that a sheriff could be obliged to release an untreatable psychopath who might well harm members of the public .
