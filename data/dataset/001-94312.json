It noted that the judicial practice regarding their application had given rise to serious interpretational difficulties and discrepancies in the caselaw of ORG . ORG considered the relevant requirements of Article CARDINAL and their interpretation by ORG to be vague and subjective and , in practice , known exclusively to ORG but not to those who wished to lodge a cassation appeal .", "According to ORG , if the conditions for admissibility of a claim ( preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal ) were formulated in imprecise terms , the right of access to a court could not be exercised effectively because of the risk of arbitrariness of the assessing body .", "In this context the court criticised , in particular , the practice of \u201c simplified reasons \u201d . It held that the use of open - ended concepts by the legislator could not be considered , in itself , as unconstitutional , as it allowed the courts a certain flexibility , to better tailor their decisions to circumstances at hand . However , in such case the obligation to substantiate the legal norm was shifted to the stage of its application . This gave the courts a certain discretion which was not to be confused with an absolute freedom from external supervision . Consequently , a general and imprecise procedural clause required a strong justification and indication of specific circumstances .", "The practice of formulaic justification in the preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal created a situation where nobody could identify how , if at all , ORG had performed the necessary assessment to substantiate those vague terms . The case - law providing guidance on their application was thus practically non - existent . The court informed the addressee of its decision that the requirements of the given article had not been met , but did not indicate any circumstances which justified this conclusion . As a result , a principle of trust has been breached . Moreover , it was impossible for lawyers in general to recognise ORG understanding of those requirements for the purpose of effectively lodging a cassation appeal in the future .", "Consequently , the \u201c pre - judgment \u201d did not guarantee procedural predictability to the party , who has lodged a cassation appeal meeting all formal requirements . The right of access to a court had thus been transformed into a pretence of this right .", "Nevertheless ORG found that it was the practice of ORG that deserved disapproval and not the relevant provisions , and the wording of those provisions could not be considered unconstitutional . In this context the court observed that the practice was not uniform and certain chambers of ORG justified their decisions in a much more elaborate and substantive way . The court further observed that the challenged provisions had already ceased to exist prior to the delivery of the present judgment .", "Accordingly , ORG refused to decide on the compatibility of those provisions with the LAW and discontinued the proceedings in this respect .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , which entered into force on DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with principles specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed , shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in LAW . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
