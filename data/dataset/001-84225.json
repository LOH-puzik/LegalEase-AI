It held that , following the applicant 's acquittal , he had been entitled to compensation for the proceeds of the auction . In this respect ORG noted :", "\u201c A person who has acquired property without a legal ground shall return it . The obligation arises where the ground on which the property was acquired ceases to exist . Such property can be goods forfeited upon suspicion of criminal acts . If the suspected person is acquitted ... the ORG no longer has any legal ground to retain the items seized , or their value , where the items have been sold as perishable . ...", "Unjust enrichment occurs to the detriment of the interests of a person whose property has been seized . ...", "When returning the property acquired without a legal ground or , as in the present case , the value of the objects sold , being quickly perishable , the debtor has a right to require compensation for the expenses incurred in maintaining the property ( LAW ) . This is the right of an honest debtor . Therefore , it has to be established whether the ORG had grounds to start the investigation and forfeit the goods in order to ensure the effectiveness thereof . The fact that no evidence of a crime has eventually been found is not in itself sufficient to assume the lack of honesty on the part of the ORG . ... Indeed , [ the applicant ] had incorrectly filled in the customs declaration ... and this was a sufficient ground to start the investigation against him and seize the material evidence . Therefore , in accordance with LAW should be entitled to recover the expenses incurred during the sale ; those expenses appear to have been necessary in order to safeguard the value of the goods . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was finally awarded LTL PERSON ( about EUR CARDINAL ) in pecuniary damages , corresponding to the value of the auctioned furs from which was deducted the auction expenses ( LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , or about EUR CARDINAL ) and value - added tax ( LTL CARDINAL , or about EUR CARDINAL ) , which the applicant should anyway have paid on importing the furs into GPE .", "CARDINAL .

( The parties have not provided the ORG with up - dated information on this aspect of the case . )", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant claimed interest on LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( the whole sum of the auction proceeds ) , calculated from the moment of his acquittal . On DATE ORG awarded him interest in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) \u2013 the sum corresponding to PERCENT interest calculated on the basis of the sum awarded as damages by ORG on DATE ( LTL CARDINAL ) , from the moment of that award to its actual payment DATE . The court dismissed the applicant 's allegation that the interest should be calculated on the basis of the whole sum of the auction proceeds . It also refused to award interest for the whole period of civil litigation for damages . The court considered that the ORG was liable to pay interest only from the date when the fact of unjust enrichment became known \u2013 i.e. when it was so concluded by ORG on DATE . Until then , the ORG was deemed an honest acquirer , even after the acquittal of the applicant . The decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower courts ' decisions . It stated that in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure , the confiscated goods should be returned to the acquitted person after his acquittal . It further stated that , as an honest acquirer of the auction proceeds , the ORG could not be liable to pay interest until DATE of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the old Civil Code ( valid until DATE ) dealt with situations of unjust enrichment , providing for an obligation to return property acquired without a legal ground or to reimburse its value .
