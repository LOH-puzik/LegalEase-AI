{"ITEMID": "001-67232", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "LITON v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in GPE in DATE and is currently in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr P - E Nilsson , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant applied for asylum to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on DATE , claiming that he had arrived in GPE DATE . He presented a NORP passport to the authorities but he could produce neither his ticket to GPE nor the required visa .", "On DATE ORG held an initial interview with the applicant in which he briefly recounted his family background and up - bringing in the city of ORG . He further stated that he had travelled to GPE on DATE via GPE and GPE and that the passport he had given to the NORP authorities was forged . It had been paid for by his father and ORG and given to him by a smuggler . Asked by the Migration Officer about his reason for asylum , the applicant submitted that he had been reported to the NORP police on false accusations of possessing illegal weapons and of having murdered a supporter of ORG . He claimed to have been arrested once by the police and detained for DATE . In response to further questions , the applicant stated that he had been the treasurer of ORG , to which he belonged , and that he had been arrested by the police in DATE and in DATE , allegedly to prevent the party from continuing with its activities and returning to power . He also claimed that he had been tortured by the police , which had caused damage to his knee and ankle joint and left him with difficulties in walking and lapses of memory . Furthermore , the police had been constantly looking for him in GPE . At the end of the interview , the Migration Officer noted that the part of the record concerning the reasons for asylum had been re - read to the applicant and that he had had nothing to object or add to it . The applicant had moreover confirmed that he had understood the interpreter well during the interview .", "On DATE ORG held a second interview with the applicant where his legal representative was present and given the opportunity to ask questions . During this interview the applicant submitted , inter alia , the following . He had held the post as treasurer of a welfare fund within ORG , the purpose of the fund being to provide support for education of the poor and to provide food in case of famine . His office had been located in GPE . He had been arrested twice , both times in his home town ORG , because of false accusations from supporters of ORG ( the ruling party at the time ) . Neither arrest had been followed by a trial against him nor had he been appointed a lawyer . The first arrest occurred on DATE , following a report to the police by ORG that he had murdered a person named PERSON . He had been detained for DATE during which time he had been beaten with bottles filled with water , sandbags and rifle butts , mostly on his legs . He had been released because he fell ill from the maltreatment . The second arrest had occurred on DATE , again after false accusations by ORG which this time had affirmed that he was , or had been , in possession of illegal weapons . He had been released on DATE , again due to ill health following physical abuse . Upon release he had been urged by the police to abandon his contacts with his party or he would be killed . During both arrests , he had been held at the central prison in GPE . After his release in DATE he had lived on the run until he left for GPE and , consequently , he had not continued to work for ORG . However , despite several questions from the Migration Officer , the applicant could not give a clear answer as to where he had lived following his release in DATE . He stated both that he mainly lived at home with his parents and that he rarely did so since the police had come looking for him almost every other day for DATE . With reference to the records from the initial interview where he had stated that he had been arrested in DATE , he claimed that it must have been a misunderstanding and that he had said that he began his political activities in DATE . He further claimed that he had already in the initial interview mentioned that he had been arrested in DATE and that it was also a mistake that this had not been included in the record .", "To support his statements the applicant submitted a certificate dated DATE and signed by a Mr PERSON , member of the central committee of ORG , which certified that the applicant was a member of the party and had worked for it since DATE , currently holding the post of welfare secretary within the unit of the Karanigonj area . It further stated that he had been arrested more than twice and detained in the GPE jail where he had been severely tortured . According to the certificate , the police were looking for him and the party had therefore recommended him to leave the country . Last , PERSON requested the Government of GPE to grant the applicant political asylum .", "On DATE ORG rejected his application for asylum and ordered that he be expelled to his home country . It first noted that the applicant had not been able to substantiate how he had travelled from GPE to GPE and consequently it remained unclear how long he had been in GPE before applying for asylum . It then went on to state that the general situation in GPE was not such as to entitle him to asylum per se . Moreover , there was freedom of political opinion in GPE and the applicant had worked for a party that was legal . ORG considered that his political activities had been very limited and that it was not probable that his political affiliation alone would give rise to a risk of persecution . With regard to the false accusations against the applicant , ORG observed that he had been released both times and that there had been no trial . It was acknowledged that false accusations occurred as part of political life in GPE but this was not found to be a sufficient reason in itself to be granted asylum . What the applicant had submitted in the present case did not give reason to believe that he was in need of protection on account of the accusations . Neither did his submissions provide support for his claim that he would be at risk of renewed arrest if he had to return to his home country . Furthermore , ORG did not question that the applicant had been exposed to ill - treatment or torture during his previous arrests , but considered that he did not risk such ill - treatment , or being punished by death or corporal punishment , if returned . Thus , it was concluded that the applicant was neither a refugee who could be granted asylum nor a person otherwise in need of protection who could be allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds . The latter conclusion was reached after consideration by ORG even though the applicant had not expressly requested it .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , renewing his request for asylum and requesting that he be granted a residence and work permit . He maintained his earlier claims and added that there was a warrant for his arrest and proceedings pending against him before the national courts in GPE . The pending cases concerned the previously mentioned accusation by political opponents . He submitted several documents , most of them in NORP , to support his statements . Among the documents there was a warrant for his arrest , in LANGUAGE , dated DATE , and CARDINAL letters from his defence lawyer in GPE , PERSON . The first letter , written in LANGUAGE , dated DATE , informed the applicant that Mr PERSON would be representing him in court against the charges of attempted murder . The second letter , in NORP , dated DATE , stated , according to the applicant , that he had been convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to DATE imprisonment and to pay a fine .", "Moreover , the applicant submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , to ORG in which the chief physician of ORG stated that the applicant suffered from ORG ( PTSD ) , was depressed and had shown suicidal tendencies . He considered that the applicant was in need of advanced psychiatric treatment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It gave the following reasoning :", "\u201c ORG shares ORG assessment of the reasons that [ the applicant ] has invoked before ORG . His submissions now , that legal proceedings have been instituted against him , does not entail that he can be considered to be persecuted or in need of protection . ....", "ORG , which does not question that [ the applicant ] has been subjected to ill - treatment in his home country and that his psychological health is poor , can not however find that a residence permit should be granted to him on this ground . Nor , a residence permit for humanitarian reasons should be granted . \u201d", "At DATE the applicant lodged a new application with ORG for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , and requested that his expulsion be stayed until the new application had been considered and a new medical examination had been carried out .", "He submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , which stated that he was very depressed and lacked the ability to care for himself . He was diagnosed as suffering from PTSD with anxiety and suicidal thoughts .", "Before the ORG , the applicant claimed that he had also invoked a document stating that he had been convicted to DATE imprisonment , in absentia , by a court in GPE . However , this has been disputed by the Government which claim that no such document had been invoked before the national authorities at any time during the proceedings . The alleged document has not been produced before the ORG .", "On DATE , ORG decided not to stay the execution of the expulsion order and , on DATE , it rejected the application . It first observed that the decision to expel the applicant had gained legal force through its decision of DATE and that the decision could not be appealed against or re - examined . However , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , ORG could examine a new application for a residence permit lodged by an alien who was to be expelled following a final decision . Under this provision , such a new application could be granted only if it was based on circumstances which had not already been examined and if the alien was in need of protection or if it otherwise would be contrary to humanitarian standards to implement the expulsion order . Turning to the issue before it , ORG noted that it did not concern a need for protection pursuant to LAW ( i.e. a new request for asylum ) . It then observed that the medical certificate which the applicant had invoked was DATE and that he had not submitted more recent medical certificates . It went on to find that the medical evidence invoked did not show that the applicant 's current health condition was of such a character that it would be contrary to humanitarian standards , within the meaning of LAW , to enforce the expulsion .", "On DATE the applicant 's representative requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to suspend the applicant 's expulsion . On DATE , the applicant allegedly tried to commit suicide by swallowing an unspecified number of cigarettes following which he was taken to hospital . After having received treatment , he was placed in a closed psychiatric care unit . On DATE he escaped from the hospital and went into hiding .", "On DATE the President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated decided , under LAW , to indicate to the respondent Government that it was desirable in the interest of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to expel the applicant to GPE until the ORG had had an opportunity to examine the application . On DATE the ORG decided , under LAW ( b ) of the Rule of the ORG , that the ORG should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case . Moreover , it decided to prolong , until further notice , the interim measure indicated under LAW .", "Following the ORG 's indication under LAW on DATE , ORG decided on DATE to stay the enforcement of its decision to expel the applicant until further notice . ORG decision is still in force .", "On DATE , after the ORG had received both parties ' observations on the admissibility and merits of the case , it received a fax signed by PERSON in which he disputed all the ORG 's claims concerning him personally as put forward in their observations . He stated that he was a ORG licensed lawyer and working at the address mentioned in the letterhead of his letters . As regarded the court case in GPE against the applicant in which he had been convicted of attempted murder , Mr PERSON stated that it was a mystery that it had disappeared but that sometimes court officials kept files secret , which must have happened in the present case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
