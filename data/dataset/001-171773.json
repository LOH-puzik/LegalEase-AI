On unspecified dates in DATE the applicants ( save for Mr PERSON ) each sent petitions to the PERSON , ORG and ORG with a request for their children to be provided with education in NORP in their respective elementary schools .

On receipt of the petitions the relevant education directorates informed ORG , which brought the matter to the attention of the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor asked the Anti - terrorism branch of ORG to identify the names and addresses of the persons who had petitioned the ORG and ORG with a request for education in NORP . It appears that on an unspecified date the same instruction was given in relation to the petitions lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested a warrant authorising a search of the homes of CARDINAL people , including the applicants , who had submitted petitions . The public prosecutor considered that the petitions in question had been made on the instructions of the NORP ( Workers\u2019 ORG ) , an illegal armed organisation , and wished to collect relevant evidence from the ORG homes . ORG granted the public prosecutor \u2019s request DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor instructed the Antiterrorism branch of ORG to conduct the searches with a view to finding evidence that could link the relevant persons to the ORG as aiders and abettors .

Early on the morning of DATE police officers from the Anti - terrorism branch of ORG carried out a simultaneous search of all the properties , including the applicants\u2019 houses . The search and seizure reports drafted by the police and signed by the applicants and other members of the household indicated that a search warrant had been issued by ORG on account of their petitions requesting education in NORP for their children .

The applicants PERSON and PERSON claimed that they had not submitted any petitions requesting education in NORP to any ORG authorities . The remaining applicants mainly denied any affiliation with the ORG and stated that they had submitted the petitions in question so that their children could learn their GPE mother tongue . Some of the applicants also stated that the issue of submission of such petitions had also been discussed at the PERSON branch of ORG ) , a NORP political party , which they attended from time to time . The ORG signed statements suggest that interpretation services were provided to CARDINAL of them ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) on request . A note drafted by the police also suggests that the applicants other than PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were illiterate .", "CARDINAL .

The authorisation was granted in response to a request made by the Anti - terrorism branch of ORG , who had claimed that the applicants\u2019 detention was needed for the completion of their files , in particular to verify whether the petitions had been submitted by the applicants themselves , whether they had any affiliation with the ORG and whether they were being searched for in connection with other offences ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for the legal basis for that authorisation ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicants were taken out of the detention centre and , following a routine medical check - up , were brought before the public prosecutor at ORG .

On DATE the public prosecutor filed an objection concerning the decision to release the applicants , claiming that it was evident from the statements made by them following their arrest that they had submitted the petitions in an organised manner with the aim of assisting the ORG \u2019s \u201c politicisation \u201d process . The public prosecutor added that although the applicants appeared to have lawfully used their right to petition , in reality they were acting on the instructions of the ORG and were thus aiding and abetting that organisation .", "CARDINAL .

The public prosecutor submitted that such organised acts of civil disobedience agreed on by the ORG had included petitioning the ORG authorities for education in NORP , dressing up in traditional NORP female costume , and applying to courts or population registration offices with requests for their NORP identities to appear on their national identity cards . When viewed against this background , the petitions in question DATE which had been submitted to certain authorities on predetermined dates and times \u2013 could not be considered to be individual acts .
