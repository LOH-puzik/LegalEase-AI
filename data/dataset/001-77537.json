POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is a writer , translator and publisher and lives in GPE . ORG were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant published a book called \u201c Narcotics \u2013 A guide \u201d ( GPE \u2013 przewodnik ) . The book had the following subtitle : \u201c Part CARDINAL : Soft drugs . Marijuana \u2013 LSD-CARDINAL \u2013 Mushrooms . History \u2013 Production \u2013 How to use DATE Dangers . \u201d", "The book opened with the following introduction :", "\u201c From the author :", "I am aware of the fact that among persons knowledgeable on the subject , the use of the word \u2018 narcotics\u2019 in the title may be controversial because of the complexity surrounding the meaning of that word . I would therefore like to add the following explanation .", "The word \u2018 narcotics\u2019 actually means agents used in surgical anaesthetics and in painkillers not used in surgery ( for example , morphine ) . However , in common parlance it is understood much more widely , probably because an appropriate term , akin to the LANGUAGE \u2018 drugs\u2019 , for instance , has not been established in the NORP language . I think that the broad meaning given to the word \u2018 narcotics\u2019 in common parlance stems from the publication \u2018 GPE and the unwashed soul\u2019 by ORG , and from the way the word is currently used by the media .", "Probably the most appropriate title for this book would be : \u2018 Psychosocial implications of the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive agents and their neurophysiological , cultural , qualitative and quantitative determinants.\u2019 However , in my view this title is slightly too long for a book aimed at the general public .", "At the same time , I would like to state that it is not my intention in any way to solicit , encourage or propagate the use of psychoactive agents .", "The aim of this publication is to fill the alarming void which exists in our country resulting from widespread ignorance and lack of knowledge about the basic issue referred to ( mistakenly and often improperly ) as drug addiction . \u201d", "The book was divided into the following chapters :", "On the back cover of the book the applicant included a quotation that began as follows :", "\u201c People do not take drugs because they are bad . They do not take drugs out of perversity . They take them because the drugs make them feel good . Very good indeed . \u201d", "The quotation was attributed to PERSON , a professor at ORG in GPE .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the LOC district prosecutor started an investigation into allegations that the applicant \u2019s book contained instructions on the production and use of drugs . The prosecutor appointed experts to assess the content of the book .", "On DATE the district prosecutor charged the applicant under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE with inciting readers of his book to use drugs .", "On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG .", "On DATE the applicant was tried by ORG . He was convicted as charged and sentenced to a fifteenmonth prison term suspended for DATE and a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) . The court gave the following reasons for the applicant \u2019s conviction :", "\u201c In view of the evidence before it the ORG considers that there can be no doubt as to PERSON", "DATE and DATE PERSON published his book entitled \u2018 GPE \u2013 A guide DATE Part CARDINAL : Soft drugs\u2019 . He distributed the book throughout the country . CARDINAL of the reasons the defendant wrote the above book was for financial gain . This was admitted by the defendant , who said that all economic activity was aimed at financial gain .", "The defendant also acted in pursuit of personal goals since he published his book and sold it throughout the country , presenting it as his contribution to the discussion concerning the legalisation of narcotics , in an attempt to establish himself as a published author .", "The defendant referred in his book to his own claims as well as citing numerous quotations from NORP and foreign publications . In the same vein , he intentionally selected information in support of his claims designed to create the impression not just that the narcotics described were not dangerous , but that taking them benefited human mental and physical health . In order to achieve this aim , the defendant omitted numerous pieces of information which were known to him and which showed the harmful influence of these psychoactive agents on the human body .", "Another fact which it is important to point out is that the defendant addressed his book mainly to young people , as demonstrated by the quotation printed on the back cover . The ORG considers that reading this quotation in a bookshop is liable to make a potential reader interested in the content of the book .", "The ORG is of the view that the aim of the message contained in the book was to persuade ... readers to try out CARDINAL of the narcotics described therein when the opportunity arose . In order to achieve this aim , the defendant sought to break down the psychological barriers normally encountered by reasonable individuals by choosing his words carefully , using analogies , outlining what he saw as the numerous qualities and advantages for the prospective consumer , and hiding or referring only in general terms to several dangerous consequences of drug use . No individual knows himself sufficiently well to be certain whether and how a certain narcotic may influence his psyche .", "The book in question was intended to be read in particular by young people . It is widely known that different types of narcotics , including those described by the defendant , are trafficked among high - school students and even among older pupils in primary schools . Moreover , it is known from radio , television and the press that the narcotics described by the defendant are taken by people , some of them teenagers , at private social events and in discotheques . Experience and observation of the environment tell us that persons of such a young age have not developed the necessary degree of self - criticism to allow them to approach the content of PERSON book with the required objectivity .", "The ORG considers that the average reader will not analyse in depth the philosophical content of the book , but will remember simple facts designed to show that the narcotics described bring immediate pleasure and unforgettable experiences \u2013 including experiences of a religious nature DATE and , more importantly , that taking the doses suggested by the defendant ... will not have any negative consequences for life and health .", "The ORG considers , therefore , that the approach taken by the defendant , consisting of publishing selected information , was aimed at inducing and making it easier for readers to take the narcotics described .", "The defendant published detailed information in his book on how to obtain ingredients and prepare them . He also gave instructions on the doses to be taken and described the states of mind which might be experienced . His actions were therefore aimed at making it easier for the reader to use narcotics .", "The defendant did not deny that access to narcotics in GPE was very easy . It is well known from the media that there are places where almost anyone who wants to experiment with a chosen narcotic may buy it . In the context of this widely known information , the defendant advised readers to buy ingredients from verified sources .", "The ORG is of the view that the average young person , after reading the book , buying narcotics and , under the influence of the book , forgetting his or her fears and apprehensions , is liable to decide unhesitatingly to take the narcotics . After reading the book he would feel certain that he was unlikely to become addicted and that he would not experience any negative effects , while being able for DATE to experience new states of mind without fear .", "In view of the above , the ORG has come to the conclusion that the actions of the defendant , PERSON , fit the characteristics of the misdemeanour described in section CARDINAL ) of ORG of DATE . ...", "When sentencing the defendant , the ORG took into account , as a factor counting against him , the significant degree of social harm which could be caused by his actions in the context of increasing drug addiction among young people .", "The ORG also took into account the following circumstances in the defendant \u2019s favour : the fact that he had no criminal record , the positive opinion of his neighbours and the fact that CARDINAL copies of the book had been printed , making it less accessible to potential readers in GPE .", "In sentencing the defendant the ORG further took into account the profit he made from the sale of the book , his ability to earn a living and the fact that he has to support a wife and CARDINAL children .", "In view of the above - mentioned circumstances in the defendant \u2019s favour , his personal circumstances and his lifestyle , which justify the assumption that he will comply with the law and will not reoffend , the ORG has decided to suspend his sentence . ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed against his conviction but the appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The appellate court fully subscribed to ORG findings and agreed that the book was actually a \u201c guide for drug addicts \u201d . The court was of the opinion that the introduction to the book , in which the applicant denied his \u201c intention in any way to solicit , encourage or propagate the use of psychoactive agents \u201d , was in complete contradiction to the content of the book . The court also relied on the opinions of CARDINAL experts who considered the book to be \u201c a set of instructions for drug addicts [ and ] incitement to the use [ of drugs ] \u201d given that the applicant was of the view that narcotics were \u201c less harmful [ than generally assumed ] or not harmful at all \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . Between DATE and DATE the case lay dormant before ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It followed the lower court \u2019s findings and agreed with its opinion that the applicant \u2019s book incited readers to use drugs and facilitated the taking of drugs by young people .", "LAW , which was adopted by ORG on DATE and came into force on DATE , states :", "\u201c GPE shall ensure freedom of the press and other means of social communication . \u201d", "LAW , which lays down a general prohibition on disproportionate limitations on constitutional rights and freedoms ( the principle of proportionality ) , provides :", "\u201c Any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute , and only when necessary in a democratic ORG for the protection of its security or public order , or to protect the natural environment , health or public morals or the freedoms and rights of other persons .
