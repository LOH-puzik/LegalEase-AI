NORP By means of a judicial letter of DATE the applicant company refused the offer and claimed compensation amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) based on an ex parte architect report which considered that , according to the ORG \u2019s architect \u2019s valuation , part of the land was agricultural land .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of any agreement , in DATE , the applicant company instituted constitutional redress proceedings , complaining under LAW to LAW about the delay in the payment of compensation ( in respect of all the pieces of land ) . The applicant company was successful and by a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG awarded it LAW in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The costs were to be borne by both parties .", "CARDINAL . Pending the above constitutional proceedings and following action taken by the Commissioner of LOC , on DATE proceedings before ORG ) were commenced to determine the compensation due .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , pending those proceedings , the Government returned part of the land to the applicant company . In consequence the remaining part of the sixth piece of expropriated land amounted to an area of CARDINAL sq.m .", "CARDINAL . The LAB were not informed of the return of the property .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , technical experts appointed by the ORG established the value of the ( entire ) sixth piece of land as ORG CARDINAL , considering that for the most part , it was to be classified as building land .", "CARDINAL .

It also awarded interest and ordered that the costs be divided by the parties in proportion .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Commissioner of Lands appealed , claiming , inter alia , that ORG had wrongly applied the law in determining the compensation , because by means of transitory provisions enacted in DATE the LAB could now no longer award more than a claimant would have claimed .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant company pleaded that the application of the relevant provisions of ORG had breached its rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the appeal in so far as Article GPE ) of the GPE had retroactive application in terms of the transitory provisions contained in LAW .

Adjusting the claim to the area of the sixth piece of land which had not been returned and for which the applicant company was owed compensation , the court awarded the applicant company ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ordered it to pay costs . As to the constitutional plea raised by the applicant company in this regard , ORG held that this legal matter had already been examined in CARDINAL constitutional cases , namely Commissioner of GPE vs PERSON , of DATE and ORG vs Director of Lands of DATE , in which it was held that there had been no breach of the claimants\u2019 property rights given that they had been awarded the sum they had actually requested in compensation ( irrespective of the fact that the independent architects had estimated the land to be worth more ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company did not institute a new and separate set of constitutional proceedings to complain about the matter , considering that it would be futile given the established case - law .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the DATE amendments described below , in awarding compensation for the value of the land the Chairman of the ORG was bound by the valuations given by CARDINAL experts ( which formed part of the LAB ) , when these were unanimous in their valuation .", "CARDINAL . Act XVII of DATE added a proviso to LAW Ordinance , LAW of LAW , amending it to read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The ORG shall be competent \u2013", "...", "( e ) to assess the amount of compensation payable under any of the provisions of this LAW and for that purpose to declare whether any area is a building site or agricultural or waste land ;", "...", "...

In circumstances similar to the present case , ORG examined , inter alia , the complaint of the claimants in that case concerning the retroactive application of LAW , which had allegedly violated their legitimate expectation to compensation as established by the laws in force at the time of the taking , thus denying them part of their compensation .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG DATE which was bound ( by procedural rules ) to look into the matter only under LAW No . DATE found no violation of the claimants\u2019 property rights .", "CARDINAL . It considered that before LAW could have awarded compensation higher than that requested by the parties , so rather than clarifying the law the LAW limited the compensation that could be awarded . Nevertheless , the claimants did not have a \u201c possession \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL , in that they had had no legitimate expectation of receiving an amount higher than that established by their ex parte expert , which they had claimed . Specific to that case the court noted firstly that when LAW had come into effect the report of the new architects had not yet been included in the case file . Secondly , before LAW the claimants had not claimed compensation higher than that awarded , and thirdly , when the tribunal architects were appointed the claimants had been aware of the new legislation . Moreover , the claimants had received fair compensation since they had been awarded the entire sum they had asked for . ORG noted that it was clear that the valuation made by the experts appointed by the tribunal was in stark contrast to the valuations made by the previous architects and the ex parte experts ; their valuation was therefore arbitrary and disproportionate , as no reasons had been given to justify the huge difference . LAW had therefore not violated the claimants\u2019 rights under LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In circumstances similar to those in the present case , the claimants raised a constitutional issue arguing that the application of the relevant proviso of LAW in their case had breached their right to fair compensation . The issue was raised before ORG before which they were appealing against a decision of the ORG awarding them compensation . ORG shared the conclusions of ORG in the case of Commissioner of Lands vs PERSON of DATE and dismissed the claim on the basis that the claimants had obtained the sum they had requested ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
