{"ITEMID": "001-68317", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "FISCHLER v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in Enskede . He is represented before the ORG by Mr B. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In their tax returns for the tax assessment DATE , a substantial number of persons , including the applicant , made deductions for capital losses , after having bought and sold interest options ( r\u00e4nteoptioner ) , and for paid interest on a promissory note loan ( reversl\u00e5n ) . All transactions were made with the same opposite party , ORG ( ORG , hereinafter referred to as the \u201c NF \u201d ) which had also granted the loans .", "Because of the substantial number of persons who had made deductions for capital losses following transactions with the ORG , ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE decided to make an audit of the ORG . However , due to the very complex and intricate nature of the transactions and the lack of co - operation by the ORG , the investigation proved difficult to carry out , for which reason ORG hired an independent expert body to carry out a part of the audit .", "According to the findings of the audit , as set forth in ORG audit report ( granskningspromemorian ) on DATE , the transactions made between the individuals and the ORG had been based on an agreement entered into by the parties beforehand who had followed a procedure set forth therein . The transactions had included buying and selling specific interest options which the ORG claimed were adjusted to conditions on the market . However , ORG found through the audit that the options had not been noted on the market nor adjusted to the market conditions , since the market price of the options had not been decisive for the determination of the price at the time of selling . Instead , the price of the options had been fixed in advance already in the agreement . Moreover , the size of the loss during DATE and the subsequent recovery DATE had also been decided beforehand . Thus , in fact , the parties had not dealt with real options , as defined in the law .", "As concerned the promissory note loan , the same type of agreement had been followed . DATE , the individuals had paid a very high interest on the loan and then , at DATE , they had paid the loan in advance , following which a part of the interest was repaid . The audit report revealed that both the cost of the interest paid DATE and the repayment of part of the interest made DATE had been predetermined in the agreement .", "The audit report concluded that the individuals had been offered by the ORG an agreement in which everything was predetermined and where the purpose had been to obtain tax benefits . The idea had been that , tax wise , the high interest on the loans paid DATE , and the repayment DATE , should finance the capital losses of the transactions with the options .", "On DATE , DATE that the above - mentioned audit report was finalised , ORG transmitted it to the applicant and informed him of its intention to revise the assessment of the arrears ( eftertaxering ) for his DATE tax assessment and to impose tax surcharges on him . On DATE it sent a preliminary consideration ( \u00f6verv\u00e4gande ) to the applicant , informing him that it was considering making a revised assessment for arrears and disallowing the deduction for paid interest on the promissory note loan in the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Further , it was considering imposing tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability on the sum ( apparently amounting to around SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The applicant was requested to submit any comments he might have within DATE .", "On DATE ORG decided to follow its preliminary consideration . With regard to the imposition of tax surcharges , it found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information by failing to provide it with information about the true conditions of the interest rates of the loan . Further , it considered that no grounds for remission had been shown and that , due to the character of the matter and the way in which it had been carried out , it could not be assumed that any such grounds existed .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision , disputing ORG findings . He maintained that there were no grounds for revising the assessment of the arrears or for imposing tax surcharges .", "On DATE ORG made the obligatory re - assessment of its decision of DATE but decided not to change it . Following this , it forwarded the appeal to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE which received it on DATE .", "On DATE , when the above - mentioned audit report was transmitted to the applicant , ORG also informed him of its intention to alter his tax assessment for DATE and to impose tax surcharges on him . On DATE ORG sent a preliminary consideration to him and , on DATE , it decided , on the basis of the findings of the audit , to decrease his income from capital gain by SEK CARDINAL for capital losses but , at the same time , to increase his income from capital gain by SEK CARDINAL for non - deductible interest . It further imposed tax surcharges amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability on the latter sum ( apparently amounting to QUANTITY ) since it considered that the applicant had submitted incorrect information and that no grounds for remission existed .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision and requested that he be taxed in accordance with his tax return and that the tax surcharges be removed . He further stated that he would develop his grounds of appeal in a later submission .", "However , ORG did not receive any further communication from the applicant . On DATE it made its obligatory re - assessment of its original decision and decided not to change it . It noted that , even though nothing had been heard from the applicant , it was necessary to take a decision in order not to prolong the process further . The appeal was then forwarded to ORG , which received it on DATE .", "The parties made further submissions before ORG and , in a partial judgment of DATE , the court rejected the applicant 's appeal concerning the question of deduction for capital losses on the options for the tax assessment DATE .", "On DATE an oral hearing was held in the case and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It found that the applicant had failed to provide ORG with information about the conditions for the promissory note loan in his tax assessment for DATE , for which reason ORG had been justified in making a revised assessment for DATE arrears .", "With regard to the tax surcharges , the court first considered that the imposition of tax surcharges did not violate the Convention . It then found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information and that there was reason to impose tax surcharges since it was clear that he had not furnished ORG with the conditions for the promissory note loan and the interest rates . ORG had not been able to examine whether the declared deductions for interest were correct . It further found that no reasons for remission had been shown .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . He maintained his claims , invoking and expanding the grounds he had presented before the lower court . Inter alia , he claimed that the imposition of tax surcharges violated the presumption of innocence contained in LAW since ORG had failed to prove that he had given incorrect information intentionally or by neglect .", "On DATE , ORG held an oral hearing in the case where several witnesses were heard at the applicant 's request .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal on the same grounds as ORG , and stated that , although the imposition of tax surcharges fell within the ambit of LAW , it did not violate the presumption of innocence contained therein .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) and requested a respite until DATE to supplement his submissions . It is not clear , however , whether he did so .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Taxpayers submit yearly tax returns to the local tax authorities . To secure that timely , sufficient and correct information is provided , the tax authorities may , under certain circumstances , impose special charges on the taxpayer in the form of tax surcharges .", "The rules on tax surcharges relevant to the present case were laid down in LAW ( Taxeringslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the Act , a tax surcharge is imposed on the taxpayer if he or she , in a tax return or in any other written statement , has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect . It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge ; concealment , in whole or in part , of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information . However , incorrect claims are not penalised ; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof , no surcharge is imposed . The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority . The surcharge amounts to PERCENT of the income tax which the tax authority would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information .", "In certain circumstances , a tax surcharge will be remitted . Thus , Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of the LAW states that taxpayers will not have to pay a surcharge if their failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is considered excusable owing to their age , illness , lack of experience or comparable circumstances . The surcharge should also be remitted where the failure appears excusable by reason of the nature of the information in question or other special circumstances , or where it would be manifestly unreasonable to impose a surcharge .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW stipulates that , if the facts of the case so require , the tax authorities must have regard to the provisions on remission , even in the absence of a specific claim to that effect by the taxpayer . In principle , however , it is up to the taxpayer to show due cause for the remission of a surcharge ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
