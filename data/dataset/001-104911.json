Early in DATE the applicant visited PERSON in a hospital in GPE , in the region covered by the then ORG ( replaced later by the countrywide ORG ) . Having performed an ultrasound scan , PERSON estimated that the applicant was in DATE of pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in DATE of her pregnancy , the applicant \u2013 who was at that time DATE , was married and had CARDINAL children DATE was registered as a pregnant patient in her local clinic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ultrasound scans were performed , in DATE of the applicant \u2019s pregnancy . On DATE PERSON estimated that it could not be ruled out that the foetus was affected with some malformation and informed the applicant thereof . The applicant told him that she wished to have an abortion if the suspicion proved true .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that in DATE and DATE the applicant had visited PERSON at a private clinic . They argued that such an institution had no right to issue a referral to any public health institution .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disagreed . She first submitted that at the material time Dr PERSON worked both at a public hospital in DATE where she had visited him in DATE and in DATE , after the second scan DATE and at a non - public clinic . She further submitted that the NORP health care system was composed of so - called public health units and non - public health units . The latter , most often being first contact and basic care institutions , had financing contracts with the public ORG ( and had had such contracts with its predecessors , ORG Funds , at the material time ) . Medical services available in non - public clinics were partly financed by public funds , constituted by premiums paid by all persons covered by the universal system of health insurance . Doctors working for non - public units had the same rights and duties to provide health care to patients as doctors employed by public units , including a right to refer a patient to a public unit .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant went to a hospital in GPE results of a third ultrasound scan performed in that hospital confirmed the likelihood that the foetus was suffering from some malformation . A genetic examination by way of amniocentesis was recommended by PERSON , in order to confirm or dispel this suspicion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had another ultrasound scan in a private clinic in FAC . She had no referral from PERSON and had therefore to pay for the service herself . Under the applicable laws , her expenditure could not be reimbursed . The results of that scan confirmed the likelihood that the foetus was affected with an unidentified malformation . Genetic tests were recommended again .", "CARDINAL . She was subsequently received by Professor PERSON . in ORG , a specialist in clinical genetics . A genetic test was again recommended . Professor PERSON . recommended that the applicant should obtain a formal referral from her family doctor , PERSON , to have the test carried out in a public hospital in FAC , which was outside her region covered by the then ORG .", "Subsequently , PERSON refused to issue a referral , because in his view the NORP condition did not qualify the applicant for an abortion under the provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that no reference to the possibility of the foetus being affected with PERSON syndrome had ever been made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disagreed . She submitted that during that visit she was told that the scan gave rise to a suspicion of either PERSON or ORG syndrome .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and her husband visited PERSON during his night duty at the hospital in T. They demanded termination of the pregnancy . He refused and indicated that the results of the ultrasound scan could not be treated as a sole ground for diagnosis that the foetus was affected with severe malformation . He proposed having a panel of doctors from the same hospital review his decision . The applicant refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to a public hospital in GPE , within her region covered by ORG , and requested advice . She was told that a decision on termination could not be taken at that hospital and was referred to a university hospital in GPE , to a pathological pregnancies ward , in another region of the Fund , for further diagnosis ( \u201c w celu dalszej diagnostyki \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s stay in the hospital in T. a hospital lawyer was asked to give an opinion with a view to ensuring that the laws on the availability of legal abortion were respected . The applicant was also told that termination of pregnancy would entail a serious risk to her life and that the CARDINAL caesarean births which she had previously had constituted the most important risk factor in deciding whether she should have a genetic test at all .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately after being discharged from the T. hospital , the applicant travelled QUANTITY to GPE . She went to see PERSON at ORG . He criticised her for contemplating a termination . She was also informed that the hospital categorically refused to carry out abortions and that no abortions had ever been performed there for DATE . She was also refused a genetic examination , Dr GPE being in the opinion that it was not necessary in her case . She stayed in the hospital for DATE and had another ultrasound scan performed , the results of which were inconclusive . Urine and blood tests were also performed . She was discharged on DATE . The applicant \u2019s discharge record stated that the foetus was affected with developmental abnormalities ( \u201c wady rozwojowe p\u0142odu \u201d ) . The same was stated in a medical certificate signed by PERSON He recommended genetic testing in order to establish the character of the ailment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again contacted Professor PERSON . , who had examined her in DATE . Another ultrasound scan performed in a private clinic where Professor PERSON . received patients confirmed the suspicion of malformation . The applicant obtained a referral from the professor to ORG in FAC , but he informed her that he was in fact not competent to issue it . The professor told her that in order to have a genetic test carried out in ORG , which was outside her region , she needed a referral issued by a doctor practising in her region and , in addition , an approval by a regional insurance fund , together with an undertaking that it would reimburse the costs of the test to the regional fund where the test was to be performed . The professor advised her to report to the FAC hospital as an emergency patient , claiming that she was about to miscarry , as it was likely that she would then be admitted to that hospital .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant asked PERSON for a referral .", "The Government submitted that PERSON could not have referred the applicant for a genetic test in GPE because neither ORG nor any other hospital in PERSON carried out such tests as a routine procedure . The applicant disagreed . She submitted that PERSON had told her that she would not obtain the referral for testing because if the results were positive she would want to have an abortion .", "CARDINAL . Afterwards , on DATE , she again unsuccessfully asked PERSON for a referral to the FAC hospital .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had obtained from him a referral to the same ORG where she had already been hospitalised CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant disagreed and submitted that no referral had been issued to her .", "The ORG notes this discrepancy in the parties\u2019 submissions and notes that no copy of that referral has been submitted to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that she had gone to the hospital with a referral issued by Professor PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disagrees . She submits that she had gone to that hospital without a referral , as advised , and had been admitted as an emergency patient .", "CARDINAL . A genetic test ( amniocentesis ) was performed there on DATE , in DATE of pregnancy , and the applicant was told that she had to wait DATE for the results .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the tests were carried out despite the fact that the applicant had not sought from the GPE section of the medical insurance fund any approval for financing them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was discharged from the FAC hospital on DATE . Before the results were available , on DATE the applicant , increasingly desperate as by then she was very afraid that the foetus was suffering from severe genetic abnormalities , reported to the T. hospital , where she submitted a written request for an abortion . Dr PERSON told her that he could not take such a decision himself . He had to speak with the consultant .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested the hospital in T. to terminate the pregnancy , referring to the provisions of LAW . She requested that in case of a negative reply it should be made in writing \u201c as soon as possible \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to that hospital again and was told that the consultant could not see her because he was ill . The visit was rescheduled for DATE . On DATE she wrote a letter of complaint to the director of the T. hospital , submitting that she had not received adequate treatment and that she felt that the doctors were intentionally postponing all decisions in her case so that she would be unable to obtain an abortion within the time - limit provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she again requested doctors at the T. hospital to carry out an abortion . She referred to the results of the genetic tests which she had received on that date . The certificate , established by Professor K.Sz . , confirmed that the karyotype indicated the presence of ORG syndrome . The certificate further read :", "\u201c A chromosomal aberration and an ultrasound image were established , indicating the presence of congenital defects which can have a serious impact on the child \u2019s normal development . Further handling of the case under the provisions of the DATE law on termination of pregnancy can be envisaged . A relevant decision should be taken with due regard to the GPE opinion \u201d .", "The doctors in the T. hospital refused to carry out an abortion , Dr PERSON telling her that it was too late by then as the foetus was able at that stage to survive outside the mother \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again complained in writing to the Director of the T. hospital about the manner in which her case had been handled and about the procrastination on the part of Dr PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and her husband submitted a number of complaints to various health care system institutions . In a reply from ORG , dated DATE , it was stated that \u201c it was impossible to establish on the basis of the available documents why the genetic tests were postponed until DATE when the foetus had already become capable of surviving outside the mother \u2019s body . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE she received a reply from the T. hospital to her complaints of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The letter contained an account of the facts of the case and quoted provisions of the DATE Act . No assessment of the lawfulness of the conduct of the medical staff involved was made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to a baby girl affected with PERSON syndrome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the prosecuting authorities to institute criminal proceedings against the persons involved in handling her case . She alleged serious failure on the part of the doctors , acting as public agents , to safeguard her interests protected by law , on account of their failure to perform timely prenatal examinations . As a result , the applicant had been denied information on the NORP condition and , consequently , divested of the possibility to decide for herself whether or not she wished to terminate her pregnancy in the conditions provided for by law , and she had been forced to continue it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigations , finding that no criminal offence had been committed . The prosecutor relied on an expert opinion prepared by ORG , according to which under LAW legal abortion was possible only when foetal malformation was severe . It was not possible to assess whether malformations of a foetus were severe enough to justify an abortion until the foetus was able to live on its own outside the mother \u2019s body . It concluded that in the applicant \u2019s case an abortion would have been possible until DATE of pregnancy . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG allowed her appeal and ordered that the investigation be re - opened . Additional medical evidence was taken during the investigation . On DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the investigation , finding that no criminal offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining , inter alia , that the prosecuting authorities had failed to address the critical issue of whether , , genetic tests should have been carried out in order to obtain a diagnosis of the foetus\u2019 condition . Instead the investigation had focused on whether or not the applicant had a right to an abortion under the applicable law .", "CARDINAL . Ultimately , on DATE , the competent court upheld the decision of the prosecuting authorities . The court held that doctors employed in public hospitals did not have the quality of \u201c public servantsthe criminal offence of breach of duty by a public servant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant filed a civil lawsuit with ORG against doctors PERSON , GPE and GPE and against the GPE and GPE hospitals . She argued that the doctors dealing with her case had unreasonably procrastinated in their decision on her access to genetic tests and had thereby failed to provide her with reliable and timely information about the NORP condition . They had also failed to establish the NORP condition in time for her to make an informed decision as to whether or not to terminate the pregnancy . As a result of an unjustified delay in obtaining relevant information she had been divested of the possibility of exercising an autonomous choice as to her parenthood .", "The applicant further argued that the laws in force authorised abortion in specific situations . However , that right had been denied her as a result of difficulties in obtaining timely access to genetic tests and the lengthy delay before she had ultimately obtained such access .", "The applicant referred to section CARDINAL ( a ) CARDINAL of the DATE Family Planning ( Protection of the Human Foetus and Conditions Permitting Pregnancy Termination ) Act and to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW guaranteeing socalled personal rights .", "The applicant argued that the circumstances in which the determination of her access to genetic testing had been decided had breached her personal rights and dignity and had deeply humiliated her . No regard had been had to her views and feelings .", "She also claimed compensation from PERSON for hostile and disparaging statements about her character and conduct which he had made in a press interview about her case . He had disclosed to the public details about her and the NORP health covered by medical secret and told the journalist that the applicant and her husband were bad and irresponsible parents .", "CARDINAL . She claimed just satisfaction in a total amount of ORG CARDINAL for breach of her rights as a patient and her personal rights . She also sought a declaration that the CARDINAL medical establishments were responsible in respect of future costs to be borne by the applicant in connection with her daughter \u2019s treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found PERSON guilty of having disclosed to the public , in an interview he had given to the press , information covered by medical secrecy , including the fact that she had envisaged the termination of the pregnancy . It conditionally discontinued the proceedings against him and fixed a period of probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG awarded the applicant LAW , finding that in a press interview published in DATE he had disclosed information relating to the applicant \u2019s health and private life in connection with her pregnancy . He had also made disrespectful and hurtful comments about the applicant \u2019s conduct and personality .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the remaining claims which she had lodged against doctors PERSON and GPE and against the hospitals . The courts found that the applicant \u2019s personal and patient \u2019s rights had not been breached by either of these doctors or the hospitals . There had been no procrastination on the LOC part in the applicant \u2019s case . Under ORG standards termination was permissible only until DATE of pregnancy , whereas the applicant had reported to the hospitals concerned when she was already in DATE of pregnancy , and on DATE she had been in DATE . Hence , neither her right to decide about her parenthood nor her rights as a patient had been breached in such a way as to place the defendants at fault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . She submitted that the right to health - related information was protected both by LAW , providing for legal protection of personal rights , and by section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE . In her case doctors GPE , GPE and PERSON had been of the view that genetic tests were relevant to establishing the NORP condition , but had not given her the necessary referral . GPE had not been able to cite any legal basis for his refusal . PERSON had stated before the court that he had not issued a referral because the applicant had not asked for one . However , it was for a doctor with the required professional knowledge to decide what tests were called for in a given medical situation . The testimony given by the defendants had clearly shown that their conduct in the case had failed to comply with the applicable legal provisions . The doctors had tried to shift the responsibility for the way in which her case had been handled to the applicant , despite the obvious fact that the fundamental responsibility for the proper handling of a medical case lay with them as health professionals . The doctors had also been well aware , as shown by the evidence which they had given , that the applicant had been desperate , in reaction to information that the foetus might be affected with a genetic disorder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the ORG conduct had breached the law , in particular section CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW in so far as it imposed on the authorities an obligation to ensure unimpeded access to prenatal information and testing , in particular in cases of increased risk or suspicion of a genetic disorder or development problem , or of an incurable lifethreatening ailment . The applicant had therefore had such a right , clearly provided for by the applicable law , but the defendants had made it impossible for her to enjoy that right .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment , endorsing the conclusions of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed her cassation appeal , quashed the judgment of the appellate court in its entirety on grounds of substance and ordered that the case be re - examined .", "ORG observed that the applicant \u2019s claim was CARDINAL - pronged : it was based firstly on the failure to refer her for genetic testing and , secondly , on the breach of her right to take an informed decision which resulted from this failure .", "CARDINAL . As to the first part of her claim , ORG observed that it was not open to doubt ( and had been confirmed by an expert opinion prepared for the purposes of the criminal investigation ) that only genetic testing could confirm or dispel suspicions that the foetus was affected with PERSON syndrome . The doctors concerned had known of the procedure . They were obliged , under LAW DATE ( ustawa o zak\u0142adach opieki zdrowotnej ) , insofar as it guaranteed patients\u2019 rights , to refer the applicant for genetic testing of their own motion , without her asking for it . Under the same LAW , the applicant had a legally protected right to obtain adequate information about the NORP health . Had the doctors had conscientious objections to issuing a referral , they should have informed the applicant thereof and referred her to another practitioner who would have referred her for the testing , in accordance with the applicable laws on the medical profession governing the relevant procedure , but they had failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . The procedures governing the carrying out of genetic tests and their financing by various parts of the then ORG , applicable at the material time , could not be validly relied on as exempting doctors from issuing a referral , in particular as those procedures were not of a statutory character and could not be plausibly relied on to justify restricting the applicant \u2019s rights as a patient . The obligation to refer the applicant had not , contrary to the ORG position , ended on the date when legal abortion of a foetus affected with suspected malformation was no longer possible ( that is , after DATE ) , since there were no legal \u2013 or medical \u2013 grounds on which to automatically link genetic testing with access to legal abortion . Furthermore , at the material time there had been no temporal limitation in law on the carrying out of these tests during pregnancy . It was only in DATE that an ordinance had been enacted under which genetic testing became available only until DATE of pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that there were therefore good reasons to accept that the doctors dealing with the applicant \u2019s case had breached her personal rights within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW and her patient \u2019s rights guaranteed by LAW . They had been aware that only genetic testing was capable of determining the NORP genetic situation , but had still refused a referral ; instead they had sent her for various tests carried out in a hospital setting which were not relevant to such a diagnosis .", "Moreover , the lower courts had erred in their finding that the applicant had not suffered non - pecuniary damage as a result of the ORG acts . Such damage had been caused by the distress , anxiety and humiliation she had suffered as a result of the manner in which her case had been handled .", "CARDINAL . As to the second part of the applicant \u2019s claim , ORG observed that it transpired from the case - law of ORG ( IV CK CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ; see paragraph DATE below ) that a right to be informed about the foetus\u2019 health and to take informed decisions , in the light of that information , as to whether to continue the pregnancy or not was a personal right within the meaning of LAW . If a child affected with a genetic problem was born as a result of failure to carry out genetic testing , a claim for just satisfaction ( zado\u015b\u0107uczynienie ) arose on the parent \u2019s part . The lower courts had erred in that they had found that there was no adequate causal link between the LOC conduct in the applicant \u2019s case and the fact that she had not had access to legal abortion . In this respect the court noted that there had been enough time DATE of the pregnancy , when the suspicions had arisen , and DATE , when the time - limit for legal abortion had expired , to carry out genetic testing . When the tests had finally been carried out , the applicant had received the results DATE . The tests should therefore have been carried out immediately after the suspicions had arisen , but instead , as a result of procrastination on the part of doctors GPE , GPE and GPE , they had ultimately been conducted much later .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court finally held that the amount of FAC CARDINAL,CARDINAL to be paid by doctor PERSON for denigrating statements he had made in a", "CARDINAL . Hence , the judgment had to be quashed and the case remitted for reexamination in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment . It stated , referring to the findings of ORG , that PERSON had failed to refer the applicant for genetic testing as soon as the suspicions as to the NORP condition had arisen . He had referred her twice to the GPE hospital , despite the fact that she had already been at that hospital and that no genetic tests had been carried out at that time . The court held that the applicant \u2019s claim of ORG should therefore be allowed .", "CARDINAL . It further amended the judgment of the first - instance court by increasing to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL the just satisfaction to be paid to the applicant by S.B. for breach of her personal rights in making denigrating public statements about her in the press .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the action was directed against the T. hospital , the court held that the applicant had not received a proper diagnosis . PERSON , working at the NORP hospital , had not referred her for genetic testing , but only to FAC , even though he had been aware that genetic testing was not carried out there . When the applicant had eventually received the results of the tests and , relying on them , had asked PERSON on DATE to perform an abortion , a written negative reply had been served on DATE , namely on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In respect of ORG , the court noted that when the applicant had been admitted there on DATE , she had already had the results of the scan made by Professor PERSON . in ORG , which strongly indicated that the foetus was affected with ORG syndrome . In such circumstances , the hospital was under an obligation to carry out tests in order to either confirm or dispel these suspicions , but had failed to do so . Other tests had been carried out instead , concerning a possible inflammatory condition of the foetus , which were irrelevant for the diagnosis of ORG syndrome . The hospital had exposed the applicant to unnecessary stress , while the correct diagnosis had not been made . The defendants had been aware that time was of the essence in the availability of legal abortion , but had failed to accelerate their decision - taking . The hospitals were liable for the negligent acts of their employees in so far as it was their duty to provide the applicant with full information about any genetic disorder of the foetus and how it might affect its development and to do so in time for her to prepare herself for the prospect of giving birth to a child with a genetic disorder . Moreover , the doctors had failed to make any record of their refusals and the grounds for them , an obligation imposed on them by LAW .", "CARDINAL . As ORG had a higher referral level , its liability was more serious as a high level of professional skill could have been reasonably expected of it . The applicant had legitimately expected that she would obtain diagnostic and therapeutic treatment of the requisite quality , whereas her case had in fact been handled with unjustifiable delays .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the GPE failure to respect the applicant \u2019s rights , the court awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL against ORG against ORG , and dismissed the remainder of her appeal .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG also notes that , in member states where abortion is permitted for a number of reasons , conditions are not always such as to guarantee women effective access to this right : the lack of local health care facilities , the lack of doctors willing to carry out abortions , the repeated medical consultations required , the time allowed for changing one \u2019s mind and the waiting time for the abortion all have the potential to make access to safe , affordable , acceptable and appropriate abortion services more difficult , or even impossible in practice .", "CARDINAL .
