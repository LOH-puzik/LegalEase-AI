The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They have been living in a stable relationship for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application to enter into a registered partnership under LAW ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of PERSON dismissed their application in accordance with sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of LAW , finding that the applicants did not meet the legal requirements , as the registered partnership was exclusively reserved for same - sex couples .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . Citing , inter alia , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , they complained of discrimination based on their sex and their sexual orientation . The NORP Regional Governor ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal on DATE , arguing with reference to PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) that as GPE were allowed to restrict access to marriage to different - sex couples , it would appear unreasonable not to allow them to reserve access to registered partnerships exclusively for same - sex couples .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently lodged complaints with both ORG and ORG , arguing that marriage was not a suitable option for them , as it was substantially different from a registered partnership . In their view , a registered partnership was in many ways more modern and \u201c lighter \u201d than marriage . The applicants put forward several examples : the different statutory time - limit for divorce versus the time - limit for dissolution of a registered partnership in the event of an irretrievable breakdown ( unheilbare GPE ) of the relationship ; the alimony payment obligations following a divorce / dissolution where blame could be placed on CARDINAL spouse / partner ; the obligations conferred by the respective legal institutions , in particular as regards trust , faithfulness and contributions to the household ; and the consequences of a declaration of the death of a spouse / partner . The applicants argued that the ORG \u2019s considerations in PERSON and PERSON in respect of marriage were not applicable to the registered partnership , which was a new legal institution , introduced in DATE . It was therefore neither based on a long - standing discriminatory tradition and deep - rooted social connotations , nor aimed at possible procreation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG complaint . The relevant parts of its judgment read as follows :", "\u201c LAW ] only applies to the traditional civil marriage ... , which has \u2018 deep - rooted social and cultural ORG and was , in the historical context , clearly understood \u2018 in its traditional ORG , case of PERSON and PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL ) . If the ORG , in its judgment in the case of PERSON and PERSON , considers that the national provisions in ORG member GPE are diverse and range from allowing same - sex marriage to explicitly forbidding it , and concludes from this that , as matters stand , the question whether or not to allow same - sex marriage is left to regulation by domestic law ( ORG , case of PERSON and PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) , this must , in view of the small number of GPE providing for a registered partnership for differentsex couples in addition to marriage , be even more valid for this question .", "As the [ Convention ] has to be read as a whole and its ORG have to be construed in harmony with one another , and as LAW ] does not grant different - sex couples , in addition to the right to marry , a right to enter into a registered partnership , the prohibition of discrimination pursuant to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW ] , a provision of more general purpose and scope , can not be interpreted as imposing such an obligation beyond the scope of LAW ] either ( see , concerning the correlating question of the right of same - sex couples to marry , which can not be derived from LAW ] either , ORG , case of PERSON and PERSON , LAW ) .", "...", "[ ORG the NORP legislator has provided for the possibility of legal recognition for same - sex couples by introducing the registered partnership , people may rely on the prohibition of discrimination provided for by LAW ] ...", "The ORG has also stated , however , in the case of PERSON and PERSON , that the legislator may restrict access to marriage to different - sex couples because it has a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred by alternative means of recognition . Moreover , the ORG assumes that LAW allows couples to obtain , in many aspects , a legal status that is equal or comparable to marriage ; apart from parental rights , there were only slight differences ( see ORG , case of PERSON and PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "Given that persons of different sex have access to marriage ( see the [ explanatory report on the draft law ] ) ; the registered partnership was introduced only to counter discrimination against same - sex couples ; [ the registered partnership ] should , in substance , have the same effects as marriage ; different - sex couples are not a group ( historically ) discriminated against ; and there is no NORP consensus on this matter , it does not amount to a violation of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW ] if the NORP legislator does not grant different - sex couples access to the registered partnership .", "...", "ORG is not called upon to examine whether the particular differences between these legal institutions , as regards the legal consequences and dissolution options , comply with the principle of equality [ PERSON ] and the prohibition of discrimination pursuant to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW ] , since the only question to be examined is whether different - sex couples have a constitutional right to access to the registered partnership . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
