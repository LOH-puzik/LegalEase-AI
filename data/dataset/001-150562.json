NORP The publishing company PERSON , registered in GPE , publishes DATE newspapers including PERSON , PERSON and Express . The chairman of the supervisory board of the publishing company is Mr PERSON , son of PERSON PERSON PERSON and PERSON , who died in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants , journalists for the online magazine ORG , published an article concerning the so - called \u201c aryanisation profits \u201d ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) of NORP during the NORP regime and the role of the PERSON family in these activities .

There the journalist and historian PERSON sowed doubts .

These parts of the article referred to the following CARDINAL real estate purchases :", "CARDINAL . In DATE a mutual insurance company situated in GPE , and which insured the employees of the PERSON company , purchased real estate situated at CARDINAL GPE in GPE from Mr GPE , a NORP who was persecuted and died shortly afterwards . In DATE the legal heirs of PERSON renounced any restitution claims after having primarily lodged such claims .", "CARDINAL . According to the denazification file of Mr PERSON , in DATE PERSON bought real estate in Leyboldstra\u00dfe in GPE , which was owned by a Mr A. ORG . Mr PERSON was a NORP who had emigrated in DATE . Therefore his property was liquidated by a curator . In DATE PERSON and Mr PERSON ( now known as PERSON ) reached a settlement concerning the structural condition of the property in DATE ( price , size , value and cultivation ) and restitution claims . In this settlement the property was declared as being in essence undeveloped except for cellar walls and concrete foundations .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore in DATE PERSON purchased real estate , located in LOC in GPE for CARDINAL PERSON . The vendor was the PERSON company , which had purchased the real estate DATE before at auction for CARDINAL PERSON . The former owner of the property was a company belonging to a NORP couple who had fled GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The chairman of the supervisory board of the publishing company , Mr PERSON , instituted an action for an interim injunction with ORG after the ORG article was published , in which he precisely indicated the parts of the article which he considered not to be true .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG and afterwards ORG issued an interim injunction and ordered the applicants to refrain from disseminating certain parts of the article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prohibited in particular any further publication of the following elements of the published article , subject to penalty ( \u201c strafbew\u00e4hrte LOC ) of MONEY for each contravention , under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code taken in conjunction with LAW , read in the light of the right to protection of personality rights ( \u201c ORG \u201d , see \u00a7 \u00a7 QUANTITY seq . , below ) :", "\u201c ... to refrain from giving the impression that the plaintiff \u2019s family unlawfully enriched itself during the NORP regime with foreign fortune , in particular by statements such as \u201c the plaintiff \u2019s family PERSON made aryanisation profits when purchasing the real estate in Leyboldstr . DATE , GPE CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and FAC \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the relevant passages of the article in question amounted to a serious interference with Mr PERSON \u2019s right to the protection of his personality rights . ORG considered that the impugned statements had to be classified as statements of fact . A statement of fact had to be assumed when a passage of an article or an article as a whole led the reader to draw a peremptory conclusion from it . In ORG view , the article in question mainly made statements of fact because the term \u201c aryanisation profit \u201d , used in the context of the purchase of real estate , created the impression that the PERSON family had enriched itself unlawfully during the NORP regime with foreign fortune by abusing the predicament in which the NORP population found itself . The veracity of that statement could be proved . ORG found that , the impugned statement being a statement of fact and not a value judgment , the burden of proof concerning the veracity of the statement lay with the applicants . However , the applicants had failed to prove the veracity of the allegations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , regarding the real estate in Leyboldstra\u00dfe , ORG stated that the mere claim that the purchase price had been below the current market value was insufficient , because this was a general assumption due to the political situation in GPE at that time and the fact that NORP were persecuted and expropriated . The ORG statement that the property was a built - up area was contradicted by statements and proof provided by the plaintiff , Mr PERSON . He had stated that an old building had been demolished in DATE and a subsequent settlement between PERSON and Mr PERSON expressly declared that the property had not been developed in DATE , apart from concrete foundations and cellar walls . As a consequence , the applicants\u2019 reference to an address book of GPE ( the \u201c GPE \u2019s address book \u201d ) as proof was considered to be too imprecise und therefore insufficient .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the real estate in LOC ORG found that the applicants had failed to substantiate that the PERSON family had exploited the Jews\u2019 plight , firstly because the PERSON family had purchased the real estate DATE after the PERSON company had purchased it at auction for CARDINAL PERSON and secondly because the price paid by the PERSON family had exceeded the auction price by CARDINAL ORG . As this purchase did not indicate a clear exploitation of the Jews\u2019 plight , the statements were to be classified as false . As far as the applicants offered a statutory declaration by the historian PERSON as proof of this allegation , the court held that in view of this finding there was no need to pursue the proof provided by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the real estate in GPE ORG held that no profit had been made by the PERSON family because it had not been the PERSON family who had purchased the real estate , but a legally independent mutual insurance company situated in GPE and which insured the DuMont company \u2019s employees . Furthermore , other real estate , comparable to that in GPE , had been sold for similar prices around the same time .", "CARDINAL . The GPE Regional Court therefore concluded that the applicants had not proved the veracity of their statements as there had either been no profits made by the PERSON family or the evidence produced by the applicants had not been sufficient . As far as the applicants argued that the term \u201c aryanisation \u201d had to be classified as a value judgment , the court was of the opinion that , even when classified as a value judgment , it still had to be considered as ambivalent . It was necessary with ambivalent expressions to examine their admissibility on the basis of the interpretation which caused the most serious interference . Against this background the statements had to be regarded as untrue and thus were not protected by freedom of speech . Moreover , the court held that there had not been a legitimate interest in publishing the statements . It was true that the publication of untrue statements of fact could be justified . However , this was only the case if the person disseminating the information had tried sufficiently to verify the facts prior to publication and if any remaining doubts as to the truth of the facts had been made sufficiently clear . In the case at hand , the applicants had not even come close to exhausting all possibilities of establishing the facts and the article was far from being balanced coverage that also indicated doubts as to the truth of the statements .", "CARDINAL . As far as the plaintiff wanted the publication of other parts of the article to be prohibited , ORG allowed the action for CARDINAL part . For other parts the applicants made a declaration of discontinuance subject to penalty ( strafbew\u00e4hrte Unterlassungserkl\u00e4rung ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants against the judgment and refused to grant the applicants leave to appeal on points of law . It endorsed the reasoning of ORG . It expressly confirmed ORG finding that the statements were to be classified as statements of fact as they were open to objective verification and proof . Even if parts of the statements comprised value judgments , these were based on documented incidents like the denazification file of Mr PERSON , address books or files of the competent tax authority . As it was primarily these documents which were supposed to prove the conclusion that the PERSON family had participated in aryanisation profits , the main focus of the statements was not the expression of an opinion but a statement of facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG complaint about the refusal to grant them leave to appeal on points of law ( Nichtzulassungsbeschwerde ) , without giving further reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . The applicants claimed a violation of their right to freedom of expression insofar as ORG and ORG had ordered them to refrain from giving the impression that the plaintiff \u2019s family had unlawfully enriched itself during the NORP regime with foreign fortune , in particular by statements such as \u201c the plaintiff \u2019s family PERSON made aryanisation profits when purchasing the real estate in Leyboldstr . DATE , GPE CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and FAC CARDINAL \u201d . The applicants claimed that ORG and ORG had omitted to clarify whether these passages of the article in question were to be classified as statements of facts or value judgments . The classification as \u201c ambivalent expressions \u201d was an oversimplification contravening ORG case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the constitutional complaint without providing reasons .", "CARDINAL . The claim underlying the injunction was based on an analogy to Article CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , read in conjunction with the second sentence of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code taken together with LAW . It is the well - established case - law of the NORP courts that a person whose personality rights are jeopardised by another individual may DATE under certain specified conditions DATE lodge a claim against the latter pursuant to these provisions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
