In DATE , the applicant , then aged DATE , was convicted of murder and sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure . The \u201c tariff \u201d part of the applicant \u2019s sentence , attributable to deterrence and punishment , was set at DATE and expired in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the expiry of his tariff , the applicant \u2019s case was the subject of review by ORG on a number of occasions . Following the fourth review in DATE , the applicant absconded from prison . Following his recapture on DATE it was decided that his case should be reviewed again in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At this , the fifth review , which in fact took place in DATE , ORG recommended that the applicant be given a provisional release date of DATE hence , during which time he should spend DATE in a Category D open prison , followed by DATE in a ORG Scheme Hostel .", "CARDINAL . ORG recommendation was not accepted by the Secretary of ORG who directed that the applicant be transferred to a Category D prison and his case be subject to further review in DATE . The applicant was notified of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision and ORG recommendation by letter of CARDINAL DATE . By letter dated DATE , the applicant made representations against that decision . These were rejected by the Secretary of ORG by letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . Leave was refused by a single judge of ORG on DATE . The applicant was advised by counsel who represented him at the hearing that there was no tenable basis for appeal against the decision refusing leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was notified that , pursuant to interim measures introduced by the Secretary of ORG on DATE , the applicant \u2019s case would be referred back to ORG for review in the form of an oral hearing at which the applicant would be entitled to legal representation . That review took place on DATE and , by letter dated DATE , ORG recommended the applicant \u2019s release . The Home Secretary followed the recommendation and released the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder in respect of offenders under the age of CARDINAL known as detention during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) ; in respect of offenders between the age of DATE , custody for life ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) , and in respect of offenders aged CARDINAL and over , life imprisonment ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Murder ( Abolition of Death Penalty ) Act DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law , in contrast to discretionary life sentences which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences ( e.g. manslaughter , rape or robbery ) . The principles underlying the imposition of a discretionary life sentence are :", "CARDINAL . Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate in order that \u201c the prisoner \u2019s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large \u201d ( R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . Rep. CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The notion of detention during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure had its origins in an Act of CARDINAL for \u201c the safe custody of insane persons charged with offence \u201d . Section CARDINAL provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder , treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in \u201c strict custody until His ORG pleasure \u201d and described their custody as being \u201c during His < Majesty \u2019s > pleasure \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , detention during His LOC pleasure was introduced in respect of offenders aged DATE and then extended to cover those under DATE . The provision in force at present is LAW ) of ORG as amended ) which provides :", "\u201c A person convicted of an offence who appears to the ORG to have been under DATE at the time the offence was committed shall not , if he is convicted of murder , be sentenced to imprisonment for life nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on or recorded against any such person but in lieu thereof the court shall ... sentence him to be detained during Her ORG \u2019s pleasure and , if so sentenced , he shall be liable to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of ORG may direct . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of ex parte PERSON on DATE , PERSON in ORG held as follows in respect of detention during Her ORG \u2019s pleasure :", "\u201c At the time of sentencing , the detention orders under LAW were mandatory . It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder . But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive ( retribution and deterrence ) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied . The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period : see NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex . p. Doody & others [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL and GPE v. GPE ( DATE ) . The order for detention under section DATE is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate : it provides for detention \u2018 during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure\u2019 . ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which expressly authorised the Secretary of ORG to discharge the detainee on licence \u2018 at any time\u2019 was repealed by ORG provisions of LAW DATE , but this does not , in my judgment , alter the nature of the sentence in any material respect . ) I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that , notwithstanding ORG practice , the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether ORG rather than ORG governs his case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court accordingly held that the applicant in that case , who was detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure , should be afforded the same opportunity , as would be given a discretionary life prisoner , to see the material before ORG when it decided upon whether he should be released after his recall to prison on revocation of his licence .", "CARDINAL . Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment , custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure have a \u201c tariff \u201d set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . After the expiry of the tariff , the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence . Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change in DATE , in particular , following the coming into force on DATE of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the relevant provisions of LAW DATE , the regime applying to the release of discretionary and mandatory life prisoners was the same . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act provided inter alia that :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG may , if recommended to do so by ORG , release on licence a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life or custody for life or a person detained under LAW DATE ( young offenders convicted of grave crimes ) , but shall not do so in the case of a person sentenced to imprisonment for life or custody for life or to detention during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure or for life except after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of GPE and the trial judge if available . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act instituted changes to the regime applicable to the release of discretionary life prisoners following the decision of ORG in the case of GPE , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , after the tariff has expired , the prisoner may require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined . Pursuant to ORG DATE which came into force on DATE , a prisoner is entitled to an oral hearing , to disclosure of all evidence before ORG and to legal representation . He is also entitled to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross - examine those who have written reports about him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regime applicable to mandatory life prisoners was , however , preserved within LAW . LAW of the DATE LAW provides insofar as relevant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If recommended to do so by ORG , the Secretary of ORG may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The criterion for determining whether re - detention is justified is that of dangerousness , meaning a consideration of whether the offence constitutes an unacceptable risk of physical danger to the life or limb of the public ( see R v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex . parte PERSON , unreported , transcript pp . DATE ; and the PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I , at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In light of the judgments of the ORG in the cases of PERSON v. the GPE and PERSON v. the GPE ( PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , loc . cit . p. CARDINAL , and PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL-I , p. CARDINAL ) , the Secretary of ORG announced , on DATE , the introduction of interim measures taking effect from DATE which changed the procedure under which the cases of prisoners detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure were reviewed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to these measures , the review took the form of an oral hearing at which prisoners were entitled to legal representation and to examine and cross - examine witnesses . Prisoners also normally received full disclosure of all material relevant to the question of whether they should be released prior to the hearing . Pending amendment of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW , ORG did not , however , have power to direct the release of any prisoner . This remained the prerogative of the Secretary of ORG subject to consultation with the judiciary , as required by CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
