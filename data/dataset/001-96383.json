RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON , PERSON GPE and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , respectively , and live in the town of ORG in FAC of GPE .", "On DATE the Government adopted regulations on ORG ( the \u201c Register \u201d ) . Information on taxpayers was to be entered in the ORG on the basis of taxpayer 's individual identification numbers ( \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0430 ( \u0418\u041d\u041d ) , the \u201c taxpayer 's number \u201d ) . The taxpayer 's number was a CARDINAL - digit sequence which included DATE for the regional tax inspectorate , the taxpayer 's sequential number , and the check value .", "On an unspecified date the applicants submitted applications to district tax inspectorate no . CARDINAL of FAC to have their taxpayers ' numbers cancelled on the ground that the numbers \u201c had been assigned to them through ignorance ... because that number is a forerunner of the mark of the PERSON as it is said in the Apocalypse , Revelation , CARDINAL:CARDINAL - CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u201d . They claimed that they did not refuse to pay taxes but merely sought an opportunity \u201c to exercise freely the rights of a NORP citizen without the taxpayer 's identification number \u201d .", "On DATE , DATE and other dates the tax inspectorate responded to their applications in the following terms :", "\u201c An individual interacting with the tax authority is not assigned a number , he is merely issued with a certificate showing his status as a taxpayer and the taxpayer 's number . And there is an important distinction ; the number does not replace the person 's NORP name and it does not contain information on the person 's family status or relationships with parents , friends or other persons ... In any event , the taxpayer 's number is , in essence , nothing more than the number of his personal account at the tax authority . Similar numbers were introduced for accounting of payers by ORG and ORG ...", "In the final document of the CARDINALth Plenary Session of ORG of ORG held in GPE on DATE the following conclusion , in particular , was made : acceptance or non - acceptance of individual numbers is not , by any means , a religious question or a sinful deed . This is a matter of personal choice that has no religious significance ... \u201d", "The tax inspectorate informed the applicant that ORG had prepared for NORP believers a special questionnaire approved by ORG ( ORG ) on CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE , and invited them to their offices for a discussion . It is unclear whether the applicants attended the discussion and what its outcome was .", "In DATE the applicants complained to a court , claiming that the taxpayer 's number had been \u201c imposed on them contrary to their religious convictions \u201d . They submitted that the interference with their right to freedom of religion was not absolutely necessary , because their demands did not violate other citizens ' rights and because before DATE the tax system had operated without any personal numbers .", "On DATE the NORP ORG of FAC gave a judgment on their complaint . Referring to ORG decision of DATE ( see below ) , ORG found that the tax inspectorate had lawfully acted within its competence and that the allocation of the taxpayer 's number did not interfere with the claimants ' private life or their right to act in accordance with their religious beliefs .", "The applicants lodged a statement of appeal . They claimed that the ORG had violated their right to follow their beliefs by imposing on them a \u201c mark of sin \u201d in the form of the taxpayer 's number .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . It emphasised that :", "\u201c ... the identification number does not replace the person 's name and may be used , alongside with other tax accounting data , solely for the purposes of taxation ; it does not encroach on the citizen 's person or rights . \u201d", "On DATE ORG declared inadmissible a complaint by a group of individuals who claimed that attribution of a taxpayer 's number without the taxpayer 's consent violated their constitutional rights to respect for their private life and to freedom of religion and belief . It found , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c The taxpayer 's number is a numerical code consisting of CARDINAL sequential digits ... Thus , any appearance in the taxpayer 's number of a certain number that might hurt the taxpayer 's religious feelings is fortuitous ; the taxpayer 's number does not replace the person 's name and shall be used , alongside with other tax data , solely for the purposes of tax accounting . Accordingly , there is no reason to assert that [ LAW ] violates the right to freedom of religion or the prohibition on collecting , storing , using and disseminating information about an individual without his or her consent . Besides , LAW does not prevent the taxpayer 's number from being changed in cases where the taxpayer 's religious convictions so require ...", "Since [ LAW ] does not encroach , as such , on the claimants ' constitutional rights and freedoms , the present complaint is inadmissible ... \u201d", "LAW of LAW ( Federal Law no . CARDINAL-FZ of DATE ) provides :", "\u201c Every taxpayer ... shall be assigned a unique identification taxpayer 's number .", "The tax authorities shall mention the taxpayer 's number in all documents sent to the taxpayer .", "Every taxpayer shall mention his taxpayer 's number in all declarations , reports , statements and other documents submitted to the tax authorities ... \u201d", "By Federal Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , the following paragraph was added to LAW :", "\u201c Individuals who are not registered as self - employed entrepreneurs shall have the right not to mention their taxpayer 's numbers in the submitted documents on the condition that they have listed their personal data enumerated in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW [ name , date and place of birth , address , passport and citizenship ] . \u201d", "On DATE ORG of ORG adopted an appeal to believers concerning taxpayer 's identification numbers . It held , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c We want to state clearly : fear not the external symbols and signs , for no delusion created by the enemy to human souls may prevail the God 's grace that abounds in ORG ...", "To those who attempt to link the identification numbers with the ' antichrist 's mark ' we remind that the tradition of the holy fathers understood the marks as a sign certifying deliberate repudiation of NORP ... In spite of that tradition it is occasionally claimed that a technological act allegedly may , by itself , create turmoil in the innermost depths of the human soul leading to NORP 's oblivion . Such a superstition is at variance with the NORP interpretation of the Revelation of St John the Divine , according to which the ' mark of the Beast ' will be received by those who deliberately put faith in him ' solely for the sake of his false miracles ' ( PERSON ) . No external mark may harm the spiritual health of the person unless it is a consequence of deliberate treason of GPE and profanation of faith ... \u201d", "In DATE , ORG issued a judgment in the case of PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , in which the parents of a DATE child contended that using a social security number to identify their daughter would \u201c steal her soul \u201d and violate their native NORP religious beliefs . By a majority , ORG found against the parents , holding as follows :", "\u201c Our cases have long recognized a distinction between the freedom of individual belief , which is absolute , and the freedom of individual conduct , which is not absolute . This case implicates only the latter concern ... Never to our knowledge has the ORG interpreted LAW to require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family . ORG simply can not be understood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens . Just as the Government may not insist that appellees engage in any set form of religious observance , so appellees may not demand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to identify their daughter .", "As a result , PERSON may no more prevail on his religious objection to the ORG 's use of a ORG number for his daughter than he could on a sincere religious objection to the size or color of the ORG 's filing cabinets . ORG affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion ; it does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the ORG 's internal procedures ...", "The statutory requirement that applicants provide a ORG number is wholly neutral in religious terms , and uniformly applicable . There is no claim that there is any attempt by ORG to discriminate invidiously , or any covert suppression of particular religious beliefs ...", "We conclude then that government regulation that indirectly and incidentally calls for a choice between securing a governmental benefit and adherence to religious beliefs is wholly different from governmental action or legislation that criminalizes religiously inspired activity or inescapably compels conduct that some find objectionable for religious reasons ... In the enforcement of a facially neutral and uniformly applicable requirement for the administration of welfare programs reaching CARDINAL of people , the Government is entitled to wide latitude ... Absent proof of an intent to discriminate against particular religious beliefs or against religion in general , the Government meets its burden [ of proof ] when it demonstrates that a challenged requirement for governmental benefits , neutral and uniform in its application , is a reasonable means of promoting a legitimate public interest ... \u201d", "A subsequent case before ORG , Employment Div . v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , concerned CARDINAL individuals who were fired from their job for ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of their ORG . ORG affirmed its approach , finding as follows :", "\u201c Although a ORG would be ' prohibiting the free exercise [ of religion ] ' in violation of the ORG if it sought to ban the performance of ( or abstention from ) physical acts solely because of their religious motivation , the ORG does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a law that incidentally forbids ( or requires ) the performance of an act that his religious belief requires ( or forbids ) if the law is not specifically directed to religious practice and is otherwise constitutional as applied to those who engage in the specified act for nonreligious reasons ...", "The government 's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct , like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy , ' can not depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector 's spiritual development . ' ... To make an individual 's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law 's coincidence with his religious beliefs , except where the ORG 's interest is ' compelling ' \u2013 permitting him , by virtue of his beliefs , ' to become a law unto himself , ' ... \u2013 contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
