Early in DATE the applicant 's husband died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG to the Sick and Housebound wrote to ORG ( LANGUAGE - beh\u00f6rde ) , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c For the following reasons [ the applicant 's ] treatment and care is causing increasing difficulty ; for DATE now it has become impossible . Our programme is being disrupted : virtually every day we must stand outside a closed door and wait until He . M , her son , perhaps deigns to open it , scantily dressed . Frequently , we must try again at another time ... A collection of newspapers , cardboard boxes and full plastic bags makes it difficult for us to gain access to the equipment we need for our work ... If [ the applicant ] is bedridden , which she was from DATE to CARDINAL DATE because of the lack of heating in the rooms , we are unable to undertake even the minimum care of [ her ] on account of the chaos in the room [ i m r\u00e4umlichen Debakel ] ...

From DATE the association 's doctor ceased to visit the applicant , who continued to live with He . M.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) requested ORG ( ORG ) to place the applicant in an old people 's nursing home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC Governor visited the applicant . The applicant explained that , as a rule , her son did the cooking and that she was given enough to eat . She could go to the toilet unassisted , and washed herself in the kitchen . Her leg sores were washed and treated by a woman who helped her . The applicant also stated that she did not wish to go to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's placement for an unlimited period in GPE on account of serious neglect ( schwere PERSON ) . The ORG relied on ORG et seq . of ORG ( PERSON ) and LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die f\u00fcrsorgerische GPE ) of the GPE of GPE . The order requested the municipal police , together with the health inspectors , to implement the order on DATE . The order noted that the applicant required permanent treatment in view of her leg sores and cataract , that she no longer received care from a doctor or an association , and that it was not certain that she had enough to eat . The order , referring to intolerable conditions of hygiene in the unheated flat , stated that this situation , which had already lasted for DATE , would not change in the foreseeable future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in the S. Nursing Home in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and He . PERSON , her son , each filed an appeal ( PERSON ) with LAW Rekurskommission ) of the GPE of GPE . ORG consisted of CARDINAL judges , its president being a lawyer . The other QUANTITY persons were specialised judges , CARDINAL of whom , the rapporteur , was a doctor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG conducted a hearing at which the applicant , He . PERSON , their lawyer , a member of ORG and a representative of ORG were present . According to the record of the hearing , the applicant explained that she had no reason to be unhappy with the nursing home , that , as she could no longer walk , it would be better for her to stay there , and that she did not see how matters could get better for her . However , she also said that she \u201c wanted to get out of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeals DATE . As to the facts it found :", "\u201c The situation at [ the applicant 's home ] was apparently catastrophic , CARDINAL parties found it necessary to file reports or make statements . It is noted in the file that lately [ the applicant ] had taken to staying in bed , her eyesight was very poor , and she could not walk or stand properly . According to her own submissions , she has to hold on to support wherever she goes . She needs a wheelchair , but does not have one at home . The flat was not heated , there was refuse everywhere , and no one was catering for meals . The nurse responsible for [ the applicant 's ] care had already stated on a previous occasion that her leg sores had not healed because of her living conditions . The nurse now states that in DATE of care she had noticed a serious loss of body weight , which she attributed to the fact that [ the applicant 's son ] was not taking sufficient care to ensure that his mother was eating properly . A certain Mr Hi . , who had brought [ the applicant ] home after her stay in hospital , had been horrified by the state of the flat and said that it was not heated . The fruit vendor also reported that the situation was horrific . When PERSON , the head of the social services , had been asked how [ the applicant ] responded to the nursing home , she had answered that she had been present when [ the applicant ] had arrived . At that time [ the applicant ] had not been able to walk , she was not properly dressed ( she was wearing nylon tights and a torn woollen jacket ) and smelled badly . PERSON was shocked and declared that she had never seen a person in such a state , although she had a long experience in guardianship matters . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its decision ORG considered that CARDINAL grounds had been made out under LAW that justified withdrawing the applicant 's liberty on grounds of welfare assistance . Firstly , the applicant had been neglected , as she was no longer able to tend to her most basic dietary and hygiene needs . She could not even dress herself . Without outside help she was confined to bed . Since ORG to the Sick and Housebound had stopped visiting , the problem was unresolved , particularly as the applicant refused to go into the S. Nursing Home voluntarily . In respect of the second ground , ORG considered that \u201c during the hearing it had come to the conclusion that the applicant had a mental disability ( senile dementia ) \u201d ( Geistesschw\u00e4che ( altersbedingte Demenz ) ) . In view of that disability , ORG considered that the applicant 's placement in a nursing home \u201c would be justified even if it was considered that the degree of neglect was not sufficiently serious \u201d . The decision continued :", "\u201c In this context , the appellants ' argument is not helped by the fact that [ the applicant ] has accepted that she needs to go into a nursing home , as she explained during the appeal hearing . It is true that there would be no need for deprivation of liberty on grounds of welfare assistance if [ the applicant ] went to reside at the S. Nursing Home of her own free will . However , it transpires from the case file that although she has already frequently stated that she was now willing to enter PERSON voluntarily , finally this has not happened . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , if the applicant were released , she would return to her son , who was unable to provide sufficient care for her , as he was himself an invalid with poor eyesight . Yet , the S. Nursing Home , which could provide the necessary care , was ideal for the applicant as it was in an area she knew . Indeed , the applicant was hardly aware of the deprivation of liberty , which was minimal , and in fact it mainly affected her son , who did not want to leave his mother . ORG further found that the deprivation of liberty on grounds of welfare assistance complied with LAW ) of the LAW , since that provision also permitted a deprivation of liberty in cases of vagrancy , a term that was to be understood in a wide sense .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her son He . PERSON lodged a public - law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) which ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed on DATE . The decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant and her son complained that ORG had not examined whether less stringent measures were possible , the court found :", "\u201c The ORG concludes on the facts that the first appellant [ the applicant ] is no longer capable of looking after and caring for herself , feeding herself or even dressing herself ; without outside help she would be confined to bed ; the second appellant [ the applicant 's son ] who is an invalid , and is in fact no longer able to see , is unable to look after her , and there is nobody else who is in a position to care for her ; other attempts which have been made to resolve this problem have failed ; in the end , placement in the S. Nursing Home at ORG has been considered to be the only means of preventing neglect . ORG has therefore duly considered the proportionality of the deprivation of liberty ...", "Whether in the case of the first appellant there exists , apart from serious neglect , some mental disability which would also justify a deprivation of liberty in itself DATE a point which is challenged by the appellants DATE and whether procedural rules have allegedly been breached in connection with this ground of detention , are matters which do not need to be examined , particularly as the appellants have been unsuccessful in their appeal against the [ applicant 's ] detention for serious neglect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lifted the applicant 's placement order as she had agreed to reside in the nursing home of her own free will .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINALa et seq . of the NORP Civil Code concern the withdrawal of liberty on grounds of welfare assistance ( f\u00fcrsorgerische GPE ) . Article ORG provides :", "\u201c An elderly or incapacitated person may be placed or retained in a suitable institution on account of mental illness , mental disability , alcoholism , other addictions or serious neglect , if the person can not otherwise be afforded the necessary personal care .", "In this context , account must be taken of the burden which the person places on his or her environment .", "The person concerned must be released as soon as the situation permits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALe , which lays down the procedure in such cases , provides that \u201c in the case of mentally ill persons a decision can only be taken on the basis of an expert opinion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Deprivation of Liberty on Grounds of Welfare Assistance Act of the GPE of GPE implements ORG et seq . of LAW . Sections CARDINAL et seq . of the LAW concern \u201c measures without deprivation of liberty \u201d . Section CARDINAL provides that ORG ( LANGUAGE - beh\u00f6rde ) shall secure the necessary personal assistance for persons who put themselves or others in danger on account of mental illness , mental disability , alcoholism , other addictions or serious neglect . Under LAW , ORG may order care measures if guardianship measures do not suffice ; such measures may be renewed after DATE and standard social - work procedures are to be followed . Sections CARDINAL et seq . concern the \u201c deprivation of liberty on grounds of welfare assistance \u201d .
