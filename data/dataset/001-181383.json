On DATE ORG quashed the secondinstance judgment of ORG and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pest Central District Court received from the applicant a request under LAW on the Civil Aspects of ORG ( Articles DATE ) and the Brussels II bis Regulation for the child to be returned to GPE . The applicant maintained that PERSON \u2019s place of residence was in GPE and that under NORP law parents exercised their custody rights jointly . PERSON had decided on the child \u2019s place of residence without his approval . On DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , and DATE , DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE the court examined the request in the presence of both parents .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the request under LAW of LAW . Relying on the definition of child abduction , as provided in LAW , the court found that PERSON had abducted PERSON from his habitual residence in GPE , where the parents had exercised their custody rights jointly . However , on the basis of the evidence before it , the court concluded that if PERSON ( who was still being breastfed ) were returned to GPE , he would be placed in uncertain circumstances , only seeing his mother DATE for TIME . It emphasised that according to the applicant \u2019s own submissions , he was away from home from TIME and that it would be difficult for him to look after the child during DATE . Thus , as he suggested , his sister would look after PERSON The court also noted that the applicant had lodged his request DATE after PERSON \u2019s abduction and that although he had visited GPE on a number of occasions , he had not been in contact with PERSON , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the first - instance decision on DATE . It reiterated the conclusion of the first - instance court that there was a grave risk that PERSON \u2019s return to GPE would expose him to harm . In this aspect the court found relevant that PERSON was only one and a half years old and if returned to GPE he would be deprived of all maternal care . Thus , under LAW , the NORP courts were not bound to order the child \u2019s return . The court also held that LAW of LAW was not applicable , since no measures or arrangements were available to secure the protection of PERSON after his return .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a petition for judicial review of this decision with the GPE . He argued that LAW was applicable to exceptional circumstances only and that neither the child \u2019s age nor his closer connection to his mother had any bearing on the matter and could not constitute a decisive element in the decision to refuse to order the child \u2019s return to his habitual residence . He also argued that he had contributed to the child \u2019s care and that his employment , which allowed him to provide for his family , could not be held against him . Furthermore , the decisions had failed to take into account ORG \u2019s best interests , which lay in his being raised by both of his parents . He also maintained that his lack of contact with PERSON was due to PERSON \u2019s own conduct and the fact that he had not been aware of the child \u2019s place of residence until DATE . Finally , the lower - instance courts had not respected the DATE deadline stipulated by LAW bis Regulation .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON dismissed the applicant \u2019s petition for judicial review on DATE . According to its reasoning both the Brussels II bis ORG and LAW had established the presumption that a child \u2019s interests could best be served by his immediate return to his habitual residence . However , LAW this presumption could be rebutted in exceptional circumstances . It agreed with the applicant that the child \u2019s young age , his close connection to the parent living in GPE and his NORP roots could not serve as a basis for the refusal to order his return to GPE . It nonetheless held that at the time of his abduction PERSON had only been DATE and that a considerable time had passed without him having contact with the applicant . The reason for this was that the applicant had refused to see PERSON at the premises of a child protection service , as suggested by PERSON The PERSON also found it important that according to the applicant \u2019s own statements his sister would take care of PERSON if the child were returned to GPE and that , according to the decision of the NORP courts , PERSON would only have very limited contact with L. Furthermore , there was no information about any measure of protection envisaged in the event of L. \u2019s return . Thus , the GPE concluded that the return of the child , who was DATE , to an unknown environment would cause serious psychological harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON initiated custody proceedings in respect of PERSON before FAC ; she also requested the court to adopt an interim measure placing L. under her custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , regard being had to the judgments delivered by the NORP courts . On DATE the Szombathely High Court overturned this decision and ordered ORG to examine whether the judgments of the NORP courts could be recognised and if not whether it had jurisdiction in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings again , finding that PERSON could have exercised her procedural rights before the NORP courts , submitting her written observations through her representative in the course of the appellate proceedings . This decision was overturned again by ORG on DATE owing to procedural errors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant tried to abduct L. , who was walking with his grandfather on the street . Following the incident PERSON lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant and requested that a restriction order be imposed on him . On DATE ORG issued a restriction order in respect of the applicant , which was subsequently overturned on appeal on the grounds that the mother herself had not been a victim of violent behaviour on the part of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in an interim decision , ORG decided not to recognise the judgments adopted by FAC tribunal de grande instance and ORG , established that it did have jurisdiction in the matter , and temporarily placed L. in his mother \u2019s sole custody . According to ORG the NORP courts had found that the interests of the child could best be served by his return to GPE . However , the proceedings before FAC tribunal de grande instance had failed to respect PERSON \u2019s right to a fair trial , since DATE owing to the fact that the applicant had given false information to the NORP authorities \u2013 she had not been informed of the proceedings and had not been able to be heard in person . Thus , the court concluded that the decision could not be recognised , pursuant to LAW ) of ORG . It also held that it had jurisdiction LAW of the Brussels II bis Regulation , since the child \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE . As to the interim resolution of custody rights , the ORG held that the interests of the child could be best served if he remained in his habitual environment \u2013 that is to say in the company of his mother and maternal grandparents DATE and that removing him from GPE would pose a risk of causing him psychological harm .", "CARDINAL . Following a further appeal , on DATE ORG overturned the decision concerning custody rights and remitted the case to the first - instance court . As to the decision on the non - recognition of the judgments delivered by the NORP courts , it found that recognition could not be refused on the basis that PERSON had not been heard in person before the NORP courts , since the Brussels II bis Regulation did not stipulate such an obligation and the mother could have submitted written observations . Nonetheless , the court found that the recognition of the foreign judgments could not be recognised , pursuant to Article PERSON ) of the Brussels II bis Regulation , since recognition would have been contrary to the public policy of GPE , given that the best interests of the child had only been respected in a formalistic way . According to ORG , restricting the mother \u2019s contact with TIME every second week would have caused harm to PERSON , especially since the applicant himself had stated that PERSON would be looked after by his sister . The court also had regard to the forensic psychiatric opinion prepared by Dr PERSON . PERSON on DATE and supplemented by PERSON on DATE , according to which from a psychological point of view \u2013 the enforcement of the NORP ORG judgment would constitute \u201c institutional abuse \u201d . Furthermore , the court found that no measures were being contemplated by the applicant to ensure the protection of the child after his return to GPE .", "A petition for judicial review lodged by the applicant with the PERSON was dismissed as time - barred on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG issued an interim decision on the exercise of parental custody and access rights . It noted that since DATE the applicant had seen his son CARDINAL times and had been in contact with him CARDINAL times via ORG . It held that PERSON needed to have contact with his father and therefore ruled that the applicant could visit him for TIME every second weekend and could contact him via ORG every other weekend . Given the applicant \u2019s violent behaviour towards the mother ( and previously towards the child \u2019s grandfather \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court held that the applicant \u2019s visits should take place under supervision . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a NORP arrest warrant against the applicant , who was detained in GPE on DATE . PERSON was placed in a childcare institution .", "CARDINAL .

Since in the meantime ORG had overturned the judgment of ORG , the applicant requested the enforcement of the judgment of the PERSON tribunal de grande instance and maintained that this judgment had been declared automatically enforceable . ORG held that the judgment of FAC tribunal de grande instance , under which no rights at all were granted to the mother at all , was contrary to the public policy of GPE since it did not respect fundamental rights , and in particular the best interest of the child , and refused by a decision of DATE to execute it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
