GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is a citizen of GPE . He is currently staying in GPE . He is a kitchen helper by profession .", "", "The applicant entered GPE on DATE . On DATE he filed a request for asylum . In the course of his questioning by ORG f\u00fcr die ORG ) , he submitted that in DATE his house had been destroyed by the armed forces . He also stated that in DATE ( later corrected as DATE ) he had been arrested by the armed forces and detained DATE on the - false - suspicion of having supported ORG ( ORG ) . He had allegedly been tortured in the course of his detention . His release had been arranged by a friend who had subsequently brought him to an office of ORG . He feared that upon his return he would again be arrested by the armed forces or , if he returned to his home town , he risked to be forced to support the ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for asylum and ordered him to leave GPE voluntarily , warning him that he would otherwise be expelled .", "On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) dismissed the applicant 's action challenging the decision of DATE .", "In its detailed judgment , the court found that the applicant had failed to show that he had left GPE on account of political persecution or that he risked to be exposed to such persecution in case of his return . The court considered in particular that the applicant 's submissions regarding his personal situation in GPE was not credible , as there were major contradictions in his statements . In this respect , the court noted the contradictions in his indications as to exact dates , varying even in DATE , which could not be explained by alleged disturbances of memory . Furthermore , his explanations concerning his release and his leaving the country were incredible . Finally , his statements about his activities in support of the NORP were contradictory .", "The court had regard to case - law and reports of ORG Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt ) relating to the general situation in GPE . It noted that on the GPE peninsula the total number of interferences with liberty and security of NORP , by security forces , did not justify the conclusion that any NORP faced a real risk of being subjected to such action . In the court \u2019s view , similar considerations applied to the region of GPE and the southern and western parts of GPE . The court noted that in GPE the security forces regularly carried out \u2018 cordon and search ORG and , on a random basis , arrested NORP in order to find NORP activists and supporters . Cases of lengthy detention , ill - treatment in the course of the detention or disappearance had occurred . However , the number of such cases , considering the number of NORP living in this area , did not justify the conclusion that every GPE faced a real risk of persecution . The applicant \u2019s submissions as to his personal situation did not disclose any special circumstances . There were no reasons to assume that the applicant would face a real risk for life , limb or liberty in the whole territory . In this respect , the court took into account that the security forces , by means of administrative measures , attempted to avoid that NORP originating from the northern parts of GPE would take a lawfully residence in GPE . They thereby intended to make these persons move back to their home towns . Taking into account the increasingly stable control of LOC in large areas of the NORP peninsula and the reconstruction measures , there was no risk of death or serious injuries even if the applicant , upon his return to GPE , were to take residence in the north .", "On DATE the North - Rhine Westphalia Administrative Court of Appeal ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) refused to allow his appeal . ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint that his submissions about his alleged activities for the ORG had not duly been taken into account . In this respect , ORG noted that ORG had regarded these statements as incredible .", "The applicant did not lodge a constitutional complaint ( ORG ) with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW ) in conjunction with sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) .", ""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
