She is represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in Stip , in the former GPE .", "In or DATE Mr P.S. , the applicant \u2019s brother , instituted civil proceedings before the then ORG ( PERSON \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) for termination of a care agreement ( \u201c the agreement \u201d ) that he had concluded on DATE with Mr G.P. Mr DATE claimed that Mr ORG had not provided him with a regular financial assistance , as specified by the agreement . Under the agreement , PERSON was authorised to collect the rent obtained from Mr PERSON \u2019s movable and immovable property , which would then have been transferred in his possession after Mr ORG death .", "On DATE ORG granted Mr DATE \u2019s application and terminated the DATE agreement . After examining considerable evidence , namely several witnesses , the parties to the proceedings and the correspondence between them , the court found that the agreement had not been carried out , as Mr P.S. had sufficient financial means and it had been he who had actually given money to Mr G.P , contrary to what had been agreed .", "On DATE the then ORG upheld PERSON appeal and quashed the lower court \u2019s decision , as it had not properly established whether the latter had fulfilled his obligations under the agreement .", "On DATE ORG upheld Mr P.S. \u2019s claim and terminated the agreement . After examining other witnesses and additional correspondence between the parties , the court held that PERSON had not provided Mr PERSON with a regular financial maintenance as agreed .", "On DATE ORG upheld PERSON appeal and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . It held that the trial court had not been established by law , as the case had been tried by a single judge instead of by a panel of judges .", "On an unspecified date in DATE Mr P.S. passed away . The latter \u2019s heirs , including the applicant , instituted inheritance proceedings concerning his property . By a court decision of DATE , they were instructed to institute separate civil proceedings to determine the ownership of the property at stake and to take over Mr PERSON \u2019s case . It appears that this decision was subsequently overturned by ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , by which the inheritance proceedings had been stayed . Mr ORG heirs , including the applicant , took over the case and joined the proceedings complained of .", "On DATE ORG upheld Mr P.S. \u2019s claim and terminated the agreement . The court held that the number of contacts between Mr G.P. and Mr P.S. had diminished over time and stopped DATE before the latter \u2019s death ; that PERSON had not given the DATE financial support to Mr P.S. as agreed and that it was the applicant who had started caring for him instead . It established that the applicant , despite prior misunderstandings with her late brother , had endeavoured to improve their personal relationships . The court also found that Mr DATE , as recognition of the applicant \u2019s efforts , had vowed that after his death all his property should be transferred in her possession .", "On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It overturned it in part concerning the trial costs entitling the applicant and the other heirs of Mr DATE to collect the reduced award .", "On DATE Mr ORG submitted to ORG an appeal on points of law ( \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) .", "On DATE the applicant states that she was provided with a copy of it .", "On DATE PERSON lodged with FAC a request for re - opening of the proceedings ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442a\u043f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 ) . He claimed that the courts had wrongly accepted the applicant and the others as claimants in the instant proceedings , as there had been no court decision ascertaining them as Mr PERSON \u2019s heirs . He further claimed that the courts had wrongly considered Mr PERSON as a party to the proceedings after his death . He also referred to another care agreement of DATE concluded between the same parties and to ORG decision of DATE , adopted in different set of proceedings , by which he had been allegedly recognised as an owner of the property on the basis of the DATE agreement .", "On DATE ORG Instance dismissed PERSON request for re - opening of the proceedings . It found that ORG decision of DATE had been made in administrative contentious proceedings ( \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 ) concerning administrative decisions for payment of personal income tax related to Mr ORG property . ORG had referred in this decision to ORG decision of DATE by which the inheritance proceedings concerning Mr PERSON \u2019s property had been stayed , as it had already been transferred into Mr ORG ownership by virtue of the DATE and DATE agreements . The court held that the facts , which ORG had referred to in its decision of DATE , could not be regarded as a new evidence that had been unknown to PERSON during the proceedings and that consequently , they could not be considered as a proper ground for re - opening of the proceedings . The court used the same reasoning to dismiss the other arguments for re - opening of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG upheld PERSON appeal and overturned the lower court \u2019s decision . It granted his request for re - opening of the proceedings and quashed the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , respectively , by which the DATE agreement had been terminated . It held that the evidence provided by PERSON had been new and that he could not have used it in the previous proceedings .", "On DATE the public prosecutor lodged with ORG a request for the protection of legality ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) against the appeal court \u2019s decision , as it had been incoherent and had lacked sufficient reasoning as to how the newly discovered evidence could have been beneficial for the party concerned if admitted in the previous proceedings .", "On DATE ORG upheld the public prosecutor \u2019s request and quashed ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed PERSON appeal against the court \u2019s decision of DATE . It reiterated the lower court \u2019s reasoning to dismiss PERSON request for re - opening of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG rejected ( \u043e\u0442\u0444\u0440\u043b\u0430 ) the appeal on points of law of DATE submitted against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court considered it as inadmissible as the value of the dispute fell below the statutory threshold . It accordingly rejected Mr ORG \u2019s appeal on points of law filed against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
