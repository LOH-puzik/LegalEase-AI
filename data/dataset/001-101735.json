They were represented before the Court by Ms L. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by PERSON , ORG and ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are of GPE origin . Following their qualification in DATE by the Borsod - Aba\u00faj - Zempl\u00e9n County Expert and ORG ( which consisted of a paediatrician , a psychologist and a specialist in therapeutic pedagogy ) as having mild intellectual disabilities ( enyhe fokban \u00e9rtelmi fogyat\u00e9kos ) , they were placed in a special class of ORG , as from DATE . This remedial class was taught physically segregated . The teacher , who was in charge of this class from DATE until DATE , did not have a degree in special pedagogy .", "The applicants ' intellectual ability was reviewed in DATE . This examination corroborated the findings of DATE .", "On DATE the applicants ' lawyer filed a criminal complaint against unknown perpetrators on charges of forging public documents and endangering minors . She alleged in essence that the school certificates issued in respect of the applicants and other pupils did not reflect their real situation in the special class , that the allegedly reduced curriculum jeopardised their intellectual progress , in particular because the teacher in charge did not have the appropriate qualification , and that the assignment of the applicants to the special class served the purpose of their physical segregation .", "In the course of the ensuing investigation conducted by ORG , a public education expert was appointed . Furthermore , a forensic psychologist examined the applicants in DATE . The findings of this expert were identical to those established in DATE . He found that Mr PERSON was mentally challenged ( \u00e9rtelmi s\u00e9r\u00fclt ) while Mr PERSON represented a borderline case of mental retardation ( ment\u00e1lisan retard\u00e1lt hat\u00e1reset ) . He concluded that their placement in the special class could not jeopardise their mental development in view of their original disabilities .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation . It observed that the legal hypothesis of the offence of endangerment of minors was only met if a grave breach of duty had been committed by the school officials , into which category lesser educational irregularities did not fall .", "On DATE the FAC finally dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant 's lawyer . It observed that a scrutiny of the documentation of the school had revealed only minor irregularities , rather than a forgery of documents . It also held that the testimonies given by the applicants and other pupils of the school contradicted the documents and the findings of the education expert and , given their subjective nature , were unsuitable for the establishment of a grave breach of duty on the part of the school 's officials . It moreover drew the applicants ' attention to the possibility of pursuing a civil action in respect of their allegations .", "Subsequently , the applicants ' lawyer retained a private expert in clinical psychology and public education . In that expert 's opinion , established in DATE , the applicants ' placement in the special class had endangered their mental and psychological development , because they had not suffered from the kind of serious mental disability which would justify their separate education .", "Relying on that opinion , on DATE the applicants ' lawyer preferred a private bill of indictment , on the charge of endangering minors , against both the director of the school and the pedagogical expert responsible for the review of the applicants ' intellectual ability in DATE . In the indictment it was alleged that their placement in the special class endangered the applicants ' mental , psychological and educational development . No mention of their ethnic origin or assertion of discrimination was made in the motion .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the motion without an examination on the merits . It observed that the charge in respect of the expert was incompatible ratione personae with section DATE ) of LAW and as such could not be retained , since she had never been under any obligation to educate , survey or take care of the applicants . Moreover , the charge in respect of the director was time - barred , since DATE had elapsed between her last relevant act in the case in DATE namely , when she had assigned an unqualified teacher to the special class \u2013 and the introduction of the motion by the applicants on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides as relevant :", "\u201c The ... school is fully liable , irrespective of its culpability , for any damage caused to ... a pupil in respect of ... [ his / her ] education ... ( tanul\u00f3i jogviszonnyal ... \u00f6sszef\u00fcgg\u00e9sben okozott ) . The provisions of the ... Civil Code shall be applicable to compensation [ for such damage ] , with the proviso that the institution ... can only be exempted from its liability if it proves that the damage was caused by force majeure ... \u201d", "Since DATE , compensation on this ground has been awarded by civil courts in several cases concerning allegations similar to those in the present application .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that any person under the obligation to educate , survey or take care of a minor , who commits a grave breach of duty flowing from this task , which results in the endangerment of the minor 's bodily , mental or moral development , shall be punishable with imprisonment of from DATE .", "According to the Commentary to LAW , a breach of duty is considered ' grave ' if the offender neglected his or her duty to such an extent that not even the minimum requirements of society were met .", "\u201c CARDINAL . In its third report , ORG urged the NORP authorities urgently to take further steps to end the over - representation of GPE children in special schools [ and ] recommended that measures be taken to facilitate the integration of GPE children then in special schools into the mainstream school system .", "DATE . ... According to information provided by the authorities , CARDINAL children who had been classified as having mental disabilities were reassessed by independent medical experts .", "CARDINAL . ORG notes that the efforts made to date to combat the disproportionate representation of NORP children in special schools for children with mental disabilities , though they have had some positive effects , can not be said to have had a major impact in practice so far . It stresses that , in parallel to assisting wrongly diagnosed children already in the special school system to return to the mainstream system , putting an end to this form of segregation also implies ensuring that children are not wrongly streamed into special schools . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
