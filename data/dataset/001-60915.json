The criminal proceedings against him , in which he stood accused of a number of offences including murder , manslaughter / grievous bodily harm , rape and narcotics offences , came to an end on DATE , when ORG ( PERSON ) confirmed the judgment of the \u2018 s - ORG ( gerechtshof ) of DATE in which the applicant had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . In imposing that sentence , ORG had taken into account the fact that the applicant had spent much of his pre - trial detention in maximum security . In addition , ORG had imposed a ORG order ( placement at the disposal of the Government \u2013 terbeschikkingstelling ) with confinement in a secure institution ( met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was initially detained in ordinary remand institutions ( huizen van bewaring ) . In a letter dated DATE to the governor of the remand institution where the applicant was detained at that time , ORG stated :", "\u201c ... I wish to inform you that a seriously increased safety risk exists in relation to [ the applicant ] . ORG [ PERSON Informatie DATE \u201c GRIP \u201d ] has obtained information DATE which has been examined by myself and which I have found to be sufficiently relevant , reliable and concrete but which should be protected for reasons of security \u2013 to the effect that [ the applicant ] is intending to escape from detention and to that purpose is managing to make contacts outside the penitentiary .", "An escape or breakout is liable to be accompanied by assistance from the outside and violence directed at others .", "I would further draw your attention to the fact that it also appears from the aforementioned information that [ the applicant ] has approached persons , or has had them approached on his behalf , in a threatening and intimidating manner .", "I advise you to take the appropriate measures to ensure the uninterrupted continuation of the [ applicant \u2019s ] detention as well as appropriate measures to prevent any damage , and in particular damage to persons , occurring outside the penitentiary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governor of the remand institution where the applicant was detained proposed to the special selection board of the maximum - security institution ( NORP PERSON \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) that the applicant be placed in the ORG which is part of the PERSON Penitentiary Complex in FAC . At a meeting of the selection board on DATE the applicant was selected for placement . He was transferred to the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s placement and informed him of the reasons which had led to that decision having been taken . Reference was made to the letter ( referred to as the \u201c official report \u201d ( ambtsbericht ) ) of DATE . In respect of the threats and intimidation , the Minister of ORG wrote that these had not only been brought to bear on fellow inmates but also on persons outside the remand institution . The applicant was further informed that his escape would pose an unacceptable risk to society . The Minister had also decided that the so - called \u201c A regime \u201d should apply to the applicant in view of the latter \u2019s threat that he would commit suicide if placed in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL requests for a transfer to an ordinary remand institution with the \u2018 s - ORG . The first request was declared inadmissible and the second was rejected . ORG based its second decision on the information obtained by GRIP , which had been further elucidated to the court , in confidence , by FAC at a hearing on DATE . Neither the applicant nor his counsel were allowed to hear what PERSON had told ORG . After the applicant and counsel had once again been admitted to the hearing , ORG very briefly provided them with some information of what it had been told by the Procurator - General but this did not contain anything about the provenance of the information obtained by GRIP or the dates on which this information had been provided to GRIP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s placement in the ORG should be continued . The wording of that decision was almost identical to that of the decision of DATE . However , the Minister decided that the applicant should no longer be subjected to the A regime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested the \u2018 sHertogenbosch Court of Appeal to order that he be transferred to an ordinary remand institution , arguing that his placement in the ORG had been unlawful . The applicant explicitly relied on LAW . He submitted that his placement in the ORG had had serious consequences for his possibilities of enjoying private and family life within the meaning of LAW : both privacy and contact with the outside world were severely limited in the ORG . Thus , ORG inmates were only allowed visits from spouses , parents and children without a glass partition between the inmate and the visitor once a month , on which occasions the only physical contact allowed was a handshake at the beginning and end of the visit . Visits from other relatives ( including siblings ) were only allowed with such a partition in place . In addition , it was only possible to contact relatives by telephone twice a week for TIME at a time .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing which took place on DATE before ORG in camera , the applicant also submitted that the conditions of his detention in the ORG constituted inhuman treatment contrary to LAW . In this connection he referred to the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CPT \u2013 see below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG in camera rejected the request in a decision dated DATE . ORG held that the reasons set out in the Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE justified the applicant \u2019s continued placement in the ORG . It further held that the conditions of detention in the ORG did not breach LAW since the ORG regime had a basis in law and the treatment of the applicant under this regime could not be regarded as amounting to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . As regards LAW , finally , ORG held that the interferences with the applicant \u2019s rights under that provision were justified as they were in accordance with the law and necessary in the interests of , inter alia , public safety .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant \u2019s placement in the ORG was once again extended , in a decision of DATE , he lodged an appeal with ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( Centrale PERSON ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Although it held that he could no longer be considered extremely likely to attempt to escape , it did find that the applicant , in the event of an escape , would pose an unacceptable risk to society in view of the nature of the offences of which he stood accused and of the effects on society and public opinion .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to a prison with an ordinary regime in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted that during his stay in the ORG he had been confronted with feelings of disempowerment and depression . The applicant \u2019s psychological condition was examined by ORG \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on a number of occasions , prior to a decision on the prolongation of his placement in the ORG . The following paragraphs contain excerpts from reports of a number of these examinations , drawn up by PERSON , the head of ORG of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Report of CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c The ORG most recently issued an advisory opinion relating to [ the applicant ] on DATE ... The conclusion reached at that time was the following :", "\u2018 Having regard to [ the applicant \u2019s ] personality and the course of his detention , [ the applicant ] should be deemed capable of acts of desperation . Within the ORG , such acts will almost certainly ( have to ) be directed against himself . Under a less strict regime , he could vent his emotions on others . For the time being , extra attention remains a necessity . The question arises whether in the long run , despite all the efforts made , the ORG is capable of offering the care required . If the risk of escape no longer necessitates keeping [ the applicant ] in the ORG , a transfer to a Special Individual Care Unit [ bijzondere individuele begeleidingsafdeling DATE \u201c BIBA \u201d ] might be ORG", "The report of DATE confirms this picture of [ the applicant ] . His psychological condition displays ups and downs . There has been a period of depression . A number of factors have a part to play in these psychological low points , such as the fact that [ the applicant ] misses his family ( his detention in the ORG certainly contributes to this ) , the continuing strain of the appeal on points of law ( after all , a great deal is at stake for [ the applicant ] ) , his relatively poorly integrated personality ( his psychological stability is low ) , as well as his cognitive capacities , which are not judged to be very high .", "[ The applicant ] has been residing in the ORG for DATE now and he obviously has difficulties coping . Added to this , a number of personal characteristics and the insecurity about his fate in detention place a heavy demand on [ the applicant \u2019s ] limited strength . I would prefer placement in a BIBA but this is unfortunately not feasible given that [ the applicant ] is detained on remand .", "As far as the present prolongation is concerned , I advise that when the decision about continued detention in the ORG is made , the aforementioned aspects will weigh relatively heavily in relation to current information about a possible risk of his escaping . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Report of DATE :", "\u201c It appears from reports of the course of [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention that prior to his placement in the ORG he was seen as a dominant man familiar with the daily routine in detention . There were regular signs that he exerted much ( negative ) influence , involving , inter alia , threats . These signs resulted in frequent transfers . Ever since he has been staying in the ORG , a more unstable , downcast side of [ the applicant ] has become much more apparent .", "[ The applicant ] is described by the prison \u2019s medical and health care team as a vulnerable man tending to depression , who takes medication for these complaints . A number of reasons may explain the contrast between [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour in detention prior to his placement in the ORG and his current behaviour . In the first place there is of course the threat of being sentenced to imprisonment ( for life ) . The fact that his appeal on points of law was upheld caused a strong resurgence of hope , but after he had again been sentenced to life imprisonment , [ the applicant ] was extremely upset . According to the members of the medical and health care team , he is beginning to recover . In the second place , there is the ORG regime itself which [ the applicant ] has difficulties coping with . [ The applicant ] used to be a person who was not constrained by any moral code of behaviour and who did not consider the rights of others . In the ORG , there are clearly defined limits and dependence . [ The applicant ] finds this loss of control over his own life difficult to accept and it looks as if this is a contributing factor to the development and continuation of the complaints linked to depression . Another relevant factor is contact with his family ; personnel in the ORG have the impression that this is deteriorating and that increasingly a distance is beginning to develop .", "The report of DATE confirms this picture of [ the applicant ] . His psychological condition displays highs and lows . There has been a period of complaints linked to depression . These lows are often mainly reactive in nature ( bad news , problems with other detainees , the loss of a \u2018 mate\u2019 within the unit , etc . ) . There is still the continuing strain relating to the outcome of the criminal proceedings ( after all , a great deal is at stake for [ the applicant ] ) , and this should be seen against the background of the relatively poorly integrated personality of [ the applicant ] ( his psychological stability is low ) and his cognitive capacities , not judged to be very high . In view of all his problems , regular attention is paid to [ the applicant ] by the medical and health care team . There is regular contact with the psychiatrist , the psychologist and social workers . Albeit somewhat intermittently , [ the applicant ] is prepared to take medication , which does have a positive effect on his mood .", "The fact remains that [ the applicant ] is having a hard time and that he has difficulties coping with the constraints of the ORG . If information about the risk of his escaping and the associated unacceptability of the risk to society is deemed such that it is no longer strictly necessary to detain [ the applicant ] in the ORG , there should be an alternative available in a secure facility which offers the possibility of creating a certain space in relation to the setting of limits . A BIBA would be suitable but , given that [ the applicant ] is detained on remand , placement there is not yet possible . I am nevertheless of the opinion that the unavailability of the most ideal detention facility where [ the applicant ] should be placed next should not be a decisive factor in the decision - making process on whether or not to prolong his placement in the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Report of DATE :", "\u201c The most serious problems which [ the applicant ] says he is experiencing in the ORG are the conditions under which visits take place and the fact that he is not seeing some of his children . [ The applicant ] becomes visibly emotional when talking about this . He complains of eating a lot , listlessness , being worried and sleeplessness . As confirmed by earlier reports , [ the applicant ] gives the impression of a vulnerable man who yearns for contact and tends towards gloominess , and who has difficulties coping with his detention . There is no appearance of serious psychopathology such as psychosis , severe depression or severe anxiety . Only mild to moderate depressive symptoms and an unstable affect are visible .", "It appears from the reports drawn up by the staff at the secure unit over DATE that [ the applicant ] has functioned well . He enjoys contact with certain codetainees . Judged by his own standards , he has participated to a reasonable degree in the programme on offer . He is , however , perceived as someone who complains a lot and who likes to lodge complaints about all manner of things . The conclusion is drawn that in the period under review [ the applicant ] appears to have found his feet .", "The medical and health care team reports that [ the applicant ] has regular contact with the social worker .", "Having regard to all of the above , [ the applicant ] has thus functioned well in DATE . The imposition of a DATE prison sentence and a ORG order , which , as opposed to life imprisonment , offer a certain perspective , has certainly contributed to the improved level of functioning . ...", "Whether or not his placement in the ORG should be extended is determined in the first place by the level of risk of [ the applicant ] escaping . ... Although [ the applicant ] has difficulties coping with his placement in the ORG , the findings are not of such a nature as to constitute strong contraindications militating against a prolongation of his placement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the request of the investigating judge in the criminal proceedings against the applicant , a report was drawn up concerning the applicant \u2019s mental faculties by a psychologist and a psychiatrist on DATE , following a period during which the applicant was held in a psychiatric observation clinic . The following excerpt has been taken from the chapter of the report describing the applicant \u2019s meetings with the psychiatrist .", "\u201c It is remarkable that soon after his admission to the psychiatric observation clinic , [ the applicant \u2019s ] appearance seems a lot more presentable : with his hair cut short , clean - shaven and wearing fresh clothes , he gives an altogether different impression from that at the first meeting . [ The applicant ] says the regime in the ORG did not encourage him to look after himself properly : sometimes days would go by without him speaking to anybody , he found the continuous strip - searching humiliating , and as a result he preferred not to go to the hairdresser \u2019s or to get showered .

The ORG \u2019s views on the nature of the regime which should be offered to prisoners held in special security units were set out in detail in the report on its DATE visit to the GPE . In that context , the ORG welcomed the recommendation of ORG that any future ORG should have \u2018 as normal a regime as PERSON .", "In its DATE report , the ORG stressed that prisoners should enjoy a relatively relaxed regime ( able to mix freely with the small number of fellow prisoners in the unit ; allowed to move without restriction within what is likely to be a relatively small physical space ; granted a good deal of choice about activities , etc . ) by way of compensation for their severe custodial situation . Special efforts should be made to develop a good internal atmosphere within such units . The aim should be to build positive relations between staff and prisoners . This is in the interests not only of the humane treatment of the unit \u2019s occupants but also of the maintenance of effective control and security and of staff safety . The existence of a satisfactory programme of activities is just as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 in a special detention unit as on normal location . It can do much to counter the deleterious effects upon a prisoner \u2019s personality of living in the bubble - like atmosphere of such a unit . The activities provided should be as diverse as possible ( education , sport , work of vocational value etc . ) As regards , in particular , work activities , it is clear that security considerations may preclude many types of work activities which are found on normal prison location . Nevertheless , this should not mean that only work of a tedious nature is provided for prisoners . In this respect , reference might be made to the suggestions set out in paragraph CARDINAL of the Explanatory Memorandum to Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The current regime in the ( ORG and ORG units is governed by a circular which was issued by ORG on DATE ( cf . document CARDINAL ) . According to the circular :", "\u2018 The extra security institution ( ORG ) at ORG has a limited communication regime . A differentiation of regimes is referred to within the ORG , where a distinction is made between what is known as the A regime , where greater restrictions apply , and the B regime , with less extreme restrictions .", "Groups of CARDINAL and a maximum of CARDINAL inmates take part in activities . Under the B regime , a maximum of CARDINAL inmates takes part in communal activities , while the maximum number is CARDINAL under the A regime . Communal activities involve only inmates from a single section .", "For security reasons , staff in contact with inmates must always outnumber the inmates , or must even be completely separated from them physically by a transparent ( glass ) wall . Moreover , with a view to the safety of the staff concerned , in those cases covered by LAW , sub - sections CARDINAL , chapter III , of the internal regulations of ORG , inmates\u2019 movements are restricted by handcuffs.\u2019", "CARDINAL . The delegation found that , in practice , out - of - cell time in the ( ORG and ORG on DATE varied from a minimum of TIME ( of outdoor exercise ) to a maximum of CARDINAL ( of outdoor exercise / recreation and/or sport ) . Depending upon the regime in which an inmate had been placed ( A / B ) and the group to which they had been allocated , these activities would take place with CARDINAL other inmates .", "The outdoor exercise yards in the ORG were of a reasonable size and a \u2018 running strip\u2019 was available for inmates who wished to engage in more strenuous physical activities . The exercise yards in the ( ORG were also large enough to enable prisoners to exert themselves physically ; however , their cage - like design rendered them rather oppressive facilities .", "During recreation periods ( of TIME ) , inmates were allowed access to communal areas where they could associate with each other , cook and eat their own food , use a computer and/or play games including table tennis .", "As regards facilities for sport , each of the CARDINAL units in the ORG was equipped with an impressive array of exercise equipment , located in a lofty glass atrium . However , inmates only had access to this equipment for CARDINAL or TIME sessions per week . Again , the equivalent facilities in ORG were of a lower standard . The ORG also had a large and well - equipped gymnasium but , at the time of the visit , it appeared that comparatively little use was being made of this facility .", "There were no organised education activities . There was also no out - of - cell work ; some in - cell work was offered to inmates , but it was of a very unchallenging nature ( e.g. stringing plastic curtain hooks onto short rods ) .", "CARDINAL . All inmate activities within ORG and ORG were subject to a high level of staff surveillance ( which is perfectly understandable in a unit of this type ) ; however , direct contacts between staff and inmates were very limited ( staff and inmate usually being separated by armoured glass panels ) . This is not conducive to building positive relations between staff and prisoners . Contact with non - custodial staff \u2013 including medical staff DATE was also subject to a number of very significant restrictions ...", "CARDINAL . It should also be noted that prisoners were regularly strip - searched ( a practice euphemistically referred to as \u2018 visitatie\u2019 ) . Such searches \u2013 which included anal inspections \u2013 were carried out at least once DATE on all prisoners , regardless of whether the persons concerned had had any contact with the outside world .", "CARDINAL . Concerning contact with the outside world , it should be noted that the house rules for ORG and ORG units provide that prisoners have the right to receive CARDINAL visit of TIME from family members and other persons approved in advance by prison management . In principle , visits took place under \u2018 NORP conditions ( i.e. through an armoured glass panel in a visiting booth ) . Prisoners also had the right to request CARDINAL \u2018 CARDINAL visit per month from family members ; however , physical contact during such visits was limited to a handshake on arrival and leaving . Prisoners and their families remained separated by a table equipped with a chest - high barrier and prison staff stood directly behind the prisoner throughout the visit . A number of inmates interviewed by the delegation indicated that , given the upsetting effects which these restrictions had had upon their families , they no longer requested \u2018 PERSON visits .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , prisoners held in the ( ORG and ORG units were subject to a very impoverished regime . They spent too little time out of their cells ; when out of their cells they associated with only a small number of fellow inmates and their relations with staff and visitors were very limited ; consequently , they did not have adequate human contact . Further , the programme of activities was underdeveloped . This was particularly the case as regards education and work . However , even as regards sport , inmates had insufficient access to the very good facilities available . Moreover , certain aspects of the regime ( in particular , systematic strip - searching ) did not appear to respond to legitimate security needs , and are humiliating for prisoners .", "DATE . The delegation \u2019s lengthy interviews with CARDINAL prisoners held in the ( T)EBI and ORG indicated that the regime as a whole was having harmful psychological consequences for those subjected to it . Indeed , the interviews revealed a consistent association of psychological symptoms which appeared to have been induced by the regime . The inmates concerned displayed the following symptom profile :", "\u2013 feelings of helplessness , which took the form of a disturbance of normal identity and severe difficulty of projection into the future ; in certain cases , the loss of identity was associated with definite episodes of depersonalisation ;", "\u2013 feelings of powerlessness , closely linked to helplessness , and leading to regression and excessive pre - occupation with bodily functions ;", "\u2013 anger , the predominant emotion being one of rage ( clearly linked to feelings of powerlessness ) and directed against self ( with expressions of low esteem , lack of confidence and associated depressive symptoms ) and others ;", "\u2013 communication difficulties , associated with the above - mentioned depersonalisation symptoms .", "The delegation \u2019s concerns about the harmful psychological consequences of the regime were reinforced during its subsequent visit to the Dr S. van Mesdag Clinic , where it interviewed a number of patients who had previously been held in the ( ORG or ORG , in whom persistent psychological sequelae ( insomnia ; anxiety symptoms ; disturbance of identity ; emotional liability and psychosomatic symptoms ) were clearly present .", "The ORG would add that it is aware that the psychologist employed in the ( ORG and ORG has publicly expressed the conviction that the regime has led to \u2018 no significant harmful effects on ORG . However , this opinion has never been subject to any form of peer review or professional assessment . It should be added that the Psychiatric Adviser to ORG expressed a contrary view to the delegation , citing as an example a case of a prisoner who had developed a florid paranoid psychosis while held in the ( T)EBI .", "CARDINAL . In the light of all of the information at its disposal , the ORG has been led to conclude that the regime currently being applied in ORG and ORG could be considered to amount to inhuman treatment . To subject prisoners classified as dangerous to such a regime could well render them more dangerous still .", "CARDINAL . The facilities in the extra security institution are of a high standard .

Similarly , current visiting arrangements should be reviewed ; the objective should be to have visits taking place under more open conditions ( paragraph DATE )", "Response : The ( ORG houses prisoners who are deemed exceptionally likely to attempt to escape , either with help from outside or by violent means . Generally speaking , they fall into CARDINAL categories : prisoners believed to be members of criminal organisations ; prisoners serving sentences for manslaughter or murder ; and prisoners who have escaped from prison in the past either by taking staff hostage or by using firearms ( and perhaps with help from outside ) . Arrangements for the detention of such prisoners need to be based first and foremost on systematic , fail - safe security arrangements , though a humane regime should then be provided within that context . The task of the ORG , like any other prison , is to execute custodial sentences without disruption . The restrictions imposed on prisoners should be no more than are necessary to deprive them of their liberty . What distinguishes the ORG from other prisons is the nature of the restrictions required to achieve that purpose . They must be more severe because the prisoners present , by definition , an above - average risk of escape or disruption of the normal prison regime . In practice , this means that the purpose of ORG and ORG is to create a place and regime from which it is impossible to escape , even by taking staff hostage .", "The regime in the ORG is the most severe anywhere in the GPE . For that reason , use of the institution is kept to a minimum and the decision to place prisoners there is taken and later reviewed at frequent intervals by a broad - based external committee . Despite the severity of the regime , prisoners in the ORG are offered sufficient out - of - cell time ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and have the opportunity to take part in recreational , sporting , musical , creative , educational and other activities . The range of activities on offer gives prisoners regular opportunities for human contact and the staff of the ORG deliberately strive to encourage such contact and participation in activities wherever possible . The small size of the unit \u2019s population ( paragraph CARDINAL ) is essential to the maintenance of order , security and control and to the prevention of escapes . It is true that there are special restrictions on contact with the outside world ( in the form of the glass partition separating prisoners from visitors ) , but the frequency of visits is the same as in a normal remand centre .", "The arrangements for searches in the ( ORG and ORG are essential to ensure the safety of staff . They have been evaluated in the past , as part of the DATE assessment of the ORG , and it has been decided that prisoners should not be searched more often than strictly necessary . This means that prisoners are not always searched on return to their cells , but only if they have been out of sight of the warder who let them out .", "Visits are organised in such a way as to permit visual , verbal and non - verbal contact while preventing direct physical contact . The special visiting arrangements are among the most important security measures to prevent escapes . If visits were more \u2018 open\u2019 and there were any chance of smuggling contraband into the prison , there would be little point in the existence of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities commission an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the extra security institution ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "Response : ORG intends to investigate the performance of the ORG in DATE .

It was further concluded in the report that a study of the psychological impact of a high - security regime was feasible . The researchers nevertheless emphasised that they had examined neither the quality of care for the mental well - being of the ORG detainees , nor the actual psychological condition of the detainees nor the effects which the regime was having on them .", "CARDINAL .
