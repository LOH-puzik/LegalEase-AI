Lastly , the applicant brought to the attention of the cassation court the fact that the plaintiffs ' claim had been stayed without any procedural steps in the first - instance court for DATE , which had led to the loss of a crucial piece of evidence ( the audio tape of the round table ) .", "CARDINAL .
