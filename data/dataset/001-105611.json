In DATE the ORG adopted its General Comment no . CARDINAL on Article CARDINAL of the ORG , providing , inter alia , the following interpretation of that provision :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The LAW does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection , but the ORG believes that such a right can be derived from DATE , inasmuch as the obligation to use lethal force may seriously conflict with the freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one \u2019s religion or belief . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A further development in the ORG \u2019s position occurred in its views adopted on DATE in the cases of PERSON of GPE and PERSON of Korea ( Communications nos . DATE and CARDINAL , ORG doc . CCPR / C/CARDINAL/D/CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , in which the ORG for the first time had to deal with complaints of CARDINAL convicted GPE \u2019s Witnesses with respect to a country where the right to conscientious objection was not recognised . The ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG ... notes that Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW excludes from the scope of \u2018 forced or compulsory labour\u2019 , which is proscribed , \u2018 any service of a military character and , in countries where conscientious objection is recognised , any national service required by law of conscientious ORG . It follows that LAW itself neither recognises nor excludes a right of conscientious objection . Thus , the present claim is to be assessed solely in the light of LAW , the understanding of which evolves as that of any other guarantee of the LAW over time in view of its text and purpose .", "CARDINAL . ... The ORG conviction and sentence , accordingly , amounts to a restriction on their ability to manifest their religion or belief . Such restriction must be justified by the permissible limits described in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , that is , that any restriction must be prescribed by law and be necessary to protect public safety , order , health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The GPE went on to conclude that the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights guaranteed by LAW ORG was not necessary and that there had been a violation of that provision .", "CARDINAL . The question of detention of conscientious objectors has also been addressed on several occasions under its individual petitions procedure by ORG which was established in DATE by ORG . Until recently , the main concern of ORG was the repeated punishment and incarceration of conscientious objectors , which it found arbitrary on the ground that it violated the principle of ne bis in idem ( see , for example , Opinion no . CARDINAL ( GPE ) and Opinion no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( GPE ) ) . In DATE ORG went CARDINAL step further and found a single instance in which a conscientious objector in GPE had been prosecuted , convicted and deprived of his liberty to have been arbitrary ( see Opinion no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( GPE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) and CARDINAL of ORG are similar to ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and CARDINAL ORG issued recommendations inviting the member GPE whose legislation still did not exempt conscientious objectors from military or alternative service to review their legal regimes and make modifications consistent with the spirit of international human rights law through legislative amendments providing for exemptions from military service in cases of conscientious objection .", "DATE . On DATE ORG decided on the first individual petition concerning the right to conscientious objection . The ORG found that LAW was to be read in conjunction with LAW ( b ) and concluded that conscientious objection was protected under LAW only in countries where it was recognised . In doing so , ORG relied heavily on the case - law of ORG and the ORG as it existed prior to DATE ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , Case no . CARDINAL , Report no . CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . This approach was later confirmed by ORG in another case ( see PERSON v. GPE , Case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Report no . CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ibero - American Convention on Young People \u2019s Rights , which sets out a number of specific rights for individuals aged DATE , was adopted in the framework of ORG . Its Article CARDINAL , entitled \u201c Right to conscientious objection \u201d , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Youth have the right to make conscientious objection towards obligatory military service .", "CARDINAL . The GPE Parties undertake to promote the pertinent legal measures to guarantee the exercise of this right and advance in the progressive elimination of obligatory military service .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The LOC also took up the question of conscientious objection in DATE . The participating ORG noted at the Human Dimension Conference that ORG Human Rights had recognised the right to conscientious objection and agreed to consider introducing various forms of alternative service in their legal systems . In DATE the PERSON prepared the \u201c ORG or Belief \u201d in which it observed that , although there was no controlling international standard on this issue , the clear trend in most democratic GPE was to allow those with serious moral or religious objections to military service to perform alternative ( non - military ) service ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
