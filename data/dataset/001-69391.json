In a joint memorial they argued that , as the second and third applicants had NORP nationality , they had the right to obtain permanent residence permits under the NORP - Latvian agreement . The first applicant , who had no nationality , contended that she was entitled to the status of a \u201c permanently resident noncitizen ( nepilsonis ) \u201d under the LAW on the Status of Former GPE Citizens without NORP or other Citizenship ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In court , the applicants made no attempt to deny the actions of which they had been accused by ORG and the ORG , but maintained that those actions had been in breach only of NORP law and therefore had no effect on their rights in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicants ' request . It noted that the applicants ' place of residence had been legally registered in PERSON DATE and that they had lived there from then onwards . In the court 's view , since the procuring of second passports by the applicants and their registration in GPE were illegal and void acts , they had no impact on the applicants ' legal status in GPE . The court also noted that the second applicant was on the list of former members of the NORP armed forces in receipt of a NORP military pension and entitled to remain in GPE . That list had been drawn up jointly by the QUANTITY governments in accordance with the NORP - Latvian agreement . Consequently , the court held that the first applicant was entitled to apply for a passport as a \u201c permanently resident non - citizen \u201d and that the second and third applicants were entitled to obtain permanent residence permits .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against that judgment to ORG . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , endorsing the findings and reasoning of the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL . The ORG then lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG . In a judgment of DATE the ORG quashed ORG judgment and declared it null and void . The ORG found that secretly obtaining CARDINAL passports and registering places of residence in CARDINAL different countries , failing to disclose the second passports and supplying false information to the authorities when applying for regularisation constituted serious breaches of NORP immigration law . The ORG also referred to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , subparagraph CARDINAL , of LAW , which stated that the status of \u201c permanently resident non - citizen \u201d could not be granted to persons who , on DATE , had their permanent place of residence registered in a member ORG of ORG ( of which GPE is a member ) . The ORG considered that the provision in question was fully applicable to the applicants ' case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that the judgment of ORG of DATE had been subsequently set aside when the proceedings were reopened , thereby depriving the entry of the applicants on the register of residents of any legal basis . It concluded that the second and third applicants , since they did not satisfy the requirements of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the Aliens and ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were also not entitled to obtain permanent residence permits . Consequently , the ORG set aside the judgment of DATE and referred the case back to the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . For procedural reasons , the case was transferred to ORG which , in a judgment of DATE , rejected the applicants ' application , reaffirming the reasons given by the ORG . Unlike the NORP ORG , ORG considered that the first applicant had NORP nationality under GPE Nationality Act . With regard to the second applicant , it considered that the fact that an individual was on the list of retired army personnel merely attested to the fact that the person concerned actually resided in GPE and was in receipt of a NORP military pension ; it did not in any sense confer entitlement to a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants on points of law , endorsing in substance the arguments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL letters dated DATE and DATE the ORG reminded the applicants that they were required to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL .

The letters sent to the other CARDINAL applicants were similar in content . The letter to the second applicant stated in particular :", "\u201c ...

In addition , a letter containing the above information concerning the CARDINAL applicants was sent to ORG . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the head of the ORG signed CARDINAL decisions formally regularising the applicants ' status in GPE .

However , regularisation of the status of the second and third applicants was contingent upon that of the first applicant . In other words , in order for PERSON and PERSON to obtain residence permits , PERSON first had to submit the relevant documents to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . None of the applicants complied with the instructions outlined above in order to obtain residence permits . As matters stand , the applicants continue to reside in GPE . According to the information available to the ORG , the second applicant is legally employed as the operator of a municipal communal heating plant in Al\u016bksne , while the third applicant is studying law at a private establishment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contended that , on TIME , the first applicant , PERSON , had been summoned to the regional headquarters of the security police ( PERSON policija ) . An officer of the security police had asked her a number of questions , some of them relating to her application to the ORG and to an interview she had given to journalists from a NORP television channel on the subject . In particular , the police had asked the first applicant how the NORP journalists had made contact with her , how she had heard about the possibility of lodging an individual application with the ORG , how she had found lawyers to represent her before the ORG and how she had known that certain persons had bribed ORG officials in order to obtain NORP residence permits . In addition , the police officer had asked her several questions about her professional career and about the members of her family .", "CARDINAL . The dialogue between the first applicant and the police officer , as reconstructed by the applicant and sent to her lawyers on DATE , ran as follows :", "\u201c Police officer : How did the television channel ORG find you ?", "Applicant : We had had telephone calls in DATE [ and ] DATE . At the time , we had refused to meet them , but journalists are bloodhounds , they always get what they want .", "Police officer : And then ?", "Applicant : They telephoned from GPE and said they wanted to meet us and talk to us .

They wanted to talk to several [ people ] who had brought cases before the courts .", "Police officer : When did they phone ?", "Applicant : It was a DATE TIME , TIME They came round on the DATE , at TIME If you want to come round [ too ] , you 're welcome . Our door is always open .", "Police officer : You said that you 'd taken the case all the way to ORG , did n't you ?", "Applicant : Yes , I did . There were CARDINAL sets of proceedings ; we fought and fought [ again ] , and eventually we turned to ORG , because of the people in charge in the [ Directorate ] . They saw it as a game to get us deported from the country , while we wanted to prove that we were in the right . [ Their ] attitude towards us was based on prejudice : we had n't broken any laws in GPE .", "Police officer : How and where did you find out that you could apply to ORG ?", "Applicant : The issue of our regularisation was discussed several times by the tripartite ORG . We had approached ORG . We had lawyers . The representatives of ORG and the [ Directorate ] had told us at the last meeting that they had no objections to raise or accusations to make as far as we were concerned , and that everything would be fine . Unfortunately , they have n't kept their promises so far . The ORG advised us to lodge an application with ORG about the length of the proceedings if the case was n't resolved .", "Police officer : And how did you find those lawyers ?", "Applicant : With the help of the lawyers in the social welfare office we were registered with .", "Police officer : Perhaps your lawyers threatened you , saying that if you did n't give information to ORG they would stop working with you ?", "Applicant : That 's nonsense . They told us not to give information to anyone without their consent , not even to ORT ...", "Police officer : You said that over DATE people had lodged applications ?", "Applicant : Yes , I did . Actually , there are even more people involved : I meant that there were CARDINAL families . We 've all been through the courts : some of us once , some twice , and some even CARDINAL times . A lot of people solved the problem by paying backhanders .", "Police officer : How do you know that ?", "Applicant : We were all in the same boat and we helped one another . We used to say to one another that if someone had money , it was better for him to pay , to avoid a trial . [ The first applicant then gave the example of CARDINAL families whose status had been regularised after they had bribed ORG officials ; she named CARDINAL of the officials concerned . ]", "Police officer : And why did you not come to us ?", "Applicant : We did n't know you could help us .", "Police officer : How did you come by the information that CARDINAL people had lodged applications ?", "Applicant : Actually , the figure is higher . We 've all had a lot of problems . [ The applicant dwelt in detail on CARDINAL specific cases concerning the regularisation of persons in a similar situation to her own . ]", "Police officer : What does your husband think about the case ?", "Applicant : He supports [ me ] : what would you do ?", "[ The police officer then asked the applicant a series of questions about her education , her work , her husband 's work and the family 's financial situation . ]", "Police officer : Once more , how did you find out that you could take your case to ORG ?", "Applicant : We read the papers , we watch television ; the cases of GPE , PERSON , PERSON and several other families were reported in the media . We approached ORG , who gave us advice and even offered to [ help us ] find a lawyer . Strange , is n't it ? It was very hard for us , having to bring a case against GPE before ORG , but all the avenues open to us to try and resolve the problem in GPE had been exhausted . It 's the fault of the [ Directorate and its officials ] , who flout the law and force people to leave GPE . They 're the ones who bring shame on GPE .

The Government contested the accuracy of this record , particularly in view of the length of time that had elapsed between the interview itself and the drafting of the document . The first applicant conceded that the document was probably less than perfect , given that it had been drafted from memory DATE after the fact ; she acknowledged that several other questions ( which she could not recall ) might have been asked during the interview .
