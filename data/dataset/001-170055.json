The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Inspector PERSON ORG arrested the applicant and took him to the police station . The applicant , who had category CARDINAL disability status in relation to his eyesight , did not offer any resistance . Subsequently , PERSON beat up the applicant by delivering several blows to his head , near to his eyes . When the applicant fell to the ground , PERSON kicked him at least once in the chest .", "CARDINAL . After this injury , the deterioration of the applicant \u2019s sight accelerated , leading to retinal detachment . In DATE and DATE he had several eye operations , including CARDINAL in a hospital in GPE , but the retinal detachment continued to progress . In DATE he was granted category CARDINAL disability status for complete loss of vision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were initiated against GPE On DATE the applicant was joined as a civil party to those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a forensic medical report was drawn up . It stated that on DATE the applicant had sustained numerous injuries , which by their nature were considered moderate , resulting in long - term health problems of CARDINAL one days and permanently reducing his capacity to work by CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE charges were brought against PERSON and on DATE the case was sent to ORG for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . S.K. did not appear at the first hearing on DATE . ORG held that the case could not be heard in his absence and issued a warrant for his arrest . In DATE the warrant was sent to the NORP police station .", "CARDINAL . During the same hearing the applicant \u2019s lawyers asked the trial court to order a second forensic medical report in an attempt to establish the nature and seriousness of the injuries sustained . The prosecutor supported the request and ORG ordered a report .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE ORG asked the NORP police station for information about the measures taken and results achieved in executing the arrest warrant . In reply to each request the police sent identical responses stating that PERSON was wanted and that the trial court would be informed when he was caught . In DATE the police informed ORG that , according to information received , PERSON had left GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the forensic medical service reminded ORG that it had not received any original medical documents . In DATE and DATE ORG asked the NORP authorities for assistance in obtaining originals of medical records relating to the applicant \u2019s operations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . For unknown reasons the documents were not obtained and as a result , the report could not be drawn up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked the trial court to order a forensic medical examination to confirm the classification of the offence . After the initial forensic medical report the applicant \u2019s health had deteriorated and he had completely lost his sight . According to the prosecutor , there were therefore grounds to consider that that might be related to the injuries which had been inflicted on the applicant in DATE . ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s request and ordered the third forensic medical examination . A medical panel was asked to comment on what kind of trauma had caused the injuries ; whether the applicant had lost his sight as a result of the injuries inflicted on him in DATE ; to what extent he had been incapacitated before the injuries and their severity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical report was drawn up . It stated that on DATE the applicant had sustained injuries which by their nature were considered minor , resulting in health problems of DATE . The report continued that prior to the injuries the applicant had had serious and progressively deteriorating myopia . The applicant \u2019s sight problems had become worse as a result of the head injuries sustained on DATE , and that had led to further deterioration of his sight .", "It was also noted that , under domestic law , the worsening of a preexisting condition did not as such serve as grounds for reclassifying the seriousness of an injury . Serious eye disorders could develop and result in the loss of sight even without trauma . In the light of the above , the report did not establish a direct causal link between the injuries inflicted on the applicant in DATE and his loss of sight .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant \u2019s request for another medical report for lack of reasoning .", "CARDINAL . DATE a total of CARDINAL hearings were postponed because experts , doctors , including an ophthalmologist , did not attend and several medical experts needed to be called . In particular , on QUANTITY occasions DATE and DATE and DATE and DATE hearings were postponed at the request of the applicant , as he had asked for a doctor and a forensic expert to be summoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of ORG , a panel of experts drew up the fourth medical report which stated that the applicant had suffered CARDINAL blow to his right eye and to his thorax . The injuries sustained by him were considered minor . The report continued by stating that on DATE the applicant had suffered injuries to his head that had resulted in a serious worsening of his eye disorder ( myopia ) with the recurrence of retinal detachments in both eyes followed by further deterioration of his sight . The worsening of a pre - existing condition , including after earlier injuries , did not in itself provide a basis for determining a more serious classification of bodily injury . A severe and progressive eye disorder ( myopia ) could deteriorate and lead to retinal detachment even if no injuries had been suffered , and eventually lead to complete loss of vision . The experts concluded that the applicant \u2019s head injuries of CARDINAL DATE had no direct causal link with the subsequent deterioration of his vision and his category CARDINAL disability status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with the trial court for compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found guilty PERSON absentia for abusing his official power in a violent and disrespectful manner . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the applicant \u2019s civil claim ORG held that the total amount claimed , namely CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and MONEY ( ORG ) had not been supported by evidence . The majority of the documents confirming payment of the medical expenses had been submitted in NORP and LANGUAGE , and in order to invite a translator it would have to delay the adjudication . In addition , the applicant had not stated which part of the expenses related to the consequences of the injuries sustained . Accordingly , the trial court decided as follows :", "\u201c To recognise the [ applicant \u2019s ] rights to compensation from the ORG for material , pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by the criminal offence , and to remit ( nodot ) the question of the precise amount to be awarded / enforced ( piedz\u012bt ) to the court to decide in civil proceedings \u201d .", "The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG registered the applicant \u2019s civil claim dated DATE against ORG and ORG . The applicant claimed compensation for damage caused by the criminal offence committed by Inspector PERSON In the claim the applicant relied on the operative part of the judgment of ORG ( see above ) , section CARDINAL of the Law on Police and various provisions of LAW which regulated tort liability . Relying on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW in particular , the applicant claimed pecuniary and non - pecuniary ( mor\u0101lo kait\u0113jumu ) damages of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for blindness , mutilation and disfigurement ( sakrop\u013cojums un iz\u0137\u0113mojums ) , loss of future income ( atraut\u0101 pe\u013c\u0146a ) and medical expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as a firstinstance court , relied , amongst other provisions , on LAW and section CARDINAL of the Law on Police , and accepted the applicant \u2019s civil claim in part . He was awarded ORG ( LAW ) in non - pecuniary damages for the damage caused to his health and ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in pecuniary damages from both defendants on a pro rata basis for his medical expenses .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage came within the scope of section CARDINAL of LAW , a lex specialis providing no specific criteria for awarding compensation . The court referred to the findings of the experts in the criminal proceedings and stated that the applicant \u2019s bodily injuries caused by the police officer might have been the reason for the worsening of his eye disorder ( myopia ) that had resulted in a rapid deterioration of his sight and eventually complete loss of vision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reviewed the case following appeals by the applicant , ORG and ORG . It ruled that the first - instance court had been incorrect in concluding that the applicant \u2019s injuries had amounted to mutilation and disfigurement under LAW of LAW . The applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage was dismissed . The pecuniary damages were reduced to ORG ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the applicant \u2019s claim for pecuniary damages , ORG ruled that the judgment adopted in the criminal proceedings against PERSON only proved that he had committed a crime using violence against the applicant . The CARDINAL usual criteria for establishing tort liability and compensation thus had to be satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the judgment of CARDINAL DATE the first and fourth criteria had been established . ORG analysed all the medical data before it concerning the applicant \u2019s health and concluded that ORG were liable to pay pecuniary damages to the applicant for his medical expenses under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damages , ORG concluded that the loss of the applicant \u2019s sight had occurred under specific circumstances , including his previous state of health . It was also noted that the loss of his sight was not directly linked to the bodily injuries sustained by him on DATE . There was therefore no evidence to prove that his bodily injuries had amounted to mutilation or disfigurement , as provided in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a preparatory meeting on CARDINAL DATE the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant as not raising any relevant legal issues .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE addressed to the Government , ORG stated that there were no grounds for the national courts to extend the scope of the applicant \u2019s claim and decide on the awarding of non - pecuniary damages on the following grounds . The applicant had claimed pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages for injuries sustained as a result of police ill - treatment . In this regard he had relied on sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW , which provided that compensation could be claimed for mutilation and disfigurement . In order to determine whether the consequences of the alleged injuries were those stipulated in the legal provision , the domestic courts had to establish the essential conditions of tort liability , namely ( i ) unlawful conduct , ( ii ) damage , ( iii ) a causal link between the unlawful conduct and damage claimed and ( iv ) fault . In the applicant \u2019s case , no such conclusions could be drawn on the basis of the medical documents . The applicant had lost his sight owing to various coexisting circumstances , not as a result of the injuries sustained in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also stated that with the amendments of DATE LAW contained a general legal provision ( section DATE of LAW ) for claiming non - pecuniary damages . Nevertheless , it did not have retroactive effect and therefore the national courts could not apply it in the applicant \u2019s case . According to ORG , no such obligation could be inferred from any other legal acts on the account that the subject matter of the present civil dispute did not concern the public law obligation which ORG had undertaken in the area of human rights .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG indicated that in the applicant \u2019s case the DATE statutory limitation period for claiming damages had started to run on DATE , DATE the final judgment in the criminal case became effective . ORG therefore considered that the applicant still had the right to rely on LAW and lodge a claim for compensation for damage caused by a criminal offence . In that regard ORG referred to the judgment of DATE in the so - called \u201c PERSON tragedy \u201d case , in which it ruled that a person has the right to receive compensation for violations of his or her human rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
