The applicant was born in DATE and is at present serving a DATE sentence in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG received an anonymous telephone call from a man who reported the disappearance of his neighbour GPE , the applicant 's wife , since DATE . On DATE the police carried out an in situ inspection of the flat and the adjacent premises where GPE had lived and collected samples of bloodstains and other biological particles found there .

On DATE at TIME the applicant was arrested by the police and placed in police custody on suspicion of murdering his wife ( PERSON ) in GPE at DATE and disposing of her body at the garbage disposal tip near the town of GPE . He was first interviewed by the police . The applicant 's statement to the police in which he confessed to murdering his wife was subsequently excluded from the case file as inadmissible evidence on the ground that he had not been legally represented .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , the applicant was brought by the police officer who had previously interviewed him before an investigating judge of ORG ( istra\u017eni sudac ORG ) and was questioned in the presence of a GPE Deputy ORG Attorney . The written transcript of the interview shows that the applicant had been warned about his right to remain silent and to be legally represented . After replying that he had understood the warnings , he chose to defend himself in person . He then stated that he was \u201c not experiencing any mental crisis , that he was aware of everything that he was saying and that the police officers had treated him correctly \u201d and then denied that he had murdered his wife but instead stated that he had found her dead and then disposed of her body out of fear that he would be accused of her murder . The applicant also stated that he had been listening to the judge 's dictation for the official record and that his words had been faithfully conveyed , adding that he had no objections as to the content of the written transcript , which he duly signed . The applicant was then placed in pre - trial detention where he remained until his conviction . The parties agree that upon his arrival he was seen by a doctor and that no injuries were recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigation was opened against the applicant in ORG on a suspicion that he had murdered his wife , PERSON and on DATE a lawyer , PERSON , was officially appointed to assist the applicant . On DATE the defence counsel appealed against the decision to open an investigation , arguing that there had been no relevant evidence that the applicant had murdered PERSON On DATE the appeal was dismissed by a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses in the presence of the applicant 's counsel . On DATE the applicant 's pre - trial detention was extended by ORG . The applicant 's counsel lodged an appeal which was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL May CARDINAL the same investigating judge again interviewed the applicant , this time in the presence of his officially appointed defence counsel . The applicant was warned that he had the right to remain silent . However , he repeated his previous statement and added some details as to how he had disposed of his wife 's dead body . He signed the written transcript of the interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a confrontation between the applicant and a witness was organised before the investigating judge , in the presence of the applicant 's officially appointed counsel . The applicant stated that on the critical occasion he had twice hit his wife . He also stated that he had asked the witness present to help him dispose of his wife 's dead body . However , he denied that he had killed her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG that he was represented by CARDINAL defence counsel of his own choosing . Consequently , in a decision of DATE the officially appointed defence counsel was relieved of his duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to ORG investigating judge , withdrawing the previous confessions he had made before that judge . He alleged that during his interview by the police on DATE he had confessed to having murdered his wife because he had been threatened and beaten by QUANTITY police officers . They had punched him in the stomach , ears and head and slapped him several times . He named CARDINAL of the officers . They had , he alleged , also threatened him with further beatings if he retracted his confession before the investigating judge . For fear of further beatings , he had made a statement on CARDINAL occasions before the investigating judge in which he had confessed to having disposed of the dead body of his wife , even though that was not true .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge excluded , inter alia , the transcript of the applicant 's interview by the police from the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE State Attorney 's ORG ( GPE dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo GPE ) filed a bill of indictment against the applicant in ORG , charging him with the murder of his wife at DATE , and the applicant was thus committed to stand trial .", "CARDINAL . During the trial proceedings the applicant , represented by CARDINAL lawyers of his own choosing , decided to remain silent . ORG trial panel heard evidence from witnesses , including ORG , in the presence of the applicant and his counsel , obtained forensic and other relevant reports and in its judgment of DATE found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The findings as to the applicant 's guilt relied on the statements of the applicant given by him before the investigating judge on CARDINAL occasions as well as on the other evidence such as a DNA analysis of the bloodstains found in the applicant 's home and hearsay evidence given by CARDINAL of the witnesses . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The defendant 's confession during the investigation and the evidence given by witnesses ORG and ORG indicate that TIME at DATE the police arrived at the applicant 's flat on account of the fact that music was being played too loud , while the fact that PERSON had actually died was twice confirmed by the defendant during the investigation . Furthermore , the witness ORG said that the defendant had told him that he had killed his wife and asked him to help him transport her dead body to PERSON in order to throw it into the sea .", "A careful analysis of the defendant 's statements given on CARDINAL occasions during the investigation and of all other evidence presented at the hearing led this court to conclude that the defendant had acted as described in the operative part of this judgment and that all the statutory elements of the crime in question , in both its objective and subjective aspects , had thus been fulfilled .", "During the investigation , the defendant , as mentioned above , twice confirmed the death of his wife , whose body has never been found .", "...", "... [ witness ] ORG , who has no sensible motive for laying any blame on the defendant , has , during the entire proceedings , expressly stated that the defendant , DATE after the critical day at DATE , had ... told him as follows : ' After you had left TIME , I killed her . ' And when [ O.M. ] had asked ' Whom ? ' , the defendant had answered ' NORP ' and had asked him to transport her dead body with his car to PERSON in order for the defendant to throw it into the sea , which the witness had refused .", "...", "... [ during ] an in situ inspection of the [ defendant 's ] flat traces of her [ the defendant 's wife ] bloodstains were found ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel both appealed against the judgment . In his personal appeal the applicant complained , inter alia , of the fact that the judgment relied on the statements given by him before the investigating judge even though he had subsequently retracted them and had informed the investigating judge that he had given these statements under duress . His lawyers had moreover appealed on the same basis . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the applicant 's conviction . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c .. the fact that PERSON had died was twice confirmed by the defendant in the statements given by him during the investigation . He described in detail how he had disposed of the dead body of his wife D , and the first - instance court correctly accepted this part of the statement while at the same time dismissing the part of his statement in which he denied murdering his wife . In this connection the defendant 's allegations that his statements during the investigation had been given as a result of the threats and beatings by the police and that he had told the investigating judge what the police had instructed him to say are unfounded . No basis for such allegations can be found in the evidence or the case file . On the contrary , when first questioned by the investigating judge the defendant expressly stated that he was not in a state of mental crisis , that he was aware of what he was saying and that the police officers of ORG had treated him correctly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of LAW ( ORG nos .
