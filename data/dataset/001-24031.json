{"ITEMID": "001-24031", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SVK", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "HARABIN v. SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , succeeded by PERSON as from DATE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG elected the applicant President of ORG for a DATE period .", "On DATE the Government adopted a resolution under which it initiated the revocation of the applicant \u2019s appointment . The background for the resolution was a proposal submitted by the Minister of ORG in which the following reasons for the applicant \u2019s removal from office were invoked .", "According to the proposal , the applicant , in his speeches , attitudes and decisions , had taken several steps which cast doubt on the trustworthiness of ORG and of the judiciary as a whole .", "Firstly , the applicant had failed to initiate disciplinary proceedings to dismiss GPE from his appointment as a judge . GPE was then the VicePresident of ORG and had forcibly entered premises belonging to ORG and had used force against a high ranking official of that ORG in DATE . According to the Minister \u2019s proposal , the applicant \u2019s behaviour in the matter had not been appropriate .", "Secondly , the applicant had initiated , in DATE , the amendment of several laws concerning the judiciary . Those proposals clearly exceeded the legitimate interest in ensuring that ORG should have its own chapter in the ORG budget . If they had been approved , the President of ORG would have had the exclusive right to determine the number of judges of ORG and to decide on the assignment or transfer of judges to it . This initiative had been strongly criticised in a declaration adopted by ORG in DATE . According to the declaration , the proposal was against the principle of transparency in staff matters and created the danger of making decision - making on judges\u2019 careers much less objective . The Minister \u2019s report concluded that the applicant had sought to obtain more power rather than to strengthen the self - administration of judges .", "Thirdly , the applicant had taken into account the views expressed by organs of self - administration of judges only in cases where it suited his interests . Thus the applicant had not accepted the transfer of a judge to ORG despite the fact that it had been recommended by ORG of GPE . On the other hand , the applicant had proposed to assign temporarily to ORG judge who clearly failed to meet the professional and moral requirements for holding a post at ORG . The Minister \u2019s report concluded that the applicant had failed to apply correct professional and ethical criteria when proposing to fill posts at ORG .", "Fourthly , the applicant had not acted in a correct manner when presenting his views on a draft amendment to the LAW . In particular , in a letter addressed to a representative of ORG , the applicant had stated that , in the opinion of almost all judges of the ordinary courts , the draft amendment to LAW was contrary to the principle of the separation of powers and permitted interference with the independence of judges . That was contrary to the views expressed by ORG of GPE , by ORG and by ORG , those being organisations which represented a majority of judges . Furthermore , the applicant had incorrectly alleged that the whole judiciary including ORG would be ruled by a member of the Government if ORG were to be established in accordance with the draft amendment to LAW , whereas under the amendment ORG was to be composed of CARDINAL judges elected by judges and of another QUANTITY members , of whom CARDINAL were to be appointed by the ORG , CARDINAL by the President of GPE and CARDINAL by the Government .", "The applicant \u2019s comments on the draft amendment were \u201c noteworthy \u201d in that they showed that he did not understand the purpose of an amnesty in a democratic ORG . The report also stated that the applicant \u2019s comments showed that the real reason for his disagreement with the draft amendment to the LAW was the point concerning the termination of the powers of the President of ORG .", "Fifthly , several cases taken up by the media had impaired the trustworthiness of the judiciary . For example , a representative of ORG was suspected of having forged an official document concerning the use of a building in which ORG had its seat . The applicant was not in a position to show that the suspicion was unsubstantiated and had frequently changed his explanation of the relevant facts . Furthermore , the applicant had failed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against a ORG judge who had been treated free of charge in a spa . The applicant had taken an inappropriate initiative in the context of judicial proceedings in that he had informed the media , on his own initiative , about a ORG decision and commented upon it prior to its delivery to the parties .", "The Minister \u2019s report concluded that the applicant \u2019s actions and behaviour showed that he did not meet the professional and moral requirements for holding the post of President of ORG . In performing his duties , the applicant had laid emphasis on his material status and the strengthening of his powers rather than on professional and ethical problems of the judiciary .", "The applicant filed a petition to ORG under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . With reference to the ORG \u2019s proposal , he alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW and also a violation of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s petition as being manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated that the Government \u2019s proposal to revoke the applicant \u2019s appointment as President of ORG did not amount to a violation of any of his constitutional rights . ORG pointed out , in particular , that there was no right under LAW to exercise the post to which the applicant had been elected . Furthermore , there was no indication that the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression or his other constitutional rights had been violated as a result of the proposal to remove him from the post since that proposal did not , as such , directly affect the applicant \u2019s rights or his interests protected by law .", "On DATE in ORG the motion that the applicant \u2019s appointment be revoked was defeated by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , with CARDINAL abstentions .", "Following the entry into force , on DATE , of a constitutional amendment the post of President of ORG was to be filled in accordance with Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The applicant was a successful candidate for that post in an election held by ORG on DATE . Subsequently ORG invalidated the election on the ground that the other candidate had been at a disadvantage vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant . The subsequent elections having not resulted in the appointment of the President of ORG pursuant to LAW , the applicant held the post of President of ORG until DATE when the term for which he had been appointed expired . Since then he has performed the duties of a ORG judge .", "The following provisions of the LAW , as in force at the relevant period , are pertinent in the present case .", "Article CARDINAL ) guarantees the freedom of expression and the right to information . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL guarantees to everyone the right to express his or her views orally , in writing , through the press , pictures or by other means and to freely seek , receive and impart ideas and information .

LAW CARDINAL entitles citizens to have access to public posts on equal terms .", "Under LAW ) , as in force until DATE , judges were elected by ORG upon the ORG \u2019s proposal for a DATE period . After the expiry of that period ORG elected judges , upon the Government \u2019s proposal , for an indefinite period .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , as in force until DATE , provided that the President and Vice - Presidents of ORG were to be elected by ORG from the judges of ORG for DATE . Such posts could not be held by the same persons for CARDINAL consecutive periods of DATE .", "Under LAW as in force until DATE , the appointment of a judge could be revoked by ORG either after his or her final conviction for an intentional criminal offence or when he or she had committed a disciplinary offence which was incompatible with the office of a judge . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , as in force until DATE , provided that , prior to revoking the appointment of a judge , ORG had to ask the competent disciplinary court for an opinion .", "Following an amendment to the LAW , the following relevant provisions entered into force with effect from DATE .", "Article PERSON ) provides for establishment of ORG , composed of the President of ORG , CARDINAL judges elected by the judges who may revoke their appointment , and another QUANTITY members , CARDINAL of whom are appointed by the ORG , CARDINAL by the President of GPE and three by the Government . Under paragraph CARDINAL(c ) of Article CARDINALa , ORG has the right to propose to the President of GPE the names of persons to be appointed to the posts of President and Vice - President of ORG and to call for their removal from office .", "Pursuant to LAW , the President and Vice - President of ORG are appointed by the President of GPE , upon the proposal of ORG , from among the judges of ORG for a DATE period . Prior to the expiry of that period the President of GPE can revoke the appointments to the posts of President and Vice - President of ORG for any of the reasons laid down in LAW .", "Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL governs , inter alia , the ORG administration of courts , which consists in setting up necessary conditions for the proper administration of justice without interfering with the independence of the judiciary .", "Under LAW ) , the central authority charged with ORG administration of justice is ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of Section CARDINAL provides that the other authorities in charge of ORG administration of ORG are the President and the Vice - President of ORG and the presidents and vice - presidents of ORG and ORG .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ORG administration of ORG is carried out by ORG through the President of ORG .", "Section CARDINAL ) provides that ORG organises , directs and controls the ORG administration of courts by their presidents .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the President of ORG carries out the ORG administration of that court in that he or she ( a ) ensures the functioning of ORG in terms of personnel and organisation , being responsible in particular for filling the expert and other posts with duly qualified staff and for dealing with personnel matters relating to judges and the other staff of the court , ( b ) ensures the functioning of ORG from the economic , material and financial point of view and ( c ) attends to the professional education of judges and other staff members of ORG .", "Under paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , the President of ORG also takes care to ensure that the dignity of judicial proceedings is respected , that the rules of judicial ethics are complied with and that proceedings before ORG are conducted without undue delays .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of LAW entitles the President of ORG to initiate complaints in the interest of the law in the cases provided for by law .", "According to LAW , any natural person has the right to protection of his or her personality , in particular of his or her life and health , civil and human dignity , privacy , name and personal characteristics .", "Pursuant to Article PERSON ) , any natural person has the right to request that unjustified infringement of his or her personal rights should be stopped and the consequences of such infringement eliminated , and to obtain appropriate satisfaction .", "Article CARDINAL ) provides that in cases where the satisfaction obtained under Article PERSON ) is insufficient , in particular because a person \u2019s dignity and position in society has been considerably diminished , the injured person is entitled to compensation for non - pecuniary damage . According to paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , when determining the amount of such compensation the courts have to take into account the seriousness of the prejudice suffered by the person concerned and also the circumstances under which the violation of that person \u2019s rights occurred ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
