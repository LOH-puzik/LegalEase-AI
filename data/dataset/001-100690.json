Although affecting the population at large , these diseases have emerged as a dramatic problem in certain prison systems . In this connection the ORG has , on a number of occasions , been obliged to express serious concerns about the inadequacy of the measures taken to tackle this problem . Further , material conditions under which prisoners are held have often been found to be such that they can only favour the spread of these diseases .", "The ORG is aware that in periods of economic difficulties - such as those encountered DATE in many countries visited by the ORG - sacrifices have to be made , including in penitentiary establishments . However , regardless of the difficulties faced at any given time , the act of depriving a person of his liberty always entails a duty of care which calls for effective methods of prevention , screening , and treatment . Compliance with this duty by public authorities is all the more important when it is a question of care required to treat life - threatening diseases .", "The use of up - to date methods for screening , the regular supply of medication and related materials , the availability of staff ensuring that prisoners take the prescribed medicines in the right doses and at the right intervals , and the provision when appropriate of special diets , constitute essential elements of an effective strategy to combat the above - mentioned diseases and to provide appropriate care to the prisoners concerned . Similarly , material conditions in accommodation for prisoners with transmissible diseases must be conducive to the improvement of their health ; in addition to natural light and good ventilation , there must be satisfactory hygiene as well as an absence of overcrowding .", "Further , the prisoners concerned should not be segregated from the rest of the prison population unless this is strictly necessary on medical or other grounds ...", "In order to dispel misconceptions on these matters , it is incumbent on national authorities to ensure that there is a full educational programme about transmissible diseases for both prisoners and prison staff . Such a programme should address methods of transmission and means of protection as well as the application of adequate preventive measures .", "It must also be stressed that appropriate information and counselling should be provided before and - in the case of a positive result - after any screening test . Further , it is axiomatic that patient - related information should be protected by medical confidentiality . As a matter of principle , any interventions in this area should be based on the informed consent of the persons concerned .", "Moreover , for control of the above - mentioned diseases to be effective , all the ministries and agencies working in this field in a given country must ensure that they co - ordinate their efforts in the best possible way . In this respect the ORG wishes to stress that the continuation of treatment after release from prison must be guaranteed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG report on the visit to GPE carried out from DATE ( CPT / INF ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG is also seriously concerned by the practice of transferring back from GPE [ temporary detention facility ] to ORG [ temporary detention ward in police departments ] facilities prisoners diagnosed to have BK+ tuberculosis ( and hence highly contagious ) , as well as by the interruption of ORG treatment while at the ORG . An interruption of the treatment also appeared to occur during transfers between penitentiary establishments .", "In the interest of combating the spread of tuberculosis within the law - enforcement and penitentiary system and in society in general , the ORG recommends that immediate measures be taken to put an end to the above - mentioned practice . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The incidence of GPE increased throughout DATE . This was due to a combination of factors , including : ( i ) increased poverty , ( ii ) under - funding of TB services and health services in general , ( iii ) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command - and - control TB system , but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post - NORP era , and ( iv ) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment . Migration of populations from ex - NORP republics with high GPE burdens also increased the problem . Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population . Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations , variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen , and frequent recourse to surgery . A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti - TB drugs and laboratory supplies , reduced quality control in GPE dispensaries and laboratories , and inadequate treatment . The social conditions favouring the spread of GPE , combined with inadequate systems for diagnosis , treatment , and surveillance , as well as increased drug resistance , produced a serious public health problem .", "TB control in the former ORG ( GPE ) and in most of GPE in DATE was heavily centralized , with separate hospitals ( TB dispensaries ) , TB sanatoriums , GPE research institutes and GPE specialists . The system was designed in DATE to address the challenges of the TB epidemic . Case detection relied strongly on active mass screening by PERSON ( phluorography ) . Specificity , sensitivity , and cost - effectiveness considerations were not features of this approach . PERSON ( ORG ) immunization was a key feature of the GPE ...", "By DATE , there was CARDINAL - fold increase in GPE incidence , and mortality from GPE increased CARDINAL times , compared with DATE . The lowered treatment effectiveness of DATE resulted into an increase in the number of TB chronic patients , creating a permanent ' breeding ground ' for the infection . At that moment , the share of pulmonary GPE cases confirmed by bacterioscopy did not exceed PERCENT , and the share of such cases confirmed by culture testing was PERCENT due to suboptimal effectiveness of laboratory diagnosis , which led to poor detection of smear - positive GPE cases . Being a social disease , GPE affected the most socially and economically marginalized populations in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

This reduces the risk of selecting further resistant bacilli ....", "Patients with sputum smear - positive pulmonary ORG should be monitored by sputum smear examination . This is the only group of GPE patients for whom bacteriological monitoring is possible . It is unnecessary and wasteful of resources to monitor the patient by chest radiography . For patients with sputum smear - negative pulmonary ORG and extra - pulmonary GPE , clinical monitoring is the usual way of assessing response to treatment .
