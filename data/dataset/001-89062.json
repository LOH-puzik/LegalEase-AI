The case was assigned to Mr PERSON , a senior investigator in the prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator Mr PERSON questioned the third applicant as a witness . On DATE he was placed in custody . On DATE the investigator issued a formal decision to arrest the third applicant on suspicion on aiding and abetting kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was allowed to see his fianc\u00e9e , PERSON . It would appear that on the latter date they contracted a marriage because from DATE she began visiting him as his wife and changed her name to PERSON . In the subsequent period she visited the first applicant on a regular basis once or DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL applicants were charged with kidnapping and torture , offences under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . They were accused of having abducted a certain PERSON , a homeless tramp , and forced him to perform physical labour in a fruit warehouse owned by them in exchange for extremely low pay . On several occasions PERSON had run away but the brothers had caught him , beaten him and tortured him by applying electric wires to various parts of his body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and his counsel requested the investigator to arrange for a confrontation with ORG and a certain witness U. On DATE the investigator refused their request , noting that the confrontation was \u201c undesirable as both ORG had previously been financially dependent on the NORP brothers and during a confrontation PERSON could exert a negative influence on them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant and his counsel requested the investigator to interview witnesses PERSON , PERSON , and PERSON , who could allegedly testify that ORG had been able to move around freely and that the NORP brothers had treated him well . On DATE the investigator dismissed the request as unsubstantiated . He noted that ORG \u2019s liberty of movement had indeed been unrestricted in the beginning and the NORP brothers had restrained him \u201c only at a later stage \u201d and that there were \u201c a sufficient number of depositions by witnesses and the victim to the effect that the NORP brothers had treated PERSON very badly and humiliated him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on an unspecified date the police entered and inspected a warehouse belonging to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG television channel GPE broadcast ORG ( \u201c Version \u201d ) programme . The second part of the programme concerned the applicants\u2019 case . The participants included the presenter PERSON Temeyeva , the GPE town prosecutor PERSON , the investigator Mr PERSON , and PERSON , who was head of the division for particularly important cases in the office of the prosecutor of GPE , as well as the victim PERSON , whose face was not shown .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON opened the programme with the following statement :", "\u201c The NORP brothers are , by their nature , cruel , insolent and greedy ; they wished to get cheap or , more precisely , free labour . On the other hand , the victim ORG , a person with no fixed abode , mild and gentle ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The presenter started telling the story of ORG \u2019s enslavement . As she was speaking , black - and - white passport - size photos of the applicants were shown full screen .", "CARDINAL . The presenter \u2019s story alternated with that of the victim PERSON , who related how he had been ill - treated by the PERSON and had unsuccessfully attempted to escape . The presenter asked the participants whether the NORP brothers could be described as sadistic .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON replied as follows :", "\u201c We , that is , prosecutors and the police , have known these brothers from the time when they were still minors ... We investigated the acts committed by the brothers but they could not be held criminally liable by virtue of their young age . After they reached the age [ of majority ] , they found themselves in the dock . All CARDINAL brothers were convicted of disorderly acts . In my opinion , that offence is very much characteristic of all the NORP brothers in its cruelty and meaningless brutality . I think that the personal qualities of the NORP brothers and [ their ] desire to have free labour have led to this crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The participants subsequently discussed why the victim had not come to the police immediately after the beatings had begun , and commented on legal aspects of the pending proceedings :", "\u201c [ Mr PERSON : ] You know when [ V. ] came to the law - enforcement authorities in DATE , our investigative group in the GPE town prosecutor \u2019s office was shocked at the cruelty of this crime . When a person comes for protection to the law - enforcement authorities , you should examine him closely , listen carefully to his story . [ ORG ] had CARDINAL injuries on him . The Convention [ for the Prevention ] of Torture naturally comes to mind .", "[ Presenter : ] The NORP brothers are now charged under CARDINAL provisions of LAW : Article CARDINAL \u2013 kidnapping committed for lucrative motives , and Article CARDINAL \u2013 torture . \u201d", "As she was speaking , the first page of the criminal case file was shown on screen .", "CARDINAL . The other participants offered the following comments :", "[ Mr PERSON : ] The prosecutor \u2019s office will insist on imprisonment as a measure of punishment in respect of all CARDINAL brothers ... For instance , LAW provides for DATE imprisonment , Article CARDINAL provides for DATE imprisonment . The court will have to choose ...", "[ Mr Nikitin : ] A brazen crime . If anyone knows about similar facts , report them to the police and the criminals will be punished ...", "[ Presenter : ] ... In DATE the ORG begins its examination of the criminal case . CARDINAL businessman brothers who got a false idea of being slave - owners will get a well - deserved punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The programme was broadcast again in DATE and on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the journalist PERSON published an article under the headline \u201c The Land of Slaves \u201d ( \u00ab PERSON \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0432 GPE ) in the local newspaper ORG . It began as follows :", "\u201c I am firmly convinced that the following story is just one fact that emerged from the dim waters of market relations . And ethnic relations as well . Though I wish I were impartial as regards these ethnic relations \u2013 each people has its enlightened scholars and cruel murderers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The journalist related the story of PERSON , who had been exploited and beaten by the NORP brothers . The article mentioned that the elder brother \u2019s first name was PERSON , that the CARDINAL other brothers were twins aged DATE and that they traded in fruit at a local market . The applicants\u2019 last names were not listed . A former classmate of PERSON who had given him refuge was quoted as citing a statement by PERSON himself , to the effect that \u201c these NORP have everything fixed up \u201d . The final paragraph read as follows :", "\u201c Many , many questions crossed my mind as I was reading the criminal case file . Why is the life of a dirty piglet more valuable than a human life ? Why are masses of NORP , GPE and others among the unemployed , while \u2018 they\u2019 not only find work for themselves but also use hired labour ! And why does everyone in the town know about the doings of that best friend of all tramps and put up with it ? ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged several complaints about the press coverage of proceedings against them .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE Mr Nikitin replied that the programme had been produced on the basis of information supplied by the division for particularly important cases in the office of the prosecutor of GPE . Pursuant to LAW , the prosecutor \u2019s office had had the right to disclose materials in the case file and make them available to the journalist .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of CARDINAL DATE a deputy prosecutor of GPE replied that there were no grounds to hold officials of the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office criminally liable for disclosure of materials from the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON wrote that there were no grounds for liability to be incurred either by officials of the prosecutor \u2019s office or by journalists who had provided coverage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy prosecutor of GPE replied to the third applicant that Mr PERSON could not be held criminally liable for his statements .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE a deputy prosecutor of GPE confirmed that the disclosure of the case file to the mass media had been in compliance with LAW . He further noted that the GPE town prosecutor ( Mr PERSON ) had been told to use \u201c a more balanced approach in determining the scope of information that could be made public in criminal cases before the conviction has become final \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In similarly worded letters of DATE and DATE , deputy prosecutors of GPE informed the first and third applicants that there were no grounds to initiate a criminal case against the maker of the television programme and that no further replies concerning that matter would be given . The GPE town prosecutor was , however , instructed to check whether a criminal investigation should be opened in connection with the article in the ORG newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office issued a formal decision not to initiate a criminal case for libel against the journalist PERSON , who had authored the article \u201c The Land of Slaves \u201d . It appears from the decision that , in PERSON \u2019s own words , she had received formal permission from the investigator PERSON to consult the case file and that PERSON had approved a draft of the article . PERSON , however , denied any memory of granting access to the file to PERSON and claimed he had never read the article in question . He did not deny , though , that he had briefed the presenter of the television programme on details of the criminal case . Referring to the applicants\u2019 conviction by the judgment of DATE ( see below ) , the investigator found that the contents of the article had been essentially true and that PERSON had not disseminated any false information damaging the third applicant \u2019s dignity or honour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a directions hearing and scheduled the opening of the trial for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The trial continued in DATE and DATE . Witnesses for the prosecution and defence , as well as the victim PERSON , testified in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicants guilty of kidnapping and torture under LAW and LAW . The third applicant was sentenced to DATE and DATE imprisonment , whilst the first and second applicants were to serve DATE in a high - security colony .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the conviction . Their points of appeal concerned , in particular , the alleged prejudice to their presumption of innocence which had resulted from the newspaper publication and television programme described above . The prosecution also lodged an appeal . The case file was sent to ORG for consideration on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting president of ORG of GPE returned the case file to ORG because the trial judge had failed to consider the applicants\u2019 comments on the trial record , to locate the allegedly missing documents and to provide the applicants with a copy of the prosecution \u2019s points of appeal .", "CARDINAL . In an interim decision of DATE the ORG partly accepted and partly rejected the applicants\u2019 corrections of the trial record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE heard the case on appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE . The court did not address the ORG arguments concerning an alleged impairment of their presumption of innocence .", "CARDINAL . Following their conviction , the applicants remained in detention facility no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL for unspecified reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the facility administration distributed DATE clothing to the prisoners . The applicants refused to take it . On DATE the third applicant accepted a padded jacket and the second applicant DATE shoes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were listed for transport from detention facility no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL to correctional colonies . According to them , the outside temperature on DATE was -CARDINALo C ; the Government submitted a certificate from the meteorological service showing that the temperature fell to -CARDINAL.CARDINAL o C in the night .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , when the applicants were taken to the assembly cell of the detention facility together with CARDINAL other detainees , they were wearing T - shirts and tracksuit bottoms . The wardens offered them DATE jackets and hats which , according to the ORG , hailed from the humanitarian - aid supplies but had been washed and were neat . The applicants claimed that the items were \u201c torn and old \u201d and refused to take them .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicants , together with other prisoners , were put into a prison van and taken to GPE railway station to board the FAC train that arrived at TIME The distance between the facility and the station was QUANTITY and the journey time was TIME . At TIME the van arrived at the station and the applicants emerged from it without DATE clothing . A prison inspector dashed into the van , collected the DATE clothing which the applicants had left behind , and gave it to the escorting officer . The officer again offered the clothing to the applicants to put on but they refused to do so , claiming that it was unfit to wear . According to the statements by the inspector and the officer , the clothing was in an \u201c appropriate condition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the argument went on for TIME . The head of the train escort refused to take the applicants in without appropriate clothing and the facility personnel decided to take them back into the cells .", "CARDINAL . In support of their claim that the clothing had been \u201c inappropriate \u201d , the applicants produced to the ORG a written statement signed by CARDINAL other detainees who had been held in facility no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE and other dates the applicants complained that they had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON responded to them in the following terms :", "\u201c It has been established that DATE clothing was given to you and that you remained outside in clothing inappropriate for DATE only because you refused to put it on . Your arguments that the clothing offered did not meet sanitary and hygiene standards could not have been objectively confirmed ; there are no grounds for disciplining any officials . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant arrived in his van at the FAC police station for questioning . On DATE he was taken into custody ( see above ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the investigator PERSON impounded the van and ordered that it should be kept in the car park of a private company . The charging order itself did not indicate the grounds on which it had been issued , but referred back to the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE , a copy of which was not made available to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant repeatedly complained to various authorities that his van had been unlawfully seized . He alleged that the investigator was using it for his private errands .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the acting PERSON prosecutor reported to the third applicant the findings of an internal inquiry into his complaints . He found as follows :", "\u201c On CARDINAL DATE PERSON arrested you ... However , the PERSON car , in which you had arrived , remained in the street outside the LOC of the GPE police station , and measures for its safe keeping were not taken . The car remained there until DATE , when PERSON impounded it ... However , he did not examine the state of the car , nor did he show it to you or any attesting witnesses ...", "The impounded car was taken by a road police employee from GPE police station , acting on PERSON orders , into the premises of the [ private company ] . The car was not properly sealed ...", "It must be noted at the same time that there existed no legal grounds for impounding the vehicle , as required by LAW . According to that provision , a charging order could be issued with a view to securing a civil claim or a possible confiscation order . However , in this case no civil claim was brought throughout the proceedings and the criminal - law provisions under which [ the third applicant ] was charged do not provide for confiscation measures as a penal sanction .", "Thus , PERSON breached ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW which set out the requirements for the record of impounding and the procedure for issuing charging orders \u2013 and also the Instruction on the procedure for seizing , accounting , storing and transferring physical evidence in criminal cases , values and other assets by law - enforcement authorities and courts .", "Further to the internal inquiry , the prosecutor of GPE was advised to determine whether PERSON should be disciplined . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator PERSON handed the keys and registration documents of the van to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In letters of DATE and DATE the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office informed the third applicant that Mr PERSON had been disciplined for breaches of the Instruction on the procedure for storing physical evidence and fined in the amount of his bonus salary for DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE the ORG lifted the charging order and the third applicant \u2019s van was returned to PERSON ( his brother \u2019s wife ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the third applicant sued the investigator Mr PERSON for damages on account of his failure to ensure the safe keeping of his van ; all CARDINAL applicants also brought a defamation action against the journalist PERSON , seeking compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage . FAC ordered the joinder of both actions and listed a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants asked the court for leave to appear . PERSON , as a representative of the first applicant , asked the court to ensure the attendance of the applicants at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued several procedural decisions . In the first decision , it rejected PERSON request for the applicants\u2019 attendance , holding that LAW did not provide for the possibility of bringing convicted persons from a correctional colony to the local investigative unit for the purpose of taking part in a hearing in a civil case . The second decision took stock of the absence of both parties \u2013 the journalist PERSON and a representative of the newspaper had not shown up despite having been notified of the hearing DATE and indicated that the case would be heard in their absence . It appears that PERSON then walked out of the courtroom in protest against the court \u2019s decision to hear the case in the absence of the first applicant . In a third decision , the court decided to proceed with the case in her absence . It additionally rejected the ORG request for leave to appear on the same grounds as above , adding :", "\u201c ... parties to the case do not just have rights but also have duties , such as [ a duty ] to make written submissions and substantiate their claims . Taking into account the fact that the rights of Mr A. Khuzhin , Mr NORP and Mr NORP are not restricted and can be exercised by them in full measure , there are no legal grounds to ensure the attendance of individuals who have committed particularly serious , insolent [ \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0437\u043a\u0438\u0435 ] crimes . \u201d", "Lastly , ORG rejected the ORG requests to summon witnesses and study the hearing records , reasoning as follows :", "\u201c The substantiation of the PERSON claim seeks to obtain a new assessment of the circumstances and findings set out in the criminal judgment of DATE . The statements by the NORP brothers are not reasoned or argued ; they are not procedural requests as such [ sic ] ; they have repeatedly studied the materials in the case file and can study them again by receiving copies of them ; since they are serving a sentence imposed by a court judgment in a penitentiary institution , the case must be examined in their absence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused for the same reasons the third applicant \u2019s request to obtain attendance of witnesses and an expert . It also decided to proceed with the hearing in the absence of both GPE representatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed all of the applicants\u2019 claims . On the defamation issue it found that the article \u201c The Land of Slaves \u201d had been based on the true facts which had subsequently been established in the criminal judgment of DATE . As regards the claim relating to the damage caused to the third applicant \u2019s van , it established that the vehicle had been returned to him after he had paid compensation to the victim for non - pecuniary damage and that the investigator had acted within his powers and had not caused any damage through his actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and PERSON appealed . They complained , in particular , of a breach of the principle of equality of arms . PERSON additionally pointed out that she had not been the representative of either PERSON or NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE held an appeal hearing . It appears that neither the applicants nor PERSON were in attendance . The court held that there had been no breach of equality of arms because the applicants had been duly notified of the hearing and informed of their right to appoint representatives . The second and third applicants had not made use of that right , whereas the first applicant \u2019s representative , PERSON , had declined to take part in the hearing . In the court \u2019s view , the joinder of the cases was also lawful and justified because the second applicant had been a party to both claims .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter of DATE from the prosecutor of GPE to the second applicant , it was incumbent on the court hearing a civil claim to decide whether the detainee \u2019s presence was necessary . The second applicant could have been escorted to the hearing if there had been a decision of ORG to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the third applicant brought a defamation action against the prosecutor Mr PERSON . He challenged as defamatory the statements made by PERSON in the ORG television programme about the applicants\u2019 adolescent delinquency , insolence and greediness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment . Mr PERSON made oral submissions to the court ; the third applicant was neither present nor represented . In dismissing the defamation action , the court noted as relevant the materials relating to the criminal case against the applicants and , more specifically , a reference letter for the second applicant from his secondary school that concerned his unauthorised absences from classes and disorderly behaviour . The court held that the facts as established in the judgment of DATE had justified Mr PERSON \u2019s reference to the applicants as insolent and greedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the third applicant lodged his points of appeal , alleging , in particular , a violation of the principle of equality of arms .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has not been provided with any information about the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Code provides that torture is punishable with up to DATE imprisonment ( LAW ) and kidnapping with up to DATE imprisonment ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure ( in force at the material time ) provided as follows :", "\u201c If the investigator observes , on the basis of the case file , that the crime committed caused pecuniary damage to an individual or organisation , he must explain to them or to their representatives that they have a right to lodge a civil claim ...", "If a civil claim has been lodged , the investigator must issue a reasoned decision recognising [ the interested party ] as a civil claimant or refusing such status ... \u201d", "\u201c Materials from the preliminary investigation may only be made public with the consent of an investigator or a prosecutor and to the extent they consider it possible ... \u201d", "\u201c With a view to securing a civil claim or a possible confiscation order , the investigator must charge the property of the suspect , defendant ... or of the other persons who keep criminally acquired property ...
