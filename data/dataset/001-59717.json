GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 14+8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "Antonio Pastor Ridruejo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , born in DATE , was a NORP national at the time of the events complained of ; he subsequently obtained NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the father of the child PERSON , born out of wedlock on DATE . In a document dated DATE , he acknowledged paternity of the unborn child , and , in a further document dated DATE , he acknowledged paternity and undertook to pay maintenance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met the child \u2019s mother , PERSON , in DATE and in DATE he moved into her flat where they lived together until DATE or , as stated by the applicant , until DATE . In any event , the applicant still visited the child and her mother until DATE , and DATE and DATE he regularly fetched GPE for visits . As from DATE Ms D. prohibited any contacts between the applicant and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access to his daughter on DATE from TIME until TIME as well as on the second DATE and at GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "The court , referring to section CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) , observed that the mother , in the exercise of her right to custody , determined the child \u2019s relations with third persons , and that the father could only be granted a right of access by court order , if this was in the interest of the child .", "According to the court \u2019s findings , these conditions were not met in the applicant \u2019s case . The court noted that ORG and the parties had been heard and that several witnesses had been questioned at a hearing in DATE . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s wish to see his daughter resulted from his sincere bonds and true affection . Nevertheless , the court reached the conclusion that access was not in the child \u2019s interest as PERSON had taken such a strong dislike to the applicant and opposed any contacts so firmly that the child would be put into a situation of antipathy and tensions which would probably considerably affect her well - being .", "The court saw no special circumstances which , nevertheless , could render such contacts beneficial for the child . The relations which had developed between the applicant and his child during the period of cohabitation could not possibly be of such importance as to take the risk that the child be irritated on account of the mother \u2019s feelings of dislike . The witnesses , nurses in the day - nursery frequented by the child , had stated that , following the separation and the disruption of contacts with the applicant , the child \u2019s behaviour had been without any or at least without any significant or lasting peculiarities and that ORG was a well - balanced , happy and open - minded child . The applicant \u2019s assertion that she missed him and , after the disruption of contacts , had repeatedly inquired after him , had therefore not been proven .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a psychological expert opinion on the question whether contacts with the applicant were in ORG \u2019s interest . On DATE , following a first conversation with the expert , the applicant challenged her for bias . He also requested that another expert be appointed on the ground that the expert \u2019s scientific approach did not reflect the latest state of research . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , finding that , taking into account the expert \u2019s explanations of CARDINAL DATE , there were no reasons to doubt her impartiality or her capabilities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to progress with the proceedings . He further applied for a provisional order granting him the right to have access to ORG during TIME DATE and prohibiting her mother from obstructing such contacts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a provisional order of access . ORG found that there was no urgency and that the applicant could be requested to await the outcome of the main proceedings . Furthermore , such an order would anticipate the possible terms of a final decision . The disadvantages for the child , should a provisional order be issued and the request be eventually dismissed in the main proceedings , were more serious than those for the applicant in continuing with the prevailing situation .", "CARDINAL . In her opinion dated DATE , the expert noted that she had visited the applicant \u2019s family in DATE and again heard the applicant , the child \u2019s mother and the child on several occasions DATE and DATE . She reached the conclusion that a right of access without prior conversations to overcome the conflicts between the parents was not in the interest of the child \u2019s well - being .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , ORG , noting that ORG had omitted to hear the child , inquired with the expert about whether hearing the child in court on her relationship with her father would be a psychological strain for her . In her reply of DATE , the expert indicated that she had not directly asked the child about her father . The risk inherent in questioning her about whether she wished to see her father was that , in this conflict between the parents , the child might have the impression that her statements were decisive .", "CARDINAL . At a court hearing on DATE , the applicant and the child \u2019s mother entered into an agreement . Under the terms of this agreement , the applicant declared not to have resort to any court proceedings , to refrain from any inquiries in the mother \u2019s personal environment and not to exercise the right of custody obtained under NORP law on the condition that they would undertake a parental therapy . The proceedings were suspended until termination of this therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed as the child \u2019s mother had not approved of the CARDINAL institutions for family therapy proposed by the applicant and had failed to react to his suggestion that she should make a proposal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "ORG considered that personal contacts with his child born out of wedlock were supposed to enable the father to verify the development and the well - being of his child and to maintain existing natural bonds . Section CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of the Civil Code thus pursued the same purpose , however , the conditions were different . While , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , the parent not having custody and care had the right to personal contact with the child born in wedlock , section DATE did not grant such a right to the father of a child born out of wedlock . Rather , the person having custody , as a rule the mother , determined if and to what extent the father was entitled to have contacts with his child . Only if contacts were in the interest of the child could the competent court grant a right of access . This weaker legal position resulted from the different social position of the father of a child born out of wedlock . Referring to case - law of ORG of DATE and DATE , ORG found no reason to doubt the constitutionality of section DATE of LAW . The court added that while , for considerations of legal policy , there was an urgent need for a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock , it was bound by the law in force .", "ORG considered that such contacts could be ordered only if this was advantageous and beneficial for the child \u2019s well - being . It could be assumed that , as a rule , such contacts were ordered as regular contacts between a father and his child offered the possibility of a normal development and facilitated the forming of the child \u2019s own personality . In applying these principles in the applicant \u2019s case , the court found that the applicant applied for access on the ground of true love for his daughter . However , such responsible motives could not result in granting a right of access which would have to be enforced . The child would suffer from the existing tensions between the parents on the occasion of every contact and her further development would be disturbed . There were no particular circumstances to conclude that contacts would nevertheless be favourable to the child . In this respect , the court found that there had already been tensions between her parents during the period of cohabitation . Furthermore , the expert had established that the child had repressed her memories concerning the applicant and did not talk about this subject in order to protect herself . She did not suffer from the situation .", "ORG further considered that the expert opinion was reliable and could not be objected to . The finding that the parents had to start a therapy with a view to overcome their conflicts before the child could have contacts with both of them was independent of the question of responsibility for the said situation . The court finally found that it had not been required to hear the child on her relations to her father as this would have amounted to a psychological strain .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with ORG , complaining that the refusal of access to his daughter infringed his parental rights and amounted to discrimination , as well as about the alleged unfairness of the taking of expert evidence . ORG acknowledged receipt on DATE .", "By letter of DATE the applicant inquired with ORG about the state of proceedings and urged a speedy decision . On DATE the ORG informed him that in a similar case which had been registered at an earlier date a decision was envisaged for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant addressed a letter to the President of ORG complaining that the examination of his constitutional complaint had been postponed until DATE . In her reply of CARDINAL DATE the Judge dealing with the applicant \u2019s case informed the applicant that , due to the heavy workload of ORG in DATE no decision could be taken . A decision was envisaged for DATE . Having regard to the importance of the subject matter , such a decision required careful preparation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . The statutory provisions on custody and access are to be found in the NORP Civil Code . They have been amended on several occasions and many were repealed by the amended LAW ) of DATE ( ORG , p. CARDINAL ) , which came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reads as follows ( the ORG \u2019s translation ) :", "\u201c The father and the mother have the right and the duty to exercise parental authority ( elterliche PERSON ) over a minor child .

Pursuant to section CARDINAL a \u00a7 CARDINAL , as amended , the parents of a minor child born out of wedlock jointly exercise custody if they make a declaration to that effect ( declaration on joint custody ) or if they marry . According to LAW , as amended , a child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child . Moreover , the parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ; and they may order the parties to fulfil their obligations towards the child . The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child \u2019s well - being would be endangered .
