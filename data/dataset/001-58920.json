During a conversation with the defendant , it was observed that he had an abrasion of the epidermis at the base of the neck . When his shirt collar was opened , it was found to be a linear abrasion of the epidermis around the front section of the neck , corresponding to the furrows found on a hanging victim . The defendant explained that ... he had tried to hang himself with a sheet , but had been resuscitated . This was his second attempt at suicide and he could not explain why he behaved in this way . He maintained that he had moments when he felt as if his consciousness was interrupted and that at these times he tried to take his own life , mainly by hanging but also by taking drugs and slashing himself with a razor .
