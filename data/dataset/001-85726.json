The applicant , who was born in DATE , is a NORP national . Her mother and younger siblings live in GPE . She is the daughter of PERSON , who was a government minister in GPE DATE and subsequently the ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father has been detained since DATE on treason charges . Her father was first arrested in DATE when the present regime , ORG ( ORG ) , took power . He was ultimately charged with treason and detained . In DATE she was followed and arrested by CARDINAL men when she went to visit her father in prison and detained for DATE during which she was asked questions about her father \u2019s political life . She escaped after claiming to be unwell and being allowed to visit a local hospital . She subsequently hid at a friend \u2019s house until her father was acquitted and released later in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s father disappeared . He was believed to have fled to GPE , having been warned that he was likely to be rearrested . The family , including the applicant , also went to live in GPE for a while , but she returned to GPE in DATE hoping that the situation had improved . DATE she was questioned about her father \u2019s whereabouts and her passport was confiscated . She obtained another passport using her real name but a false date of birth . In DATE she again travelled to GPE and then returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant obtained a ticket and tourist visa for GPE , originally planning to travel as a tourist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was at home with family members when plain clothes police officers or soldiers raided the house , looking for evidence . They had brought the applicant \u2019s father with them in handcuffs . The applicant stayed with a friend for DATE and then travelled to GPE via GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed asylum on arrival in GPE on the basis of her father \u2019s political activities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused her application for asylum on the ground that she had not herself been involved in any political parties or activities in GPE and that she had not claimed to have experienced any arrests , detention or significant problems from the time of her father \u2019s release in DATE until the claimed raid on her home in DATE . This was considered to be evidence that she would not be of any adverse interest to the GPE authorities . Furthermore , she had used the passport she had obtained from the NORP authorities through the correct channels in the name of PERSON to leave GPE without apparent difficulties , having previously used this passport to visit GPE in DATE for DATE after which she had returned to GPE . Despite her claims that her passport in the name of ORG had been confiscated earlier by the authorities and that the date of birth on the passport with which she had left GPE was false , the names were ones which she used and which her parents had given her and she had submitted letters of residence to obtain the passport from the authorities . It was considered that she would not have been able to leave GPE through normal immigration channels had she been of any particular or adverse interest to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Special Adjudicator dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to refuse her asylum claim . He found that there was no evidence that she had been deeply associated with her father \u2019s political activities . She held no personal political opinion , had not been politically active and had given no evidence at the hearing to demonstrate that she was any closer to her father than any other family members . Her arrest in DATE had not occurred because of any imputed political opinion but was rather to inquire about her father . Following her release the authorities had shown no further interest in her . After returning from GPE in DATE she continued to live at home and was thus easy to locate . The applicant \u2019s assertion that she was believed by the authorities in GPE to be involved in rebel activities and to assist her father politically was emphatically rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , by a majority of CARDINAL , refused her appeal against the determination of the Special Adjudicator . It found that GPE was not correct in stating that there was no evidence of individuals being at risk of persecution because of the political activities of their relatives , as he should have considered and made a finding on a letter from ORG before him which contained evidence to the contrary . The Special Adjudicator had also erred in stating that the applicant had claimed to have been followed but never accosted or apprehended after she returned from GPE in DATE and it would have been better if he had referred to the applicant \u2019s claim to have gone into hiding when concluding that the authorities had shown no further interest in her after her release . Though the applicant was a credible witness and events in GPE had given rise to a genuine fear of persecution on her part , she had not been seriously ill - treated when detained for a short time in DATE and questioned about her father \u2019s political activities . Her representative had conceded at the hearing that she had not been subjected to past persecution . There was no evidence that the authorities were looking for the applicant in the period between her being questioned and her father \u2019s release in DATE . However , it was noted that this may have been because she was in hiding . After the applicant \u2019s father disappeared in DATE there was a period before she went to GPE during which the authorities could have found her at her home and arrested her if they had wanted to do so . They could have arrested her at any time between her return to GPE in DATE and DATE , except for a brief period from DATE during which she returned to GPE . During this period , the applicant believed that she was being watched and followed . If this was the case and the authorities had as serious an interest in her as she claimed , it was difficult to understand why they had not arrested her . Whilst in DATE she was accosted by CARDINAL men who asked her if she knew where her father was and confiscated her original passport , they did not arrest her or subject her to the persecution she claimed to fear . If she was correct and the authorities were looking for her father they were as likely to obtain information from her during that period as they would be during the period after he was detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also dismissed the applicant \u2019s assertion that the authorities believed her to be involved in rebel activities and to have assisted her father politically . It considered that the authorities could have arrested the applicant either during the periods outlined above or in DATE , when they brought her father to the house in handcuffs when she was present . There was no claim that the applicant or any other member of the family present at that time had been arrested . The evidence showed that the only real interest the authorities had in the applicant was in discovering her father \u2019s whereabouts . They no longer needed this information since he was in custody . Though the applicant sought to argue that the GPE authorities might still wish to obtain information from her , which would assist the conviction of her father or his associates , it was likely that they were looking for incriminating evidence when they searched the home in DATE . However they did not arrest the applicant . Having regard to the country information reports , the tribunal also found that there was no evidence that family members of political opponents were negatively associated or as a result persecuted in any way .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL - member majority of the ORG did not find that the applicant had established a reasonable degree of likelihood that , as a family member of an opposition politician , she would herself be at risk of persecution . The minority member , however , considered that the applicant , because of her father \u2019s political position , would be perceived by ORG as a political opponent . Moreover , the Government might attempt , by use of force if necessary , to obtain evidence from her to be used against her father at trial . The majority of the ORG recommended on humanitarian grounds that the Secretary of ORG reconsider the applicant \u2019s position , in the light of her genuine subjective fear of returning to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant permission to appeal to ORG on the basis that the grounds of appeal did not disclose any arguable point of law .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant made further representations to the Secretary of ORG claiming that her removal from GPE would be a breach of the latter \u2019s obligations under LAW , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention and LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG rejected these representations , inter alia , on the basis that the Special Adjudicator and ORG had addressed all the reasons in their determinations and that the concerns raised under LAW in relation to difficulties the applicant might suffer in GPE did not engage GPE obligations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an Adjudicator refused the applicant \u2019s human rights appeal under section CARDINAL ) of ORG ( \u201c DATE Act \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was of the opinion that as the applicant \u2019s claim had been considered and dismissed by both a Special Adjudicator and the ORG , albeit on a majority decision , he needed to consider whether there were any circumstances that had arisen since the date of the ORG \u2019s decision that would provide exceptional circumstances sufficient to engage LAW . Though the current conditions in GPE were certainly no better than they were at the time the applicant had left the country , there was nothing to suggest that they had seriously deteriorated or that the position of her father had worsened . The Adjudicator noted that the applicant \u2019s cousin had informed her that the remainder of her family were well in GPE and that her legal representative had conceded that there was no emphatic ground to contend that LAW would be breached should the applicant be returned to GPE . He further observed that , with commendable honesty , the applicant \u2019s legal representative had accepted that LAW CARDINAL claim would be hard to uphold and had rather sought to concentrate on the Article CARDINAL claim . As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions under Article CARDINAL , the Adjudicator found that the applicant had established a private and not family life in GPE as the relationship she enjoyed with a male friend did not constitute family life . Though she had established a private life during her stay in GPE in excess of DATE , revolving around her employment in a church and her accountancy studies , her removal to GPE , however sympathetic one might be to her circumstances , would not be disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was detained with a view to effecting her removal from GPE and removal directions were set for her return to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors obtained an injunction from a ORG judge over the telephone restraining the Secretary of ORG from removing the applicant from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued an application for permission to apply for judicial review of her removal directions on the basis that her removal would be in breach of her rights under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s application for permission to apply for judicial review was refused by a ORG judge following consideration of the documents . The judge refused the application holding that it was an abuse of process and merely an attempt to frustrate her removal directions since there had been no application for permission to appeal against the ORG \u2019s determination dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Secretary of ORG refused the applicant discretionary leave to remain in GPE and found that the applicant \u2019s further submissions did not amount to a fresh claim . All the points raised in her submissions had already been addressed when the applicant \u2019s earlier claim had been determined and they were not significantly different from the material that had previously been considered . The applicant \u2019s fears that she might be detained , tortured or subjected to degrading treatment given the manner of her escape were considered speculative as she had provided no evidence to support this claim . The applicant had failed to provide any evidence that the GPE authorities were of the opinion that she could assist them with any inquiries regarding her father . No new or compelling evidence had been provided . Article CARDINAL had already been considered during her appeal against the refusal of her human rights application and all the issues she had raised in her current representations had also been raised before and considered thoroughly by the Adjudicator . Furthermore , the applicant had the opportunity to apply for permission to appeal against the Adjudicator \u2019s determination of CARDINAL DATE but had failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . Following the application of Rule DATE and communication of this case to the Government for their observations , the applicant was released from detention and granted temporary admission into GPE , with a requirement to report on a DATE basis . The Government confirmed in writing that , as a result of the Rule CARDINAL indication , the applicant would not be removed from GPE pending the conclusion of the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
