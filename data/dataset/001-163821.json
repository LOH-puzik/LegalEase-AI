CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE .", "The CARDINAL - judge panel ( krivi\u010dno vije\u0107e ) has , on its own motion , within the meaning of LAW of LAW , examined further detention of [ the applicant ] and found as follows :", "- the detention [ of the applicant ] should be extended pursuant to LAW .", "Notably , given that [ the applicant ] is indicted for an aggravated murder pursuant to LAW ( a ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , and in view of the seriousness of the criminal offence for which he could be sentenced to DATE of imprisonment , and especially in view of the fact that the accused committed the said criminal offence on DATE at around CARDINAL , after which he fled the crime scene , and that the authorised police officers of ORG deprived him of liberty on DATE at CARDINAL , these are the reasons , in view of the panel , justifying the extension of detention pursuant to LAW .", "In the opinion of this panel [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention should be extended also pursuant to the detention basis as provided in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , given that [ the applicant ] is charged with aggravated murder under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , and having in mind that the provided sentence is DATE of imprisonment , the first condition for the extension of detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW is fulfilled , that is that the provided sentence for the criminal offence is DATE or more . Furthermore , in this particular case there are particularly qualifying circumstances of the criminal offence at issue due to the manner in which it was committed or its consequences , which are reflected in the fact that [ the applicant ] , as it transpires from the case - file , [ ... ] in an insidious manner and for material gain , deprived X of his life [ ... ] by shooting him at close range in the chest and in the back with an automatic gun several times , inflicting on him numerous injuries and causing his immediate death , after which he fled , and according to this panel the aforementioned established facts and circumstances , in their entirety , represent extraordinary circumstances indicating that the [ applicant \u2019s ] release would threaten public order and peace , which reasons justify the extension of detention . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ( Apelacioni sud ) in GPE dismissed both appeals . It established that the decision delivered by fax was identical to the original which was signed and stamped . It further considered that the applicant had been served with a decision bearing no signature or stamp by an obvious mistake , which did not make the decision unlawful or cause a violation of his human rights guaranteed by LAW and the Convention . One of the judges involved in the ruling was GPE", "CARDINAL . By DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal , submitting a number of complaints , CARDINAL of them being that ORG should have been excluded from the bench given that she was related to the representative of the injured party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud ) in GPE quashed the decision of ORG and ordered that the case be re - examined . ORG quashed the said decision on the ground that GPE had indeed to be excluded from ruling on the applicant \u2019s appeals as she was the sister of the injured party \u2019s representative . In view of this , the court did not consider it necessary to examine the other complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon the remittal by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeals . This decision was not submitted to the case - file . From the subsequent decision of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , however , it transpires that ORG held , in particular , that : ( a ) the applicant \u2019s detention had not ended on DATE , as the previous detention order had not specified how long the detention would last and the statutory time - limit of DATE was not mandatory ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) ; and ( b ) the absence of the stamp and signature on the detention order did not make it unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal complaining that his detention had not been extended within the statutory time - limit of DATE , that the copy of the relevant decision had not been signed and stamped , and that the presumption of innocence had been violated by ORG decision . He relied , inter alia , on DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal . It considered in particular that the relevant legislation limited the duration of the detention to DATE after the indictment , and that there was no other limitation in that regard . The courts had a duty to examine DATE if reasons for detention persisted and , depending on the circumstances , extend it or revoke it . There was no obligation on the courts to specify how long the detention would last , given their obligation to control the duration of the detention DATE . However , these statutory time - limits were not mandatory and the fact that the decision had been issued after DATE and DATE could not therefore be decisive for concluding that the applicant \u2019s right to liberty was violated . The court also held that ORG and ORG had not stated that the applicant was guilty but that it transpired from the case - file and the disputed decisions that the applicant had been charged with the relevant criminal offence . The court did not address the complaint about the lack of a stamp and signature on the copy of the decision extending the detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It is clear from the case - file that the above decision of ORG was not dispatched before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as submitted by the Government , ORG issued a first - instance decision on the charges against the applicant . They did not provide a copy thereof . There is also no information in the case - file as to whether the criminal proceedings against the applicant have ended in the meantime and if so what the outcome was ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
