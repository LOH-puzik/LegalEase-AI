The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was an employee of a glass factory in GPE . On DATE the factory granted the applicant and his family a flat for their use in GPE , consisting of a kitchen , CARDINAL room and a communal toilet and measuring QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) , which regulated the sale of publicly - owned flats previously let under protected tenancies , giving the right to holders of such tenancies of publicly - owned flats to purchase them from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions .", "CARDINAL . Under that LAW the applicant as the buyer and GPE as the seller concluded a contract for the sale of the said flat on DATE . A copy of the contract was submitted for approval by the ORG Attorney 's ORG . On DATE approval was given .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON GPE ) recorded the applicant 's ownership of the flat in the court 's land register . A copy of this decision was sent for information to the GPE State Attorney 's ORG in GPE ( PERSON pravobraniteljstvo ORG \u017eupanije u GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE State Attorney 's ORG brought a civil action against the applicant and GPE in ORG , seeking annulment of the sale contract in question . They argued that the applicant could not have obtained a protected tenancy of the flat because the glass factory where he had worked had had no right to dispose of the said flat and that such a right had been vested in GPE alone . ORG accepted these arguments and in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE annulled the sale contract . The judgment was upheld by ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) on DATE . The relevant parts of its judgment read as follows :", "\u201c The ORG decision of DATE , granting the first plaintiff PERSON the right to use a flat in GPE at QUANTITY Street , , consisting of CARDINAL room , a kitchen and a communal toilet , clearly and expressly shows that the flat in question as regards its size and equipment is to be considered an unsuitable flat ( neuvjetan stan ) DATE provisional accommodation ( nu\u017eni smje\u0161taj ) .", "The question whether the first plaintiff actually acquired the flat in question as provisional accommodation can not be assessed separately in the proceedings at issue ; instead we have to accept the presumption that it was so , which the first plaintiff knew or should have known , owing to which he could not acquire a protected tenancy of the flat in question since under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Official Gazette nos . DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in force at the time , a protected tenancy could not be acquired in respect of flats and LOC used as provisional accommodation , as correctly established by the court of first instance in the impugned judgment .", "Since the main condition for sale of a flat under LAW ( Official Gazette nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) is that the buyer is a holder of a protected tenancy of the flat which is the subject of the sale , the first - instance court correctly found that the contract in question concluded between the first and the second plaintiff on CARDINAL DATE was null and void under section CARDINAL of LAW because it had had no [ legal ] basis as the first plaintiff had not been a holder of a protected tenancy of the flat .", "This court likewise accepts further findings of the first - instance court : that the first plaintiff had not acquired a protected tenancy of the flat in question , and the glass factory ... had had no right to dispose of the flat to give it to the first plaintiff for his use and so that he could acquire a protected tenancy , which he had therefore not done because , as said above , the glass factory actually gave the flat to the first plaintiff merely as provisional accommodation .", "...", "The evidence submitted does not show that the first plaintiff acquired a protected tenancy of the flat in question or that the flat was part of the glass factory 's housing assets , or that GPE or GPE recognised the first plaintiff 's protected tenancy of the flat ... and therefore the sale contract in question ... is in fact null and void because it has no [ legal ] basis DATE that is to say because the first plaintiff was not a holder of a protected tenancy of that flat ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint , arguing that a number of his constitutional rights , including his right to property , had been infringed because the lower courts ' judgments had deprived him of his ownership of the flat in question .
