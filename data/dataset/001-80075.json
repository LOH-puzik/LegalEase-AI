It called for their dismissal and named the applicant as one of the individuals whose employment should be terminated ( see , for example , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As a direct result , ORG and ORG initiated inquiries into the religious activities of the ORG 's staff members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in summarising the findings of ORG , found that there were insufficient grounds for opening a preliminary investigation . At the same time it stated that , inter alia , the activities at the School were \u201c not free of criminal culpability \u201d , and that they were in contravention of LAW and \u201c probably \u201d the relevant education Acts and regulations .

On DATE the principal of the School was dismissed by ORG . The dismissal order directly referred to the negative media coverage and the findings of ORG and accused her of tolerating the activities of ORG at the ORG to the detriment of its staff and pupils . It also suggested that the principal should have dismissed those members of staff who were Word of Life followers . It is unclear whether the principal appealed against her dismissal .", "CARDINAL . A new principal was appointed soon thereafter .", "CARDINAL . In a broadcast on the Hristo Botev radio station , aired on DATE , the MP stressed that there were still members of ORG working in the ORG , such as the swimming pool manager ( the post occupied by the applicant ) , and inferred from this that the ORG had not conclusively resolved the matter with the dismissal of the former principal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a mechanical engineer and had a second university degree in pedagogical sciences . She had been involved in the religious activities of ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The job description did not expressly refer to any education or professional qualification requirements for the post . The applicant 's basic salary was set at CARDINAL old NORP levs ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) with a PERCENT bonus for length of service .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the principal of the ORG was dismissed and a new one was appointed soon thereafter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to a meeting with ORG and his deputy . Another member of staff , PERSON , was also summoned to the meeting , which took place on the premises of the School . At the meeting , the inspectors asked for their resignations as a means of easing public tensions . The applicant contended , although this was disputed by the Government , that the inspectors had threatened them that if they did not resign of their own accord or did not renounce their faith , they would be dismissed on disciplinary grounds . The inspectors claimed that irrespective of their work performance they \u201c could instruct the [ new ] principal \u201d to dismiss them . PERSON denied being a member of ORG , while the applicant did not and also refused to resign . No assessment or mention was made during the meeting as to whether the applicant was performing her job well and whether she met the requirements for holding her post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the new principal of the School in writing of her meeting of DATE with ORG and his deputy . No action was taken in response .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the new principal alienated the applicant \u2013 her office phone was removed , the locks to the swimming pool were changed without her being provided with a set of keys and the supervision of the renovation of the swimming pool was entrusted to a subordinate even though it should allegedly have been her responsibility . The new principal also made enquiries as to the applicant 's work performance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the human resources department of the ORG prepared a list of CARDINAL employees allegedly without job descriptions . The applicant 's name and post were among them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON radio aired the interview with the MP in which he implied that the applicant 's post was CARDINAL of those still being occupied by a member of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was dismissed , with immediate effect , on the grounds of not meeting the education and professional qualification requirements for the post of \u201c swimming pool manager \u201d ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . When she was served with the order , the applicant enquired as to which requirements she did not meet , but the new principal did not inform her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated proceedings before ORG challenging the lawfulness of the dismissal . She also sought reinstatement in her previous post and compensation for loss of income .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that her dismissal was directly related to her religious beliefs and her refusal to resign of her own accord . Such a reason for terminating her employment contract , she argued , was a violation of LAW of LAW and LAW , which prohibited religious discrimination .", "CARDINAL . During the trial it was established that in DATE there had been a further amendment to the ORG 's roster of posts , which ORG had approved in a letter of DATE , but with effect from DATE . The amended roster of posts no longer envisaged the post of \u201c swimming pool manager \u201d , but provided for the post of \u201c sports complex organiser \u201d . On an unspecified date a job description had also been prepared for the new post which set out the requirements for the holder of the post as follows : \u201c university degree in sports , university degree in economics , as an exception \u2013 secondary education with specialisation in the relevant sport , qualified lifeguard , certified swimming instructor . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant argued before ORG that the changes to the ORG 's roster of posts should have taken place in accordance with standard practices and should not have been arbitrary . She claimed that the standard practice was to make changes to the roster of posts before the beginning of DATE . The applicant also claimed that the changes were arbitrary because there had not been any objective necessity , stemming from the work being performed , to change the requirements for the post .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE at which the respondent party presented the new job description for the post of \u201c sports complex organiser \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE several witnesses gave evidence . ORG testified that the standard practice was to make changes to the roster of posts before DATE unless an urgent need , usually of a financial nature , required otherwise . He confirmed that he had met with the applicant in DATE in connection with the findings of ORG and that he had invited her to resign in view of the mounting discontent and public opinion . He stated that he had not enquired as to the activities of ORG at the ORG and that he was not familiar with the applicant 's work performance .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also testified and informed the court that the new principal had threatened her with dismissal if she talked about her work at the School . She testified as to the meeting of DATE with ORG and stated that , faced with the claim of being a follower of Word of Life , she had denied it . She stated that she had broken down and cried during the meeting because she had CARDINAL children to support and did not want to be left without a job . PERSON also informed the court that , as far as she was aware , the applicant had been a good and diligent employee , who had maintained good relations with the other members of staff .", "CARDINAL . A teacher from the ORG also testified at the hearing . He informed the court that since its construction in DATE the swimming pool had always had a manager , but that there had never been a requirement of a university degree in sports for the post . The teacher also testified as to the content of the radio broadcast of DATE , in which the applicant had been singled out for dismissal by the MP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed her written submissions with ORG , contending that the evidence in the case supported her claim . She maintained that the ORG 's roster of posts had been changed in the middle of DATE with the sole aim of introducing such requirements for her post as to allow her dismissal on those grounds .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claims . In its judgment the court noted that the burden of proof as to whether the dismissal had been lawful or not lay with the School . It found , inter alia , that the School had complied with the procedure for changing the roster of posts and that the new job description for the post was in conformity with the standard job descriptions for such posts as approved by ORG . In addition , the court found that with the changes to the requirements for the post the ORG had envisaged the possibility that the person appointed to the job would not only manage and organise the activities of the swimming pool but could also act as a lifeguard or swimming instructor , a factor which the court deemed to be of \u201c vital importance \u201d . Based on these considerations , the court found that \u201c there really had been preconditions [ which entailed ] changing the requirements for the post \u201d and that the dismissal was therefore lawful . Separately , ORG found that the applicant 's claims that her dismissal had been motivated by her religious beliefs were not supported by the evidence in the case , that in fact the applicant had had very good relations with the other members of staff and that there were no complaints as to her work performance . The court also reasoned that the applicant 's assertions in this respect were refuted by the fact that PERSON was still employed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment of ORG . She claimed , inter alia , that its findings were not based on the evidence established in the case and were therefore unfounded . She claimed that ORG had failed to make a proper assessment of key evidence , such as the testimonies of ORG and PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant also questioned the grounds of the first - instance court for dismissing her claim and contended that they were frivolous and at odds with the substance of her complaint alleging religious discrimination . Firstly , she had never claimed that her personal relations with her colleagues had suffered as a result of her religious beliefs . Secondly , she submitted that the first - instance court 's reasoning that there had been no discrimination against her , considering that PERSON was still employed by the ORG , was incorrect as there were various possible reasons for PERSON continued employment , such as the fact that the media had not singled her out for dismissal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed that ORG had never analysed in substance her complaint alleging religious discrimination , but had dealt with the matter purely as an issue of unfair dismissal .", "CARDINAL . Finally , she maintained that the facts of the case clearly showed that following her refusal to resign on DATE the ORG had simply tried to find a legal ground for dismissing her and that the chosen method was to change the requirements for the post she occupied so that she would become ineligible to hold it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the former principal of the ORG filed submissions with ORG , attesting to a conversation she had had in DATE with ORG . At the meeting he had identified CARDINAL employees in respect of whom there had been \u201c information that they were members of a sect \u201d and whose employment he had insisted be terminated . At the time , the former principal had suggested that those employees resign of their own accord , but they had refused and no further action had been taken against them . It is unclear whether the applicant was CARDINAL of those employees .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court found , inter alia , that the ORG had both a need and the right to change the roster of posts and the requirements for the applicant 's post and to dismiss her because she did not meet those requirements . It also found that ORG had adequately addressed the applicant 's allegations of religious discrimination and found them to be \u201c totally and irrefutably ... irrelevant \u201d based on the fact that she had maintained good relations with her colleagues and had been a good employee . Any allegations of subjective reasons or discriminatory grounds for her dismissal were therefore considered unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a petition for review ( cassation appeal ) , claiming , inter alia , that the lower courts had failed to properly evaluate the evidence before them and had never addressed the substance of her complaint alleging religious discrimination . She maintained that they had failed to assess the circumstances surrounding her dismissal and especially the events leading up to it , which clearly demonstrated the real reason why this legal method had been used to terminate her employment .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was conducted on DATE , which the applicant and her counsel , though duly summoned , did not attend . They presented their submissions to the court in writing .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court found , inter alia , that the applicant 's arguments were unsubstantiated , and upheld the findings of the lower courts . It stressed that the ORG had the right to change the requirements for the post and that such changes were not subject to judicial review . In addition , it compared the duties and responsibilities of the posts of \u201c swimming pool manager \u201d and \u201c sports complex organiser \u201d and found them to be essentially the same . ORG also noted that the old job description had lacked any education or professional qualification requirements for the post , while the new one had included such requirements . It reasoned , therefore , that the employer had simply filled a gap that had previously existed in that respect .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court refused to address the remainder of the arguments of the applicant as it found them to be irrelevant to the proceedings and to the issue of the dismissal .", "CARDINAL .

LAW ( Article CARDINAL ) , LAW of DATE ( section CARDINAL ) and LAW ( LAW ) provide for protection against discrimination grounded on , inter alia , religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . An amendment of LAW of DATE widened the scope of protection against discrimination in the workplace to include \u201c indirect discrimination \u201d , which was defined in item CARDINAL of \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW as follows :", "\u201c ' Indirect ' [ refers to ] the discrimination whereby ostensibly legal solutions are used in exercising labour rights and duties , but they are applied , in the light of the criteria under LAW [ of LAW ] , in a manner which in reality and in fact places some workers and employees in [ a ] less favourable or privileged position compared to others . Discrimination [ does not exist where ] the differences or the preferences [ are ] based on the qualification requirements for performing a specific job , or where special protection is given to certain [ types of ] workers and employees ( juveniles , pregnant women and mothers of young children , disabled people , those with reduced working capacity and other similar groups ) , as established by normative acts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above definition was repealed on DATE with the entry into force of ORG , which provides a comprehensive framework for protection against discrimination . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW introduced the following new definition of \u201c indirect discrimination \u201d :", "\u201c Indirect discrimination is placing a person on the basis of the criteria in LAW sex , race , nationality , ethnicity ... , religion and belief ... ] in a less favourable position in comparison to other persons by way of an ostensibly neutral provision , criterion or practice , unless the said provision , criterion or practice is objectively justified in view of a statutory aim and the means of attaining the said aim are appropriate and necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An employer may terminate a contract of employment by giving notice in writing to an employee where he or she does not have the necessary education or vocational training for performing the work assigned ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In reviewing such terminations the domestic courts have as their established practice that for a dismissal to be lawful ( under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) it is sufficient for the courts to establish that there were new requirements in terms of education or vocational training for performing the assigned work which the employee no longer met , without their being required to assess the necessity for introducing such requirements ( see , for example , \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ORG DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. , ORG \u0433. \u043e. ) .", "CARDINAL .
