The judges who found that LAW ( CARDINAL ) was not unconstitutional and did not contravene the LAW considered that the LAW authorised ORG to exclude the right to seek judicial review of certain categories of administrative decision provided that a constitutionally guaranteed legitimate aim overrode the interests of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms . National security was such a legitimate aim . Its protection had priority over the protection of individual rights and freedoms . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW took account of the fact that confidential information was at stake in deportation decisions based on national security . The wishes of a foreigner who had imperilled the security or the interests of ORG could not prevail over national security considerations .

The judges who held that LAW ( CARDINAL ) was unconstitutional considered that the principle of proportionality inherent in the LAW required that limitations on constitutional rights could not go beyond what was strictly necessary for the achievement of the legitimate aim pursued and that regard should be had to the fundamental importance of the right to judicial remedies enshrined in LAW . Depriving aliens of any possibility of obtaining judicial review of a deportation decision was disproportionate . The interests of national security were sufficiently protected as the administration could order immediate execution of a deportation order notwithstanding a pending application for judicial review . Furthermore , it was not true that an administrative appeal was possible .", "CARDINAL . This second group of judges also considered that the impugned provision was incompatible with the Convention as interpreted in the case - law of ORG .", "The unavailability of judicial review could lead to violations of LAW if an alien was deported to a country where he or she risked inhuman treatment .", "The judges further stated , inter alia :", "\u201c LAW allows the confinement [ of an alien pending deportation ] at the discretion of ORG , without limitation in time ... Neither that LAW nor any other law provides for any possibility of review ... [ However , ] the LAW , in its LAW , requires a remedy ...", "Deportation ... may constitute an interference with family life [ under LAW ] . Therefore , an assessment must be made as to whether such a measure is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security ...", "National security is one of the values of a NORP society , as much as fundamental rights and freedoms are . A domestic legal provision would be contrary to the Convention if there were no guarantees against administrative abuse and arbitrariness . These guarantees must be provided for by law . The balance between fundamental rights and the public interest must be assessed in every case by a court or another body independent from the executive . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
