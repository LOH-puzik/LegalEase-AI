The first applicant lives in GPE and the second applicant , who is the father of the first applicant , lives in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by Ms N. Mole of FAC , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant married a NORP national ( \u201c the mother \u201d ) in DATE . In DATE the first applicant ( their only child ) was born . The second applicant separated from the mother in DATE and their divorce was finalised in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the separation , the second applicant and the mother established a fully - shared care arrangement . The first applicant spent equal amounts of time ( DATE per week ) with each parent and major events were celebrated jointly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother applied to a ORG for permission to relocate to GPE with the first applicant . The second applicant opposed the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) to prepare a report on the question of relocation . The ORG officer filed her report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report indicated that the motivation for the mother \u2019s return to GPE was disputed . The second applicant believed that the principal motivation for the mother \u2019s return to GPE was her desire to pursue a new relationship . He was concerned about the emotional harm that separation would cause to the first applicant . He also expressed concerns that the mother \u2019s plans appeared to be somewhat vague . The mother accepted that she had a new boyfriend ( \u201c X \u201d ) in GPE with whom she hoped to develop a relationship on her return . However , she claimed that she had no support network in GPE and no employment prospects . As a consequence , she was unable to fund an acceptable lifestyle for herself and the first applicant . She believed that in GPE she would have the support of her family and friends , who could also assist her in finding work .", "CARDINAL . The ORG officer noted that the first applicant would likely experience feelings of loss and bereavement were he to relocate to GPE and she suspected that he would regress severely , with the added danger of behavioural problems at home and at school . However , she believed that the good foundation he had gained from his parents should offer a reasonably good prognosis for recovery and the ability to adapt . She concluded :", "\u201c Mrs [ T ] has set out her plans for herself and [ J ] in GPE . These are attuned to [ J \u2019s ] needs and appear reasonable . In my opinion , there are areas of uncertainty , i.e. settled living arrangements , her ability to earn and provide an appropriate lifestyle , especially within a privatised system , and child care arrangements ( apart from nursery ) . Mr [ T ] asserts that PERSON [ T ] is deeply committed to her relationship with [ X ] that her need to be with him will override her consideration of [ J \u2019s ] needs . If this is true , this raises considerable concern . Mr [ T ] does not accept that PERSON [ T ] is unable to fund herself or obtain a good home should she remain in the GPE He regards her as a resourceful and talented individual . He states that she has the ability to have frequent access to her friends and family in GPE .", "Recommendation", "In my opinion , [ J ] should not be removed from the jurisdiction unless there is a cogent reason for such a removal . The viability of such a move will have to be established by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant legal test with regard to international relocation was set out in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] DATE , in which ORG noted that such cases had consistently been decided upon the application of CARDINAL propositions : that the welfare of the child was of paramount consideration and that refusing the primary carer \u2019s reasonable proposals for relocation was likely to impact detrimentally on the welfare of her dependent children . Prior to reaching a conclusion , the court had to ask whether the mother \u2019s application was genuine and realistic . If it was , the court had to ask whether the father \u2019s proposal was motivated by a genuine concern for the child \u2019s well - being or by some ulterior motive . Finally , the court had to consider the impact on the mother of refusal before conducting an overriding review of the child \u2019s welfare . The test in ORG has been widely applied since DATE of the judgment . However , in the case of Re Y ( Leave to Remove from Jurisdiction ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL FLR CARDINAL a High Court Judge held that a case in which there was an equal shared care arrangement fell outside the ambit of ORG . He decided the case solely on the welfare checklist contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act and this decision was affirmed by ORG in GPE v. ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a District Judge granted the mother permission to relocate with the first applicant to GPE . The judge noted that in the present case there was no clear - cut primary carer . However , she observed that both parents had new partners and that the relationship between them had been becoming more strained . She further observed that while each parent had equal custody , the second applicant had largely left it to the mother to make important decisions , for example concerning the choice of nursery school for the first applicant . Consequently , the judge found it probable that the terms of the shared care arrangement would change in future even if the first applicant and the mother were to remain in GPE . The judge therefore distinguished the case of Re Y and gave weight to the factors in GPE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the questions posed in ORG , the judge considered that both parents were motivated by genuine rather than improper concerns . Although the judge noted that the mother \u2019s plans were \u201c fluid \u201d and that there was an absence of any definite plans , she considered her application to have been researched and investigated . The judge accepted that relocation would have a huge impact on the second applicant , but stated that it was clear that the mother would be devastated if her application were to be refused , and that her distress would impact negatively on the first applicant . The judge also accepted that her distress would make it hard for her to obtain employment and improve her life .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the judge considered the first applicant \u2019s welfare as directed by the welfare checklist . Although she noted that the case was very finely balanced , she concluded that the balance of the first applicant \u2019s interests lay with relocation . In reaching this conclusion , she noted that she had considered the LAW interference with the second applicant \u2019s rights but considered it justified and proportionate .", "CARDINAL . With regard to contact , the judge ordered that the first applicant was to be brought to GPE at least twice per year and the mother was to make the first applicant available for contact up to a maximum of CARDINAL periods per year in GPE . Contact was to include DATE staying contact in DATE and CARDINAL nursery or school holidays either in GPE or elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the second applicant advised him that any appeal against this decision would have slim prospects of success . Nevertheless , the second applicant appealed to ORG of ORG . ORG could only overturn the findings of GPE if it considered them to be \u201c plainly wrong \u201d or if the judge had approached the matter in a plainly incorrect way . As ORG did not consider the findings of LOC to fall into either of these categories , it dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal in a decision dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The mother and the first applicant moved to GPE in DATE . The second applicant submits that they currently live in a CARDINAL - room bedsit with no internet connection . As a consequence , the second applicant can only communicate with the first applicant through ORG when he visits his grandparents . The first applicant is attending a day care centre DATE a week and the mother remains unemployed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the mother brought the first applicant to GPE , where he spent DATE with the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The principle statutory provision in cases concerning the care of children is LAW CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . LAW sets out the welfare checklist . The welfare checklist provides that when a court determines any question with respect to the upbringing of a child , the child \u2019s welfare shall be its paramount consideration . In particular , the court shall have regard to the following factors :", "\u201c ( a ) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned ( considered in the light of his age and understanding ) ;", "( b ) his physical , emotional and educational needs ;", "( c ) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances ;", "( d ) his age , sex , background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant ;", "( e ) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering ;", "( f ) how capable each of his parents , and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant , is of meeting his needs ;", "( g ) the range of powers available to the court under LAW in the proceedings in question . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act concerns the removal of a child from the jurisdiction . It provides that where a residence order is in force with respect to a child , no person may remove him from GPE without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the Court .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the question of relocation , the foundation of the current case - law is the case of NORP v. Poel [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL . In that case ORG stated that :", "\u201c When a marriage breaks up , then a situation normally arises when the child of that marriage , instead of being in the joint custody of both parents , must of necessity become one who is in the custody of a single parent . Once that position has arisen and the custody is working well , this court should not lightly interfere with such reasonable way of life as is selected by that parent to whom custody has been rightly given . Any such interference may , as ORG has pointed out , produce considerable strains which would be unfair not only to the parent whose way of life is interfered with but also to any new marriage of that parent . In that way it might well in due course reflect on the welfare of the child . The way in which the parent who properly has custody of a child may choose in a reasonable manner to order his or her way of life is CARDINAL of those things which the parent who has not been given custody may well have to bear , even though one has every sympathy with the latter on some of the results . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the adoption of the DATE LAW approach in NORP was reiterated in ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] DATE . Lord Justice PERSON stated that :", "\u201c In summary a review of the decisions of this court over the course of DATE demonstrates that relocation cases have been consistently decided upon the application of the following CARDINAL propositions : ( a ) the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration ; and ( b ) refusing the primary carer \u2019s reasonable proposals for the relocation of her family life is likely to impact detrimentally on the welfare of her dependent children . Therefore her application to relocate will be granted unless the court concludes that it is incompatible with the welfare of the children . \u201d", "... ... ...", "However there is a danger that if the regard which the court pays to the reasonable proposals of the primary carer were elevated into a legal presumption then there would be an obvious risk of the breach of the respondent \u2019s rights not only under LAW but also his rights under LAW to a fair trial . To guard against the risk of too perfunctory an investigation resulting from too ready an assumption that the mother \u2019s proposals are necessarily compatible with the child \u2019s welfare I would suggest the following discipline as a prelude to conclusion :", "( a ) Pose the question : is the mother \u2019s application genuine in the sense that it is not motivated by some selfish desire to exclude the father from the child \u2019s life ? Then ask is the mother \u2019s application realistic , by which I mean founded on practical proposals both well researched and investigated ? If the application fails either of these tests refusal will inevitably follow .", "( b ) If however the application passes these tests then there must be a careful appraisal of the father \u2019s opposition : is it motivated by a genuine concern for the future of the child \u2019s welfare or is it driven by some ulterior motive ? What would be the extent of the detriment to him and his future relationship with the child were the application granted ? To what extent would that be offset by extension of the child \u2019s relationship with the maternal family and homeland ?", "( c ) What would be the impact on the mother , either as the single parent or as a new wife , of a refusal of her realistic proposal ?", "( d ) The outcome of the second and third appraisals must then be brought into an overriding review of the child \u2019s welfare as the paramount consideration , directed by the statutory checklist insofar as appropriate .", "In suggesting such a discipline I would not wish to be thought to have diminished the importance that this court has consistently attached to the emotional and psychological well - being of the primary carer . In any evaluation of the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration great weight must be given to this factor . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Later on in the judgment the President summed up the position as follows :", "\u201c In summary I would suggest that the following considerations should be in the forefront of the mind of a judge trying one of these difficult cases . They are not and could not be exclusive of the other important matters which arise in the individual case to be decided . All the relevant factors need to be considered , including the points I make below , so far as they are relevant , and weighed in the balance . The points I make are obvious but in view of the arguments presented to us in this case , it may be worthwhile to repeat them .", "( a ) The welfare of the child is always paramount .", "( b ) There is no presumption created by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE in favour of the applicant parent .", "( c ) The reasonable proposals of the parent with a residence order wishing to live abroad carry great weight .", "( d ) Consequently the proposals have to be scrutinised with care and the court needs to be satisfied that there is a genuine motivation for the move and not the intention to bring contact between the child and the other parent to an end .", "( e ) The effect upon the applicant parent and the new family of the child of a refusal of leave is very important .", "( f ) The effect upon the child of the denial of contact with the other parent and in some cases his family is very important .", "( g ) The opportunity for continuing contact between the child and the parent left behind may be significant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The test in ORG has been widely applied since DATE of the judgment . However , in the case of Re Y ( Leave to Remove from Jurisdiction ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL FLR CARDINAL a High Court Judge held that the facts of a case in which there was an equal shared care arrangement fell outside the ambit of well - settled authorities . He therefore decided the case solely on the welfare checklist contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act . This decision was affirmed by ORG in GPE v. ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , in which Lord Justice PERSON categorically stated that PERSON was based on the premise that the applicant was the primary carer and that it in no way set out the approach the court should take where there was no primary carer . In such cases the court stated that the judge should exercise his discretion to grant or refuse by applying the welfare checklist contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act . Nevertheless , Lord Justice PERSON considered the test in ORG to be of continuing relevance in relocation cases . However , Lady Justice Black and Lord Justice PERSON appeared to suggest that the test in ORG was \u201c guidance \u201d rather than principles of law from which no departure was permitted . They further suggested that the welfare of the child should overbear all other considerations , however powerful or reasonable they might be .", "CARDINAL . The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the PERSON provides as follows :", "CARDINAL .
