In DATE , as part of a large - scale investigation into taxicab operators , ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE carried out a tax audit of the applicant 's taxi firm . Having discovered in the course of the audit certain irregularities in the tax returns for DATE , ORG drafted an audit report on DATE containing a supplementary tax assessment and invited the applicant to submit comments . The applicant challenged the report and requested that further investigative measures be carried out .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the findings of the audit and the applicant 's observations , ORG \u2013 by decisions of CARDINAL and DATE increased the applicant 's liability to income tax by MONEY ( SEK ) , to value - added tax ( merv\u00e4rdesskatt ) by QUANTITY and to employer 's contributions ( arbetsgivaravgifter ) by SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Moreover , as the information supplied by the applicant in his tax returns was found to be incorrect and the figure given for the turnover of the business had been revised upwards under a discretionary assessment procedure , ORG ordered him to pay tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg , avgiftstill\u00e4gg ) amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability , depending on the type of tax involved . The additional taxes levied on the applicant , including interest and surcharges , totalled CARDINAL , of which SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL were surcharges . The amounts relating to value - added tax and employer 's contributions were payable on DATE and those relating to income tax on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Claiming that the information relied upon by ORG to calculate the turnover of his business was inaccurate , the applicant , by a letter of DATE , requested the ORG to reconsider its decisions . As he risked being declared bankrupt before his tax liability had been determined by the courts , he also requested a stay of execution in respect of the amounts assessed . The request was prompted by the fact that neither an appeal to a court nor a request for reconsideration by ORG had in itself any suspensive effect on the obligation to pay the taxes and surcharges due as a result of the impugned decisions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In letters of DATE to the applicant 's counsel ORG responded to the applicant 's request for a stay of execution as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG considers that the prerequisites laid down in DATE , subsection CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) , of LAW [ Uppb\u00f6rdslagen , DATE ] for granting a stay of execution have been fulfilled .", "According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , ORG may , in certain cases , require that security be provided for any amount in respect of which a stay of execution is sought .", "Having regard to the information contained in [ the applicant 's ] tax return and considering the other circumstances in the case , ORG finds that [ the applicant 's ] ability to pay is open to serious doubt .", "ORG is of the opinion that [ the applicant ] has to provide security for the amount ... in respect of which he has requested a stay of execution .

The applicant appealed against those decisions to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that he should be exempted from the obligation to provide security and granted a stay of execution . Both claims rested on the contention that it would be unreasonable and amount to a violation of LAW for enforcement proceedings to be instituted against the applicant without a court having first determined whether he had any liability to pay the amounts involved .", "CARDINAL . By judgments of DATE ORG upheld ORG decisions of CARDINAL DATE . The court noted at the outset that the formal prerequisites for granting a stay of execution under section DATE , subsection CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of LAW had been fulfilled .

That amount included SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , plus PERCENT in penalties for late payment , in tax surcharges . The ORG noted that an investigation had revealed that the only property owned by the applicant was some vehicles , but of insufficient value to cover the debt .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to appear before ORG on DATE . The court commenced its examination of the case but , at the insistence of the applicant \u2013 who referred to the fact that his request for a stay of execution was still pending before ORG \u2013 adjourned the bankruptcy proceedings until DATE , when it held a second hearing in the case . When heard by the court the applicant now stated that he was unable to comply with ORG condition for granting a stay of execution , namely providing security . By a decision of DATE , after rejecting the applicant 's request for a further adjournment , ORG declared the applicant bankrupt . In so doing it had regard to the fact that , under LAW , the applicant was under an obligation to pay the debt , was unable to provide the security required in order to obtain a stay of execution and had to be considered insolvent as he had been found to have no distrainable assets .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) , claiming , inter alia , that ORG decision amounted to a violation of LAW , in that the enforcement proceedings had been allowed to continue irrespective of the fact that he had challenged ORG decisions regarding his liability to taxes and tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL .

The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , on DATE the applicant requested ORG to reconsider its decisions on taxes and tax surcharges . In a letter of DATE , the applicant referred to ORG order DATE temporarily adjourning the bankruptcy proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and stressed the need for a speedy reconsideration by ORG . On DATE the ORG \u2013 noting that the applicant had appealed against the decisions on taxes and tax surcharges \u2013 stood by its previous decisions and refused to change them . Consequently , the matters were automatically referred to ORG for determination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested an oral hearing at which it was proposed that certain witnesses would give evidence . Later , asked by ORG to clarify his request , the applicant stated that an oral hearing was not required on the issue of the assessment of the tax surcharges , but was necessary so that the court could hear evidence relating to the information on which the tax decisions were based . By a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that it did not find a hearing necessary and ordered him to make his final observations in the case in writing .", "CARDINAL . By judgments of DATE ORG upheld ORG decisions of CARDINAL and DATE and rejected the applicant 's request for an oral hearing , considering that the information on which the impugned decisions were based was reliable and showed that the applicant 's income and the taxes in question could not be assessed in accordance with the statements made in his tax returns . Thus , ORG had had good reason to make discretionary tax assessments based on the information obtained during the audit . Furthermore , the amounts levied on the applicant could not be considered too high . With respect to the tax surcharges , ORG made extensive references to the judgments of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and concluded that the NORP provisions on tax surcharges were in conformity with the Convention . It considered that there had been sufficient reasons to impose the surcharges in question and that no legal basis for remitting them had been shown . In that connection , it dismissed the applicant 's argument that the allegedly excessive length of the proceedings constituted by itself a reason to remit the surcharges .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has appealed to ORG , where the dispute is at present pending .", "CARDINAL . The rules on taxes and tax surcharges relevant to the present case were primarily laid down in LAW ( Taxeringslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , the CARDINAL ORG ( NORP om merv\u00e4rdeskatt , ORG , replaced by PERSON , CARDINAL ) and ORG from Employers Act ( NORP om uppb\u00f6rd av socialavgifter PERSON arbetsgivare , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . Issues concerning taxation and the imposition of tax surcharges were regulated in a very similar manner in the various acts . In the following section , therefore , reference is made only to the provisions of LAW . LAW and parts of ORG DATE were replaced by LAW ( Skattebetalningslagen , DATE ) as from DATE . As no essential changes have been made by either the enactment of LAW or amendments to LAW , the following account describes both the present system and the one applicable at the material time .", "CARDINAL . Income tax , value - added tax and employer 's contributions are all determined by county tax authorities , to which taxpayers are obliged to submit information relevant to the assessment of taxes . For the purpose of securing timely , sufficient and correct information , there are provisions stipulating that , under certain circumstances , the tax authorities may impose penalties on the taxpayer in the form of tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL . These surcharges were introduced into NORP legislation in DATE . The new provisions entered into force on DATE at the same time as a new Act on tax offences . According to the preparatory documents ( Government Bill CARDINAL ) , the main purpose of the reform was to create a more effective and fairer system of penalties than the old CARDINAL , which was based entirely on criminal penalties determined by the ordinary courts following police investigation and prosecution . Unlike penalties for tax offences , the new surcharges were to be determined solely on objective grounds , and , accordingly , without regard to any form of criminal intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer . It was thought that the old system did not function satisfactorily , since a large number of tax returns contained incorrect information whereas relatively few people were charged with tax offences . Now that the new system has been introduced only serious tax offences are prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . A tax surcharge is imposed on a taxpayer in CARDINAL situations : if he or she , in a tax return or in any other written statement , has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) or if , following a discretionary assessment , the tax authority decides not to rely on the tax return ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge ; concealment , in whole or in part , of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information . However , incorrect claims are not penalised ; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof , no surcharge is imposed . The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority . A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that the tax authority can not base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite having been reminded of the obligation to do so ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . In the latter case the decision to impose a tax surcharge will be revoked if the taxpayer files a tax return within a certain time - limit . The surcharge amounts to PERCENT of either the income tax which the tax authority would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information or the income tax levied under the discretionary assessment . The corresponding provisions on value - added tax and employer 's contributions stipulate that the surcharge comes to PERCENT of the supplementary tax levied on the taxpayer . In certain circumstances , the rates applied are PERCENT or PERCENT , respectively , for the various types of tax .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer has furnished incorrect information , no tax surcharge will be imposed in certain situations , for example where the tax authority has corrected obvious miscalculations or written errors by the taxpayer , where the information has been corrected or could have been corrected with the aid of certain documents that should have been available to the tax authorities , such as a certificate of income from the employer , or where the taxpayer has corrected the information voluntarily ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , in certain circumstances , a tax surcharge will be remitted . Thus , taxpayers will not have to pay a surcharge if their failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is considered excusable owing to their age , illness , lack of experience or comparable circumstances . The surcharge should also be remitted where the failure appears excusable by reason of the nature of the information in question or other special circumstances , or where it would be manifestly unreasonable to impose a surcharge ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The phrase \u201c the nature of the information \u201d primarily covers situations where a taxpayer has had to assess an objectively complicated tax question . According to the preparatory documents ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the expression \u201c manifestly unreasonable \u201d refers to situations in which the imposition of a tax surcharge would be disproportionate to the fault attributable to the taxpayer or would be unacceptable for other reasons . If the facts of the case so require , the tax authorities must have regard to the provisions on remission , even in the absence of a specific claim to that effect by the taxpayer ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . In principle , however , it is up to the taxpayer to show due cause for the remission of a surcharge .", "CARDINAL . If dissatisfied with a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges , the taxpayer may , before DATE after DATE , request the tax authority to reconsider its decision ( LAW , sections DATE ) . A decision concerning surcharges may also be reviewed at the taxpayer 's request after the expiry of this time - limit , if the decision on the underlying tax issue has not yet become final ( LAW , LAW ) . The tax authority may also , on its own motion , decide to review its own earlier decision . A review to the taxpayer 's disadvantage must be made before DATE following the assessment year unless the taxpayer , inter alia , has submitted incorrect information during the course of the tax proceedings or has failed to file a tax return or to furnish required information , in which case the time - limit normally expires at DATE after DATE ( LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The tax authority 's decision may also be appealed against to a county administrative court . As with requests for reconsideration , an appeal has to be lodged before DATE after DATE ( LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , unless it concerns a tax surcharge based on a tax decision that has not yet become final ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . Following the appeal , the tax authority must reconsider its decision as soon as possible and , if it decides to vary the decision in accordance with the taxpayer 's request , the appeal will become void ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . If the decision is not thus amended , the appeal is referred to the county administrative court . If special reasons exist , an appeal may be forwarded by the tax authority to the county administrative court without reconsidering the assessment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . Further appeals lie to an administrative court of appeal and , subject to compliance with the conditions for obtaining leave to appeal , ORG .", "CARDINAL . A tax surcharge is connected to the tax in respect of which it has been imposed in that a successful objection to the underlying tax has an automatic effect on the tax surcharge , which is reduced correspondingly ( LAW , LAW ) . The tax surcharge may , however , be challenged separately , if grounds for reduction or remission exist ( see above ) .", "CARDINAL . If the proceedings before a county administrative court or an administrative court of appeal concern a tax surcharge , the appellant has the right to an oral hearing ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the collection of taxes and tax surcharges was regulated by LAW , ORG DATE and ORG from Employers Act . The provisions of these Acts relevant to the present case were very similar and , for this reason , only the provisions of LAW are set out below . Since DATE tax collection has been regulated by LAW , which contains essentially the same rules as LAW .", "CARDINAL . A request for reconsideration or an appeal against a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges has no suspensive effect on the taxpayer 's obligation to pay the amounts in question ( section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . However , the tax authority may grant a stay of execution in respect of taxes and surcharges provided that CARDINAL of the following CARDINAL conditions is met : ( CARDINAL ) if it may be assumed that the amount imposed on the taxpayer will be reduced or remitted ; ( CARDINAL ) if the outcome of the case is uncertain ; or ( CARDINAL ) if payment of the amount in question would result in considerable damage for the taxpayer or would otherwise appear unjust ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . According to the preparatory documents , the second condition will be satisfied not only where an outcome favourable to the taxpayer is just as likely as an unfavourable one , but also in cases where it is more probable than not that the proceedings will result in the taxpayer 's claims being rejected . However , a stay will not to be granted if the request for reconsideration or the appeal has little prospect of success ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . An example of a situation where \u201c considerable damage \u201d might result is the forced sale of the taxpayer 's real estate or business or other property of great importance to his financial situation and livelihood ( ibid . , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If , in cases where the second or third condition just referred to is applicable , it may be assumed DATE due to the taxpayer 's situation or other circumstances DATE that the amount for which a stay of execution is requested will not be duly paid , the request can not be granted unless the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee or other security for the amount due . Even in these cases , however , a stay may be granted without security if the relevant amount is relatively insignificant or if there are other special reasons ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The application of section DATE of LAW was examined by ORG in a judgment of DATE ( Case no . DATE , published in PERSON ( R\u00c5 ) DATE ref . CARDINAL ) . In that case , ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG had found that the applicant company DATE which had appealed against ORG decision to impose on it certain energy taxes and interest in the total amount of MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL \u2013 could not be granted a stay of execution . ORG noted , however , that there was some uncertainty as regards the main issue in the case \u2013 whether the income in question was at all taxable \u2013 and that the tax levied constituted a considerable sum . For these reasons , it found that it would be unreasonable to demand payment of the amount before a court had determined the applicant company 's tax liability . Noting that security in principle had to be provided by the company , ORG nevertheless took account of the fact that ORG was expected to determine the tax - liability issue within a short time and that special reasons therefore existed for not requiring security . Accordingly , the applicant company was granted a stay of execution without security until DATE after ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . A taxpayer may request the tax authority to reconsider its decision concerning the stay - of - execution issue and may appeal against its decision to a county administrative court . The procedure is essentially identical to that followed in regard to requests for reconsideration and appeals concerning the main tax issues ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 see paragraphs DATE above ) . Further appeals to an administrative court of appeal and ORG are subject to leave to appeal being granted ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement offices are under an obligation to levy execution on a debtor upon request , even if the tax authority 's decision concerning tax and tax surcharges is not final ( LAW , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( ORG ) taken in conjunction with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ; the latter provisions have been replaced by similar provisions in LAW ) . If the debtor does not have enough distrainable property , the enforcement office may request a district court to declare him or her bankrupt . The debtor will normally be considered insolvent if it is discovered during attempts to levy distress in DATE preceding the presentation of the bankruptcy petition that his or her assets are insufficient to pay the debt in full ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . If the bankrupt 's estate is not sufficient to defray all the existing and expected bankruptcy expenses and other liabilities that the bankrupt has incurred , the bankruptcy proceedings will be terminated ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If a bankruptcy petition is based on a tax debt determined by a decision that is not yet final , the court examining the petition is required to make an independent assessment of the alleged debt , having regard to the evidence adduced in the bankruptcy proceedings . The court accordingly has to make a prediction about the outcome of the pending tax assessment proceedings ( judgment of ORG of DATE , Case no . ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As taxes and tax surcharges are payable even if the tax authority 's decision is not final , the decision may be varied or quashed after the relevant amounts have been paid . If so , the amount overpaid is refunded with interest ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ) . If distress has been levied on the taxpayer 's property or he or she has been declared bankrupt on account of the tax debt , the distress warrant or bankruptcy decision will be set aside on appeal . Should the warrant or decision have become final , the taxpayer may , upon request , have the case reopened and the warrant or decision quashed ( LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) ) . Any property that has been distrained upon will , if possible , then be restored to the taxpayer ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . The same applies to property forming part of a bankrupt 's estate to the extent that it is not required for the payment of the bankruptcy expenses and other liabilities ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . If the taxpayer 's property has been sold and the amount obtained from the sale has been used to pay off the alleged tax debt , the taxpayer will receive financial compensation . In addition , it is open to the taxpayer to bring an action for damages against the ORG for the financial loss caused by the distress or the bankruptcy ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) , on the ground that the authorities or the courts have acted wrongfully or negligently .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings may be brought against a taxpayer who has furnished incorrect information to a tax authority or who , with the object of evading tax , has failed to file a tax return or similar document . If the taxpayer has acted with intent and his actions have resulted in his being charged too little tax , he will be convicted of tax fraud . The possible sentence ranges from a fine for petty offences to imprisonment for a maximum of DATE for cases of aggravated tax fraud ( sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW ( Skattebrottslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . If the taxpayer is considered to have been grossly negligent in submitting incorrect information , he may be convicted of making a negligent misrepresentation to the tax authorities ( v\u00e5rdsl\u00f6s skatteuppgift ) ( section CARDINAL ) . A criminal charge under LAW is brought in accordance with the rules governing criminal proceedings in general which means , inter alia , that there can only be a criminal conviction on prosecution and trial by the courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , the fact that a tax surcharge has already been imposed on the same grounds as those forming the basis of the criminal charge is no bar to criminal proceedings . Moreover , a decision to impose a surcharge has no binding force or any other effect that might prejudice the determination of the criminal charge . However , it was the intention of the legislature that the trial court would be aware when considering the criminal charge that a surcharge had been imposed ( Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG considered whether a person could be convicted for a tax offence in criminal proceedings following the imposition of a tax surcharge in tax proceedings ( Case no . B CARDINAL - CARDINAL , published in Nytt juridiskt arkiv CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Having noted that , under NORP law , a surcharge is not considered a criminal penalty and thus does not prevent trial and conviction for a tax offence relating to the same act , ORG went on to examine the matter under LAW . It first considered , in the light of ORG case - law , that there were weighty arguments for regarding LAW as being applicable under its criminal head to proceedings involving a tax surcharge . Even assuming this to be the case , it held , however , that the principle of non bis in idem , as set forth in LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , did not prevent criminal proceedings from being brought against someone for an act in respect of which a surcharge had already been levied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered CARDINAL judgments in which it examined the applicability of LAW to the tax surcharges imposed under the NORP tax system . In CARDINAL of the judgments ( Case no . DATE , R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) , noting the criteria established by ORG for determining whether an offence qualified as \u201c criminal \u201d , ORG gave an extensive opinion on the application of these criteria to the surcharges in question . It stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The NORP legislature has described the tax surcharge as an administrative sanction akin to a penalty ... The rules on oral hearings in LAW , section DATE , of LAW should be seen as a manifestation of the desire to bring taxation procedure into line with the legal safeguards laid down in LAW . Also , according to case - law ( R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) , the rules on voting in LAW of LAW [ in the criminal - procedure part of the LAW ] are applicable in cases concerning surcharges under LAW ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . The tax surcharge appears to have been considered a predominantly criminal sanction in other contexts as well . For example , it was stated in the preparatory documents to the legislation establishing the rule prohibiting ex post facto laws in LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG [ Regeringsformen ] \u2013 which covers penalties , other criminal sanctions and other special legal effects of a criminal offence \u2013 that the proposed rule also applied to administrative sanctions akin to penalties such as tax surcharges , charges for the late payment of taxes and late - payment fees under various tax laws . ... However , under NORP law , there is no requirement of intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer for the imposition of a tax surcharge . Also , the surcharge , to a certain extent , has the character of a conditional fine [ vitesfunktion ] and can be remitted on purely objective grounds . Moreover , it can not be converted into a prison sentence . Therefore , it has been considered that the surcharge is not to be classified as a penalty under the NORP legal system but rather as an administrative tax sanction . Accordingly , its classification as such under the NORP legal system does not constitute sufficient reason for regarding it as a criminal sanction within the meaning of the Convention .", "With respect to the other CARDINAL criteria applied by ORG in this connection \u2013 that is , the nature of the offence and the nature and degree of severity of the sanction \u2013 the following should be taken into account . The NORP rules on tax surcharges are general and concern all taxpayers . The purpose of the system of administrative sanctions is to exert pressure on taxpayers , by means of a considerable financial sanction , to observe the obligations prescribed by the laws on taxes and charges . It should also be noted that the NORP tax surcharge , in its present form , replaced earlier procedures of a purely criminal nature . As regards the characteristics that have been established by ORG as referring to the nature and degree of severity of the sanction , it should be borne in mind that a surcharge is levied in proportion to the tax avoided by the provision of incorrect information . This means that surcharges may in principle come to very large amounts without any upper limit .", "In ORG opinion , the last - mentioned aspect strongly indicates that Article CARDINAL is to be regarded as applicable to the NORP tax surcharge . In a recently delivered judgment , ORG also stated , in the light of ORG case - law , that ' there are weighty arguments for regarding LAW as being applicable also to NORP proceedings concerning tax surcharges ' [ ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . CARDINAL consideration that might still cause some doubt is that the NORP surcharge differs from the NORP one with regard to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL factors to which ORG attached importance in its final assessment in ORG v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ] : it can not be converted into a prison sentence . Furthermore , contrary to the NORP rules , the NORP rules on surcharges lack a subjective element in the real sense ...", "However , the fact that the NORP tax surcharge can not be converted into a prison sentence is not , in ORG opinion , a strong argument against finding Article CARDINAL to be applicable . There is no doubt that a fine imposed under criminal law falls under LAW , irrespective of whether or not it can be converted into a prison sentence . Moreover , the judgment in GPE must be taken to indicate that financial sanctions other than a fine may also fall under LAW , at least if they are of some significance . Furthermore , following ORG judgments in PERSON ... and PERSON [ Lauko and PERSON v. GPE , judgments of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VI , pp . PERSON and DATE , respectively ] , both of which concerned fines imposed in respect of minor offences , it must now be regarded as established that the imposition of a prison sentence is not a prerequisite for an act to be viewed as a criminal offence within the meaning of the ORG . Nor , in the circumstances , can an independent or even significant meaning be attached to the lack of subjective elements ( instead , there is reason to make a separate assessment as to the compatibility of strict liability with the presumption of innocence ... ) .", "In view of the foregoing ORG finds , having regard to all the circumstances , that the NORP tax surcharge is to be regarded as falling under LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to examine the compatibility of the tax surcharges with the presumption of innocence under LAW . It gave the following opinion :", "\u201c It is probable that , in determining whether strict criminal liability is compatible with the Convention , ORG will apply essentially the same test as it did in Salabiaku [ Salabiaku v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ] with respect to liability established on the basis of presumptions . This means that liability must not arise entirely automatically on proof of the objective elements . Instead , in order for there to be no conflict with the presumption of innocence , the individual must have the possibility of some form of defence based on subjective circumstances .", "As has been mentioned above , a tax surcharge is imposed by means of an administrative procedure without any requirement of intent or negligence . An appeal against a decision concerning a surcharge lies to an administrative court . If intent or gross negligence is established , liability under criminal law may be imputed following trial and conviction by a court of general jurisdiction .", "Taxation in GPE is largely based on information given by the individual and certification by him or her of information received from other sources . The purpose of the tax surcharge is to emphasise , inter alia , that the individual is required to be meticulous in fulfilling the duty of filing a tax return and the related obligation to submit information . In principle , carelessness is not acceptable . Furthermore , the taxpayer must normally have an understanding of what information is of relevance to the examination of a claim in order to avoid the risk of incorrect information being considered to have been given and a surcharge imposed . In other words , the taxpayer is required to have a certain knowledge of the tax rules .", "Inaccuracies and failures of the kind that may cause the imposition of a tax surcharge occur in a very large number of cases . The requirements of foreseeability and uniformity in the imposition of surcharges have therefore been regarded as calling for surcharges to be levied in accordance with relatively simple and standardised rules . However , the rules and regulations must also meet demands for a reasonably nuanced assessment ... and provide guarantees of legal certainty . Therefore , a surcharge is not imposed automatically when incorrect information is submitted . Firstly , certain types of inaccuracies are excluded and , secondly , authorities and courts must consider whether there are grounds for remitting the surcharge , even if no specific claim to that effect has been made .", "The following may be stated with particular reference to the grounds for remitting surcharges . The requirements of understanding and meticulousness must be proportionate to the taxpayer 's ability and capacity to comprehend the tax rules and apply them to the existing situation . The rules on remission are aimed at preventing the imposition of a tax surcharge as a result of , for example , excusable ignorance or a misunderstanding as to the content of a tax rule . They are also supposed to prevent a surcharge from being imposed where other excusable mistakes are made in discharging the duty to file a tax return . The rules on remission are , moreover , drafted in such a way as to allow the authorities and courts a certain latitude in assessing questions of remission , having regard to the subjective position of the taxpayer . Indeed , the grounds for remission \u2013 in conjunction with the rules providing , on objective grounds , for surcharges not to be imposed or to be set aside in particular circumstances \u2013 may in certain cases allow of considerations that lead to greater exemption from surcharges than would be the case if the imposition of surcharges were conditional on the taxpayer having acted intentionally or negligently . Although the grounds for remission are not entirely comparable to the conditions for accountability which the subjective elements represent in criminal law , they must , when taken together with the cases in which surcharges are excluded on purely objective grounds , be considered as affording the taxpayer , where appropriate , sufficient scope for avoiding the imposition of surcharges to prevent a conflict with the presumption of innocence as set out in LAW arising . In general , however , this requires that the courts , in applying the rules on surcharges , should indeed make a nuanced and not too restrictive assessment in each individual case as to whether there are grounds for setting aside or remitting the tax surcharge . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered that the NORP tax surcharge complied with the general requirement under LAW to be proportionate . It held that a system of sanctions against breaches of the obligation to submit tax returns and information to the tax authorities served an important public interest . Moreover , it noted , inter alia , that the requirement of proportionality was reflected in the rules on surcharges as , under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , surcharges were to be remitted in cases where they would be \u201c manifestly unreasonable \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the other judgment delivered on DATE ( Case no . DATE ) ORG was called upon to examine whether the enforcement of a tax surcharge prior to a court examination of a taxpayer 's liability to pay the surcharge in question conflicted with the presumption of innocence under LAW . It made the following assessment :", "\u201c The Article stipulates that the presumption of innocence shall be observed until guilt has been proved according to law . It does not follow from the wording of the LAW that a criminal sanction that has been imposed can not be enforced before the decision has become final . There are , furthermore , examples both in GPE and in other NORP countries of regular criminal sanctions being enforceable notwithstanding the fact that the decision has not become final ...", "Moreover , there is nothing in the case - law of ORG to support the view that LAW prevents the enforcement of decisions concerning criminal sanctions that have not become final . In this connection , it should be pointed out that ORG expressly accepted the immediate enforcement of tax surcharges in GPE v. GPE [ no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , unreported ] .", "The conclusion of ORG is that LAW does not prevent enforcement on the ground that a decision concerning tax surcharges has not become final .", "It remains to be determined whether the enforcement of an administrative authority 's decision on surcharges requires the matter to have been examined by a court .", "It follows from LAW that everyone charged with a criminal offence has a right to have his or her case determined by a court . However , the rules in LAW are not considered to preclude the examination by an administrative authority of issues falling under LAW , provided that the individual may subsequently bring the matter before a court that fully affords the legal safeguards laid down in the LAW ...", "In ORG opinion , it is unclear to what extent the presumption of innocence should be taken to require that a decision by an administrative authority concerning a criminal sanction against which an appeal has been made should not be enforced before a court has examined the appeal . It appears that the question has not been determined by ORG . However , it seems reasonable to assume that enforcement may not take place if it would make it impossible for the original legal position to be restored in the event that the subsequent judicial examination resulted in the authority 's decision being varied .", "As far as tax surcharges are concerned , a taxpayer may appeal to a court against an administrative authority 's decision to impose such a surcharge . If the taxpayer 's appeal is successful , any amount that has been paid will be refunded with interest . It is also possible for the taxpayer to request a stay of execution in connection with the appeal . It is unlikely that any enforcement measures will be taken pending the court 's examination of the application for a stay ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . Under the rules applicable in the instant case , a stay may be granted if it can be assumed that the amount imposed on the taxpayer will be reduced or that he will be relieved of the obligation to pay the amount , if the outcome of the case is uncertain or if payment of the amount imposed would result in considerable damage for the taxpayer or otherwise appears unjust . In certain cases , a stay can be granted only on condition that security is provided ( section DATE , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ; there are now largely corresponding rules in ... LAW ) .", "The rules on stays of execution provide the taxpayer with the opportunity to have a preliminary examination by a court of the final outcome of the case concerning tax surcharges . If the taxpayer refrains from using this option or if the court , following an examination , finds that it can not be assumed that the taxpayer 's appeal on the merits will be successful , or even that the outcome is uncertain and that , moreover , there is no reason to expect considerable damage to result from payment of the surcharge , it can not , in the view of ORG , be contradictory to LAW to require immediate enforcement . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
