NORP Until DATE the applicant worked as a coal miner for Gorubso \u2013 ORG ( a ORG enterprise , transformed into a ORG - owned company in DATE and later , apparently in DATE , privatised following the opening of winding - up proceedings ; currently a joint - stock company Gorubso Zlatograd DATE ) . In DATE the applicant brought proceedings against the mining company seeking payment of compensation for the occupational disease he had developed as a result of exposure to hazardous conditions in the mine .

NORP In DATE the applicant requested that the enforcement judge institute enforcement proceedings against the debtor . It appears that in DATE the enforcement judge attached the company \u2019s bank accounts . There is no information in the case file about the development of the enforcement proceedings between DATE and DATE . In particular , there is no evidence about requests made by the applicant for enforcement measures , claims lodged in the winding - up proceedings relating to the mining company \u2019s assets , or information sought by the applicant on the payment of the debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge discontinued the enforcement proceedings on the basis of LAW ( \u0434 ) of LAW , as the applicant had not requested enforcement actions for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his lawyer consulted the file of the enforcement proceedings . The applicant submits that only then did he find out that the proceedings had been discontinued in DATE , and that he was shown a document \u2013 the enforcement judge \u2019s register of DATE for the incoming and outgoing amounts DATE which indicated that in DATE the mining company had paid the applicant an amount of ORG CARDINAL by means of bank transfer .

By a letter of DATE , the enforcement judge informed the applicant that , as was clear from the information in the file , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( representing the initial compensation of BGL CARDINAL plus several DATE payments ) . In a letter of DATE , the bank which had effected the payment on CARDINAL DATE informed the applicant that the documents concerning the money transfer had already been destroyed as the DATE time - limit for keeping them had expired .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to the prosecution authorities requesting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the payment of DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the enforcement judge informed the investigation authorities that , as could be seen from the enforcement judge \u2019s register of DATE , on DATE the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . As to the payment orders of that date , the enforcement judge noted that they had been destroyed as the DATE time - limit for keeping payment documents under LAW had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings , noting that a long period of time had elapsed since the alleged offence had been committed , and that the time - limits for keeping the relevant documents at the respective institutions had already expired .

In the period DATE inflation in GPE was running high and the national currency was depreciating . As of the entry into force of a law on DATE , ORG CARDINAL became CARDINAL new NORP lev ( ORG ) . The applicant submitted that due to the enforcement judge \u2019s inactivity over DATE and the inflation and the devaluation of the national currency , the total amount of DATE payments he was entitled to receive for DATE to DATE had devalued to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately CARDINAL euros ( EUR ) ) . He claimed that the amount he was entitled to receive from DATE had devalued to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with LAW seq . of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) , in force at the material time , enforcement proceedings against ORG enterprises were to be directed firstly towards their bank accounts in ORG banks . When payment upon a writ of execution against the ORG enterprise could not be received because of lack of such bank accounts or of available funds in them , enforcement was to be carried out by an enforcement judge . Certain articles of property belonging to the ORG enterprises could not be subject to enforcement , other than in winding - up proceedings . These provisions were repealed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE Code provided that enforcement proceedings against private parties were to be instituted upon the request of the creditor . The creditors were under the obligation to state against which debtor \u2019s possessions ( bank accounts , immovable property , and so forth ) they would like the enforcement to be directed ( LAW ) . Throughout the proceedings the creditors could request the enforcement actions to be directed against different possessions of the debtor . If the creditors did not request enforcement actions to be undertaken for a period of DATE , the enforcement proceedings had to be terminated ( LAW ( \u0434 ) ) . The LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) , which came into force on DATE , contained similar provisions .", "CARDINAL .
