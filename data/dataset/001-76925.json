GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The CARDINAL applicants are Mr PERSON , a NORP and NORP national born in DATE , PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , and their children , PERSON , a NORP and NORP national born in DATE , and ORG , a NORP and NORP national born in DATE . They live in GPE ( GPE ) and were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON NORP PERSON , CARDINAL lawyers practising in GPE .", "The applicants belong to a NORP community which is strongly attached to the Bible and reject the attendance of private or ORG schools for religious reasons . The applicant parents find that school education does not suit their beliefs since sex education is taught , mythical creatures such as witches and dwarfs appear in fairy tales during school lessons , and physical and psychological violence among pupils at school is on the increase .", "They educate their children at home in accordance with the syllabus and materials of the \u201c ORG \u201d , an institution based in PERSON which is not recognised as a private school by the ORG . The institution specialises in assisting devout NORP parents in educating their children at home . The school \u2019s syllabus contains both books and materials which are used by ORG or private schools and materials specially prepared to support the education of religious beliefs . Teaching by parents is supervised by staff trained by ORG . The teaching is supplemented by occasional gatherings of parents , children and staff members .", "The applicant parents applied for their children to be exempted from compulsory primary school attendance and for permission to educate them at home . The third and fourth applicants reached the age for compulsory school attendance in DATE and DATE respectively . At present , they do not attend a private or ORG school .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the application pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of GPE ( PERSON ) . ORG ( ORG ) dismissed an objection by the applicants on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed a request by the applicants for exemption from compulsory primary - school attendance . The court noted that LAW granted the parents both freedom of religion and the right to educate their children with regard to religious and philosophical convictions , which also included the negative aspect of keeping their children away from convictions which would be harmful in their opinion . That freedom , however , was restricted by the ORG \u2019s obligation to provide education and tuition . Hence compulsory schooling was not a matter for the GPE discretion . The applicant GPE wish to let their children grow up in a \u201c protected area \u201d at home without outside interference could not take priority over compulsory school attendance . Even if the children could be sufficiently educated at home , the ORG \u2019s obligation to provide education under LAW would not be met if the children had no contact with other children . Attending a primary school , with children from all backgrounds , would enable the children both to gain their first experiences of society and to acquire social skills . Neither would be possible if the parents were authorised to educate the children at home , in particular because the applicant parents had openly stated that they wished to avoid their children having regular contact with other children . The court noted that the ORG \u2019s obligation to educate would also further the children \u2019s interests and served the protection of their personal rights . Because of their young age , the applicant children were unable to foresee the consequences of their GPE decision to opt for home education . Therefore , they could hardly be expected to make an autonomous decision for themselves . Moreover , the applicant GPE right to educate their children would not be undermined by compulsory school attendance as the parents could educate their children before and after school , as well as at DATE . They were also free to send their children to a denominational school , which would possibly be more sensitive as to sex education than a ORG school , although the court questioned whether the issue of sex education would be of any relevance in a primary school \u2019s syllabus .", "On DATE the Baden - ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants . It found that , even though the applicant GPE right to educate their children included religious education , they were not exclusively entitled under LAW to educate their children . The ORG \u2019s constitutional obligation to provide the children with an education was on an equal footing with the GPE right . The court stressed that the decisive point was not whether home education was equally as effective as primary school education , but that compulsory school attendance required children from all backgrounds in society to gather together . Parents could not obtain an exemption from compulsory school attendance for their children if they disagreed with the content of particular parts of the syllabus , even if their disagreement was religiously motivated . The applicant parents could not be permitted to keep their children away from school and the influences of other children . Schools represented society , and it was in the children \u2019s interests to become part of that society . The GPE right to provide education did not go so far as to deprive their children of that experience . Parents could require the ORG to take positive measures in order to prevent their children being ill - treated by other children . The applicant parents had not , however , argued that the school authorities in GPE would fail to do so . Neither had the parents sufficiently argued that the applicant children would be exposed to religious influence which was opposed to their own views . The school \u2019s obligation of religious neutrality would prevent the applicant children from any indoctrination against their will . In so far as the applicants complained that the school \u2019s syllabus was too scientific and denied any divine influence on the creation and the history of the world , the court found that freedom of religion did not entail the freedom not to deal with any possible conflicts between science and religion . The \u201c mythical figures \u201d such as dwarfs or witches which the applicants considered to represent occultism were characters in fairy tales and children \u2019s books which were well known to all children . At school , they would be introduced to children as fictional characters . Hence the ORG did not promote superstition through its schools .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an application by the applicants for leave to appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG refused to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicants because it had already dealt with the decisive constitutional issues in its settled case - law . It pointed out that the administrative courts\u2019 decisions had neither violated the applicant GPE right to educate their children nor the applicants\u2019 freedom of religion . The balance of interests between the applicants\u2019 rights on the one hand and the ORG \u2019s obligation to provide school education on the other did not require exemption from compulsory school attendance . ORG stressed that the ORG \u2019s obligation to provide education did not only concern the acquisition of knowledge , but also the education of responsible citizens to participate in a democratic and pluralistic society . To hold that home education under the ORG \u2019s supervision was not equally effective for pursuing these aims was at least not erroneous . The acquisition of social skills in dealing with other persons who had different views and in holding an opinion which differed from the views of the majority was only possible through regular contact with society . Everyday experience with other children based on regular school attendance was a more effective means of achieving that aim . ORG found that the interferences with the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights were also proportionate given the general interest of society in avoiding the emergence of parallel societies based on separate philosophical convictions . Moreover , society also had an interest in the integration of minorities . Such integration required not only that minorities with separate religious or philosophical views should not be excluded , but also that they should not exclude themselves . Therefore , the exercise and practising of tolerance in primary schools was an important goal . Lastly , ORG considered that the interference was reasonable as the parents still had the possibility of educating their children themselves outside TIME , and the school system was obliged to be considerate towards dissenting religious beliefs .", "The relevant provisions of LAW are the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
