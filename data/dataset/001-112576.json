The first , second and third applicants arrived in GPE on DATE following a promise of work by X. , a GPE man of NORP nationality , residing in GPE , who accommodated them in a villa in the village of GPE , in the province of GPE , where he lived with his family . The third and the first applicants provided different versions on this point to the NORP authorities .

As the second and third applicants refused , X. threatened them with a loaded gun . Then the second and third applicants were beaten , threatened with death and forced to leave the first applicant in GPE and go back to GPE . Although the applicants denied this , it seems from their initial submissions that the second and third applicants had been offered money to leave their daughter behind . On DATE , the second and third applicants went back to GPE . On their return the second applicant was diagnosed with type CARDINAL diabetes , which he alleged was a consequence of the stress endured .", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , the police accompanied them with an interpreter to identify the house in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Apparently frustrated with the police \u2019s slowness in responding to the complaint , the second applicant lodged written complaints with many other institutions . A letter of CARDINAL DATE , addressed to the NORP Prime Minister , the NORP Ministers for Foreign and ORG , the NORP Ambassador in GPE , the Prefect of GPE , the NORP Prime Minister , the NORP Minister for ORG and the NORP Ambassador to GPE , is included in the file .", "CARDINAL .

At TIME that day , she was taken to a police station in ORG and questioned , in the presence of an interpreter , by CARDINAL female and CARDINAL male police officers . The applicants alleged that she was treated roughly and threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth . Allegedly she was then forced to declare that she did not wish her supposed kidnappers to be prosecuted , to answer \u201c yes \u201d to all other questions , and to sign certain documents in NORP , which she did not understand and which were neither translated into NORP nor given to her . They also alleged that the interpreter did not do her job properly and remained silent in the face of the treatment being inflicted . The applicants further alleged that PERSON was present during certain parts of the first applicant \u2019s questioning .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the third applicant was questioned by the police in GPE in the presence of an interpreter . The third applicant alleged that she was also threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth , and that the interpreter did not do her job properly .

They also complained that the NORP authorities did not seek to question the second applicant in order to establish the facts , by means of cooperation with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the file that , after DATE , the applicants sent several letters and e - mails , most of which were in NORP , to the NORP authorities ( such as the NORP Prime Minister , the NORP Ministers for ORG and ORG , ORG attached to ORG of GPE , the mayor of GPE and the NORP diplomatic authorities in GPE ) , with a request to provide them with information about the police raid of DATE and to start criminal proceedings against the first applicant \u2019s alleged kidnappers . They also complained that they had suffered threats , humiliation and ill - treatment at the hands of the police .

At the same time , the applicants also wrote to the Prime Minister of GPE , the Head of ORG of ORG ( ORG ) and ORG in GPE , requesting them to protect their rights and assist them in obtaining information from the NORP authorities . ORG in GPE provided the applicants with certain information .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not provide the ORG with any document regarding their questioning and the subsequent criminal proceedings against them ( see below ) .

On DATE and DATE , at the ORG \u2019s request , ORG submitted a number of documents , among which the transcript of the first complaint lodged by the third applicant on DATE with the GPE police , and TIME of the interviews with the first applicant , the third applicant and some of the alleged kidnappers , which took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

More specifically , on CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG requested help from ORG to identify the location where the first applicant was allegedly being held . On DATE the ORG went to GPE to identify the location together with the third applicant . They inspected the location and the third applicant identified the villa she had mentioned in her complaint . On DATE ORG transmitted the crime report ( notizia di reato ) to ORG . From the communal registry it appeared that no person resided in the identified villa , but that it was owned by an individual who had a criminal record . In consequence , the police kept the place under surveillance . The police raided the villa on DATE , after having observed movement inside . During the search the police seized a number of cameras containing photographs of what appeared to be a wedding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG was informed by fax of developments in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , immediately after the raid , the first applicant was questioned by ORG , who was assisted by the police . As also transpires from the documents , the first applicant made allegations that showed a number of discrepancies with the complaint previously submitted by her mother , and which led the authorities to conclude that no kidnapping , but rather an agreement about a marriage , had in reality taken place between the CARDINAL families . This conclusion was confirmed by photographs given to the police by X. after the raid , showing a wedding party at which the second applicant received a sum of money from X. When showed the photographs , the first applicant denied that her father had taken money as part of the agreement about the marriage .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the third applicant was questioned by ORG in Vercelli . She stated again that her daughter had not married Y. of her own free will , and claimed that the photographs were nothing but a fake , taken on purpose by the alleged kidnappers , who had threatened them with a gun , in order to undermine the credibility of their version of the facts . The ORG police also questioned X. , PERSON ( a third party present at the wedding ) and Y. , who all stated that Y. had entered into a consensual marriage with the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . As a result of these interviews and on the basis of the photographs , ORG decided to turn the proceedings against unknown persons for kidnapping ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG ) into proceedings against the first and third applicants for perjury and libel . TIME , the first and third applicants were informed by the ORG and GPE police about the charges and invited to appoint a representative . They were then provided with a court - appointed lawyer . At TIME the first applicant was transferred to a shelter for homeless people . On DATE she was released into the custody of her mother .

On DATE the first applicant was invited for questioning by ORG , but she was in GPE and did not appear .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of Turin concluded the investigation against the third applicant and sent the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the third applicant , on the ground that the facts of which she was accused did not subsist . The actual evidence consisting of the notes verbal of the questioning of the accused and her daughter , the photographic evidence and the policemen \u2019s statements , were indicative and could not establish without doubt the guilt of the accused . The accused and her daughter \u2019s statements were contradictory and the photos did not certify the circumstances in which they were taken . According to the police statements it could only be deduced that the daughter had been found at the villa and the persons who could have clarified the facts had availed themselves of the right to remain silent . The understanding of the facts was further complicated by the GPE tradition of selling , or paying a sum of money previously established to the family of the bride for the purposes of concluding a marriage , a matter which in the case of a dispute could have created consequences which it had been impossible to establish .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the documents produced by ORG , particularly the declarations made by X. , NORP and PERSON , ORG considered the facts to be as follows .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants arrived in GPE and were accommodated in the nomad camp in GPE .

After festivities the newlyweds retired to the trailer where they consummated the marriage and Y. confirmed that the first applicant had been a virgin .

At the end of the wedding X. paid the second applicant the remainder of the amount due , namely LAW , in the presence of both families and other witnesses , as proven by the photographs . After the festivities the bride \u2019s parents were accompanied to the railway station and left for GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Once in GPE it was only on DATE , DATE after their departure from GPE , that the second applicant complained to the ORG of GPE .
