NORP The applicant , ORG ve ORG PERSON , is a joint stock company registered in GPE that operated a private tutoring centre ( dershane ) in GPE for students preparing for secondary school and university entrance examinations at the time of the events giving rise to the present application . The applicant company was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Law no . PERSON on ORG was enacted on DATE to govern the authorisation , operation , management and supervision of private education institutions . According to former section CARDINAL ( b ) of PERSON no . PERSON , the term \u201c institution \u201d included , for the purposes of that PERSON , private institutions engaging in pre - school , elementary and secondary school education , schools for special education and various training courses , distance learning institutions , private tutoring centres , driving schools , inservice training centres , student study centres , special education and rehabilitation centres , and other similar private education institutions .", "CARDINAL . According to former section CARDINAL ( f ) of PERSON no . PERSON , a \u201c private tutoring centre \u201d was defined as a private education institution that prepared students for , inter alia , examinations held for admittance to secondary education or higher education ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c entrance examinations \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Law no . CARDINAL was enacted to amend various laws , including PERSON no . PERSON . Amongst other changes , PERSON no . CARDINAL removed \u201c private tutoring centres \u201d from the list of private education institutions that were authorised to operate within the scope of PERSON no . PERSON , and made certain arrangements for the transformation of private tutoring centres in operation to other education institutions . It also amended the definition of \u201c various training courses \u201d mentioned in section QUANTITY ( b ) of PERSON no . PERSON to specify that such training courses could not engage in preparing students for entrance examinations , and further added that \u201c student study centres \u201d referred to in the same paragraph could only offer services to students who were aged twelve or below . According to the preparatory works to PERSON no . CARDINAL , such amendments were considered necessary mainly to tackle the dichotomy and inequality of opportunity caused by private tutoring centres within the education system , which had over DATE begun to be perceived as an alternative to compulsory education institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an action brought by a group of Members of ORG , ORG decided to annul those provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL that concerned private tutoring centres , as well as the amendments made to the definitions of \u201c various training centres \u201d and \u201c student study centres \u201d . The annulment became effective on DATE , the date of publication of ORG decision . ORG stressed in its decision that private tutoring centres had been set up to prepare students for entrance examinations , and thus served a specific need which was not always met by regular schools . Instead of taking more targeted measures to deal with the problems posed by those tutoring centres , however , the legislator had opted for their complete abolition , which was not a proportionate response in the circumstances , considering in particular that no alternatives were on offer to meet the specific needs of students preparing for entrance examinations . ORG noted in this connection the amendment of the definitions of \u201c various training courses \u201d and \u201c student study centres \u201d to prevent them from replacing private tutoring centres .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Regulation on Private Education Institutions was amended . The amendments concerned , inter alia , details regarding the \u201c transformation programme \u201d that had to be followed by private tutoring centres and the various education institutions that they could transfer into .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a circular ( no . CARDINAL ) regarding , inter alia , the situation of private tutoring centres . The circular stated that following the ORG decision , private tutoring centres currently in operation had to transform themselves into other private education institutions in order to be able to continue to operate . According to CARDINAL of this circular , any private tutoring centres which had not applied for the \u201c transformation programme \u201d by DATE would have their operating licences revoked .", "CARDINAL . Following an action brought by an education workers\u2019 trade union , on DATE ORG ordered a stay of execution of circular no . DATE . ORG stated that by virtue of LAW decisions delivered by ORG did not have retroactive effect , which meant that while the relevant provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL abolishing private tutoring centres had been annulled , the former provisions of PERSON no . PERSON governing those centres had not been reinstated . This , ORG explained , created a gap in the law in respect of the legal status of private tutoring centres which were currently in operation ; this gap had to be filled by the legislator . In the absence of such action by the legislative body , any measures taken by the administration to close down private tutoring centres or limit their activities would be ultra vires . For this reason , ORG found that circular no . DATE issued by ORG had been ultra vires and had contravened the ORG decision by virtue of its provisions providing for the closure of private tutoring centres . CARDINAL of the members of ORG , including the president , delivered a dissenting opinion stating that circular no . DATE was lawful and in compliance with the ORG decision . It appears that ORG has not yet delivered a decision on the merits of this case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued another circular ( no . CARDINAL ) on the subject . According to section CARDINAL of this circular , no administrative action would be taken by governors\u2019 offices against private tutoring centres which were operating lawfully at the time of the enactment of PERSON no .
