The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE . The second and the third applicants , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are her children , born in DATE and DATE . The applicants are all NORP nationals . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On an unknown date , the applicants arrived in GPE from GPE and applied for asylum and residence permits . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) they claimed , inter alia , the following . They originated from LOC and feared persecution due to the internal armed conflict there . The first applicant \u2019s former husband had been engaged in the resistance movement . They had last met at DATE . Some time later , she had met another man who had fought for the South Ossetian army and who had been shot dead . Subsequently , the applicants\u2019 house had been shot at on several occasions and they had been unable to obtain any protection from the domestic authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applications and decided that the applicants were to be expelled to either GPE or GPE . It stated that the first and the second applicants\u2019 passports had been submitted to ORG anonymously and that these showed that the applicants were NORP nationals . Moreover , the passports contained GPE visas issued by ORG in GPE and stamps which showed that they had entered GPE by car in DATE . However , it noted that the first applicant had undergone a language test , according to which it was found probable that she originated from GPE . Moreover , the first and second applicants had also submitted documents which they claimed were temporary documents issued by the South Ossetian authorities and which functioned as internal passports for GPE . Consequently , their applications were examined on the basis of a return to either GPE or GPE . In the ORG \u2019s view , there were no indications that the applicants would risk persecution or other ill - treatment upon return to GPE due to their LOC . It further noted that the family had not claimed that they needed international protection in relation to GPE . Finally , ORG noted that there were no particularly distressing circumstances in the case since the family had no strong connection to GPE and it had not appeared that any person in the family suffered from serious health problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining their claims and adding the following new information . The NORP passports were false and the family \u2019s real last name was PERSON . The family had come to GPE with the help of smugglers but had been unable to pay them the full amount demanded , for which reason the smugglers had submitted false passports to the NORP authorities as revenge . The first applicant had herself ordered the passports in GPE , which were falsifications of authentic NORP passports . Consequently , it had been wrong of the ORG to base its examination on these passports and their asylum claims should be tried only against GPE and in particular LOC . In this respect , they asserted that LOC was an unsafe place for a single mother with children and that they had nothing to return to since their house had been destroyed in the war between GPE and GPE . The children could not be guaranteed schooling or good health care there . Moreover , the first and second applicants risked gender - related persecution and possibly even trafficking .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the family \u2019s health , it had deteriorated since ORG rejection . They submitted a medical certificate from DATE concerning the third applicant , which stated that he had been receiving treatment for depression at the Child and Youth Psychiatric Centre ( Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin - BUP ) since DATE . Furthermore , he had been hospitalised for a shorter period due to somatic symptoms , depression and refusal to eat . They further submitted a certificate from DATE and issued by a psychotherapist at ORG which stated that the third applicant was in a state of apathy and spent all his time in bed , which was confirmed by a medical certificate from DATE . Regarding the second applicant , a medical certificate from DATE issued by a psychiatrist stated that she had been in contact with the psychiatric unit since DATE due to anxiety and tendencies to try to isolate herself from the outside world . In DATE her health had deteriorated and she had refused to eat . In DATE , she had been hospitalised due to depression and malnutrition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision and ordered that the applicants be expelled to GPE . At the request of the court , ORG had contacted ORG in GPE to verify the authenticity of the passports . The results indicated that the passports and the visas were authentic and that they had not been tampered with . Moreover , ORG in GPE had confirmed that the first and the second applicants had been granted visas for the relevant period . Consequently , ORG found it substantiated that the applicants had used their passports when entering GPE and noted that the first applicant had stated that she had ordered them herself . As to the other identity documents submitted by the applicants , the court found them to be of a simple nature and noted that they contained different names from those in the passports . Therefore , in the court \u2019s view , the applicants had not substantiated any nationality other than NORP and their applications should accordingly be examined only on the basis of a return to GPE . Turning to the applicants\u2019 personal situation , ORG found no reason to believe that the applicants would risk any persecution or discrimination due to their LOC ethnicity and noted that they had not submitted any other grounds for international protection against GPE .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the applicants\u2019 ties to GPE and their state of health , ORG observed that the applicants had only spent DATE in GPE and noted that it could not be considered contrary to the children \u2019s best interests to accompany their mother back to GPE . Moreover , since the medical documentation relied on by the applicants did not contain any information about the prognosis of the applicants\u2019 need for health care , or the consequences if no care were provided , the court found them to have low evidentiary value . It also appeared from country information submitted in the case that health care was available in GPE leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicants requested ORG to reexamine their case , arguing that there were impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order . They claimed that they all suffered poor health and that medical care in GPE was insufficient . They further referred to a car accident in DATE , in which the first applicant \u2019s youngest son and the second and third applicants\u2019 younger brother , PERSON , had died , and the fact that he was buried in GPE . They submitted new medical certificates regarding the second and the third applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the application . It noted that the health of the third applicant had recently improved since he was no longer being tube fed and had started talking and interacting socially . As concerned the second applicant , it observed that her health was likewise better as her depression was considered mild and no longer serious . In the ORG \u2019s view , there was sufficient health care available in GPE for the applicants . When taking these circumstances into account , and despite the fact that PERSON was buried in GPE , it found no impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG which , on DATE , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision in full .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants again requested ORG to re - examine their case , invoking the same grounds as previously and adding that the first applicant was mentally unstable and under severe stress with suicidal tendencies . The third applicant was at risk of falling into a state of apathy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the request on the grounds that the applicants had invoked no new circumstances of importance to justify altering the previous decisions . Moreover , it found that there were no impediments to their expulsion .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged yet another request with ORG to re - examine their case , invoking their continued ill - health and the fact that PERSON was buried in GPE . They submitted the same medical certificates as submitted to the ORG and referred to below , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . It noted that the applicants had not invoked any new circumstances which had not already been examined by ORG . As concerned the applicants\u2019Sweden .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants requested the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG in order to stop their expulsion to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Acting President of the Section to which the case had been allocated refused the ORG request for interim measures .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG , the applicants submitted new medical certificates concerning their state of health , issued by a Chief physician and specialist in psychiatry .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant the certificates , dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE stated , inter alia , that her state of health had markedly worsened after ORG rejection of the asylum request in DATE , making her increasingly anxious and worried about her children \u2019s ill - health . Since the loss of her youngest son , PERSON , in DATE , the first applicant \u2019s mental health had visibly worsened and she had persistently sought help . She questioned her capabilities as a mother and blamed herself for what had happened to her family . She was suffering from a serious psychological disorder with signs of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) for which she was in need of long - term medication as well as therapeutic treatment . She had become increasingly depressive and suicidal with an imminent risk of destructive actions . She received a variety of medication .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the second applicant , the certificate dated DATE stated , inter alia , that she had suffered from recurrent serious depression and difficulties sleeping and eating . She had been treated with medication for anxiety but had shown tendencies to overdose which had made physicians cautious to prescribe medication . Currently , the depression was considered mild but she still had panic attacks , was anxious and felt hopeless about her life situation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the third applicant , the certificate dated DATE stated , inter alia , that he had been treated periodically at ORG for deep depression which had worsened since his brother \u2019s death . He had lost weight and no longer had any interest in life . He had difficulties eating and sleeping properly and had recurring rages where he hit his head against the table and beat his fists against the wall . At present , he was heading for a breakdown and could see no other option than to end his life . He probably had a personality disorder due to extensive periods of stress with minimal possibilities to control his own acts . He was in need of long - term treatment .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . It defines the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , a permit may nevertheless be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s state of health . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for granting a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . According to a provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
