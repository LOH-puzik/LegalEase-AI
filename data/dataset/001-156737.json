On DATE the applicant \u2019s son - in - law , who had been accompanied by his granddaughter , was interviewed at the ORG \u2019s office . According to the conversation report produced on that occasion the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had informed the ORG that his wife had suffered from depression because he had left to work abroad . He had returned to GPE DATE prior to the meeting at the ORG and had not told his daughter about her mother \u2019s death . He had acknowledged that his daughter had to be informed about her mother \u2019s death and had agreed to inform her with the help of a psychologist . He had also stated that the applicant had used to have a normal relationship with his granddaughter , before he had started pressuring them and picking fights in front of their home . The applicant had not agreed to the marriage between him and his wife and had used to interfere in their marriage .", "CARDINAL . According to that report the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had also been counselled on how to speak to his daughter about her mother and had been advised to shield her from family fights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG provided the applicant \u2019s granddaughter with psychological counselling in order to prepare her for the news that her mother had died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG produced the social investigation report requested by the ORG on DATE . The report concluded that the child had a close connection to her father and her paternal grandparents who had cared for her in her father \u2019s absence . The father \u2019s family had provided the child with normal conditions for her physical , moral and intellectual development and her health had not been endangered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed at the ORG \u2019s office . According to the conversation report produced on that occasion the applicant had informed the ORG that his relationship with his son - in - law had been very bad and that his son - in - law had refused to allow him into his home .", "CARDINAL . According to the same report the ORG \u2019s representatives had explained to the applicant that he had made a mistake in informing his granddaughter about her mother \u2019s death directly and without any preliminary coaching . He had been advised that it would be in the best interest of the child to avoid and to solve family conflicts . He had also been informed that it would be advisable for him to avoid speaking ill of his sonin - law in front of his granddaughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Agency informed the applicant following his enquiry that they could have ordered his granddaughter \u2019s psychological evaluation only if it had been ordered by a court or had been requested by her father . Moreover , they stated that they had not been competent to punish an individual for failure to comply with a final court judgment . Furthermore , they noted that the applicant \u2019s granddaughter had received psychological counselling in respect of her mother \u2019s death and in order to help her process the trauma .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant asked the ORG to inform him whether he had a right to have contact with his granddaughter and whether she could have been counselled in the absence of her father in order to improve his relationship with her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that they did not have the competence to contradict the final court judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) granting him visiting rights . Moreover , they stated that the child could not have undergone psychological counselling without her father \u2019s consent on account of her young age and the fact that the ORG \u2019s intervention had not been needed for reasons imputable to the applicant \u2019s son - in - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Agency informed ORG that in DATE they had supported the applicant in his attempts to rekindle his relationship with his granddaughter . They stated that , following his daughter \u2019s death , the applicant had asked the ORG to intervene and to help him preserve his relationship with his granddaughter . Following the applicant \u2019s notification , the ORG \u2019s representatives had spoken to the applicant \u2019s son - in - law . Because his son - in - law had not informed his granddaughter about her mother \u2019s death , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law and the child had been included in psychological counselling program which had led to the applicant \u2019s granddaughter finding out the truth about her mother . Neither the ORG \u2019s , nor ORG investigations carried out at the child home had disclosed any danger for the child . In this context , ORG had mediated a meeting between the applicant , his son - in - law and his granddaughter in order to observe their interaction and to help resolve the conflict between the CARDINAL parties so that the child would not be traumatised even further . During that meeting , the interaction between the applicant and the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had been very tense . The applicant had accused his son - in - law of killing his daughter and had called him a murderer in front of the child . Because the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had also been verbally aggressive towards the applicant , both parties had been advised on the negative consequences of their behaviour in respect of the child . Whilst the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had changed his behaviour and had mastered his anger , the applicant had failed to do the same even though he had been warned that his behaviour might affect his granddaughter \u2019s emotional wellbeing and that it had caused her to reject contact with him . The applicant \u2019s granddaughter had refused any physical contact with the applicant both before and after she had been counselled by a psychologist .", "CARDINAL . On the same dates ORG also informed ORG that every time the applicant \u2019s granddaughter had been brought to the ORG , her psychological evaluation had been carried out in CARDINAL stages : her interaction with the adults had been observed and afterwards she had received psychological counselling in the absence of her father . Also , given the child \u2019s young age , the fact that her father had been her legal representative and that he had not been a danger to the child , there had been no legal basis for the ORG to accept the applicant \u2019s request to organise psychological counselling sessions between him and his granddaughter without the father \u2019s consent and in his absence . Moreover , after PERSON no . CARDINAL on protection of the rights of children had been amended on DATE a person facing conflicts caused by enforcement of visiting rights could have notified the social protection service from the child \u2019s domicile . However , after the aforementioned date the applicant had no longer contacted ORG , and the latter had not been informed by ORG either that the applicant had faced problems with the enforcement of his visiting rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant opened proceedings against his son - in - law seeking custody of his granddaughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant amended his application and asked the domestic courts to grant him visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter if his request for custody rights was dismissed . He asked to see his granddaughter every DATE at her home and to be granted the right to take her at his house for DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed in part the applicant \u2019s action and granted him visiting rights DATE from TIME at his granddaughter \u2019s and son - in - law \u2019s home . It held that the applicant was entitled to have a normal relationship with his granddaughter , a fact that had also been acknowledged by the applicant \u2019s son - in - law who had objected only to the visiting schedule requested by the applicant . A normal relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter was in the child \u2019s best interest . Given the child \u2019s young age , she needed a stable living environment which could have been affected if she had to travel to the applicant \u2019s home for DATE during DATE . The applicant could also have asked for an extension of his visiting rights once his relationship with his granddaughter had improved and the child had grown older .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment before ORG . He asked to be granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter at his house or in a neutral location on account of his poor relationship with his son - in - law . He further argued that a denial of his request by the court would prevent him from actually reconnecting with the child .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG ordered the ORG to produce a psychological evaluation report in respect of the applicant \u2019s granddaughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the second - instance court \u2019s order for a psychological evaluation report , the ORG organised a meeting between the applicant , his granddaughter and his son - in - law in order to assess their interaction . According to the meeting report produced on DATE , at the beginning of the meeting the applicant \u2019s daughter had sat only in her father \u2019s lap and had not approached the applicant . Afterwards , she had been examined by a psychologist . The applicant \u2019s son - in - law had stated that when the applicant had come to see his granddaughter according to the court \u2019s schedule he had told the child that her father would murder her just as he had done with her mother . At the same time the applicant had claimed that his son - in - law had been controlling his granddaughter and had turned her against him . The parties had been advised that mediation services could have been provided for them in order to help them resolve their conflict . The applicant \u2019s son - in - law had refused , however , to leave the child alone with her grandfather because he could not have trusted his behaviour towards her . The applicant had accused his son - in - law of murdering his daughter in front of the child . At the end of the meeting the child had refused interact with her grandparent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Agency produced the psychological evaluation report ordered by the second - instance court . It concluded that the applicant , his son - in - law and his granddaughter had needed psychological counselling in order to enable them to resolve their conflict and to rekindle their relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed in part the judgment of the first - instance court and granted him visiting rights on DATE from TIME at his home . It held , amongst other things , that according to the available evidence the applicant and his granddaughter had enjoyed an affectionate relationship both prior and after the child \u2019s mother \u2019s death . The relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter had changed abruptly and the child had refused to see her grandfather any more , her refusal being fuelled by a feeling of fear towards her grandfather . The conclusions of the psychological evaluation report produced in respect of the child had recommended psychological counselling for both the applicant and the child \u2019s father in order to resolve the conflict between them and to allow them to have a balanced relationship with the child . Consequently , the conflict between the applicant and his son - in - law had influenced the applicant \u2019s relationship with his granddaughter , given that the child \u2019s attitude towards her grandfather had changed . In the absence of any evidence that the applicant would have endangered the child \u2019s physical or moral development , he had been entitled to have a personal relationship with his granddaughter . Given the excessively tense situation between the applicant and his son - in - law , the age and the interests of the child , the relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter could have been rekindled only if he had been allowed to take her to his home during the allowed visiting TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment . He asked to be granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter either every DATE or alternatively every second DATE at his house on account of his busy work programme . He further argued that a denial of his request by the court would prevent him from rekindling the relationship with his granddaughter .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It held , amongst other things , that it was in the best interest of the child to have contact with her grandfather given that the applicant had not endangered his granddaughter \u2019s physical and moral development and that prior and after the child \u2019s mother \u2019s death they had had an affectionate relationship with one another which had been affected by the death of the child \u2019s mother and the conflict between the applicant and his son - in - law . In spite of the child \u2019s fear towards the applicant , according to the social investigation report the best interest of the child had been to establish a functional relationship with the applicant , reason for which the parties psychological counselling had been recommended . However , the visiting schedule requested by the applicant would have been tiring for the child , given their family situation and the child \u2019s young age and would have also limited the applicant \u2019s son - in - law \u2019s time spent with his child . The visiting programme could have been changed once the factual circumstances had changed and if it had been in the best interest of the child . Consequently , it was more appropriate for the applicant to have contact with his granddaughter only CARDINAL DATE per month .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought criminal proceedings against his son - in - law on the basis of LAW for repeatedly obstructing him to see his granddaughter . He argued that although on DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE he had contacted his son - in - law and had asked him to allow him to have contact with his granddaughter , his son - in - law had refused to allow him to see her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against his son - in - law . It held that even though the applicant had been granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter by a final court judgment , every time he had asked her to go with him to his home she had obstinately refused . Moreover , the child had been heard in the presence of a representative of ORG and she had refused to go to the applicant \u2019s house because she had feared him after he had repeatedly visited her at school and had scared her with his repeated requests to follow him home . Furthermore , the psychological report produced by ORG showed that the child had feared the applicant and had recommended that the child underwent psychological counselling in order to rekindle her relationship with the applicant . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had only observed his child \u2019s wishes and there was no evidence that he had influenced the child . The applicant appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s decision before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant . It held that the applicant was not a parent and therefore the elements required for the offence provided by LAW to exist had not been met . Moreover , the police officers had heard the child in the presence of the representative of ORG and she had refused to go to the applicant \u2019s home because she had feared him . The child had also stated that her father had never told her not to go to the applicant \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . In his initial letters the applicant informed the ORG that in his hometown there had been CARDINAL bailiffs and all of them had refused to help him enforce the final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant employed a bailiff located in GPE to enforce the final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the bailiff informed the applicant \u2019s soninlaw that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against him following the applicant \u2019s request . She invited the applicant \u2019s son - in - law to her office on DATE in order for him to pay the required enforcement fees and to provide the required information concerning his assets . She also informed him that failure to comply or to provide the required information was punishable by fines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff notified the applicant \u2019s son - in - law that he needed to comply with the domestic courts\u2019 judgment and that the first meeting between the applicant and his granddaughter would take place on DATE . She also notified him that she would proceed with the enforcement of the judgment as provided , among other things , by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG if he refused to comply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son - in - law agreed before the bailiff to obey the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff accompanied the applicant to his granddaughter \u2019s home in order to enforce the judgment . The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the applicant \u2019s soninlaw had agreed to allow the applicant to see his granddaughter and had not obstructed the enforcement proceedings . The applicant \u2019s granddaughter had a strong emotional connection with her father and had been hostile towards the applicant . She had obstinately refused to accompany her grandfather anywhere without her father being present because she had feared her grandfather . Consequently , the applicant and his son - in - law had agreed , with the child \u2019s consent , to take the child in a public location and to spend the day together accompanied by the bailiff . The applicant had been able to give his granddaughter a gift and had interacted with her calmly and openly . The applicant \u2019s son in law had agreed to allow his daughter to visit her grandfather any time she wished and even on other days than the ones that had been mentioned by the court . The applicant \u2019s granddaughter had agreed to have future contact with her grandfather but only in her father \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL .

The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the parties had agreed for the meeting to take place in a public location after they had consulted the applicant \u2019s granddaughter \u2019s wishes . The applicant \u2019s son - in - law had reiterated his willingness to allow the applicant to visit his granddaughter , but had informed the bailiff that she had refused to see her grandfather in his absence or in a different location than the one she had chosen . At the same time , the applicant had expressed his dissatisfaction with his son - in - law \u2019s compliance with the final court judgment granting him contact rights , in so far as he had been influencing the child in choosing the locations of their meetings and therefore he had not allowed him to spend time with his granddaughter at his home . The applicant and his granddaughter had enjoyed the time together , while the applicant \u2019s son - in - law had kept a low profile . Also the parties had agreed to allow the child and her grandfather to choose together the locations of their future meetings . At DATE the applicant \u2019s granddaughter had refused her father \u2019s proposal to travel back to her home in the company of her grandfather .", "CARDINAL .

The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the applicant and his granddaughter had agreed for the meeting to take place in a public location . The applicant and his son - in - law had a disagreement on whether the location of the meetings could have been chosen by the applicant on his own or only with the child \u2019s consent .
