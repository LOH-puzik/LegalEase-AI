GEORGIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were successively represented by their Agents , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was a member of a private housing cooperative ( \u201c the cooperative \u201d ) . Under an agreement of CARDINAL DATE , the cooperative undertook to deliver to the applicant , in exchange for a monetary contribution , a refurbished apartment of QUANTITY on the first floor of a block of flats which was to be constructed in the centre of GPE .", "On DATE the construction of the block was terminated , but the cooperative refused to fulfil its contractual obligation vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant , excluding him from the membership . The applicant then sued the cooperative , claiming the property title to a flat corresponding to the conditions stipulated in the agreement of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the disputed flat \u201d ) . He also sought an injunction barring the cooperative from registering the flats in the newly constructed block , pending the resolution of his dispute .", "In an interlocutory decision of DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo ORG in GPE allowed the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction , ordering ORG to attach all the flats in the block , pending the final determination of the dispute . However , that decision was overturned , on the basis of the cooperative \u2019s appeal , by the same ORG on DATE . The attachment record was consequently deleted from ORG , and the flats in the block were immediately distributed , with property rights , among the members of the cooperative .", "The applicant then appealed against the decision of DATE , and on CARDINAL DATE the ORG delivered another interlocutory decision , confirming the initial attachment order of DATE . The decision of CARDINAL DATE became binding .", "On DATE the applicant brought a court action against the competent bailiffs from the GPE enforcement office and ORG , requesting those authorities to enforce the interlocutory decision of CARDINAL DATE and to pay him damages for the delay in its enforcement ( \u201c the action of QUANTITY DATE \u201d ) .", "Initially , the ORG on DATE dismissed the action of DATE as manifestly ill - founded . However , the applicant appealed , explaining that the essence of his claim was to restore the situation which had existed prior to the lifting of the attachment order on DATE . During the appellate proceedings , the applicant further specified that he aimed at the annulment of those records in ORG which had confirmed the distribution of the flats between the cooperative members on the first floor of the block . In addition , the applicant dropped his claim for damages .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE , ordering ORG and the bailiffs to annul the cooperative ORG property titles to the flats located on the first floor of the block . In its decision , the appellate court duly noted that the applicant had withdrawn his claim for damages .", "As neither the applicant nor the respondent authorities lodged a cassation appeal against the decision of DATE , it became binding and , as disclosed by the case file , was later enforced by the authorities .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the GPE - Saburtalo ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s civil action on the merits , ordering the cooperative to transfer the disputed flat to the applicant \u2019s ownership .", "The judgment of CARDINAL DATE was fully upheld by ORG and ORG of GPE on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , becoming binding on DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued to the GPE enforcement office a writ for the enforcement of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the bailiff from the GPE enforcement office , who became in charge of the applicant \u2019s case , proposed to the cooperative to abide voluntarily by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The President of the cooperative , PERSON , replied , on DATE , that all the flats on the first floor of the block had already been alienated to third parties .", "On DATE the bailiff again requested the cooperative to abide by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , on pain of the initiation of criminal proceedings against PERSON under LAW . The reiterated proposal was left unanswered by the debtor , and on DATE the bailiff transmitted the case to an investigative unit of ORG , the agency in charge of enforcement proceedings , for more drastic measures . Consequently , on DATE a criminal case was opened against PERSON for the obstruction of the enforcement .", "On DATE the applicant complained to ORG of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , about the bailiff \u2019s failure to recover the judgment debt of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant noted that , after the records of the third parties\u2019 property titles to the relevant flats had been removed from ORG , there was no impediment to the transfer of the disputed flat to his ownership .", "In a letter of DATE , ORG informed the applicant of the measures which had been undertaken to compel the cooperative to abide by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The authority also invited the applicant , in the light of the difficulties associated with the transfer of the disputed flat , to consider the possibility of an adjustment in the modalities of the enforcement , as envisaged by the relevant enforcement legislation . That proposal was left unanswered by the applicant .", "Subsequently , an extensive exchange of correspondence , bearing on the method and various factual details of the possible transfer of the disputed flat to the applicant , took place between the bailiff and PERSON However , those negotiations yielded no result , and on DATE ORG ordered , within the framework of the criminal proceedings , PERSON dismissal from the post of President of the cooperative .", "On DATE the bailiff requested all the members of the cooperative to reach an agreement on the transfer of the disputed flat to the applicant , on pain of the initiation of criminal proceedings under LAW against each of them .", "On DATE , brokered by the bailiff , PERSON made a friendly settlement proposal to the applicant . Notably , the former President of the cooperative expressed his readiness to cede his own apartment free of charge to the applicant , in exchange for the latter \u2019s waiver of any further claims over the disputed flat . The applicant did not accept that proposal .", "According to the case file , the judgment of CARDINAL DATE has not been enforced to date .", "The non - enforcement of a binding judgment or the obstruction of its enforcement by , inter alia , executives of a corporation or other organisation was a criminally liable offence , prescribed by LAW .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , an appeal against any procedural decision , action or omission of an agent of the enforcement authority ( bailiff ) lay to a court .", "Pursuant to ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG , the ORG could be sued for the harm done by an action or omission of any public servant . In such proceedings , the relevant provisions of LAW could be applied , if necessary .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW stated that damage done to an individual by either negligent or deliberate misconduct of a public servant should be compensated by the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
