On completion of his training , he was promoted to the rank of sergeant . In DATE he and some CARDINAL soldiers were parachuted into GPE territory , then under NORP occupation , near the NORP border and thus to the area where he was born . The applicant joined a NORP commando unit composed of members of the \u201c Red Partisans \u201d ( a NORP force which fought a guerrilla war against the NORP forces ) . In DATE he was put in command of a platoon by his CARDINAL immediate superiors , whose primary objectives were , according to the applicant , to sabotage military installations , communication lines and NORP supply points , to derail trains and to spread political propaganda among the local population .

NORP In DATE the NORP army had discovered and wiped out a group of ORG led by Major PERSON who were hiding in the barn of GPE in the village of GPE . The NORP military administration had provided some men in PERSON with a rifle and CARDINAL grenades each . The applicant and his unit suspected the villagers of having spied for the NORP and of having turned in Major PERSON \u2019s men to the enemy . They decided to take reprisals against the villagers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his unit , armed and wearing ORG ( former NORP army ) uniforms to avoid arousing suspicion , entered the village of GPE . The inhabitants were preparing to celebrate GPE . The unit split up into a number of small groups , each of which attacked a house on the applicant \u2019s orders .", "CARDINAL . Several of the Red Partisans burst into the home of a farmer , PERSON , seized weapons they found there and ordered him out into the yard .

PERSON wife burnt to death in the fire with her dead husband .", "CARDINAL . While the prosecution also claimed that the Partisans pillaged the village ( stealing clothes and food ) , ORG of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and ORG made specific findings as regards the seizure of weapons but not as regards the stealing of any other items .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG , the applicant contested the factual findings of the domestic courts and submitted as follows .", "CARDINAL . He considered that all the deceased villagers were collaborators and traitors who had delivered Major PERSON \u2019s platoon ( which included women and a small child ) to the NORP in DATE : CARDINAL women ( ORG mother and wife and PERSON wife ) assured Major PERSON \u2019s platoon that the Wehrmacht was some distance away , but PERSON sent PERSON to alert the NORP forces .

Any member of Major PERSON \u2019s group who tried to escape was shot dead . ORG mother removed the coats from the bodies . The NORP military command rewarded the villagers concerned with firewood , sugar , alcohol and a sum of money . PERSON GPE and PERSON were PERSON ( NORP auxiliary police ) .", "CARDINAL . Approximately DATE prior to the events of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant and all the men in his platoon had received a summons from their commanding officer . He had informed them that an ad hoc military court had delivered judgment against the inhabitants of PERSON implicated in the betrayal of Major PERSON \u2019s men and that their platoon was required to execute the order . More specifically , they were required to \u201c bring the CARDINAL Schutzm\u00e4nner from PERSON to stand trial \u201d . The applicant maintained that he had refused to lead the operation ( the villagers had known him since childhood so he feared for the safety of his parents who lived in the neighbouring village ) . The commanding officer therefore assigned the mission to another Partisan and it was that other Partisan who had given the orders during the ORG operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had followed the men from his unit . He did not enter the village , but hid behind a bush from which he could see ORG house . Soon thereafter , he had heard cries and gunfire , and had seen smoke . DATE , the Partisans returned alone . CARDINAL had been wounded in the arm . Another was carrying CARDINAL rifles , CARDINAL grenades and a large quantity of cartridges , all of which had been seized in the villagers\u2019 homes . His unit later told him that they had not been able to carry out their mission as the villagers had \u201c fled while firing at them and the NORP had arrived \u201d . He denied that his unit had pillaged ORG . On returning to the base , the Partisans had been severely reprimanded by the commanding officer for failing to capture the wanted persons .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG entered GPE and on CARDINAL DATE NORP territory passed into the control of the GPE forces .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in GPE after the war ended . He was decorated for his military activities with the Order of PERSON , the highest distinction awarded in the GPE . In DATE he joined ORG of GPE . In DATE he graduated from the GPE Interior Ministry Academy . Subsequently , and until his retirement in DATE , he worked as an officer in various branches of the NORP police force .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of the NORP SSR adopted the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia , which declared GPE \u2019s incorporation into the GPE in DATE unlawful , null and void and restored force of law to the fundamental provisions of LAW of DATE . On DATE , ORG adopted the Declaration on the Accession of the Republic of Latvia to ORG . The term \u201c accession \u201d meant a solemn , unilateral acceptance of the values embodied in the instruments concerned : most of the conventions referred to in the declaration were subsequently signed and ratified by GPE in accordance with the established procedure .", "CARDINAL . After CARDINAL unsuccessful coups d\u2019\u00e9tat , on DATE ORG passed LAW on GPE proclaiming full independence with immediate effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted the Declaration on the Occupation of GPE . The declaration described the annexation of NORP territory by the GPE in DATE as a \u201c military occupation \u201d and an \u201c illegal incorporation \u201d . The NORP repossession of the territory at DATE was referred to as the \u201c re - establishment of an occupying regime \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG , based in GPE , forwarded an investigation file ( on the events of CARDINAL DATE ) to ORG . In DATE the applicant was charged with war crimes . In DATE he was brought before ORG of First Instance and his pretrial detention was ordered . In DATE a final bill of indictment was drawn up and the case file was forwarded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The trial took place before ORG on DATE . The applicant pleaded not guilty . He repeated his account of the events of CARDINAL DATE , underlining that all the victims of the attack had been armed ORG . He denied any personal involvement in the events : as to the various documents ( including press articles ) which attested to the contrary , he explained that he had knowingly allowed the historical facts to be distorted for his own personal glory and benefit at that time .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the case file contained ample evidence of his guilt and that the applicant had perpetrated acts in violation of the rules set out in the Charter of ORG for GPE , the Fourth Hague Convention respecting LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ( IV ) \u201d ) and LAW ( IV ) relative to ORG in Time of War of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL LAW ( IV ) \u201d ) . He was found guilty of offences contrary to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW and an immediate DATE custodial sentence was imposed . Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the latter judgment and returned the case file to ORG with instructions to make additional inquiries . It considered there were lacunae in ORG reasoning and , in particular , that ORG had failed to resolve decisive questions including whether PERSON was in an \u201c occupied territory \u201d , whether the applicant and his victims could be considered \u201c combatants \u201d and \u201c non - combatants \u201d respectively and whether the fact that the NORP military administration had armed the villagers would make them \u201c prisoners of war \u201d in the event of their arrest . In addition , the prosecution should have consulted specialists on history and international criminal law . It ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the prosecution \u2019s appeal by a judgment of DATE , although it struck out the requirement to obtain specialist advice since questions of law were solely for the courts to decide .", "CARDINAL . Following a fresh investigation , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was again charged under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the case and delivered judgment on DATE acquitting the applicant of war crimes , but finding him guilty of banditry ( contrary to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ) carrying a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Having analysed the situation in which GPE had found itself as a result of the events in DATE and the NORP invasion , ORG concluded that the applicant could not be considered a \u201c representative of the occupying forces \u201d . On the contrary , he had fought for the liberation of the country against the occupying forces of NORP GPE . As GPE had been incorporated into the GPE , the applicant \u2019s conduct had to be considered in the light of NORP law . In addition , he could not reasonably have foreseen that he would DATE be classified as a \u201c representative of the NORP occupying forces \u201d . With regard to the Mazie Bati operation , ORG accepted that the villagers had collaborated with the NORP military administration and had handed over Major PERSON \u2019s group of ORG to the Wehrmacht and that the attack on the village had been carried out pursuant to the judgment of the ad hoc military court set up within the detachment of ORG . ORG also accepted that the deaths of the CARDINAL men from PERSON could be regarded as having been necessary and justified by considerations of a military order . However , it found that such justification did not extend to the killing of the CARDINAL women or the burning down of the village buildings , for which acts , as commanding officer , the applicant was responsible . Consequently , as they had acted beyond the authority of the ad hoc military court \u2019s judgment both the applicant and his men had committed an act of banditry for which they bore full responsibility but which was , however , statute - barred .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed to ORG . Relying , inter alia , on LAW , the applicant sought a full acquittal , arguing that the law had been applied against him retrospectively . The prosecution submitted that ORG had made a number of serious errors of fact and law : it had neglected the fact that GPE \u2019s incorporation into the GPE was contrary to LAW of DATE and to international law , and was therefore unlawful , and that GPE had continued to exist de jure . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s conduct in DATE could and should have been analysed under NORP and international law , rather than NORP law . Further , the prosecution criticised ORG assessment of the evidence in the case . In its view , the court had relied on a series of assertions by the applicant that were not only unsupported by any evidence , but also contrary to the tenor of the evidence , notably the applicant \u2019s claims that the villagers from ORG were armed collaborators of the NORP military administration who had helped the NORP to wipe out Major PERSON \u2019s Red Partisans ; that an ad hoc Partisan tribunal had been set up within the applicant \u2019s detachment of ORG ; and that the purpose of ORG operation was not summary execution but the arrest of the villagers .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed the prosecution \u2019s appeal , quashed the judgment of ORG and found the applicant guilty of offences contrary to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW . Having reviewed the evidence , it noted :", "\u201c ... Thus , PERSON and the Partisans from the special group he commanded stole the weapons that had been delivered to enable the villagers to defend themselves and killed CARDINAL civilians from the village , burning QUANTITY of them \u2013 including QUANTITY women , one in the final stages of pregnancy \u2013 alive in the process . They also burnt down CARDINAL farms .", "By attacking those CARDINAL civilians from the village of PERSON , who had not taken part in the fighting , by stealing their weapons and killing them , PERSON and the NORP under his command ... committed an appalling violation of the laws and customs of war as set out in :", "\u2013 point ( b ) of the first paragraph of LAW [ ( IV ) ] of [ DATE respecting ORG , which is binding on all civilised nations and forbids the treacherous killing or wounding of members of the civil population ; LAW [ of the DATE LAW ( IV ) ] , which prohibits attacks by whatever means of villages , dwellings or buildings which are undefended ; and the first paragraph of LAW [ of LAW ( IV ) ] , which lays down that family honour and rights , and the lives of persons and private property must be respected .", "\u2013 LAW , point ( a ) , of LAW [ ( IV ) ] of CARDINAL DATE relative to ORG in Time of War ... , which lays down that persons taking no active part in the hostilities must not be subjected to violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture ; point ( d ) [ of the same paragraph ] , which provides ... that the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognised as indispensable by civilised peoples is prohibited ; Article CARDINAL , which prohibits murder , torture and all other brutality against protected persons ; and Article CARDINAL , which provides that no protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed and prohibits collective penalties and all measures of intimidation , pillage and reprisals against protected persons and their property .", "\u2013 Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the [ First ] LAW to the [ LAW and relating to ORG adopted on DATE ... , which lays down that the civilian population as such , as well as individual civilians , shall not be the object of attack and prohibits acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population ; [ LAW , point ( a ) , which prohibits indiscriminate attacks not directed at a specific military objective ; [ LAW , which prohibits attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals ; LAW , point ( a ) ... , which prohibits violence to the life , health , or physical or mental well - being of persons , in particular , murder , torture of all kinds , whether physical or mental , and mutilation ; and [ LAW ] point ( d ) , which prohibits collective punishments .", "By acting with particular cruelty and brutality and burning a pregnant villager alive ... , PERSON and his Partisans openly flouted the laws and customs of war set out in the first paragraph of LAW DATE ] LAW [ ( IV ) ] ... , which lays down that expectant mothers shall be the object of particular protection and respect .", "Likewise , by burning down the [ dwelling ] houses and other buildings belonging to the villagers ...

Punishments were also specified .", "CARDINAL . In the Hostages ( Wilhelm List ) case , the accused were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War relating mainly to the institution of a scheme of reprisal killings in occupied territory and to the summary execution of NORP troops after they surrendered .

As regards military necessity , the judgment noted as follows :", "\u201c Military necessity permits a belligerent , subject to the laws of war , to apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time , life and money . In general , it sanctions measures by an occupant necessary to protect the safety of his forces and to facilitate the success of his operations . It permits the destruction of life of armed enemies and other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war ; it allows the capturing of armed enemies and others of peculiar danger , but it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill . The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war . Destruction as an end in itself is a violation of international law . There must be some reasonable connection between the destruction of property and the overcoming of the enemy forces . \u201d", "CARDINAL . While the ORG had to admit that the absence of a formal declaration of war between GPE and GPE created grave doubts as to whether the executed NORP officers would have been entitled to \u201c prisoner of war \u201d status , it looked beyond this fact to find that their summary execution was \u201c unlawful and wholly unjustified \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

These included prosecutions before NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP and NORP military and civilian courts .

Certain judgments stressed the legitimate referral of a domestic tribunal to the international laws and customs of war and referred to rules concerning the unnecessary destruction of civilian property , the unlawful wearing of an enemy uniform and individual command responsibility .", "CARDINAL .
