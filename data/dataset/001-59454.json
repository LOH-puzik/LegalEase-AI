The complaints raised in this application arise out of the NORP military operations in northern GPE in DATE and DATE and the continuing division of the territory of GPE . At the time of the ORG 's consideration of the merits of the PERSON v. GPE case in DATE , the NORP military presence at the material time was described in the following terms ( PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( merits ) , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VI , p. CARDINAL , LAW DATE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP armed forces of more than QUANTITY personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern GPE , which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication . The army 's headquarters are in GPE . ORG is based in PERSON ( PERSON ) with its sector covering GPE to the PERSON Milia suburb of GPE and with CARDINAL personnel . ORG , with CARDINAL personnel , is based at GPE village , and its sector ranges from GPE village to GPE . ORG ( NORP Forces in GPE under LAW ) is stationed at GPE near GPE , with a sector running from FAC to LOC . A NORP naval command and outpost are based at GPE and PERSON respectively . NORP airforce personnel are based at PERSON , PERSON and other airfields . The NORP airforce is stationed on the NORP mainland at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to NORP military courts , as stipulated so far as concerns ' GPE citizens ' by ORG of DATE ( section CARDINAL ) and LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A major development in the continuing division of GPE occurred in DATE with the proclamation of the \u201c GPE \u201d ( the \u201c LOC \u201d ) and the subsequent enactment of the \u201c LAW \u201d on DATE .", "This development was condemned by the international community . On DATE ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the \u201c GPE \u201d legally invalid and calling upon all GPE not to recognise any ORG other than GPE . A similar call was made by ORG on DATE in its LAW ( DATE ) . In DATE ORG decided that it continued to regard the government of GPE as the sole legitimate government of GPE and called for respect of the sovereignty , independence , territorial integrity and unity of GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the respondent Government , the \u201c TRNC \u201d is a democratic and constitutional ORG which is politically independent of all other sovereign GPE including GPE , and the administration in northern GPE has been set up by the NORP - NORP people in the exercise of its right to self - determination and not by GPE . Notwithstanding this view , it is only the NORP government which is recognised internationally as the government of GPE in the context of diplomatic and treaty relations and the working of international organisations .", "CARDINAL . ORG peacekeeping forces ( \u201c UNFICYP \u201d ) maintain a buffer - zone . A number of political initiatives have been taken at the level of ORG aimed at settling the GPE problem on the basis of institutional arrangements acceptable to both sides . To this end , inter - communal talks have been sponsored by the Secretary - General of ORG acting under the direction of ORG . In this connection , the respondent Government maintain that the NORP - Cypriot authorities in northern GPE have pursued the talks on the basis of what they consider to be already agreed principles of bi - zonality and bi - communality within the framework of a federal constitution . Support for this basis of negotiation is found in the ORG Secretary - General 's Set of Ideas of DATE and the ORG resolutions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE confirming that a federal solution sought by both sides will be \u201c bi - communal \u201d and \u201c bi - zonal \u201d .", "Furthermore , and of relevance to the instant application , in DATE ORG on Missing Persons ( \u201c CMP \u201d ) was set up to \u201c look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter - communal fighting as well as in the events of DATE and afterwards \u201d and \u201c to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities , specifying as appropriate whether they are still alive or dead , and in the latter case approximate times of death \u201d . The ORG has not yet completed its investigations .", "CARDINAL . The events of DATE and DATE and their aftermath gave rise to CARDINAL previous applications by the applicant Government against the respondent ORG under former LAW . The first ( no . CARDINAL ) and second ( no . CARDINAL ) applications were joined by the ORG and led to the adoption on DATE of a report under former LAW ( \u201c the DATE report \u201d ) in which the ORG expressed the opinion that the respondent ORG had violated ORG , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL . On DATE ORG turn adopted , with reference to an earlier decision of DATE , ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL in which it expressed , inter alia , the conviction that \u201c the enduring protection of human rights in GPE can only be brought about through the re - establishment of peace and confidence between the CARDINAL communities ; and that inter - communal talks constitute the appropriate framework for reaching a solution of the dispute \u201d . In its resolution ORG strongly urged the parties to resume the talks under the auspices of the Secretary - General of ORG in order to agree upon solutions on all aspects of the dispute ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG viewed this decision as completing its consideration of the case .", "The third application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged by the applicant Government was the subject of a further report under former DATE adopted by ORG on DATE ( \u201c the DATE report \u201d ) . In that report the ORG expressed the opinion that the respondent ORG was in breach of its obligations under LAW No . CARDINAL . On DATE ORG CARDINAL ) CARDINAL in respect of the ORG 's DATE report . In its resolution ORG limited itself to a decision to make the DATE report public and stated that its consideration of the case was thereby completed .", "CARDINAL . The instant application is the first to have been referred to the ORG . The applicant ORG requested ORG in their memorial to \u201c decide and declare that the respondent ORG is responsible for continuing violations and other violations of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention and of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL \u201d .", "These allegations were invoked with reference to CARDINAL broad categories of complaints : alleged violations of the rights of NORP - Cypriot missing persons and their relatives ; alleged violations of the home and property rights of displaced persons ; alleged violations of the rights of enclaved NORP in northern GPE ; alleged violations of the rights of NORP and the Gypsy community in northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers it appropriate at this stage to summarise the ORG 's findings of fact in respect of the various violations of the ORG alleged by the applicant Government as well as the essential arguments advanced by both parties and the documentary and other evidence relied on by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant Government essentially claimed in their application that CARDINAL NORP Cypriots were still missing DATE after the cessation of hostilities . These persons were last seen alive in NORP custody and their fate has never been accounted for by the respondent State .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government maintained in reply that there was no proof that any of the missing persons were still alive or were being kept in custody . In their principal submission , the issues raised by the applicant Government should continue to be pursued within the framework of ORG on Missing Persons ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) rather than under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The Commission proceeded on the understanding that its task was not to establish what actually happened to the NORP - Cypriot persons who went missing following the NORP military operations conducted in northern GPE in DATE and DATE . Rather , it saw its task as CARDINAL of determining whether or not the alleged failure of the respondent State to clarify the facts surrounding the disappearances constituted a continuing violation of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . To that end , the ORG had particular regard to its earlier findings in its DATE and DATE reports . It recalled that in its DATE report it had stated that it was widely accepted that a considerable number of NORP were still missing as a result of armed conflict in GPE and that a number of persons declared to be missing were identified as NORP Cypriots taken prisoner by the NORP army . This finding , in the ORG 's opinion at the time , created a presumption of NORP responsibility for the fate of persons shown to be in NORP custody . While noting that killings of NORP - Cypriot civilians had occurred on a large scale , the ORG also considered at the time of its DATE report that it was unable to ascertain whether , and under what circumstances , NORP - Cypriot prisoners declared to be missing had been deprived of their life .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the ORG further recalled that in its DATE report it found it established that there were sufficient indications in an indefinite number of cases that missing NORP Cypriots had been in NORP custody in DATE and that this finding once again created a presumption of NORP responsibility for the fate of these persons .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in NORP or NORP - Cypriot custody . In this connection , the Commission had regard to the following : a statement of Mr PERSON , \u201c President of the NORP \u201d , broadcast on DATE , in which he admitted that CARDINAL NORP - Cypriot prisoners were handed over to NORP - NORP fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to GPE ; the broadcast statement of Professor PERSON , a former NORP officer who had served in the NORP army at the time and participated in the DATE military operation in GPE , in which he suggested that the NORP army had engaged in widespread killings of , inter alia , civilians in so - called cleaning - up operations ; ORG submitted to ORG in DATE indicating , inter alia , that NORP and NORP - Cypriot soldiers rounded up NORP - Cypriot civilians in the village of PERSON on DATE and took away males over DATE , most of whom were reportedly killed by NORP - NORP fighters ; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the ORG 's earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by NORP soldiers or NORP - Cypriot paramilitaries .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that , notwithstanding evidence of the killing of NORP - Cypriot prisoners and civilians , there was no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which the respondent ORG could be held responsible ; nor did the ORG find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by the respondent ORG . On the other hand , the ORG found it established that the facts surrounding the fate of the missing persons had not been clarified by the authorities and brought to the notice of the victims ' relatives .", "CARDINAL . The Commission further concluded that its examination of the applicant ORG 's complaints in the instant application was not precluded by the ongoing work of the ORG . It noted in this connection that the scope of the investigation being conducted by the ORG was limited to determining whether or not any of the missing persons on its list were dead or alive ; nor was the ORG empowered to make findings either on the cause of death or on the issue of responsibility for any deaths so established . Furthermore , the territorial jurisdiction of the ORG was limited to the island of GPE , thus excluding investigations in GPE where some of the disappearances were claimed to have occurred . ORG also observed that persons who might be responsible for violations of the Convention were promised impunity and that it was doubtful whether the ORG 's investigation could extend to actions by the NORP army or NORP officials on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . The Commission established the facts under this heading against the background of the applicant ORG 's principal submission that CARDINAL displaced NORP Cypriots and their children continued to be prevented as a matter of policy from returning to their homes in northern GPE and from having access to their property there for any purpose . The applicant Government submitted that the presence of the NORP army together with \u201c TRNC\u201d-imposed border restrictions ensured that the return of displaced persons was rendered physically impossible and , as a corollary , that their cross - border family visits were gravely impeded . What started as a gradual and continuing process of illegality over DATE had now resulted in the transfer of the property left behind by the displaced persons to the \u201c TRNC \u201d authorities without payment of compensation and its re - assignment , together with \u201c title deeds \u201d , to ORG bodies , NORP Cypriots and settlers from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government maintained before the ORG that the question of the LOC district of LOC along with the issues of freedom of movement , freedom of settlement and the right of property could only be resolved within the framework of the inter - communal talks ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on the basis of the principles agreed on by both sides for the conduct of the talks . Until an overall solution to the GPE question , acceptable to both sides , was found , and having regard to security considerations , there could be no question of a right of the displaced persons to return . The respondent Government further submitted that the regulation of property abandoned by displaced persons , as with restrictions on cross - border movement , fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the \u201c GPE \u201d authorities .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that it was common knowledge that with the exception of CARDINAL NORP living in the NORP area and NORP living in the NORP peninsula , the whole NORP - Cypriot population which before DATE resided in the northern part of GPE had left that area , the large majority of these people now living in southern GPE . The reality of this situation was not contested by the respondent Government .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted with reference to its earlier findings in its DATE and DATE reports that there was no essential change in the situation obtaining at the time of the introduction of the instant application . Accordingly , and this was not disputed either by the respondent Government , displaced NORP Cypriots had no possibility of returning to their homes in northern GPE and were physically prevented from crossing into the northern part on account of the fact that it was sealed off by the NORP army . The arrangements introduced by the \u201c LOC \u201d authorities in DATE to allow NORP and NORP to cross into northern GPE for the purposes of family visits or , as regards NORP Cypriots , visits to LOC , did not affect this conclusion .", "CARDINAL . Nor did the respondent Government dispute the fact that NORP - Cypriot owners of property in northern GPE continued to be prevented from having access to , controlling , using and enjoying their property . As to the fate of that property , the ORG found it established that up until DATE there was an administrative practice of the NORP - Cypriot authorities to leave the official ORG unaffected and to register separately the \u201c abandoned \u201d property and its allocation . The beneficiaries of allocations were issued with \u201c possessory certificates \u201d but not \u201c deeds of title \u201d to the properties concerned . However , as from DATE the practice changed and thereafter \u201c title deeds \u201d were issued and the relevant entries concerning the change of ownership were made in ORG . The ORG found it established that , at least since DATE , the NORP - Cypriot authorities no longer recognised any ownership rights of NORP Cypriots in respect of their properties in northern GPE . The ORG found confirmation for this finding in the provisions of \u201c LAW ( b ) of LAW \u201d of CARDINAL DATE and \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d purporting to give effect to that provision .", "CARDINAL . Although the respondent Government pointed out in their submissions to the ORG that the issue of the right of displaced NORP Cypriots to return to their homes was a matter to be determined within the framework of the inter - communal talks sponsored by the Secretary - General of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Commission found that there had been no significant progress in DATE in the discussion of issues such as freedom of settlement , payment of compensation to NORP Cypriots for the interference with their property rights , or restitution of NORP - Cypriot property in the Varosha district .", "CARDINAL . The applicant Government adduced evidence in support of their complaint that the dwindling number of NORP living in the NORP peninsula of northern GPE were subjected to continuing oppressive treatment which amounted to a complete denial of their rights and a negation of their human dignity . In addition to the harassment and intimidation which they suffered at the hands of NORP settlers , and which has gone unpunished , the enclaved NORP laboured under restrictions which violated many of the substantive rights contained in the Convention . The continuous DATE interferences with their rights could not be redressed at the local level on account of the absence of effective remedies before the \u201c GPE \u201d courts . Similar but less extensive restrictions applied to the NORP population living in the NORP area of northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government maintained before the ORG that effective judicial remedies were available to all NORP Cypriots living in northern GPE . However , they claimed that the applicant Government actively discouraged them from taking proceedings in the \u201c TRNC \u201d . The respondent Government further submitted that the evidence before the Commission did not provide any basis of fact for the allegations made .", "CARDINAL . The Commission established the facts under this heading with reference to materials submitted by both ORG . These materials included , inter alia , written statements of persons affected by the restrictions alleged by the applicant Government ; press reports dealing with the situation in northern GPE ; case - law of the \u201c NORP \u201d courts on the availability of remedies in the \u201c GPE \u201d ; \u201c GPE legislation \u201d and decisions of the \u201c ORG \u201d on entry and exit arrangements at FAC check - point . ORG also had regard to ORG documents concerning the living conditions of enclaved NORP and especially to the ORG Secretary - General 's progress reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE on the humanitarian review carried out by ORG in DATE concerning the living conditions of ORG , the so - called \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG 's delegates heard the evidence of CARDINAL witnesses on the situation of NORP Cypriots and NORP living in northern GPE . These witnesses comprised CARDINAL persons who were closely associated with the preparation of the \u201c PERSON Brief \u201d as well as persons proposed by both ORG . The delegates also visited , on CARDINAL and DATE , a number of localities in northern GPE , including NORP - Cypriot villages in the PERSON area , and heard statements from officials and other persons encountered during the visits .", "CARDINAL . The Commission considered the above - mentioned \u201c PERSON Brief \u201d an accurate description of the situation of the enclaved NORP - Cypriot and NORP populations at about the time of the introduction of the instant application and that the proposals for remedial action recommended by ORG following the humanitarian review reflected the real needs of these groups in the face of administrative practices which actually existed at the material time . Although the ORG noted that there had been a considerable improvement in the overall situation of the enclaved populations , as evidenced by the ORG Secretary - General 's progress reports on the \u201c PERSON Brief \u201d recommendations , there still remained a number of severe restrictions . These restrictions were not laid down in any \u201c GPE legislation \u201d and were in the nature of administrative practices .", "CARDINAL . The Commission further found that there existed a functioning court system in the \u201c GPE \u201d which was in principle accessible to NORP living in northern GPE . It appeared that at least in cases of trespass to property or personal injury there had been some successful actions brought by NORP - Cypriot litigants before the civil and criminal courts . However , in view of the scarcity of cases brought by NORP Cypriots , the ORG was led to conclude that the effectiveness of the judicial system for resident NORP Cypriots had not really been tested .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a further conclusion , the Commission found that there was no evidence of continuing wrongful allocation of properties of resident NORP Cypriots to other persons during the period under consideration . However , the ORG did find it established that there was a continuing practice of the \u201c NORP \u201d authorities to allocate to NORP or immigrants the property of NORP Cypriots who had died or left northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of legal proceedings before the \u201c TRNC \u201d courts , the ORG noted that it had not been tested whether or not NORP or NORP living in northern GPE were in fact considered as citizens enjoying the protection of the \u201c LAW \u201d . It did however find it established that , in so far as the groups at issue complained of administrative practices such as restrictions on their freedom of movement or on family visits which were based on decisions of the \u201c ORG \u201d , any legal challenge to these restrictions would be futile given that such decisions were not open to review by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Although the ORG found no evidence of cases of actual detention of members of the enclaved population , it was satisfied that there was clear evidence that restrictions on movement and family visits continued to be applied to NORP Cypriots and NORP notwithstanding recent improvements . It further observed that an exit visa was still necessary for transfers to medical facilities in the south , although no fees were levied in urgent cases . There was no evidence to confirm the allegation that the processing of applications for movement was delayed in certain cases with the result that the health or life of patients was endangered ; nor was there any indication of a deliberate practice of delaying the processing of such applications .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found it established that there were restrictions on the freedom of movement of NORP - Cypriot and NORP schoolchildren attending schools in the south . Until the entry into force of the decision of the \u201c ORG \u201d of CARDINAL DATE , they were not allowed to return permanently to the north after having attained the age of DATE in the case of males and CARDINAL in the case of females . The age - limit of DATE was still maintained for NORP - Cypriot male students . Up to the age - limit , certain restrictions applied to the visits of students to their parents in the north , which were gradually relaxed . However , even DATE such visits are subject to a visa requirement and a reduced \u201c entry fee \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to educational facilities , the Commission held that , although there was a system of primary - school education for the children of NORP living in northern GPE , there were no secondary schools for them . The vast majority of schoolchildren went to the south for their secondary education and the restriction on the return of NORP - Cypriot and NORP schoolchildren to the north after the completion of their studies had led to the separation of many families . Furthermore , school textbooks for use in the NORP - Cypriot primary school were subjected to a \u201c vetting \u201d procedure in the context of confidence - building measures suggested by ORG . The procedure was cumbersome and a relatively high number of school - books were being objected to by the NORP - Cypriot administration .", "CARDINAL . Aside from school - books , the ORG found no evidence of any restrictions being applied during the period under consideration to the importation , circulation or possession of other types of books ; nor was there evidence of restrictions on the circulation of newspapers published in southern GPE . However , there was no regular distribution system for the NORP - Cypriot press in the PERSON area and no direct post and telecommunications links between the north and south of the island . It was further noted that the enclaved population was able to receive NORP - Cypriot radio and television .", "CARDINAL . The Commission did not find any conclusive evidence that letters destined for NORP Cypriots were opened by the \u201c GPE \u201d police or that their telephones were tapped .", "CARDINAL . As to alleged restrictions on religious worship , the ORG found that the main problem for NORP Cypriots in this connection stemmed from the fact that there was CARDINAL priest for the whole NORP area and that the NORP - Cypriot authorities were not favourable to the appointment of additional priests from the south . The Commission delegates were unable to confirm during their visit to the NORP area whether access to LOC was free at any time for NORP Cypriots . It appeared to be the case that on high religious holidays ( which occur CARDINAL times a year ) visits to the monastery are also allowed to NORP Cypriots from the south .", "CARDINAL . Concerning alleged restrictions on the freedom of association of the enclaved population , the ORG observed that the relevant \u201c GPE \u201d law on associations only covered the creation of associations by NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant Government contended before the ORG that NORP living in northern GPE , especially political dissidents and the ORG , were the victims of an administrative practice of violation of their Convention rights . They adduced evidence in support of their claim that these groups were victims of arbitrary arrest and detention , police misconduct , discrimination and ill - treatment and interferences in various forms with other Convention rights such as , inter alia , fair trial , private and family life , expression , association , property and education .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government essentially maintained that the above allegations were unsubstantiated on the evidence and pointed to the availability of effective remedies in the \u201c GPE \u201d to aggrieved persons .", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's investigation into the applicant ORG 's allegations was based mainly on the oral evidence of CARDINAL witnesses who testified before the ORG 's delegates on the situation of NORP and the Gypsy community living in northern GPE . The witnesses were proposed by both parties . Their evidence was taken by the delegates in GPE , GPE and GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that there existed rivalry and social conflict between the original NORP and immigrants from GPE who continued to arrive in considerable numbers . Some of the original NORP Cypriots and their political groups and media resented the \u201c LOC \u201d policy of full integration for the settlers .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , while there was a significant incidence of emigration from the \u201c TRNC \u201d for economic reasons , it could not be excluded that there were also cases of NORP Cypriots having fled the \u201c GPE \u201d out of fear of political persecution . The Commission considered that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of witnesses ' assertions that in a few cases complaints of harassment or discrimination by private groups of or against political opponents were not followed up by the \u201c GPE \u201d police . However , it concluded that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact a consistent administrative practice of the \u201c GPE \u201d authorities , including the courts , of refusing protection to political opponents of the ruling parties . In so far as it was alleged by the applicant Government that the authorities themselves were involved in the harassment of political opponents , the Commission did not have sufficient details concerning the incidents complained of ( for example , the dispersing of demonstrations , short - term arrests ) which would allow it to form an opinion as to the justification or otherwise of the impugned acts . The Commission noted that , in any event , it did not appear that the remedy of habeas corpus had been invoked by persons claiming to be victims of arbitrary arrest or detention .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the alleged discrimination against and arbitrary treatment of members of the NORP - Cypriot Gypsy community , the ORG found that judicial remedies had apparently not been used in respect of particularly grave incidents such as the pulling down of shacks near GPE and the refusal of airline companies to transport NORP to GPE without a visa .", "CARDINAL .
