GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Javier Borrego Borrego;Karel Jungwiert;Margarita Tsatsa-Nikolovska;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mrs A. ORG , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Until his emigration to GPE in DATE the applicant lived and worked in GPE ( GPE ) . When applying for benefits in GPE the applicant made differing statements as to his employment or working record in GPE . In an application to ORG ( Bundesknappschaft \u2013 hereinafter called \u201c ORG \u201d ) the applicant submitted that he had been self - employed prior to leaving GPE . Yet in an application for unemployment benefits to ORG the applicant submitted that he had been employed at the material time . In GPE the applicant collected unemployment benefits and temporary allowances ( \u00dcbergangsgeld ) . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE he had a heart attack .", "On DATE the applicant applied for an invalidity pension to ORG submitting that he had been self - employed in GPE until DATE and had made contributions to the NORP pension scheme during that time . On DATE ORG rejected his request finding that he had not contributed to the pension scheme for a sufficiently long period . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection with ORG . On DATE the Commission for Objections of ORG ( PERSON ) rejected his objection . On DATE the applicant offered to contribute retroactively ( nachentrichten ) to the pension scheme for DATE . In DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG in ORG arguing inter alia that he would be entitled to make contributions to the pension scheme retroactively for DATE .", "In DATE the court obtained information from ORG relating to the applicant \u2019s contributions to the NORP pension scheme . According to ORG the applicant had been self - employed and had contributed to the public pension scheme until DATE .", "On DATE , following a hearing , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action confirming the findings of ORG . The court noted in addition that the time - limit for contributing retroactively had elapsed .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . On DATE the court ordered the translation of NORP documents submitted by the applicant . On DATE the court requested the applicant to submit the original NORP documents .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE the court held hearings and questioned CARDINAL witnesses altogether .", "Following a change of ORG . CARDINAL as of DATE the applicant requested the application of the new legal provisions to his case .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court acknowledged that he had been invalid since his heart attack on DATE , but confirmed that he had not contributed to the pension scheme for a sufficiently long period . It recalled that according to the provisions of ORG . CARDINAL an insured would have had to contribute to the pension scheme for DATE during DATE preceding the occurrence of invalidity . That period could be extended exceptionally by taking into account previous contributions or periods during which certain benefits had been collected . Although the court took into consideration previous contributions made to the NORP pension system and periods during which the applicant had received unemployment benefits the applicant still did not reach the required minimum number of DATE . A further exceptional extension was rendered impossible because the court found that the applicant had not made contributions in respect of DATE . The court pointed out that according to ORG the applicant had only made contributions until ORG CARDINAL DATE . As regards the applicant \u2019s own submissions the court found them to be inconsistent , since he had made different statements as to his employment or working record in the past .", "Furthermore , the court had grave doubts as to whether the applicant had actually been unemployed in GPE while receiving unemployment benefits since the witnesses questioned had indicated that he had worked illicitly . In addition the applicant had carried a licence to run a bar . However , the court left that question open since the absence of contributions for DATE excluded an invalidity pension in any event . Lastly , the court held that also the application of the new legal provisions of ORG . CARDINAL would not entitle the applicant to invalidity pension . The court refused the applicant leave to appeal on points of law .", "The applicant then lodged a complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law with ORG , inter alia contesting the application of ORG . CARDINAL . The complaint reached ORG on DATE . The applicant was granted an extension of DATE of the time - limit for substantiating his complaint upon his own motion . His submissions reached the court on DATE and on CARDINAL June DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as inadmissible stating that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaints ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
