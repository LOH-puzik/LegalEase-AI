He lives in GPE with his mother , PERSON , who has acted on behalf of her under - age son in the national proceedings and in lodging an application under LAW . The applicant was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by ORG , Attorney , Attorney - ORG ) , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s father , Mr PERSON ( born in DATE ) , died in connection with his being arrested by police officers at ORG ( servicekontor ) in GPE .", "Mr PERSON had been visiting ORG to complain about the refusal of a social security allowance . The police were called as employees of the ORG had found his behaviour disturbing and threatening . Upon arrival at around TIME the officers had observed Mr PERSON inside the public area of the LOC . He had approached them and asked whether he had been responsible for their presence . After the employees in the presence of the police had given Mr PERSON an explanation for the refusal of the allowance and had informed him of the possibility to lodge an appeal , the police officers had ordered him to leave the LOC and warned him that should he fail to do so he would be arrested . The decision of CARDINAL DATE , referred to below , described the events which followed .", "Since Mr PERSON had refused to comply with the police officers repeated orders to leave the LOC , the police decided to arrest him . Police officers PERSON and PERSON had taken hold of PERSON arms in order to escort him from the building . Mr PERSON had immediately and vigorously resisted . Officer PERSON explained that when he tried to grab Mr PERSON \u2019s left hand , the latter had struck PERSON very hard in the chest with his elbow . After having tried in vain to grab Mr PERSON \u2019s left hand in order to avoid further blows , Officer PERSON jumped on Mr PERSON \u2019s back , gripped Mr PERSON by the throat using his right hand and remained in that position .", "The police officers felt that the situation was out of control and that they needed to pacify Mr PERSON , or else they or other persons in ORG might possibly get hurt .", "After Mr PERSON had circled a few times with Officer PERSON on his back and with Officer PERSON gripping his right arm , all CARDINAL had fallen to the ground in the public area of the office LOC . When falling , Officer PERSON had kept his grip around Mr PERSON \u2019s throat , and continued to do so until he and PERSON handcuffed Mr PERSON .", "Finding it undesirable and wrong to let Mr PERSON remain on the floor of where they were hindering access and movement of the many people around them , Officers PERSON and PERSON decided to take Mr PERSON outside . They had pulled him by his arms to the landing outside the front door .", "On the landing Officers PERSON and PERSON had used considerable force to keep Mr PERSON down as he was struggling hard to free himself . PERSON had used his own body weight while bending Mr PERSON \u2019s wrist in order to keep him down . Officer PERSON , standing to the right of Mr GPE , had pushed him to the ground .", "When Officer PERSON had arrived at the scene , he had noted that Mr PERSON had tried to free himself from PERSON and PERSON and was kicking out . Since PERSON PERSON risked kicking passers - by , Officer PERSON had tried to immobilise his feet by applying a so - called leglock ( benl\u00e5s ) . He had been prevented by PERSON PERSON from doing so since the latter was trying to get up and was kicking Officer PERSON", "While on the landing , Mr PERSON had screamed loudly and repeatedly . After struggling for a while he had calmed down completely . He had fainted and had been placed in a lateral position . The officers had ensured that he could breath .", "At TIME Officer B reported that Mr PERSON \u2019s resistance had been so vigorous that he had fainted and that he had had to call an ambulance . At TIME the officers reported that they would bring Mr PERSON by police van to FAC . In view of the location of the nearest ambulance , it was felt that the police vehicle ( of which Officer PERSON was the driver ) could transport Mr PERSON to the hospital as fast , or even faster , than an ambulance . Mr PERSON was placed on the floor of the police cell at the rear end of the vehicle . Because of its restricted space , QUANTITY in length , his knees were bent upwards . The journey took TIME . Upon arrival at the hospital , a nurse and a doctor detected a weak pulse in Mr PERSON \u2019s throat . Medical appliances were connected to Mr PERSON \u2019s body and it was established that his heart had stopped .", "ORG hereinafter referred to as GPE ) carried out an investigation of the CARDINAL police officers of PERSON Police District who had taken part in Mr PERSON \u2019s arrest . The investigation was based on suspicion of offences having been committed under LAW , second alternative , ( bodily infringement resulting in death ) of LAW , Article CARDINAL alternative ( bodily injury resulting in death ) , Article CARDINAL ( manslaughter committed by negligence ) and LAW aggravated neglect in the performance of official duties ) . None of the officers was indicted . On DATE ORG decided to discontinue ( henlegge ) the proceedings . As regards the CARDINAL officers who had been in contact with Mr PERSON , the decision was based on the state of the evidence ; regarding the fourth officer , the decision to discontinue had been taken on the ground that no criminal offence had been proved .", "The deceased \u2019s next - of - kin , including the applicant , complained about the above decision to ORG ) . They disputed that it had been necessary for the police to restrain Mr PERSON and to do so in the manner they did , notably by means of a strangulation grip around his throat , placing him on his stomach while exerting considerable pressure on his back , holding his head and legs and handcuffing him . They further complained of the ORG omission to carry out life - saving measures when they realised that he was unconscious . The plaintiffs moreover complained about the procedure , namely that the first CARDINAL police officers had been represented by the same lawyer and had been interrogated at intervals , enabling them to coordinate their versions of events . They also requested that further evidence be obtained on officer PERSON \u2019s previous use of strangulation grips . They asserted that on CARDINAL previous occasions officer PERSON had used a strangulation grip when arresting a coloured person , once in the so - called \u201c GPE case \u201d , and on another occasion when arresting an NORP , which had led to police misconduct complaints being filed against him . On CARDINAL occasions he had used strangulation grips \u201c in a dramatic way \u201d .", "The Director of Public Prosecutions requested ORG to take further investigative measures with a view to clarifying certain matters that could be of importance for the assessment of whether a criminal offence had been committed by the police \u201c in a situation that had ended tragically in PERSON PERSON \u2019s death \u201d .", "On DATE ORG , after having taken the measures requested , reported back to ORG . In this connection the ORG provided particulars of the QUANTITY police misconduct complaints referred to above and stated that it could not be concluded that ORG had previously used strangulation grips \u201c in a dramatic manner \u201d . In the GPE case ORG had not found proof of unlawful or excessive use of force . In the other case , the arrestee had allegedly experienced breathing problems due to pressure being applied to his chest after being placed on the ground . PERSON had conceded that he had gripped him around his neck . ORG had in that case upheld the decision to drop the complaint against ORG , finding that no more force had been used than had been required by the situation . ORG also provided details of a third complaint where the case had been dropped as no criminal offence had been proved .", "ORG concluded that no weight could be attached to earlier complaints against ORG , including those instances where he might have gripped an arrestee around the throat or neck , in the assessment of whether ORG could be held criminally liable in the present case . The information did not appear to have any significance for the assessment of the facts in the present case and in the Special Unit \u2019s view no clear behavioural pattern on V.s part emerged from this information regarding the use of force against persons from a minority background . The use of force appeared on the whole to have been situational . The number of complaints had to be seen against the background of the fact that over a long period he had been assigned to operational service . It should also be emphasised that the complaints against ORG seemed to have been dealt with sufficiently thoroughly and had been dropped .", "ORG also considered previous complaints against officer PERSON but found none of these to be relevant . It informed ORG that no previous police misconduct complaints had been made against officers PERSON and H.", "In his final comments of CARDINAL DATE on the supplementary investigative measures taken by ORG , the applicant did not specifically address the latter \u2019s findings regarding previous police misconduct cases .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "By way of a preliminary observation he endorsed ORG findings that the information obtained about previous police misconduct complaints was not capable of shedding light on the sequence of events and the question of guilt in the present case . He found inter alia as follows .", "A combination of factors had caused Mr PERSON \u2019s death . To all appearances his death had occurred as a result of asphyxia and his reactions to this . The asphyxia had been caused by PERSON own efforts when resisting arrest , combined with breathing problems when pressure had been exerted on his throat and , not least , with his having been placed by the police on his stomach for a certain period of time and being subjected to the use of force by the police while in this position .", "Forensic experts had documented the fact that restraining agitated persons by placing them on their stomach entailed a risk of positional asphyxia ( leiebetinget kvelning ) . This position could hinder movements in the chest and could over time lead to a dramatic reduction in lung capacity , heart palpitation frequency , blood pressure and blood volume , and could lead to death if the person \u2019s craving for oxygen or oxygen deficit was not compensated in time . There had been reason to believe that the factors described had played a significant role in Mr PERSON \u2019s death .", "The circumstances surrounding the arrest were obviously not such as would have justified the use of methods that could have put Mr PERSON \u2019s life in danger . A central question was whether the officers could or ought to have been aware of the possibility that placing him on his stomach together with the other means of restraint used could lead to Mr PERSON \u2019s death .", "The Director of Public Prosecutions found it beyond doubt that neither the police officers involved nor the S\u00f8r - Tr\u00f8ndelag Police District had known of the dangers of restraining persons by placing them on their stomach on the ground . Nor had employees of ORG or of ORG possessed such knowledge prior to the present case . Awareness of the risk had not been particularly widespread among health personnel either .", "ORG had reported that the type of restraint at issue had been standard procedure for the arrest of obstructive persons . ORG students had been taught that every person arrested , if placed on the ground , should end up flat on the stomach and that the person was to be immobilised by inter alia bending his arms and shoulders from this position . Accordingly , the officers who had put Mr PERSON on his stomach in this position had applied the method which they had been taught to use in such situations .", "Even though ORG and ORG practices had been deficient with regard to the collection of information about the risks involved in using the impugned restraining method , ORG found no ground for qualifying the omissions as gross neglectNorwegian ORG and ORG liable pursuant to LAW . In making this assessment , regard had been had to the submission by medical experts that knowledge about the dangers of asphyxiation connected with the relevant restraint measures had not been particularly widespread among health personnel .", "The Director of Public Prosecutions emphasised that he presumed that ORG would quickly place all relevant material at the disposal of ORG and ORG so as to promote education , training and the dissemination of information as well as the introduction of central directives and control measures for preventing asphyxiation caused by the position of the arrestee during arrest . The ORG would presumably review Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE in light of the experience gained from the present case and consider whether it sufficiently fulfilled the need to have directives on situations in which restraining a person by placing him on the stomach could be justified , the length of time a person could be kept in such a position and , not least , checking the situation of the arrestee during and after his being kept in such a position . Of central importance was the further elaboration of guidelines on the manner in which continuous checking of the arrestee \u2019s situation was to be carried out and on how to move rapidly to other less dangerous methods while maintaining the necessary control .", "In the course of DATE and DATE of DATE several attempts were made on behalf of the deceased \u2019s children to obtain compensation from the ORG but to no avail .", "On DATE the applicant and another son of the deceased , Mr Prince PERSON , born in DATE and resident in GPE , GPE , instituted civil compensation proceedings against the ORG before ORG . They claimed compensation for loss of their father \u2019s financial support and for non - pecuniary damage under , respectively , sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE .", "On DATE the Parliamentary Ombudsperson ( Civil Matters ) gave of his own motion an opinion ( case DATE ) on PERSON death and on the issue of responsibility for police practices in respect of techniques of use of force on arrest , in particular restraining a person by placing him on the stomach . The PERSON endorsed ORG and ORG findings mentioned above . After carrying out a detailed review of the ORG \u2019s case - law in relation to LAW , he observed that the question whether at the time of Mr PERSON \u2019s death the NORP authorities ought to have been aware of the risk of death as a result of placing an arrestee on the stomach , depended on a concrete assessment of the circumstances . Among other factors , regard ought to be had to whether the police officer had done all that could reasonably be expected to reduce the risk , bearing in mind the seriousness of the risk , its probability and immediacy , whether it was for the ORG to assess the risk and the vulnerability of the victim .", "Considering the matter as a whole , the ORG found that GPE had not sufficiently complied with its obligations under LAW the use of restraint by placing the arrestee on the stomach upon arrest . The ORG ought to have been aware of the health hazards involved in the use of this technique . Such knowledge would have provided the requisite basis for regulating its use and ensuring adequate training of the police with a view to avoiding loss of life or serious injury . Against the background of the information available regarding the dangers of restraining a person by placing him on the stomach , it would not have entailed an excessive burden for the NORP authorities to acquire by the time of PERSON PERSON \u2019s death the necessary knowledge about the health hazards of the technique . The necessary knowledge could have been acquired without considerable expense .", "The NORP authorities\u2019 lack of knowledge appeared to have been caused by deficient practices for updating medical and police knowledge about techniques of arrest . The risks accompanying restraint of an arrestee by placing him on the stomach could clearly have been reduced if the ORG had been aware of such risks , and death resulting from using this technique could have been avoided .", "The responsibility for violation of the obligations to protect human rights lay with the ORG . This followed directly from public international law and was stated expressly in LAW . In this connection it was unnecessary to consider further where to place the responsibility for the violation of LAW . In light of the information provided by ORG it seemed that the principal responsibility for the lack of regulation of the use of the impugned restraint method lay primarily with ORG . However , this case also showed that ORG had failed in its role by not developing and updating techniques of arrest for the purposes of training .", "On DATE - that the PERSON issued his opinion , the ORG concluded a friendly - settlement agreement with the applicant and his brother . By virtue of this agreement , the applicant was to be paid ORG MONEY ( and his brother NOK CARDINAL ) in respect of their above - mentioned compensation claims and payment of these amounts was to constitute \u201c full and final settlement of any claim against the ORG in connection with Mr PERSON death \u201d . The proceedings before ORG were discontinued .", "On DATE the Registry invited the applicant to clarify whether in light of the above friendly - settlement agreement he wished to maintain his application to the ORG . On DATE his lawyer replied in the affirmative , pointing out that the agreement had settled the financial aspects of the case but did not imply that the ORG accepted criticism or acknowledged responsibility for PERSON death or a human rights violation in this respect .", "On DATE , the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated decided , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of ORG , that notice of the application should be given to the Government of GPE and that the Government should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case .", "On DATE the Government \u2019s observations of CARDINAL DATE were transmitted to the applicant \u2019s representative , who was requested to submit any observations together with any claims for just satisfaction in reply by QUANTITY DATE . The applicant did not respond .", "By a letter dated DATE , sent by registered post , the applicant \u2019s representative was notified that the period allowed for submission of the applicant \u2019s observations had expired on CARDINAL DATE and that no extension of time had been requested . The applicant \u2019s representative \u2019s attention was drawn to LAW ( a ) of the LAW , which provides that the ORG may strike a case out of its list of cases where the circumstances lead to the conclusion that the applicant does not intend to pursue the application .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative replied enclosing a letter to the ORG dated DATE ( which had not been received ) . It stated that the applicant had \u201c no further comments to the application \u201d , that he agreed with the respondent ORG that the parties had settled the financial dispute , that there was no financial loss in the case and that \u201c due to the amicable settlement of the case the ORG did not admit [ to ] any responsibility for the death of PERSON . \u201d The settlement agreement had not covered his legal costs incurred in the LAW proceedings . He would therefore maintain his application .", "The applicant submitted large quantities of documents relating to a number of previous complaints of police misconduct , involving allegations of excessive use of force , filed with a former police complaints authority \u2013 ORG ( ORG s\u00e6rskilte etterforsknngsorgan ) - notably against officers PERSON and PERSON This included the so - called \u201c GPE case \u201d where Officer PERSON had been charged for swearing ( \u201c svarte faen \u201d \u2013 normally meaning \u201c bloody hell \u201d , literally \u201c black devil \u201d ) in the presence of a coloured woman , perceived by her as a racist attack , but had been acquitted by ORG in DATE finding that it had been a spontaneous reaction to his having been bitten by the woman . PERSON had been expressing his frustration and his remark had not been specifically aimed at the woman or linked to the colour of her skin . The investigation into the woman \u2019s complaints of excessive use of force was apparently dropped on the ground of the state of the evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
