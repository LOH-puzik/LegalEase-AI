NORP The applicant in the first case , PERSON ( the first applicant ) , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr D. L\u00e1z\u00e1r , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant in the second case , Mr L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Vidovics ( the second applicant ) , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG also by PERSON , acting in that case on behalf ORG , a consumer protection association .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the cases , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE both applicants took out mortgages from NORP commercial / mortgage banks . Their loan agreements were denominated in GPE . According to the terms of the agreements , the applicants were to bear the risk of any exchange rate fluctuations between the NORP forint and MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted that her loan agreement had not contained all the information required by law , to be exact , that provisions on a particular cost element , namely that of \u201c currency spreads \u201d ( the practice of applying the \u201c sell rate \u201d when granting the loan and the \u201c buy rate \u201d for repayment ) were not indicated . Furthermore , no proper reasons had been given in the agreement to justify any unilateral modifications of the costs collected by the banks . She contended that her loan agreement had been invalid because , owing to the above - mentioned defects , it conflicted with mandatory provisions of NORP law that had been in force at the time of signing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant initiated civil proceedings against the banks , urging the court to declare her loan agreements invalid for the reasons stated above . According to the information provided by the applicant , the proceedings are suspended .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , several debtors of foreign - currency - based consumer loan agreements lodged similar actions in GPE . Due to the large number of those court cases , the GPE decided to deliver a uniformity decision in respect of the issues concerning such agreements . In its ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , it adopted a position on the unfairness of certain clauses of such consumer loan contracts . It held that the fact that , in such situations , the debtor bore the risk of currency fluctuations ( in exchange for the favourable interest rates obtained ) did not , in itself , make the agreements invalid . The unfairness of such contractual terms could be assessed and established only if the information provided by the bank on the nature of that risk was unintelligible for the average consumer . It also held that currency spreads , as provided for in the contracts , were invalid . Moreover , clauses enabling the unilateral amendment of the contracts were also invalid unless those clauses complied with certain principles laid down in the earlier no . CARDINAL ( PERSON ) Uniformity Decision of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to ensure that the principles laid down in the GPE \u2019s Uniformity Decision could be enforced directly , not only in pending litigations but also in connection with potential , non - litigated claims concerning consumer loan contracts , ORG then adopted CARDINAL pieces of legislation . Those statutes were enacted also to ensure that all foreign - currency - based loan agreements were converted into NORP forints and that settlements between the consumer and the financial institution \u2013 in respect of unlawfully collected sums from currency spreads and costs that arose from unilateral amendments \u2013 were implemented in accordance with the guidance of the GPE and with pending court actions being meanwhile put on hold .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , Act no . XXXVIII of DATE on the resolution of questions relating to the uniformity decision of the GPE regarding consumer loan agreements drawn up by financial institutions ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which entered into force on DATE , provided that currency spreads constituted invalid contractual provisions . Moreover , that there was a presumption \u2013 to be potentially refuted by the banks in separate proceedings \u2013 that clauses enabling the unilateral amendment of the contract were also invalid . This legislation prescribed that pending proceedings in respect of consumer loan agreements were to be suspended until the measures provided for in the other CARDINAL relevant pieces of legislation had been taken .", "CARDINAL . Act no . XL of DATE on the rules of settlement laid down in LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which entered into force on DATE , provided , among other things , that if a claimant wished to pursue his or her claim against the financial institution in court , he or she needed to complete the claim by itemising and quantifying the consequences of the alleged invalidity of the contract , otherwise the case would be discontinued except for those claims that related to issues not covered by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Act no . ORG of DATE on change of the currency of consumer loan agreements denominated in foreign currency ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which entered into force on DATE , provided that all foreign - currency - based loan agreements were to be converted into NORP - forint - based loans , using a defined exchange rate .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged complaints with ORG , claiming that certain provisions of LAW had violated her right to a fair trial . She argued that ORG had intervened in private - law matters by adopting the impugned legislation and that this contravened the democratic principle of separation of powers . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint , without an examination on the merits , holding that it lacked relevant reasoning and as such , was not eligible for a decision .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s pending action against the banks was suspended under LAW ; and on DATE she was invited by the court to supplement her statement of claim in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She lodged another constitutional complaint , arguing that the court \u2019s decision and LAW on which it was based were unconstitutional . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint , without an examination on the merits , holding that it concerned an interim decision rather than a final judgment and , as such , was not eligible for constitutional review .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged a complaint with ORG on DATE , claiming that certain provisions of LAW those in respect of the conversion of foreign currency into NORP forints using a defined exchange rate \u2013 were unconstitutional . He argued that ORG had intervened in private - law matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after due examination of the merits of CARDINAL of similar complaints , ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s complaint . It stated that the aims of LAW were to eliminate the continuous risk arising from exchange - rate fluctuations and to ensure that the loan agreements could remain in force between the parties . Those aims were in the interests of both debtors , such as the applicants , and creditors with stakes in the financial institutions . It held that when ORG \u2013 in the light of the critically changed situation which had occurred after the execution of the relevant loan agreements ( namely the unexpected and dramatic devaluation of the NORP forint vis - \u00e0 - vis MONEY ) \u2013 had modified the contractual terms ordering the conversion of the agreements , it had acted in the common interest of society , taking into due consideration the interest of consumers as well . The interference was thus proportionate and necessary in a NORP society . Furthermore , ORG held that there was no connection between the challenged provisions of LAW and the right to a fair trial , because the challenged provisions ( namely the conversion of loans from foreigncurrency - based loans into LANGUAGE - forint loans at a defined exchange rate ) had no impact on the pending actions regarding the alleged invalidity of the loan agreements .", "CARDINAL .
