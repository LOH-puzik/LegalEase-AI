The argument that the provisions complained of , forbidding certain NORP citizens from standing as candidates or being elected to ORG and municipal councils , discriminate against them on the basis of their political allegiance is without foundation ... The impugned provisions do not provide for a difference in treatment on the basis of an individual \u2019s political convictions ( opinions ) but for a restriction on electoral rights for having acted against the re - established democratic order after CARDINAL DATE ...", "Accordingly , ORG limited the restrictions to the degree of each individual \u2019s personal responsibility [ individu\u0101l\u0101s atbild\u012bbas pak\u0101pe ] in carrying out those ORG objectives and programmes , and the restriction on the right to be elected to ORG or to a municipal council ... is related to the specific individual \u2019s activities in the respective ... associations .", "In itself , formal membership of the above - mentioned organisations can not serve as a basis for preventing an individual from standing as candidate or being elected to ORG ...", "Consequently , the impugned provisions are directed only against those who attempted , subsequent to CARDINAL DATE and in the presence of the army of occupation , to re - establish the former regime through active participation [ ar akt\u012bvu darb\u012bbu ] ; on the other hand , they do not affect persons who have differing political convictions ( opinions ) .

In order to determine whether the measure applied , namely the restrictions on passive electoral rights , is proportionate to the objectives being pursued , namely the protection , firstly , of democratic State order and , secondly , of the national security and integrity of the NORP State , it is necessary to assess the political situation in the country and other related circumstances .
