The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the first applicant , PERSON , was the owner of a DATE newspaper , ORG . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was the editor - in - chief of the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article entitled \u201c Friends , I surely have to watch [ it ] \u201d ( \u201c PERSON mutlaka izlemeliyim arkada\u015flar \u201d ) written by PERSON was published on page CARDINAL of ORG CARDINALnd issue . It concerned a case that had caused a public outcry in GPE , namely that of FAC , a journalist who was beaten to death by the police whilst under arrest in DATE . Following the killing , ORG set up ORG in order to shed light on the murder of PERSON . On DATE the Commission published its report which contained , among other things , the names , the functions and the statements of numerous police officers , including ORG and ORG", "The above - mentioned article read as follows :", "\u201c This is what ORG said [ I surely have to watch [ it ] ] to colleagues who were making their final preparations to observe the funerals of PERSON and PERSON GPE \u2013 CARDINAL revolutionary detainees who had been killed in GPE DATE when he arrived at the newspaper office on DATE . This was an expression of his commitment and involvement in life with a great enthusiasm , which went beyond the mere love of his job .", "The difference between doing this job [ journalism ] reluctantly and doing it wholeheartedly and flawlessly was apparent in his effort to report events fully , notwithstanding the hindrances created by the police at PERSON , where he went on DATE of the events .", "Unlike his colleagues , he perceived pushing against the police barricade as the means to reach the news behind that barricade . What else was journalism for ?", "The barricade that stands in front of the reality that the people of GPE need stands in front of the journalist sometimes officially , sometimes unofficially and sometimes in the form of a gang . However , when that barricade is broken down , a dark bottomless well filled with the danger of \u201c being eliminated \u201d \u2212 to use the expression of the official ORG \u2212 is waiting in front of you to swallow you up . In DATE , CARDINAL journalists have been swallowed up by this well . The important message behind this is that we need determination to go beyond the darkness and reach the light . Or , to put it a different way , it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators ( Ya da , ba\u015fka bir deyi\u015fle , \u201c bertaraf ediciler \u201d , \u201c bertaraf \u201d edilmeden karanl\u0131ktan s\u00fcrekli ayd\u0131nl\u0131\u011fa \u00e7\u0131kmak da m\u00fcmk\u00fcn de\u011fil ) . Following ORG \u2019s death , the honest journalists of GPE , especially the young ones , thought that waiting to confront that reality was a hopeless prospect . Indeed , they thought that it was already too late . It was also like this for the country \u2019s working class who constantly encountered the police in their struggle to seek legal solutions . Moreover , ORG was CARDINAL of them . This consciousness became the driving force behind the transformation of every hearing of his trial \u2212 which was \u201c exiled \u201d , first to ORG then to GPE , with the aim of keeping it hidden from public view \u2212 into a demonstration .", "We have learnt that the murderers will be tried , and we are duty - bound to ensure the effective continuation of such proceedings . This has been the only trial involving a journalist in which the murderers were punished notwithstanding the public authorities\u2019 reluctance \u2212 which has taught us all that democracy is won not by waiting for it to appear from some place but by standing up for it . And above all , assuming that the protective ring around the former Director of ORG , ORG , who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of ORG , and around Vice - Director PERSON , who executed this order , would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles ( Metin\u2019in \u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fcyle sonu\u00e7lanan toplu g\u00f6zalt\u0131 emrini veren d\u00f6nemin GPE PERSON ile bu emri uygulayan yard\u0131mc\u0131s\u0131 K.B.\u2019\u0131n \u00fczerindeki koruma halesinin sonsuza PERSON kalaca\u011f\u0131n\u0131 d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnmek ise , her\u015feyden \u00f6nce verilen onca m\u00fccadeleye PERSON inan\u00e7s\u0131zl\u0131k olur ) .

Absolute protection from this fate requires constant and persistent monitoring . Is not one of the reasons why we are entering DATE with unsolved journalist murders the fact that those who occupy the seat and write the column of ORG at PERSON , and those who occupy the seat and write the column of PERSON at ORG , and also the newspaper of the journalist PERSON , did not make it their business to reveal the murderers and all those responsible in the first place ?", "Is there any solution other than coming after the \u201c eliminators \u201d , whilst \u201c surely watching \u201d , and removing them and their collaborators completely from our soil , in order to save ourselves from becoming a country in which gangs can behave as they please ? \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In a petition dated CARDINAL DATE the ORG lawyer argued in their defence submissions that the crime of disclosing the identities of public officials who are involved in the fight against terrorism is not committed merely by using the officials\u2019 names in connection with a case in which they have been tried as accused . The ORG lawyer maintained that the persons were already known to the public due to their positions and that their names were already in the public domain . He further contended that the ORG trial before ORG was in contravention of Articles CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to heavy fines , of MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) at the relevant time ) and GPE CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) respectively . In accordance with CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , the first - instance court also ordered the temporary closure of the newspaper for DATE . According to the brief reasons given by ORG , the following sentences from the article were sufficient to conclude that ORG and ORG had been rendered targets for terrorist organisations :", "\u201c ... it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators ...

All those following the case of PERSON will not stop coming after T. and B. , who were already guilty in people \u2019s minds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants lodged an appeal . They stated first of all that the article in question had been written on the fourth anniversary of the killing of journalist PERSON , who had been beaten to death by the police in DATE whilst in custody . The applicants argued that the purpose of the article had been to raise concern over the fact that some high - ranking officials had not been tried and that those accused in PERSON trial had still not been convicted , DATE after the death of PERSON . The applicants maintained in this respect that the CARDINAL officials concerned , namely ORG and ORG , were the ones who had given and executed the detention order which had resulted in ORG death . The applicants also pointed out that these CARDINAL officials had been the only ones in respect of whom the requests for authorisation to prosecute under PERSON no . DATE ( PERSON on the Prosecution of Civil Servants and Public Officials ) had been rejected by the Interior Minister at the material time . The names of the CARDINAL officials had therefore been mentioned in the article because of their involvement in the abovementioned events and not because of their role in the fight against terrorism . The applicants further submitted that the names of the officials had already appeared in the public domain and that the officials , being the Director and the Vice - Director of ORG , were already known to the public and thus not in a position to complain about the disclosure of their identities .", "CARDINAL . As regards the content of the article , the applicants observed that the writer of the article had defended the rule of law and the notion of justice and had not incited people to violence or advocated terrorism . According to the applicants , the article constituted a critical assessment of ORG trial and of the impunity of some high - ranking officials , as well as the challenges journalists were facing .", "CARDINAL . The applicants emphasised that the sentence \u201c And above all , assuming that the protective ring around the former Director of ORG , ORG , who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of ORG , and around Vice - Director PERSON , who executed this order , would remain in place forever , would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles \u201d had been a reference to the fact that no permission had been given under PERSON no . DATE to authorise the prosecution of the CARDINAL officials in question for their alleged criminal conduct in connection with the events surrounding ORG death .", "CARDINAL . They observed that , with the sentence \u201c ... it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators \u201d the writer of the article had highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in their struggle to seek justice . This being so , they argued that it was untenable to conclude that the writer had in any way suggested the physical elimination of the CARDINAL officials .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , they asserted that with the expression \u201c coming after \u201d the writer had obviously referred to the aftermath of PERSON trial which contributed significantly to the punishment of the accused police officers . According to the applicants , the writer had wished the cases against the CARDINAL officials to be followed up by the people of GPE with a view to bringing these officials to justice .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal application , the applicants requested that ORG hold a hearing .", "CARDINAL . They also complained about the application of Additional section QUANTITY no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .
