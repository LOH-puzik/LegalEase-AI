On DATE PERSON , who was also a candidate for ORG in elections scheduled for DATE , brought a court action against the applicant before ORG in accordance with LAW . He submitted that the newspaper of which the applicant was an editor - in - chief had published information that he had been an informant of the secret police of the former communist regime . He contended that this was false . He demanded that the applicant publicly revoke this statement and apologise for it by placing paid announcements in numerous newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared itself incompetent to deal with the matter and transmitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided that the case should be considered in ordinary contentious proceedings applicable to claims for protection of reputation under LAW and transmitted the case to ORG . Upon appeal , ORG on DATE quashed this decision as it considered that the case should be dealt with by ORG in special proceedings governed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG summoned the applicant by fax sent to his work address to attend a court hearing scheduled for DATE . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer sent a letter to the court in which he protested against the despatch of the summons to the applicant 's place of work instead of to his private address and informed the court that the applicant should be considered as not having been duly summoned . He requested that the hearing be adjourned .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the ORG summoned the applicant to adduce evidence to show that the information concerning the plaintiff PERSON and his alleged involvement with the communist secret police was true .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a power of attorney in favour of his representative and requested that the case be pursued by way of ordinary contentious proceedings as the proceedings provided for by LAW had not led to a decision on the merits within DATE period stipulated in this LAW . He requested the court to call as witnesses the former and current Ministers of Internal Affairs as well as PERSON , a well - known politician , and to request ORG to submit various documents in evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG summoned the applicant and his lawyer by notifications sent by fax to their respective work and office addresses to the hearing fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE before ORG the applicant 's lawyer was present , but the applicant was not . The court pronounced its decision on DATE . It upheld the plaintiff 's claim and ordered the applicant to publicly revoke his statements by placing relevant announcements in numerous newspapers .", "CARDINAL . In reaching this decision , ORG considered that in the proceedings in question the time - limits for serving summonses set out in LAW did not apply . The applicant 's lawyer had been aware that the proceedings had been instituted since DATE ; he had been given a power of attorney on CARDINAL DATE and had submitted the request to produce evidence on DATE . Thus , he had had enough time to prepare his arguments . The court indicated that it had requested ORG to produce the documents requested by the applicant . On DATE the Ministry had refused to do so as those documents were subject to official secrecy and could only be produced in court in criminal proceedings , in accordance with ORG . The court further observed that it could not call the witnesses proposed by the applicant ; they could only have given evidence as to whether PERSON had been put on the list of informants prepared by ORG , but not as to whether ORG had in fact been an informant . Moreover , in view of the serious nature of the allegations advanced against ORG by the applicant 's newspaper , in the absence of any documentary evidence these allegations could not have been considered proved , even if they had been confirmed by the witnesses . Thus , as the applicant had not adduced any other evidence to prove that the information concerning PERSON was true , the court found against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision , invoking , inter alia , LAW . He contended that the proceedings were null and void as neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been summoned to the hearing on DATE with CARDINAL ' notice , as provided for by LAW of LAW . Furthermore , the applicant 's interests could not be protected properly as he did not have sufficient time to prepare his arguments between the date of receipt of the summons and the date of the hearing . The applicant further argued that , as all his requests to call witnesses and evidence had been refused , he had been denied a reasonable opportunity to prove the facts essential for the merits of the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . The court considered that the complaint concerning the summons was unfounded . Both the applicant and his lawyer had been summoned DATE before the hearing , which was justified , given the special nature of the proceedings under LAW . The court recalled that , although this provision provided for such cases to be decided within TIME , failure to do so did not oblige the court to deal with the case according to the normal procedures for contentious civil proceedings laid down in the provisions of LAW . Moreover , the applicant , being aware of the special nature of the proceedings , should have expected that he might be summoned from DATE to the next and should have taken effective measures to ensure that the summons reached him in time . These considerations were especially relevant as the applicant was represented by a lawyer who was under a professional obligation to take appropriate measures to this end . In any event , the lawyer received the summons in time to appear at the hearing , even though he contended , unconvincingly , that he had learned about the date of the hearing from a journalist .", "As to the merits , the court noted that the lower court had requested the Ministry to submit documents requested by the applicant . However , this request had been refused . In the light of LAW , the refusal had to be considered lawful . Moreover , the very fact that an individual 's name had been included in the list prepared by ORG could not be deemed proof that this person had in fact been an informant . The veracity of information contained in the list had been repeatedly called into question both by interested parties and , more widely , in numerous press articles . It had been emphasised that the list had been prepared and used as a weapon in a political battle , intended to discredit the persons concerned . Therefore , the veracity of a claim that a particular person had been a police informant could not possibly be established solely on the basis of the list itself and without prior verification of the list and , in particular , without some legally established means whereby the rights of persons branded as police informants could be defended . The court accordingly considered that the burden of proof lay with the defendant , who had failed to demonstrate that , at the time of the publication of the information at issue , he had possessed sufficient evidence that ORG had been an informant as alleged .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provided that a candidate in parliamentary elections could bring a court action seeking rectification of information published about him / her during the election campaign and claiming compensation . The court was required to decide the case within TIME . The court could order the publisher of the information to rectify the information immediately and to apologise publicly to the plaintiff , if the information proved to be false or inaccurate . The court could order the defendant to pay compensation to the plaintiff . The provisions of LAW were applicable to proceedings brought before the courts on the basis of this provision .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that the person who relies on a fact relevant to his or her case bears the burden of proving that fact . Pursuant to LAW , the parties to civil proceedings are under an obligation to adduce evidence to establish the facts relevant to their claim . Under LAW , evidence can be taken as to the facts which are of relevance for the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . As regards the burden of proof , the case - law of the NORP courts in proceedings instituted on the basis of LAW was inconsistent . In certain cases the courts held that an analysis of LAW read together with the general principle of LAW led to the conclusion that the burden of proof , in cases in which the information concerning a candidate was harmful to his or her good reputation , lay on the person who had published the information in question . The courts argued that in such cases the approach taken in LAW should be followed , in that there was a presumption that attacks on the personal rights of the plaintiff were unlawful . Consequently , it fell to the defendant to prove their lawfulness , in particular by pointing out that the information published about the plaintiff , and which was deemed to be harmful to him or her , was true . Thus the plaintiff was exempted from the obligation to demonstrate that the allegations against him were untrue ( ORG , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE CARDINAL ; ORG , I Acz DATE of CARDINAL ) .", "In another decision , ORG held that the plaintiff in Article CARDINAL proceedings could not be required to adduce evidence in order to prove that something had not occurred ( ORG , I Acz CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE of CARDINAL ) . In a further case in which the court ordered the defendant to prove that statements about the candidate were true , the court emphasised that , in conformity with the principle ei incumbit probatio qui dicit , non qui negat , it was not possible to require the plaintiff to produce evidence to prove that certain facts had not occurred ( ORG , Acz CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Dec. CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , in certain decisions given on the basis of LAW , the courts held that that provision in conjunction with LAW required the plaintiff to prove that the statements contained in the contested publications were untrue ( ORG , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; ORG I Acz DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged his application with the ORG , alleging a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Commission declared the application partly admissible on CARDINAL DATE . In its report of CARDINAL DATE ( former LAW ) it expressed the opinion , by QUANTITY votes to one , that there had been no violation of LAW on account of the fact that the court refused to take all evidence proposed by the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
