POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits (Art. 6-1 inapplicable);Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON and FAC are a married couple residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By way of an administrative decision of CARDINAL DATE a property owned by the second applicant \u2019s father PERSON and located in NORP was expropriated pursuant to provisions of the DATE ORG . It was stated in the decision that GPE was the owner of this property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this decision was upheld by the Minister of Agriculture , who considered that the factual findings of the expropriation commission as to the area of the property concerned could not be called into question given that the commission was composed not only of agents of the administration , but also of political representatives .", "CARDINAL . By an on - site protocol of CARDINAL DATE a commission , established under the provisions of the DATE ORG , inspected the property and found that land situated in NORP owned by the second applicant \u2019s father PERSON consisted of QUANTITY of land , out of which QUANTITY constituted arable land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged with ORG an application to have the expropriation decision declared null and void under LAW or amended under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to ORG about the failure of the administration to rule on their DATE application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted further pleadings to that court , indicating that certain relevant documents had been found in ORG which showed that the on - site commission had wrongly calculated the surface of the property concerned in DATE . The area of the property was in fact , in the light of the newly found documents , QUANTITY of arable land . Thus , the property should not have been subject to expropriation within the framework of the agrarian reform law as it did not attain the minimum threshold of QUANTITY of arable land . The applicants further referred to an official protocol drawn up in DATE , which confirmed this finding .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the Minister of Agriculture to issue a decision concerning the applicants\u2019 application of DATE within DATE from the date of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicants informed ORG that the property in question had had a surface of QUANTITY , as shown by the protocol of CARDINAL DATE and by another document drawn up by land surveyor ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG obliged ORG to take further evidence in order to establish the legal status of the property concerned under the provisions of civil law , i.e. to determine who had been the owner of the property concerned at the time of expropriation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants objected thereto by a letter of CARDINAL DATE , pointing out that the question who had been the owner of the property in DATE in terms of substantive civil law was entirely extraneous to the administrative case which was pending before ORG . Any issues concerning the assessment of the link between the former owner of the property and the applicants from the angle of substantive civil law on inheritance was irrelevant for the administrative case , which concerned only the examination of the lawfulness of the administrative decision on expropriation . They insisted that a decision on their restitution claim be given in accordance with the judgment of ORG of DATE , which had set a DATE time limit for the authorities to do so .", "CARDINAL . They reiterated their submissions in a letter of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicants again requested that a decision be given . On DATE the applicants reiterated their request that the decision on the merits of the case be given and complained that the proceedings had remained pending for a long time . They referred again to ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the ORG stayed the proceedings on the ground that a certain GPE had submitted a request to quash the expropriation decision . She had argued that the second applicant \u2019s father PERSON was not its owner , but only its lessee . She contended that it was her father GPE , who owned the property concerned . However , she had failed to submit conclusive documents to prove it . The proceedings were therefore stayed pursuant to LAW until relevant documents had been submitted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to stay the proceedings . They reiterated their request that a decision be given and emphasised that they had remained pending since DATE . They argued that the decision to stay the proceedings had been taken in disregard of the essential substantive law elements of the case . The documents required by ORG and relating to the civil law status of the property at the time of expropriation were entirely irrelevant to the administrative case .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicants reiterated their arguments . The proceedings remain stayed . The applicants submit that all their efforts to have them resumed have been unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law no provisions have been enacted allowing specifically for the redressing of wrongs committed in connection with expropriations effected within the framework of the agrarian reform . Therefore no specific legal framework is available , enacted with the purpose of mitigating the effects of certain infringements of property rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , it is open to persons whose property was expropriated or their legal successors , to institute , under LAW , administrative proceedings in order to claim that the expropriation decisions should be declared null and void as having been issued contrary to law . In particular , a final administrative decision can be declared null and void at any time if it was issued without a legal basis , or in flagrant violation of law .", "CARDINAL . Decisions flawed as a result of lesser procedural shortcomings , listed under items CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , such as those given by an authority which lacked competence to issue a decision in a given case , or in a case which had already been decided or addressed to a person not being a party to the proceedings , can only be declared null and void if DATE have elapsed from the date on which such decisions were given . In respect of such decisions it is only possible to declare that they were issued contrary to law ; the decisions themselves remain valid .", "CARDINAL . If the flaw that taints the challenged decision is of a substantive character , i.e. if the decision had been given without a legal basis or in flagrant violation of law , the administrative authority shall declare it null and void .", "CARDINAL . A decision to declare the old decision null and void , or a refusal to do so , may ultimately be appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE LAW provides that \u201c the agrarian reform in GPE is a ORG and economic imperative and shall be realised ... pursuant to principles set forth in the manifesto of ORG \u201d .", "LAW , in so far as relevant , reads :", "\u201c The following agricultural estates shall be designated for the purposes of the agrarian reform : ...", "e ) being a property or a co - property of natural persons or legal entities , if the entire area of the estate exceeds either QUANTITY in total , or QUANTITY of arable land ...", "All real estate , referred to in items ... , e ) above shall , with no delay and without compensation , be taken over by the ORG . \u201c", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the administration is obliged to deal with cases without undue delay . Simple cases should be dealt without any delay . In cases requiring some enquiry a first - instance decision should be given in DATE . In particularly complex cases decisions shall be taken within DATE .", "CARDINAL . If the decision has not been given within those time limits , a complaint under LAW may be filed with the higher - instance authority , which shall fix an additional time limit , establish the persons responsible for the failure to deal with the case within the time - limits , and , if need be , arrange for preventive measures to be adopted in order to prevent further delays .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG was adopted , which entered into force on DATE . It created further procedures in which a complaint about the administration \u2019s failure to act could be raised .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , that court is competent to examine complaints about the administration \u2019s inactivity in administrative proceedings in cases referred to in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , if a complaint about the inactivity of an administrative authority is well - founded , the court shall oblige the competent authority to give a decision , or to carry out the factual act , or to confer or acknowledge an individual entitlement , right or obligation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law on Administrative Courts came into force , which replaced LAW and established a CARDINAL - tiered system of appeals against administrative decisions to administrative courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
