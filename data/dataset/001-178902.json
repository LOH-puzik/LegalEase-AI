He had arrived at the scene with his friends and had found PERSON lying unconscious on the floor .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel also questioned PERSON , the surgeon who had treated all CARDINAL victims at the local hospital and who explained the severity of the individual wounds sustained by the victims . The court also obtained the testimony of CARDINAL medical experts . PERSON made an assessment of the ORG individual injuries , the most likely manner in which they had been sustained , the angles of the stab wounds , and so forth . The doctor stated that ORG had sustained CARDINAL wounds to his back and a number of wounds to his chest . PERSON had been stabbed CARDINAL times from behind , CARDINAL times in the neck and on the back of the head , once to the left shoulder and once in the left side of his chest . PERSON had been stabbed in the stomach . Dr D.M.S. performed a clinical examination of \u0160.A. in order to assess his wounds in more detail .", "CARDINAL . NORP The panel also examined several documents that had been called in evidence . Medical reports relating to the applicant and his sons showed that they had sustained minor injuries , the applicant notably sustaining only a few contusions ( on the right forearm , above the left scapula and on his left eye , which remained undamaged ) . Other evidence showed that the applicant had been in a dispute over workers hired by \u0160.A. who had vacated the applicant \u2019s flat . \u0160.A. had not made a declaration of a change of residence to the competent administrative authority , although as an employer and new landlord he should have done so . Furthermore , telephone records showed that the applicant and PERSON had had CARDINAL conversations on DATE of the incident . Moreover , PERSON , the applicant \u2019s son , had called his father a number of times that day just before the fight broke out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG panel found the applicant guilty of attempting to murder PERSON , GPE and GPE by stabbing the first in the neck , on the back of the head and the left side of his chest , the second in the left side of the stomach and the third in the back . CARDINAL of the offences had been aided and abetted by the applicant \u2019s sons , who were each convicted of CARDINAL count of attempted murder . The court sentenced the applicant to DATE and DATE in prison , while his sons were both sentenced to DATE and DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL pages , the court established on the basis of the testimony , telephone and GPS data that the applicant had called ORG DATE of the attack in order to discuss the workers\u2019 change of residence , but they had been unable to resolve the matter . Consequently , the applicant had gone to the bar with a view to get the workers to sign written statements concerning their change of residence . He had asked PERSON , who had been in the bar with PERSON , to sign the statement , but he had refused . After that the applicant had again called PERSON , but to no avail . Being informed of the situation by the applicant , PERSON and GPE had joined him and they had together gone in search of ORG They had stopped GPE near the bar and the applicant had hit him in the face with the handle of the knife . PERSON had withdrawn in the direction of the bar , and had been joined by ORG , who had been informed about the attack by the telephone call from ORG A fight involving the CARDINAL men had then started , with the accused being prepared for it as they had been equipped with knives . It had finished when the applicant and his sons had left the scene and GPE had called the police .", "CARDINAL . The court found that TIME had passed between PERSON being stopped by the applicant and his sons and the call to the police , while the fight and stabbing could not have lasted TIME . In particular , the court established that GPE had received the call from \u0160e . A. at TIME second past CARDINAL in the evening and that TIME had called CARDINAL . In the meantime , he had been stabbed several times . As regards the other circumstances of the fight , such as who had hit whom , the court relied on the testimony of PERSON , PERSON , and the witnesses ORG and GPE The court , taking into account the fact that the injured parties could not have been expected to pay particular attention to what was happening to others while they themselves were engaged in the fight , found their testimony mostly consistent , except for the question of when ORG had joined the fight . The court took the view on that point that the fight had only broken out after ORG arrival , contrary to what he himself had alleged . The court further found ORG initial testimony ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to be the more persuasive of the CARDINAL , and that it was in line with the findings of the medical experts . It found that GPE had initially fought with PERSON , the applicant with PERSON , and PERSON with ORG a fact which the court found confirmed by the testimony of \u201c PERSON , PERSON , and also the witnesses ORG and GPE , and \u0160e . A. \u201d Referring to GPE \u2019s initial testimony and the applicant \u2019s statement during the investigation , which it found was also supported by \u0160e . A. \u2019s testimony , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s statement at the hearing that his knife had only had a QUANTITY blade .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the applicant \u2019s argument that he had acted in self - defence , the court found that \u201c the statements given by the accused were contradictory and refuted self - defence ... [ and ] the evidence produced at the hearing completely excluded that possibility [ of self - defence ] \u201d . The ORG found that only the defendants and the CARDINAL injured parties had engaged in the fight and that if PERSON had wanted to attack the applicant he could easily have outnumbered the defendants . The applicant and his sons had been motivated by anger towards GPE and GPE , while PERSON had become involved because he had tried to protect PERSON As the applicant had failed to convince PERSON to cancel his residence status , he had resorted to violence . If the applicant had felt that he was in danger , he could simply have walked away . Instead , he had provoked a fight , together with his sons . The court also found that while the applicant had admitted to stabbing \u0160.A. several times in the back , he and the other CARDINAL defendants had not addressed the fact that the injured parties had sustained other stab wounds too . Moreover , the court noted that none of the witnesses had testified that the applicant had lain on the floor and been kicked by the other men . The court found that since the defendants had been prepared for a fight in advance the injured parties should be believed when they stated that they had in fact been attacked and that they had responded by fighting back . It considered the injured parties\u2019 description of how they had obtained the wounds to be persuasive . Having regard to the fact that the fight was of short duration , the court found that the defendants had pulled their knives out quickly and had quickly \u201c finished with \u201d the injured parties . The court further found that as the victims had sustained CARDINAL stab wounds altogether , it was plausible that the applicant had not been the only assailant , but that all CARDINAL defendants had inflicted them . Finally , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he had pulled the knife out after being attacked by CARDINAL people as \u201c unrealistic \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment the court also explained the reasons for reading out GPE and \u0160e . A. \u2019s statements . It noted that the CARDINAL witnesses had not attended the hearing , despite being properly summoned , and that counsel for the defendants had been offered the possibility to attend their questioning during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , complaining , inter alia , that the first - instance court had violated his defence rights by relying on the record of the testimony that GPE and \u0160e . A. had given during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the higher court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . As regards the applicant \u2019s alleged inability to cross - examine GPE and \u0160e . A. at the trial , the higher court considered that the applicant had had an opportunity to question the witnesses during the investigation . It noted that counsel for the applicant had been informed about the hearing with the investigating judge , as confirmed by an acknowledgment of receipt , but had failed to attend it . According to the higher court , the defence had been aware of the notice of the possibility to participate in the questioning of witnesses during the investigation but had consciously disregarded it . Hence , it had accepted the risk that the witnesses would not be available for questioning at the trial . Moreover , the higher court considered that the applicant had failed to comply with paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as he had not substantiated in what way his inability to question the CARDINAL witnesses at the trial had undermined the legality of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court confirmed that the first - instance court had correctly applied CARDINAL of LAW by reading out the testimony given by GPE and \u0160e . A. during the investigation as the witnesses , who were foreigners , had been duly summoned to appear before the court but had refused to attend . ORG further found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provided that the investigating judge should have sent the request to attend the questioning directly to the defendants as well as to counsel . However , according to ORG , the applicant had failed to explain how that error on the part of the investigating judge had affected the legality of the impugned judgment . In ORG opinion , the error could only have affected the legality of the judgment if the first - instance court had relied on the testimony of GPE and \u0160e . A. to a decisive extent , which , however , had not been alleged in the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . ORG dismissed the complaint on DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
