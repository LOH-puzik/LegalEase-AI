THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6;Not necessary to examine Art. 13", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted at ORG , inter alia , of CARDINAL count of robbery and CARDINAL counts of burglary . The jury \u2019s decision was by a majority verdict of CARDINAL . He received a sentence of imprisonment of DATE for the robbery , and CARDINAL sentences of DATE each for the burglary offences . All CARDINAL sentences were to be served concurrently .", "The evidence against the applicant consisted of detailed oral admissions that he had allegedly made to the police concerning his involvement in the CARDINAL offences . According to the police he was questioned on CARDINAL separate occasions and contemporaneous notes were taken of his statements . However , he had declined to sign them .", "His defence during the trial was to maintain that these statements had been concocted by the police . He protested his innocence pointing out that he had not denied his numerous misdeeds in the past . The only witnesses called by the defence during the trial were the CARDINAL police officers who had interviewed him .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal against the sentence but not the conviction was granted by a single judge of ORG ) on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the substantive appeal against sentence was dismissed by the full court .", "CARDINAL . The victim of the robbery ( Miss Sizer ) which took place on DATE was a lady of DATE of age who was awakened from her sleep to find a man standing over her . Before having her hands tied behind her back and being blindfolded she was able to take a quick glance at him . She remained tied up until she was freed TIME . In a statement to the police she gave a description of the man which corresponded with the applicant and stated that she thought she would recognise him again . She was not called as a witness during the trial but her written statement was read to the jury .", "The CARDINAL counts of burglary related to separate incidents which occurred on DATE and DATE also involving the home of an elderly woman . On the latter occasion the police arrested the applicant \u2019s co - defendant in the vicinity . It was his statement to the police which led to the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant petitioned the Secretary of ORG for ORG with complaints against police officers who had investigated his case and given evidence at his trial . An independent police investigation was ordered in the course of which certain facts came to the applicant \u2019s attention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . On DATE , the applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction out of time . The police report ( the PERSON report ) , dated DATE , was delivered to ORG which directed it to ORG . The report was requested by the applicant \u2019s advisers but its disclosure was refused on the grounds of public interest immunity .", "In DATE , ORG decided that there was insufficient evidence to support criminal charges against the police officers , but recommended that disciplinary charges be brought against QUANTITY police officers . At the disciplinary hearing , on DATE , the tribunal decided that there was no case to answer and dismissed the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG for ORG referred the applicant \u2019s case to ORG ) under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( \" the CARDINAL Act \" ; see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The reference was heard on DATE and judgment delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted to ORG that the verdict should be set aside as unsafe and unsatisfactory because of certain shortcomings in the prosecution case , in particular , that certain information had been withheld by the police . At the trial one of the police witnesses had stated under cross - examination that no fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime . In fact CARDINAL fingerprints had been found which later turned out to be those of the next door neighbour who was a regular visitor to the house . The applicant had not been informed of this by the prosecution before his trial .", "It was argued by the applicant that the police officer had told lies and that his veracity as regards the admission statements was thus called into question .", "ORG rejected this submission as follows :", "\" We do not accept that interpretation of Detective PERSON evidence . We think quite plainly what he was indicating there and intended to indicate was that no fingerprints relating to either of the CARDINAL alleged burglars were discovered at the scene : neither the fingerprint of Rose nor the fingerprint of PERSON , the present appellant .", "We do not think , had the matter been carried further , it would have been demonstrated that PERSON was a person who to that extent could not be believed on his own . \"", "CARDINAL . A further shortcoming complained of by the applicant related to the fact that the police had shown CARDINAL volumes of photographs of possible burglars ( including a photograph of the applicant ) to the elderly victim of the robbery who said that she had caught a fleeting glimpse of the burglar . Her statement , read to the jury , said that she thought she would be able to recognise her assailant . Yet she did not pick out the applicant from the photographs .", "This fact was not , however , mentioned by CARDINAL of the police witnesses who had made a written statement which was read out to the jury and had not been indicated to the applicant before or during his trial . Counsel for the applicant submitted to ORG that this omission cast such doubt on the evidence of the prosecution that it might have led the jury to believe that the confession statements had indeed been \" manufactured \" by the police as the applicant alleged .", "ORG also rejected this argument :", "\" The fact that Miss PERSON had a fleeting glimpse of her assailant , and the fact that such identification as she did make was largely directed to other matters of identification rather than his features , leads us to believe that the jury would not have been influenced to act other than they did if they had the full story of the photographs and of Police Constable PERSON \u2019s activities with regard to that . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG examined other impugned shortcomings which it did not consider to cast any doubt on the verdict . It was of the opinion that , even if these matters had been investigated , it would have made no difference to the outcome .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded as follows :", "\" It is clear that there was some slipshod police work in the present case , no doubt because they took the view that here was a man who had admitted these crimes fully , and consequently there was very little need for them to indulge in a further verification of whether what he said was true . Although this is a matter which perhaps casts the police in a somewhat lazy or idle light , we do not think in the circumstances there was anything unsafe or unsatisfactory in the end about these convictions . Consequently , treating this matter as we have to according to LAW , we think this appeal fails and must be dismissed . \"", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant did not request ORG to exercise its discretionary power to rehear evidence under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) with a view , for example , to cross - examining the police officers who gave evidence at the applicant \u2019s trial . He considered that there was little prospect of such a request being granted . Nor did he request the court to order the production of the PERSON report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant took advice concerning the possibility of appealing to ORG but was informed , in an opinion of counsel dated DATE , that there were no grounds on which an appeal could successfully be pursued before ORG .", "He petitioned the Secretary of ORG for ORG on DATE without success . He is currently serving a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment following his conviction on DATE at ORG on CARDINAL counts of burglary .", "CARDINAL . Under the Attorney General \u2019s Guidelines issued in DATE , the prosecution is obliged ( subject to specified discretionary exceptions ) to disclose to the defence \" unused material \" , which includes all witness statements not enclosed in the bundle of statements served on the defence at the stage of committal of the case by ORG to ORG .", "The prosecution is also under a duty to inform the defence of any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) . Consequently where evidence of a prosecution witness is given before the court stating that the witness would recognise the accused again , and the prosecution knows that when shown a photograph of the accused the witness in fact failed to identify him , it is required to inform the defence of that fact .", "For the purpose , among others , of ensuring compliance with this duty , ORG has stated that all the statements which have been taken by the police should be put before counsel for the ORG , and that it should not be left to the police to decide which statements he is to receive ( NORP v. ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . A jury \u2019s verdict may be either unanimous or by a majority . It must be unanimous unless the trial judge , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Juries Act DATE , has directed , after TIME of unsuccessful jury deliberations , that a majority verdict will be accepted . A majority verdict will be effective if , where there are not CARDINAL jurors , CARDINAL of them agree on the verdict , or , where there are QUANTITY jurors , QUANTITY of them agree . If the jury do not agree on either a unanimous or majority verdict , they may , at the discretion of the trial judge , be discharged , but such a discharge does not amount to acquittal and the accused may be tried again by a second jury . In the event of a second jury disagreeing , it is common practice for the prosecution formally to offer no evidence .", "CARDINAL .

In relation to appeals subsequent to DATE , section CARDINAL has been amended to confer on ORG a broader basis to order a retrial .", "CARDINAL .

PERSON , judgment of ORG ) of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The approach to be adopted by ORG when considering under section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act whether a trial verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory was discussed by ORG in the context of a section CARDINAL reference in GPE v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL . PERSON , with whom the other members of ORG agreed , stated :", "\" I do not suggest that in determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory , it is a wrong approach for the court to pose the question - \u2018 Might this new evidence have led to the jury returning a verdict of not guilty?\u2019 If the court thinks that it would or might , the court will no doubt conclude that the verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory ... It would , in my opinion , be wrong for the court to say : \u2018 In our view this evidence does not give rise to any reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused . We do not ourselves consider that an unsafe or unsatisfactory verdict was returned but as the jury who heard the case might conceivably have taken a different view from ours , we quash the conviction\u2019 for ORG has , in terms , said that the court should only quash a conviction if , there being no error of law or material irregularity at the trial , \u2018 they think\u2019 the verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory . They have to decide and ORG has not required them or given them power to quash a verdict if they think that a jury might conceivably reach a different conclusion from that to which they have come . If the court has no reasonable doubt about the verdict , it follows that the court does not think that the jury could have CARDINAL ; and , conversely , if the court says that a jury might in the light of the new evidence have a reasonable doubt , that means that the court has a reasonable doubt . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that the powers under LAW of the DATE Act extend to rehearing evidence which has already been given at the trial , if this is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice . The court has also held that it has a general power under LAW ( CARDINAL ) to admit further evidence , not restricted to the circumstances set out in LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( NORP v. PERSON and others [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) . However it is unusual for ORG to exercise that power since it is reluctant to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury which has already seen and heard the relevant witness . In practice , the exercise of the power to receive evidence is thus mainly confined to fresh evidence which has arisen since the trial and which the jury did not have the benefit of hearing . No statistics are available on the frequency with which the power to rehear evidence is exercised .", "CARDINAL .
