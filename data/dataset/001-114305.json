GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the Court by Ms B. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s son was born out of wedlock in DATE . Following the marriage with the child \u2019s mother the applicant acquired joint custody ( gemeinsame Personensorge ) in DATE . In DATE the couple separated . The applicant \u2019s wife and their common son moved to another flat in DATE . However , the child stayed DATE a week with the applicant until DATE .", "On DATE the child \u2019s mother requested ORG to transfer the right to determine where the child should reside ( GPE ) to her . On DATE the applicant requested that custody of the child or , alternatively , the right to determine where the child should reside be transferred to him . On DATE the child \u2019s mother submitted an interim request to ORG to award custody provisionally to her .", "During a hearing before ORG on DATE the child \u2019s mother requested that custody of the child be transferred to her . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered a psychological expert opinion to which parent custody of the child should be transferred .", "The expert , having examined the parents and the child , submitted an expert opinion , running CARDINAL pages long , on CARDINAL DATE . The expert found that the child should reside with his mother and recommended to render a joint custody regulation provided that the parents would overcome their personal disputes by using professional assistance .", "On DATE the applicant submitted an interim request to ORG to provisionally award him the right to determine where the child should reside . During a hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant withdrew his custody request and confined his application to the right to determine the child \u2019s place of residence .", "By decision of DATE ORG granted the child \u2019s mother sole custody for the time the parties lived separately . The court held that the child had a closer emotional link with his mother and should therefore remain with her . It further found that under the present circumstances joint custody would not serve the child \u2019s benefit due to the ongoing disputes between the parents and their failure to agree on basic decisions concerning the child .", "By decision dated DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision . It expressed misgivings as to whether the parents were willing to cooperate . ORG had regard to the tensions between the applicant and his wife and considered that the parents did not appear to be able to jointly decide important questions in the child \u2019s best interest .", "By written submission to ORG dated DATE , the applicant requested to amend the custody regulation . The applicant submitted that the situation had significantly changed . The parties were now willing and able to cooperate for the child and to make common decisions . The applicant invited ORG to order joint custody in case that the pending divorce proceedings became final . He further requested ORG to appoint a guardian ad litem for the child .", "During a hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant \u2019s wife opposed the request for joint custody . During another hearing before ORG on DATE counsel of the applicant \u2019s wife declined any friendly settlement in respect of the custody regulation . Neither the applicant \u2019s wife nor their son attended this hearing .", "By judgment dated DATE ORG issued a divorce decree . Simultaneously , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to order joint custody . In this respect ORG relied on Section CARDINAL of GPE ( the \u201c LAW \u201d - see Relevant domestic law below ) and found that the applicant had failed to submit any sound reasons ( triftige GPE ) concerning the benefit of the child that might result in a change of the custody regulation .", "The applicant appealed . He pointed out , inter alia , that the custody decision was no longer up to date . The applicant submitted that the tensions had loosened against the background of the divorce proceedings and that the cooperation with the child \u2019s mother proved to be working in DATE routine . The applicant further stressed that the custody decision of ORG had been for the time of separation only and , thus , had had a temporary character . He requested ORG to order a new expert opinion and to hear the child \u2019s mother in person .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It relied on Sections CARDINAL and DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . Referring to the case law , it underlined that joint custody and sole custody did not establish a relationship of rule and exception in a way that sole custody of a parent could be regarded as ultima - ratio . The court stated that it was insufficient for an amendment of a custody decision to be compatible with the well - being of the concerned child , but rather that the advantages sought by the amendment had to clearly outweigh the inherent disadvantages . It held that the applicant \u2019s complaint did not state any sound reason for the change of the custody regulation . Even assuming the alleged practise of joint custody in DATE routine , ORG considered that in addition a shared willingness of both parents to reestablish joint custody was necessary . That in turn could not be assumed in view of the refusal of the applicant \u2019s wife to change the custody regulation . Moreover , ORG was of the opinion that the applicant could not rely on a change of the circumstances the previous custody decision had been based on , namely that the parents had abandoned their dispute during their separation on the child \u2019s upbringing and were willing to communicate . It observed that there was no indication that the child would indeed profit from joint custody and the applicant \u2019s participation in making decisions of far - reaching consequences .", "By written submission dated DATE , the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint , alleging that the courts failed to review the custody decision made during the separation phase after the divorce proceedings proprio motu . He argued that the high threshold level implied in Section CARDINAL of LAW for a change from sole custody to joint custody rendered an amendment without the consent of the other parent impossible even if joint custody was practised in everyday life . On DATE ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving further reasons .", "Pursuant to LAW of LAW the care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The state oversees the performance of this duty .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL Living apart and joint parental custody", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If parents who exercise joint parental custody , live apart for a period that is not merely temporary , each parent may apply for the family court to transfer parental custody or part of the parental custody to him alone .", "( CARDINAL ) The application is to be granted to the extent that", "CARDINAL . NORP the other parent consents , unless the child has reached the age of fourteen and objects to the transfer , or", "CARDINAL . it is to be expected that the termination of the joint parental custody and the transfer to the applicant is most conducive to the best interests of the child ( ... ) \u201d .", "( ... )", "Section CARDINAL Amendment of judicial decisions and of court - approved settlements", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The decision on the right of custody or of access or a court - approved settlement must be amended if this is appropriate for sound reasons which affect the benefit of the child in the long term .
