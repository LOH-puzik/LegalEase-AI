His body showed traces of violence . DATE , the authorities opened a pre - trial investigation on suspicion that a murder had been committed ( LAW ) .", "On DATE the authorities issued the death certificate , which stated that the cause of death had been the loss of body temperature .", "On DATE the investigator requested the ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c MRU ORG \u201d ) to establish LOC 's cause of death .", "On DATE the MRU ORG 's expert , NORP GPE , in a report ( no . MCARDINAL/CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , \u201c the first expert report \u201d ) , found that FAC 's blood alcohol level content ( BAC ) and urine alcohol level content had been CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively , which showed that , before his death , ORG had been highly intoxicated and could have died from alcohol poisoning . Given that there were no cracks in LOC skull and his inner organs had not been damaged , there was no ground to conclude that his death was the result of violence . The expert report also stated that , after sustaining the injuries , the applicant 's son could have lived for TIME and that the injuries which FAC had sustained would have amounted to a light health impairment for a living person .", "The applicant and her lawyer contacted another expert , A. PERSON , asking if he would conduct a new expert examination . On DATE that expert produced his report ( no . A - KJ-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u201c the second expert report \u201d ) , stating that the cause of ORG 's death could have been ( gal\u0117jo b\u016bti ) a severe head injury , since FAC had sustained CARDINAL blows to the head . The expert ruled out alcohol poisoning or loss of body temperature as possible causes of death .", "On DATE the prosecutors transferred the case to ORG , charging PERSON and PERSON with having lightly impaired the health of the applicant 's son , as well as offences of theft and robbery .", "On DATE ORG , on a request of the prosecutor and the applicant 's counsel , commissioned the MRU FMI to conduct a new expert examination .", "On DATE the MRU ORG 's experts , ORG and R. Sitien\u0117 , concluded their examination and presented their results in a report ( no . ORG ) , \u201c the third expert report \u201d ) , stating that ORG had died from alcohol poisoning and that there was no causal link between his death and the injuries he had sustained . Furthermore , there was no evidence that FAC had died from a loss of body temperature .", "In view of inconsistencies in the expert reports as to the cause of ORG 's death , at a hearing held on DATE the applicant asked ORG to commission the experts who had already given their reports , as well as an expert on toxicology and a neurosurgeon , to conduct CARDINAL more expert examination .", "The court dismissed the applicant 's request without giving any reasons .", "On DATE the ORG convicted PERSON and PERSON of slightly impairing the health of the applicant 's son ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) , theft ( LAW ) and robbery ( LAW ) . In so finding , the court noted that , at TIME on DATE , PERSON and PERSON , being intoxicated and with the aim of stealing from the applicant 's son , had attacked him , hitting him CARDINAL times in the area of his head , face and hands . When LOC fell , PERSON and PERSON took his jacket , wallet and CARDINAL mobile telephones , and ran away .", "PERSON and PERSON were sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "The court also granted the applicant 's claim for pecuniary damages in the amount of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "The applicant appealed , claiming that the lower court had wrongly convicted PERSON and PERSON of robbery , when they should have been convicted of manslaughter . The applicant argued , inter alia , that the trial court had restricted her right to submit evidence and make requests . Given that there were different hypotheses as to the reasons for her son 's death , she requested a supplementary expert report . However , the trial court dismissed her motion . Moreover , the trial court did not grant her request to have the experts examined at the hearing . Lastly , the applicant submitted that the first - instance court had inaccurately examined the evidence and had therefore reached wrong legal conclusions .", "In the meantime , the applicant 's counsel approached PERSON with a request that , for a second time , he determine the cause of ORG 's death . A. PERSON consented and , on DATE , produced a new report ( no . A - KI-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u201c the fourth expert report \u201d ) . The applicant 's counsel presented that report to the appellate court . The report stipulated that ORG had died from multiple head injuries . The report ruled out alcohol poisoning as a possible cause of death , finding that the third expert report had been inconclusive and unfounded .", "On DATE ORG examined the case on appeal and upheld the lower court 's judgment . The appellate court upheld the trial court 's decision not to order a new expert examination and not to summon the expert , PERSON , to the hearing , since , under domestic law , an expert is to be summoned only if the court decides that his testimony is necessary to explain or to supplement a written report . ORG also noted that the applicant 's right to take part in the criminal proceedings had not been breached , given that she had had a lawyer who had attended the hearing and had been able to put questions to the accused , the witnesses and those experts who had been present before the trial court . Moreover , upon a request by the applicant , the expert , PERSON , had prepared his second expert report . The applicant thus actively participated in the proceedings and the principle of adversarial proceedings had not been breached .", "On DATE ORG examined the applicant 's cassation appeal . Observing that the appellate court had joined the second expert report by PERSON to the case and yet had refused to analyse it without giving any grounds for such a refusal , ORG concluded that the appellate court had breached the applicant 's right to put forward evidence and take part in the investigation .", "ORG also noted that the applicant and her lawyer had asked the appellate court to summon the experts PERSON , PERSON and PERSON for questioning in open court , since they had had different views about the cause of ORG 's death . Nonetheless , the appellate court dismissed that request , again without explanation . ORG concluded that the appellate court had committed an essential breach of criminal procedure , restricting the applicant 's rights , and had failed to deal with the case thoroughly and impartially and to adopt a fair decision . The case was remitted to the court of appeal for fresh examination .", "On DATE ORG varied the trial court 's judgment . The court noted that the experts had agreed on CARDINAL essential point , namely , that the loss of body temperature had not caused ORG 's death . However , they had come to different conclusions as regards the actual cause of death . For NORP GPE , it was alcohol poisoning . For PERSON , the likely cause of death was a head injury . In view of diverging conclusions , it was necessary to elucidate which evidence was more reliable .", "The appellate court observed that , under domestic law , it was free to assess the evidence , relying on its inner belief . Expert or specialist reports had evidentiary value because they had been drafted by a person having specialist knowledge . Whilst conceding that the judges did not have such specialised competence , the appellate court nevertheless noted that the presence of contradictory evidence was not an absolute ground for a new expert examination to be conducted .", "This time , ORG analysed the evidence which had not been examined at first instance . In particular , the appellate court studied the second expert report by A. PERSON . Experts NORP GPE , PERSON , PERSON and an expert in toxicology , P. GPE , were summoned and questioned .", "The appellate court noted that the experts PERSON , PERSON and P. GPE , when questioned at the hearing , testified that GPE 's BAC had been CARDINAL , which was a lethal dose in medical theory . For the court , A. PERSON , when questioned , was not able to constructively contradict ( konstruktyviai paprie\u0161tarauti ) those expert conclusions and agreed that , had there been no sign of head injuries , the single cause of death could have been certified as alcohol poisoning .", "Given the above , the appellate court concluded that PERSON previous evaluation , dismissing alcohol poisoning as the cause of death , had to be rejected ( visi\u0161kai paneigtas ) as clearly unfounded and based on an unobjective , unilateral and tendentious evaluation of the evidence . In the opinion of the court , having examined all the material in the case file and having had recourse to all possibilities of obtaining supplementary evidence , no objective and reliable data had been established to contradict the other experts ' conclusion that ORG had died of alcohol poisoning . At the same time , there was no reliable evidence to confirm , without a doubt , a supposition that FAC had died from head injuries . Consequently , when resolving the matter of the accountability of PERSON and PERSON , the applicant 's argument that the true cause of ORG 's death had not been established and that therefore yet another expert report was necessary , was unfounded .", "The appellate court partly amended the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , reducing the applicant 's award for pecuniary damages to LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's reasoning and dismissed the applicant 's cassation appeal . It observed that the appellate court had granted the request of the applicant 's representative for the third expert report , had admitted in evidence the fourth expert report and examined it , had summoned and questioned the experts and had given reasons for the decision not to grant the applicant 's request for yet another expert opinion . ORG concluded that the applicant 's allegation that the lower courts had committed a breach of criminal procedure , because they had not collected enough evidence to establish the cause of her son 's death , was unfounded .", "LAW provides that criminal proceedings are adversarial ( laikantis rungimosi principo", "On DATE the Constitutional Court"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
