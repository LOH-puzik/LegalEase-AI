The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He has a daughter , PERSON , born on DATE . He and the child \u2019s mother , who were not married , separated shortly after the birth . The child lives with her mother , who has sole parental authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE , the parents have argued about contact . In DATE , the applicant lodged his first request for contact with ORG . During a hearing in DATE the parents agreed to him having supervised contact , which took place until DATE . On DATE the parents reached a further agreement for supervised contact , which was approved by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the supervising ORG , which had refused to continue to be involved due to the parties\u2019 behaviour , be replaced by another child protection association . On DATE ORG granted this request . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the appointed child protection association refused to act upon ORG instructions because of the mother \u2019s behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to impose a coercive fine on the mother in order to enforce contact rights . On DATE the parents agreed on a court - approved contact arrangement . On DATE ORG , upon the applicant \u2019s request , appointed an access facilitator ( Umgangspfleger ) . The order was subject to a time - limit expiring on DATE . Subsequently , the contactarrangement was implemented in a more or less regular way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the court to extend contact , reappoint a custodian ad litem ( Verfahrenspfleger ) and impose a coercive fine on the mother . In reply , the mother requested that contact be suspended for DATE . On DATE , after having again heard an expert , ORG suspended contact until DATE . The applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested an extension of contact following the end of the suspension period . After hearing the child in person , on DATE ORG granted the applicant contact on a DATE basis . At the same time it gave specific directions about the contact and set out sanctions to be applied if the parents did not comply with the order . Contact did not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having heard the child again , ORG , at the mother \u2019s request , suspended the applicant \u2019s contact until the conclusion of the main proceedings and rejected his requests for a coercive fine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard both parents , the child and the child \u2019s custodian ad litem . Relying on the opinion of a psychiatrist , Dr B. , submitted both in writing and explained orally , it granted the applicant contact of TIME every fortnight . It appointed a guardian , who was given specific directions as to how the child should be prepared for contact and how the meetings should be organised .", "CARDINAL . The mother appealed against this decision . The applicant pursued his request for contact and furthermore requested that ORG order the mother to supply regular information on the child \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal obtained further written submissions from Dr B. , who , with regard to the development , was now of the opinion that a suspension of the applicant \u2019s contact was , at the moment , the less damaging approach and therefore in the child \u2019s best interest . Contact with the applicant as such was not found to be damaging , but the circumstances of the conflict rendered a different solution at the moment impossible . As regards the GPE conflict , the expert pointed out that the applicant had agreed on mediation , but the mother refused such a procedure . He declined any possibility for the applicant to positively and actively arrange any contact at the moment . In her written submission to ORG , the child \u2019s guardian expressed her view according to which , to prevent longtime damages of the child , a minimum contact with the applicant should be guaranteed in any event by allowing him to send letters and presents to the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard from the parents , the child \u2019s guardian , the child and PERSON , it rejected the applicant \u2019s request and suspended all contact between him and his daughter indefinitely , pursuant to Articles DATE and DATE of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed at the outset that the court - approved contact agreement of CARDINAL DATE was still valid . It considered , however , that contact had to be permanently suspended because ordering contact would affect the child \u2019s welfare . The court noted that the child had not had any contact with her father for DATE , and that he had become a stranger to her . This had been confirmed , in particular , by the courtappointed expert . When heard in court , the child had clearly stated that she did not want to see her father . She only had limited , bad memories of him . The child , who appeared to have developed properly in relation to her age , had given the impression that she knew what was at stake and what she wanted . In spite of her young age , she had clearly and firmly expressed the desire to have her own wishes respected , suggesting that she would not accept being forced into doing something she did not want . The guardian submitted that he had not succeeded in breaking the child \u2019s aversion to her father . According to him , the child had cried and left the room when he had started talking about her father .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the child \u2019s attitude had been influenced by the loyalty she felt towards her mother , who continuously talked negatively about the father . The child felt obliged to feel the same way as her mother . She longed for the dispute between her parents to come to an end so that she would no longer be exposed to a conflict of loyalties . She saw rejecting her father as the only way to preserve at least her mother \u2019s love . Relying on the expert \u2019s findings , ORG observed that the child was mature enough to make a conscious decision and be aware of its consequences . She found herself in a psychological dilemma caused by the communication troubles between her parents , without yet having developed post - traumatic stress disorder . On the one hand , the loss of contact with a parent generally led to a disturbance of psychological development which affected a child \u2019s welfare , but on the other , forced contact in the context of a continuing dispute between parents could also seriously affect the child .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the expert , in his opinion submitted to ORG , had explained that contact with the father did not in itself jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare . However , the expert considered it necessary to prepare the parents by improving their communication before reinstating contact . ORG decision had failed to take this \u201c prerequisite \u201d into account . The parents had not undertaken any steps in this direction . When heard in ORG on DATE , the expert had clarified that if the parents did not change their way of communicating , which would necessitate at least some form of professional help such as mediation , it would cause more harm to attempt to reinstate contact than to exclude it altogether .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal continued :", "\u201c Against the background of the GPE previous conduct both in and outside the courtroom , the [ ORG ] chamber rules out the possibility that the parents will be able successfully to have recourse to mediation in the foreseeable future . As a mandatory result , the father can not be granted access to H. at present ( derzeit ) and the only available option is to exclude [ him ] from contact . It is not possible to solve the child \u2019s dilemma by specifying the arrangements for contact ... or by appointing a custodian .", "It is up to the mother to overcome her aversion to the father , and up to the father to learn that contact can only be reinstated through patience , restraint and understanding of both the mother \u2019s and child \u2019s feelings . It is furthermore not ruled out that the child , with advancing age and maturity , will be able to detach herself from her GPE dispute and seek contact with her father herself . The present decision does not exclude these options . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment given on DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG refused to entertain a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant regarding the decisions taken in the main proceedings , without providing reasons .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant lodged his application with the ORG and the application had been communicated to the ORG , the family case file was sent to ORG and then back to ORG . On DATE , after its return from the Ministry , the case file was presented to a judge , who ruled : \u201c CARDINAL . Seen . Nothing to be done . CARDINAL . To be stored \u201d ( CARDINAL . PERSON .
