The applicant , the private company PERSON . PERSON , whose registered office is in GPE , is the publisher of the DATE magazine PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u2013\u201cParliament \u201d ) examined a draft law on same - sex civil partnerships . At DATE it adopted the Registration of Same - Sex Civil Partnerships Act ( hereinafter DATE \u201c the Act \u201d ) . During the parliamentary debate on the issue , certain deputies of ORG ( hereinafter DATE \u201c the SNP \u201d ) , which opposed legal recognition of same - sex partnerships , took the floor in order to express their disagreement with the proposed draft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON magazine published a CARDINAL - page article entitled \u201c Registration of Same - Sex Civil Partnerships Act adopted \u201d , with the standfirst : \u201c Right - wingers full of pride , but according to non - governmental organisations the LAW is not consistent with LAW , summarising the parliamentary debate preceding the adoption of the LAW . The first CARDINAL paragraphs of the article read as follows :", "\u201c DATE , the second reading of the proposed LAW on the registration of same - sex civil partnerships ended up as a crash course in narrow - mindedness , pervaded by a Stone Age mentality . Our elected representatives were so keen to reject amendments to the draft [ and the ] actual rights of same - sex oriented citizens that they decided to pass the LAW at the third attempt within CARDINAL single parliamentary session . On DATE , the Act came to fruition , the outcome being CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ...", "The ORG \u2019s gunslingers ... shone brilliantly during the explanation of their votes . [ ORG ] spouted forth all the same stupidities as at the previous reading ( such as that the Act was completely unnecessary , that the Act had been extorted by marginal groups , that there were other groups which merited the legislature \u2019s priority ) , and touched on the objections against his use of words such as \u02bbfaggots\u02bc and \u02bblesbians\u02bc DATE . He stated : \u02bbWhere I come from , we call them \u201c faggots \u201d and \u201c lesbians \u201d ; in GPE a region in GPE ] , they are called \u201c kulotini \u201d and in GPE they are \u201c gays \u201d . I am not someone who would change his way of speaking just because he has come to GPE . In PERSON [ another region in GPE ] , we simply have faggots and lesbians.\u02bc", "[ ORG ] , also from the ORG , assured with a playful smile that there was probably not a single person in the assembly hall who wished for the \u2018 fruit of their loins to declare themselves to be what we are voting on DATE , with our rights ... in other words , none of us would want to have a son or a daughter who would opt for this kind of GPE . If our homeless people could follow the breadcrumb trail to GPE or even further , let these ladies and gentlemen also go there to marry . But the biggest victims of this law would be the children of such a marriage : \u2018 Just imagine a child whose father comes to pick him up from school and greets him with \u201c PERSON , I \u2019ve come to take you hooooome ! Have you got your coat on yet?\u2019 He accompanied this brilliant remark with a coffeehouse imitation which was probably supposed to clearly illustrate some orthodox understanding of a stereotypically effeminate and mannered faggot , whereas in reality [ what it illustrated was ] just the typical attitude of a cerebral bankrupt who is lucky to be living in a country with such a limited pool of human resources that a person of his characteristics can even end up in ORG , when in a normal country worthy of any respect he could not even be a janitor in the average urban primary school . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE of the article , the author first described the responses of other parliamentarians to the SNP PERSON speeches , and in DATE concluded with the views on the newly adopted PERSON expressed by the non - governmental organisations advocating for the rights of same - sex couples , which mainly deplored the fact that the LAW accorded a very limited set of rights to these couples . It ended by reporting the announcement by the representatives of these organisations that they would be challenging the newly adopted LAW before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG member PERSON brought an action before ORG for defamation of his honour and reputation against the applicant company , claiming that he had suffered severe mental distress due to the offensiveness of the article . He claimed that the depiction of him as \u201c cerebral bankrupt \u201d was objectively and subjectively offensive , its sole intent being to belittle him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company replied that it considered its actions to have been lawful , as a balance had to be struck between PERSON \u2019s right to honour and reputation and its own right to the freedom of expression . It invoked the standards and case - law of ORG the freedom of the press to impart information on matters of public interest . The applicant company considered that PERSON \u2019s statements in the parliamentary debate had amounted to an insulting attack which degraded homosexuals , and hence the criticism published in PERSON . Nevertheless , the critical article had not been aimed at belittling PERSON as a person , but constituted a reaction to his own extreme statements in similar terms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an unsuccessful settlement hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another hearing was held at which the court heard GPE , who stated that he had not offended anyone with his remarks , nor had he wished to do so . He had taken the offensive remarks in PERSON as an attack on his character and had been very hurt by them , especially as he had become the subject of ridicule in his local community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG handed down its judgment , in which it partially upheld ORG claim and ordered the applicant company to pay him damages in the amount of CARDINAL NORP Tolars ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The applicant company was also ordered to publish the introductory and operative part of the judgment in PERSON . The remainder of ORG claim was dismissed . The court acknowledged that the applicant company had had the right to publish critical comments on ORG conduct in the parliamentary debate ; however , the term \u201c cerebral bankrupt \u201d had referred to his personal characteristics and was therefore objectively offensive . In the court \u2019s opinion , the use of such offensive language did not simply serve the purpose of imparting information to the public . Moreover , the description in the article did not constitute a serious criticism of ORG work .", "CARDINAL . As to PERSON \u2019s conduct , the court held that the gestures he had used to mimic the behaviour of a homosexual man were simply reminiscent of gestures made by actors to convey the idea of homosexuality . The court neither found PERSON \u2019s speech and conduct to be offensive to homosexuals , nor considered it to have been aimed at promoting prejudice and intolerance against them . It held that PERSON had merely expressed his opinion , which , wrong as it might have been , was not to be regarded as extreme and thus justifying the treatment in the impugned article .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed against the judgment before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . It upheld PERSON \u2019s appeal in respect of the text to be published in PERSON informing the public of the judgment , but dismissed his claim for greater damages . ORG upheld ORG finding that the statements in the impugned article constituted an offensive judgment of PERSON \u2019s personality which he was not required to endure . The court further held that , even assuming that PERSON \u2019s speech had been offensive to homosexuals , that did not justify the applicant company \u2019s crude response aimed at him personally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . It claimed , inter alia , that the impugned article was to be considered a political satire in which the author had merely expressed his opinion on ORG conduct in a public parliamentary debate . It further maintained that the words \u201c typical attitude of a cerebral bankrupt \u201d had not been aimed at ORG as a person but at his mimicking of the gestures allegedly typical of homosexual men .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , dismissed the applicant company \u2019s complaint , holding that the lower courts had struck a fair balance between its freedom of expression and PERSON \u2019s personal dignity . The court acknowledged the broad boundaries associated with the freedom of the press , especially when reporting on matters of great public interest , but found on the facts of the case in issue that the lower courts had appropriately applied the criteria resulting from their own case - law and the case - law of ORG . The court dismissed the applicant company \u2019s assertion that the criticism in question had not been aimed at GPE as a person but at his mimicking of homosexuals , concluding that the average reader would understand the remark as an assessment of ORG intelligence and personal characteristics .", "CARDINAL . It also dismissed the applicant company \u2019s argument that the article was to be regarded as a satire , as it was evident from the text that it was intended to inform the public about the content of the parliamentary debate and to express a critical opinion of the speeches of the individual deputies . As regards the applicant company \u2019s argument that the offensive statement had been a response to ORG own offensive remarks , ORG acknowledged that in such cases sharper criticism might be permissible , but only if there was a sufficient factual basis for it . As the court found no substantive connection between PERSON \u2019s speech and the assessment of his intellectual abilities , it concluded that the criticism was not justified . In ORG view , the impugned article and its author \u2019s offensive characterisation of PERSON had not contributed either to people being informed or to a socially responsible public discussion on the position of homosexuals .", "CARDINAL . Constitutional judge ORG submitted a dissenting opinion in which he referred to a climate of general tolerance towards intolerant and offensive statements against homosexuals . He further expressed the view that the lower courts had been biased and also that ORG had failed to appropriately apply the standards of freedom of the press developed in the case - law of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
