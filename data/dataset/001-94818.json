CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated under NORP law with its registered office in GPE . It was represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney - General of GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant company was registered as a public company .", "During DATE an investor company ( ORG ) made an offer to the applicant company to purchase CARDINAL founder 's shares and CARDINAL ordinary shares , at QUANTITY ( ORG ) each ; the total value amounting to ORG CARDINAL . The offer was accepted by the applicant company and the investor company made an advance payment of ORG CARDINAL .", "In DATE the applicant company declared a public offer of the shares .", "On DATE Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL came into force , amending the ORG DATE ( Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL ) .", "In DATE the investor company paid the remaining sum of ORG CARDINAL to the applicant company .", "In DATE the shares were transferred to the investor company .", "On DATE the applicant submitted an application to introduce the share titles on ORG .", "The application was rejected by ORG .", "On DATE Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL was amended by PERSON . LAW PERSON was abolished and replaced .", "On DATE the investor company requested reimbursement of the sum paid for the purchase of the shares plus interest , as the share titles had not been introduced on ORG .", "The applicant company was granted an extension by ORG for the return of the money . This extension covered the period from DATE until DATE .", "On DATE the investor company ( \u201c plaintiff \u201d ) brought civil proceedings against the applicant company ( action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) before ORG of GPE claiming the return of the sum of ORG CARDINAL paid to the applicant company for the purchase of the shares . The claim was based on sections CARDINAL A ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG of DATE as amended by PERSON and , alternatively , on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the latter law .", "The applicant company alleged , inter alia , that the relevant law did not provide the plaintiff with the right to request reimbursement of the sums paid , nor did it require the applicant company to return this money . The applicant company also raised the question of the constitutionality of the applicable law , referring to Articles CARDINAL , DATE ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW and the case of ORG v. the Police ( Criminal Appeals DATE and DATE , judgment of DATE ) in which ORG had found that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of Law CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)/ CARDINAL contravened the LAW .", "On DATE ORG issued its judgment . The court observed that the first part of the sum had been paid by the plaintiff in DATE , that is before the entry into force of PERSON , whereas the rest of the sum had been paid afterwards , in DATE . The court found that in the light of sections ORG ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) the plaintiff had an actionable right which commenced after the lapse of DATE from the date of the submission of an application for the introduction of the relevant titles on ORG or earlier in the event of rejection of the application . In such an event the issuer or company or person who received the sum had to return it to the purchaser within DATE of the date when the purchaser asked for it . PERSON did not affect rights and obligations which had been created before its entry into force .", "Following the DATE period the applicant company had been granted an extension by ORG for the return of the money . This extension was still in force both when the plaintiff requested the return of the shares ( CARDINAL DATE ) and when the plaintiff brought the civil proceedings ( DATE ) . Therefore , in so far as the sum of ORG CARDINAL was concerned , which was claimed on the basis of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON , this claim was premature in view of the extension given to the applicant company by ORG .", "The court then went on to examine the applicant company 's claim regarding constitutionality . In this respect it firstly held , inter alia , that LAW , providing for the protection of the right to property , was not relevant to the contested legislative provisions . In considering the applicant company 's complaint as to the constitutionality of the provisions in question in relation to LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW protecting the freedom to conduct business and the freedom to contract respectively , the court observed that such an issue could not be examined in abstracto but only in relation to the circumstances of a given case . Although the applicant company claimed that the law interfered with an agreement between the parties that had come into effect , the facts put before the court did not support this claim . First of all , it could not be ascertained when the agreement had been reached . Secondly , the court was not aware of the contents of the agreement , and in particular whether the agreement contained conditions as to the rights and obligations of the parties in the event that the share titles were not introduced on ORG . It could not therefore be ascertained whether the sections of the law in question affected and/or interfered with the specific agreement in any way . Consequently , the court held that it could not , on the basis of the facts before it , examine the issue of constitutionality raised before it .", "Furthermore , the court held that the case of ORG v. the Police ( cited above ) relied on by the applicant was not applicable . In this respect it noted that in that case ORG had examined the constitutionality of sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON in relation to LAW . LAW CARDINAL ) imposed an obligation on the company to submit a ( duly completed and well - founded ) application for the introduction of titles on ORG within DATE , or alternatively on another date but not DATE following the date of entry into force of the applicable law . ORG found that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) was unconstitutional as it deprived the appellant company [ in that case ] of the capability of acting in the way which it considered promoted the financial interests of the company and those of its members . It rendered criminal the freedom of the appellant company to regulate its financial relations and the free financial operation of the business so that it could operate profitably .", "The court pointed out that in the present case the plaintiff was not seeking to interfere with the activities of the applicant company but had requested reimbursement of the sums it had paid for the purchase of the shares , with the prospect that the share titles would be introduced on ORG , a right which had been implicitly , if not directly , recognised by ORG in the case of GPE , where the following was stated :", "\u201c The complainant - investors have contracted freely and of their own accord with the appellants . The GPE legal framework contains provisions which protect the rights of the investor . For a possible violation of rights which emanate from the relationship which they created with the appellants , they may resort to the remedies provided by LAW . \u201d", "Accordingly , the court found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded it the sum of ORG CARDINAL with PERCENT interest from DATE , the date of the submission of the application to introduce the share titles on to ORG , until payment . Costs were awarded against the applicant company .", "On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal with ORG ( appeal no . DATE ) . The applicant company had CARDINAL grounds of appeal . It raised , inter alia , the compatibility of the legal provisions in question with Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW ( see below ) , LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL . In the context particularly of LAW , the applicant company , in its written submission to the court , alleged that it had made known to prospective purchasers that it did not meet one of the basic requirements for admission to ORG .", "However , during the hearing of the appeal , the applicant company restricted its grounds of appeal to CARDINAL points . Firstly , that the respondents did not have an actionable right on the basis of the relevant provisions and secondly that these provisions were unconstitutional because they contravened LAW , which protected the right to property . The applicant company 's complaint of unconstitutionality was therefore limited to the above LAW provision . In this respect , the applicant relied on ORG judgment in the case of ORG v. ORG ( Criminal Appeal no . CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) in which ORG had found that the PERSON on the Return of Money to Investors ( PERSON CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL ) contravened LAW .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment and dismissed the appeal . With regard to the question of constitutionality the court noted that the case of ORG ( cited above ) relied on by the applicant was distinguishable from the present case . The court noted that the above decision of ORG concerned a criminal case in which the provisions of section CARDINAL of PERSON CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL were examined . This law criminalised a specific omission by a person , which arose from the operation of a private agreement , that is to say in the domain of civil law . The court pointed out that the issue which arose in the present appeal was covered fully by the decision of ORG in the case of ORG v. PERSON ( Civil Appeal DATE , judgment of DATE ) where the provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL , which were in essence identical to the contested provision , namely section ORG ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) , were discussed extensively . In that case ORG decided that the provisions of the relevant section were constitutional . ORG decided that the same was applicable to the provisions of section CARDINALA ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) . In particular , the court noted that legislative provisions and regulations which had the object of protecting the public interest and social and financial interests as well as those of the public and citizens , were permissible . ORG went on to cite the essential parts of the above judgment :", "\u201c We consider that in the present case too what has been done by the legislation in issue is the regulation of the relations between the contracting parties thus excluding the application of the provisions of LAW ) . Even if in any case it could be said , if this article was applicable , that the provisions of LAW ( CARDINAL ) were put there for the protection of the rights of third parties , as permitted by paragraph CARDINAL of the above article of the LAW .", "...", "In any case , as has also been stated in PERSON ( above ) , legislative provisions and regulations are permissible which have the object of protecting the public interest , the social and financial interests as well as the protection of the public and the citizens . The same section provides for the prevention of exploitation by persons who have peculiar financial power , something which in our view would be completely applicable to our case , where learned counsel for the appellant himself in his oral address before us referred extensively to the problems and situations created by the introduction of companies on to ORG . In any case , however , in the case of ORG of FAC and ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , at page CARDINAL , it was said that the ORG also continues to have the power to secure the vital interests of its people . It does not matter if appropriate legislation which serves this purpose has the consequence of amending or annulling agreements already in force ( see PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "Section CARDINALA ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL ) as amended by PERSON which entered into force on DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c Any interested purchaser who has paid any sum or other consideration to an issuer , a company or a person for the purchase of shares either in accordance with the provisions of sub - section ( CARDINAL ) above or otherwise , may after DATE have elapsed from the date of the submission of an application for the introduction of the relevant titles on ORG , or earlier in the event of rejection of the application , apply in writing for the return of the sum or consideration if the relevant titles have not been given to him or the relevant titles have been given to him but they have not as yet been introduced on ORG . In such an event the issuer or company or person who received the sum or consideration must return it to the interested purchaser within DATE of the date when the interested purchaser asked for the return of the sum or consideration , with PERCENT interest calculated from DATE when the application for the introduction of the said titles on ORG was made , and must return the relevant titles if they have been issued and given to the interested purchaser :", "Provided that , notwithstanding the provisions of sub - section ( CARDINAL ) , the ORG may bar an issuer or company which contravenes the provisions of this section from introducing titles on ORG . \u201d", "On DATE Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL was amended by PERSON . LAW PERSON was abolished and replaced . However , the provisions of Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL continued to be applied to rights and obligations that arose before NORP came into force .", "Sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) Any issuer , company , member of the board of a company or person who has received or has bound any sum or has received any consideration for the sale or offer for sale or acceptance of an offer for the purchase of titles on their behalf or on behalf of any company incorporated or being incorporated before the entry into force of ORG ( Amending ) ( No . CARDINAL ) PERSON of DATE , with the prospect and/or representations that the said titles would be introduced on ORG , shall within DATE or within any other period which will be decided by CARDINAL of the interested purchasers and which shall not in any case exceed DATE from the date of entry into force of ORG ( Amending ) ( No . CARDINAL ) PERSON of DATE take all the necessary actions for the submission of a duly substantiated and documented application ( in accordance with the present PERSON and the LAW issued thereunder ) for the introduction of the relevant titles on to ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Failure by an issuer , company , member of the board of a company or any person to act in accordance with the provisions of sub - section ( CARDINAL ) above is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment of DATE or a fine of QUANTITY and/or with both these penalties and entails the compulsory return of any sum or consideration received or the release of any bound sum , with interest of PERCENT to be paid to the interested purchaser with the return at the same time of the relevant titles if they have been issued and given to the interested purchaser .", "( CARDINAL ) Any issuer , company , member of the board of a company or person who has received any sum or any consideration from the sale or offer for sale or acceptance of an offer for the purchase of titles on behalf of any company incorporated or being incorporated before the entry into force of ORG ( Amending ) ( No . CARDINAL ) PERSON of DATE , with the prospect or representations that the said titles would be introduced on ORG , shall , if the relevant titles are not introduced for any reason on ORG within DATE of the submission of the application for their introduction on ORG , or earlier in the event of rejection of the application , and if the interested purchaser asks for it in writing , return the sums or considerations to those who had paid them within DATE of the date when the interested purchaser asked for them , which he had paid with PERCENT interest calculated from DATE of the submission of the application , at the same time as the return of the relevant titles :", "Provided that , if the ORG ascertains that the application under consideration is duly and sufficiently substantiated and documented in accordance with ORG and that there is no prima facie substantial obstacle to the approval of the application and that the delay in approving the application is not due to the applicant , it may grant a reasonable extension of time to the applicant with regard to the return of the sums received . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) above imposes an obligation on any \u201c issuer , company , member of the board of a company or person \u201d to submit an application for the introduction of shares on to ORG within DATE or within any other period which will be decided by CARDINAL of the interested purchasers and which shall not in any case exceed DATE from the date of entry into force of the amending LAW . Failure to submit such an application is a criminal offence . In the case of ORG v. the Police ( cited above ) ORG found that the penalisation of the failure to submit an application to introduce titles on to ORG within a fixed time - limit , and in an absolute manner , was an impermissible interference with the right protected by LAW and nullified the freedom which that provision guaranteed . It accordingly held that LAW ) was unconstitutional .", "In the case of ORG ( cited above ) ORG found that section CARDINAL of the Return of Money to Investors Law ( PERSON CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL ) was unconstitutional . This case was a criminal case and the law in question criminalised a specific failure by a person which had risen from the operation of a private agreement , that is to say in the domain of civil law . In that case ORG held the following :", "\u201c A purchaser has bought shares from an issuer on the condition that the latter would introduce them on ORG , and this has not happened , then , if the procedure provided by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the law is followed , he is entitled to ask for the return of the money or the consideration which he gave for the purchase of the shares . If the issuer does not return to the purchaser the money or the consideration he gave , then he commits a criminal offence as provided in CARDINAL of the law , and if convicted is liable to imprisonment of DATE or to a fine of MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "Our thoughts and judgment follow . As to the amount or any consideration given by a purchaser of shares to the issuer , who both issues and hands over the shares to him , that amount and any other consideration come into the absolute ownership of the issuer just as the shares come into the ownership of the purchaser . The use by the law of the term \u201c returns \u201d is without true legal substance . It does not correspond to the legal truth . What the law essentially provides is the compulsion of the issuer , by the likelihood of prosecution and conviction , to deliver to the purchaser , and the registered owner of the shares , part of his property . This is constitutionally impermissible , because it compels the issuer to alienate part of his property , otherwise he will face the consequences which the law provides .", "The decision of our ORG in ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL CLR DATE has no relation to the legal treatment that this criminal appeal ought to have . In that case it was decided that the legislative provision ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) DATE ) constituted a regulation of contractual relations and for this reason it did not violate LAW .", "Of assistance in the present case is the decision in Criminal Appeals DATE and CARDINAL ORG v. Police , CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , a decision which was upheld by LAW in recourses CARDINAL and others ORG and others v. the ORG , CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . We observe , however , that in both the above CARDINAL cases the ORG discussed whether the law violated LAW , given the suggestion that the legislative provision was necessary for the reasons contained in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . The law in issue , examined in this case , as we said above , and for the reasons we have explained , abolishes in toto the fundamental right secured by LAW .", "We will not deal with anything else , which results from the good work done collectively by the advocates in the case .
