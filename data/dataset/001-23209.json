NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG ( hereinafter referred to as PCARDINAL ) , is a radio broadcasting company established in GPE . The applicant company is represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE PCARDINAL applied for authorisation to radiobroadcast , in whole or in part , the main hearing ( hovedforhandling ) in a major criminal trial concerning charges against CARDINAL persons of triple murder , the so - called ORG case , scheduled to take place before ORG ( herredsrett ) as from DATE . According to the applicant , this was probably the most spectacular and media - focused criminal case in NORP history . The case involved a son and his wife , the wife \u2019s CARDINAL - sister and a friend of the latter , who were charged with the murder of the son \u2019s parents and sister , committed in a particularly brutal manner .", "The district court judge ( sorenskriveren ) , who received the application on DATE , replied by fax :", "\u201c APPLICATION FOR BROADCASTING", "The PERSON case", "Hereby rejected", "Nobody is granted such permission \u201d", "The above decision was taken under section CARDINALA ( in its version as applicable at the relevant time ) of ORG Act DATE ( domstolloven ) .", "PCARDINAL appealed against this decision to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) and requested it to quash ORG refusal to broadcast and to give a new decision . The applicant maintained that there was no justification for refusing radio broadcasting from the ORG opening statements and closing arguments and from the delivery of verdict .", "On DATE ORG dismissed ( avviste ) the appeal . In so far the procedure was concerned , it found no error which warranted setting aside the refusal . Regarding the substance of the decision , it held that this was a matter which by its very nature could not form the subject of an appeal ( uangripelig ) . ORG added incidentally that , notwithstanding this limitation on its own jurisdiction , it did not find that the disputed refusal conflicted with either the LAW provisions concerning the public character of judicial proceedings or those on freedom of expression .", "On DATE ORG of the ORG unanimously rejected an appeal by PCARDINAL against the High Court \u2019s decision . The ORG \u2019s reasoning could be summarised as follows .", "The ORG noted the absence , in section CARDINAL ( incorporating the provision of section CARDINAL according to an amendment in DATE , which had not yet entered into force ) of ORG Act DATE , of an express provision on the right to appeal against a refusal to broadcast , unlike sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL concerning respectively prohibition on reporting from judicial proceedings ( referatforbud ) and publication of judicial decisions . This suggested that section CARDINAL decisions were not intended to be open to appeal . However , the ORG did not find it necessary to consider the applicant \u2019s argument that a right of appeal would follow from LAW ( straffeprosessloven ) , since such a right could in any event follow from the fact that it had been claimed that a LAW right had been violated . In this connection the ORG mentioned the provisions of LAW on the precedence of international human rights conventions over domestic law and LAW right to an effective remedy for \u201c arguable claims \u201d of violation . The ORG noted a decision by the former Commission ( PERSON and Others v. GPE , application no . DATE ) , which concerned complaints by CARDINAL journalist under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention about judicial orders to prohibit reporting and to hear a case in camera , rejected as manifestly ill - founded . It was found that the interference was justified for the purposes of LAW and that , absent an arguable claim of violation , LAW did not apply . The ORG further observed that the \u201c arguable claim \u201d criterion had been criticised in legal theory and pointed out that the condition for lodging an appeal under NORP procedural law was that the appellant \u2019s claim of violation did not appear entirely unfounded .", "As regards the decision under challenge , the ORG , noting that ORG had dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional ground , quoted its findings on the merits and upheld those findings . As regards the latter aspect , the ORG observed :", "\u201c The ORG agrees with what has been stated by ORG and points to the fact that the principle of publicity in LAW is to ensure democratic control of the courts , not the right of the public to receive information , and that the principle is preserved by the provisions on public hearing and the freedom to report in ... ORG . The ORG can not see that the prohibition in section CARDINALA , first paragraph , of the LAW on , inter alia , recording for radio transmission from the proceedings in a criminal case infringes the right to receive and impart information under LAW . It is recalled that the media are not excluded from , or imposed a duty of silence about , the proceedings . The ORG finds no support in the ORG \u2019s or the [ former ] Commission \u2019s case - law for interpreting the right to freedom of expression to mean that there is a right to record from criminal proceedings with a view to radio - or television broadcasting . At last , it should be noted that , under section CARDINAL , second paragraph , a derogation from the prohibition in the first paragraph may be made during the main hearing where there are special reasons and after having heard the views of the parties . \u201d", "In the meantime , on DATE the trial started before ORG . It was held in open court . Because of the great media interest in the case and since the hearing room was too small to host both members of the ordinary public and media representatives , special arrangements were made enabling the press to follow the trial at a press centre , set up in a sports hall , to which sound and picture were transmitted live and shown on a television screen .", "Section CARDINAL , as in force at the material time , of ORG Act DATE ( domstolloven ) provided :", "\u201c During oral proceedings in a criminal case , photographing , filming and radio - or television recordings are prohibited . It is also prohibited to take photographs or make recordings of the accused or the convicted on his or her way to , or from , the hearing or when he or she is staying inside the building in which the hearing takes place , without his or her consent .", "If there are special reasons for doing so , the court may in the course of the proceedings make an exception from the [ above ] prohibition if it can be assumed that it would not unduly affect the examination of the case and no other reasons militate decisively against doing so . Before authorisation is given the parties should have an opportunity to express their views . \u201d", "LAW ( straffeprosessloven ) reads :", "\u201c An interlocutory appeal may be brought against a court order or decision by any person who is affected thereby unless it may form the subject of an appeal proper or may serve as a ground for such an appeal by the said person , or by reason of its nature or a specific statutory provision is unchallengable . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
