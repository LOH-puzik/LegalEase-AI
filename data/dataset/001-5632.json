{"ITEMID": "001-5632", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ESP", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "J. L.S. v. SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr ORG ] is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives at PERSON ( GPE ) . He is a soldier in the provisional reserve force .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant signed an \u201c administrative special - quarters - allocation form \u201d at the ORG Quartermaster - General , thereby obtaining the use of lodgings in GPE . The quartermasters - general were set up by a royal decree of CARDINAL DATE to meet the housing needs of military personnel , who were liable to be transferred at regular intervals .", "In DATE the applicant made a request under PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE for a transfer to the provisional reserve force . It was granted by a decree ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) issued by ORG on DATE . The transfer was irreversible under administrative regulations .", "On DATE Royal Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE was published . It established ORG ( GPE ) and abolished the ORG Quartermaster - General . By DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , certain servicemen in the provisional reserve force were required to surrender possession of DATE to the ORG before DATE .", "On DATE the Director - General of GPE informed the applicant that DATE should have been vacated before DATE . On DATE the applicant was given DATE to leave and was told that failure to do so would result in possession proceedings being brought . GPE put in motion an administrative procedure against the applicant , who on DATE was ordered to leave DATE by a decision of the Secretary of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant made an application to ORG for judicial review of that decision .", "Meanwhile , GPE sought an order from the GPE investigating judge requiring the applicant to vacate the LOC ( ORG had not ordered a stay of execution of the decision of DATE ) . On DATE the investigating judge made an order authorising eviction .", "The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , which reversed the impugned decision on DATE holding that the execution of the administrative eviction order was disproportionate since the application for judicial review was still pending .", "The DATE decree was partly amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , which was not , however , applicable to servicemen in the provisional reserve force . Nonetheless , it did permit aggrieved parties to apply in certain circumstances for a stay of execution of orders for possession . The applicant made such an application on DATE . However , owing to the fact that he had moved , it was not heard .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was served on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for judicial review and upheld the order for possession . It noted at the outset that the applicant had been allocated his quarters in his capacity as a serviceman and that public servants were in an objective legal position that could be modified without undermining the rule of law . A public servant \u2019s position was therefore not immutable from the time he took up office , but was governed by the principle that the rules regulating the status of public servants had been accepted . In rejecting the applicant \u2019s submissions , the court referred to a ORG judgment of DATE in which it was held that the law on urban lettings and the provisions governing low - rent housing did not apply to military quarters or to transfers of possession of DATE . The applicant \u2019s claims were therefore ill - founded since none of the rights the applicant might previously have enjoyed as a tenant had been infringed ; nor had he been unlawfully deprived of his legitimate rights .", "The applicant subsequently lodged an amparo appeal with ORG , which was dismissed in a decision of DATE on the ground that there was no constitutional basis for the appeal . ORG held that the court below had given sufficient reasons for rejecting the applicant \u2019s submissions regarding the retrospective application of Decree no . DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It further noted that eviction from DATE did not amount to a penalty for the purposes of LAW and that , in any event , no amparo appeal lay in respect of breaches of that provision , in which the prohibition on giving retrospective effect to norms that were restrictive of rights was to be found .", "\u201c The LAW guarantees the rule of law , the application of norms according to rank , their publication , the non - retrospective nature of provisions laying down increased penalties or restricting individual rights , legal certainty , the accountability of public authorities and the prohibition of any arbitrary act on their part . \u201d", "\u201c In the light of the need for military defence planning and in order to enhance the operational effectiveness of ORG and facilitate the geographical mobility of their members , ORG shall take appropriate measures to provide for the housing needs of members of ORG resulting from the requirement for them to be mobile ; ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL(a ) Servicemen in the provisional reserve force when LAW enters into force [ DATE ] and occupying military quarters shall be entitled to live in DATE for life provided they satisfy the age requirement for joining the reserve force for their rank , regiment and post as laid down by Law no . CARDINAL of DATE or will satisfy that requirement within a maximum of DATE .", "All other members of the provisional reserve force shall vacate DATE before DATE . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
