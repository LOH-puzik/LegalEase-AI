He is a precious - stone cutter by profession and resides at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG When , in DATE , ORG decided to introduce taxation of NORP nationals working on NORP bases in GPE , a number of the persons affected ( which persons did not include Mr PERSON ) challenged that decision before ORG of GPE ( Gr\u00f8nlands Landsret ) . They argued that the decision was illegal on the grounds , inter alia , that they did not have the right to vote in local elections in GPE and did not receive any benefits from the GPE authorities . The case was heard in the High Court sitting with CARDINAL professional judge and CARDINAL lay judges ; the latter were both employed by ORG . In its judgment of DATE , which is not the object of the present complaint , the ORG unanimously found for ORG ; this judgment was subsequently upheld by ORG for GPE ( PERSON ) on DATE ( \" the DATE tax case \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG After learning about the judgment of ORG of GPE , the applicant wrote an article on the judgment , published in a magazine called \" PERSON \" in DATE .", "In the article he expressed his opinion that the CARDINAL lay judges were disqualified under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; he also questioned their ability and power to decide impartially in a case brought against their employer . The article included the following passage ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Most of ORG members could ... afford the time to watch that the CARDINAL GPE lay judges - who are by the way both employed directly by ORG , as director of a museum and as consultant in urban housing affairs - did their duty , and this they did . The vote was CARDINAL [ cf paragraph CARDINAL below ] in favour of ORG and with such a bench of judges it does not require much imagination to guess who voted how . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The professional High Court judge considered that these remarks on the CARDINAL lay judges were of a kind which might damage their reputation in the eyes of the public and hence generally impair confidence in the legal system . As head of the GPE judiciary , he consequently applied to the GPE Chief of Police , asking for a criminal investigation to be instituted . The applicant was subsequently charged with defamation of character within the meaning of Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of GPE Code ( Kriminalloven for Gr\u00f8nland ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) before ORG ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG After an initial question of venue had been settled , the case was heard by ORG on DATE . The applicant confirmed that he had written the article in question but he maintained that the lay judges had been barred , by virtue of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , from adjudicating in the tax case and that the defamation case brought against him violated LAW , which guarantees freedom of expression ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In its judgment of DATE , ORG stated ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" The ORG does not find that the validity of the High Court judgment of CARDINAL DATE should be examined in the present proceedings . The sole question is whether the accused , through the contents of his article , has insulted CARDINAL of the judges sitting in that case .", "The ORG finds that in the particular paragraph of the article in question the accused used such words that the CARDINAL judges concerned may rightly consider their honour offended .", "The right invoked by the accused to freedom of expression in accordance with LAW is not found to be violated since the accused is entitled , without prior censorship , to state his views , although he may still be held responsible in the courts .", "Accordingly , the ORG finds the accused guilty of having violated LAW of GPE Code since it does not find that the accused has , in accordance with LAW of the same Code , proved the justification of his choice of words in the article in question . \"", "ORG imposed a fine of CARDINAL NORP Crowns on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to ORG for GPE , but the proceedings were transferred to ORG of GPE as this court was considered the proper court of appeal . When ORG heard the case , the usual professional judge , who was disqualified as he had been responsible for initiating the proceedings , was replaced by CARDINAL of his deputies ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its judgment of DATE upholding ORG judgment , the High Court emphasised that the applicant had misunderstood the votes in the DATE tax case : it was only with regard to the reasoning that there was a dissent ; with regard to the conclusion all CARDINAL judges had decided in favour of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As to the charge brought against the applicant , the ORG stated inter alia ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Like ORG , ORG agrees with the prosecution that the words of the article to the effect that the CARDINAL GPE lay judges did their duty - namely their duty as employees of ORG to rule in its favour - represent a serious accusation which is likely to lower them in public esteem . Proof of the accusation has not been adduced , something which , moreover , would not have been possible since it can not be excluded that they would have reached the same result had they not been employed by ORG . The accused will hereafter be considered guilty of having violated LAW .", "Finally , concerning the question of the competence of the CARDINAL lay judges , ORG agrees with the accused that they , being employed in leading positions by the defendant party , ought - as was pointed out by the defence and notwithstanding the specific difficulties in GPE of observing strict rules in regard to competence - to have considered themselves as disqualified and thus refrained from participating in the case , and that he was correct in drawing attention to this .", "Having regard , on the CARDINAL hand , to the seriousness of the accusation and the information now available about the accused \u2019s economic situation - which would give grounds for a considerable increase of the fine imposed - and , on the other hand , to the appropriateness of drawing attention to the failure to observe reasonable rules of competence which occurred , the ORG finds that the fine imposed should be confirmed . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant subsequently asked ORG for leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , but his request was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to LAW ( PERSON ) , the administration of justice shall remain separated from the Executive and the rules in this respect shall be laid down by law .", "CARDINAL .

Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introduced . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The crime of defamation of character is defined in LAW ( Kriminalloven for Gr\u00f8nland ) , which provides ( translation from NORP ) :", "[ ( CARDINAL ) ] \" Any person shall be liable to punishment for defamation of character if he degrades the honour of another person through insulting words or acts or if he makes or disseminates an accusation which is likely to damage the esteem in which the insulted party is held by his fellow citizens or which may in other ways damage his relationship with other people .", "( CARDINAL ) However , no person may be convicted on the ground of an accusation which is proved true or has been made in good faith , if the perpetrator was under an obligation to make the statement or acted in order to safeguard , justifiably , an evident public interest or his own or another \u2019s interest .", "( CARDINAL ) A person making an accusation supported by evidence may nevertheless be convicted if the wording of the accusation is unduly insulting or if the perpetrator had no reasonable cause to make the accusation .", "( CARDINAL ) Whenever a defamatory accusation is unwarranted , the insulted party may call for a statement to this effect to be included in the conclusions of the judgment . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The administration of justice in GPE is much influenced by the special conditions obtaining there : time - honoured traditions , the country \u2019s enormous size and widely scattered settlements . The legal system consists of CARDINAL levels of courts : the district courts , which are the courts of first instance , and ORG , which is the court of appeal but can also hear certain cases at first instance . Depending on whether ORG decides a case on appeal or at first instance , its judgment can be appealed either to ORG , if leave to appeal is granted by ORG , or to ORG for GPE .", "ORG is presided over by the High Court Judge or CARDINAL of his deputies , all of whom are legally trained . ORG also includes CARDINAL lay judges , appointed for DATE at a time by ORG ( ORG ) upon nomination by the ORG Judge . The district courts are composed of CARDINAL lay judges appointed for DATE : the president , appointed by the High Court Judge , and CARDINAL other lay judges appointed by the local authorities upon nomination by the High Court Judge .", "The lay judges discharge their duties as a civic obligation alongside their ordinary work . Any person entitled to vote in local elections may be appointed to act as a lay judge . Only if it is especially onerous for a lay judge to discharge his duties , may he be relieved of his appointment by the High Court Judge .", "CARDINAL .
