On DATE , additional investigative measures were ordered by a military prosecutor , but it appears that none was taken .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prosecutor decided not to institute criminal proceedings on the grounds that the shooting had taken place as the result of fortuitous circumstances : the soldiers had been led to believe that the tourists were terrorists , so that when the tourists failed to respond to the order to get out of the cars and surrender , they had given the soldiers an impression of imminent danger .", "CARDINAL .

It was emphasised that the second round of shooting had taken place when the cars were stationary and the passengers were trying to hide in the immediate surroundings environment . He considered that the order to shoot had constituted a criminal act and that any fear that the soldiers might have experienced could not have amounted to a circumstance capable of removing criminal liability . It was therefore ordered to institute criminal proceedings against Lieutenant Colonel S. for aggravated murder .", "CARDINAL . The file was sent back to the military prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , GPE and GPE , CARDINAL of the victims of the shooting of DATE , lodged a complaint against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with the higher prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the military section of the prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG and ORG quashed the decision of DATE , indicating that DATE given the fact that in DATE criminal proceedings had been instituted against Colonel PERSON and several procedural acts had been taken in connection therewith \u2013 the running of the statutory time - limit had been interrupted and criminal liability was therefore not time - barred .

CARDINAL civilians , including a former President of GPE and a former Head of ORG , had been also charged .", "CARDINAL . A letter of CARDINAL DATE from the military prosecuting authorities indicates that CARDINAL decisions to discontinue proceedings , issued in the separate investigations , were set aside and the relevant files joined to case no .
