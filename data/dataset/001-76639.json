FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A NORP company called ORG ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) and an NORP company called ORG ( hereinafter \u201c VIS \u201d ) agreed that they would gradually switch production of coated decorative panels known as \u201c ORG - panels \u201d from GPE to the ORG factory in GPE , so that ORG would eventually become responsible for their marketing only . ORG had a monopoly over ORG - panels in GPE .", "At DATE ORG and ORG signed another contract , according to which ORG would buy wind - block panels from ORG . The cooperation between the CARDINAL companies covered , as a result , all the marketing rights of ORG products in GPE , GPE and west - NORP countries .", "ORG , which was still producing ORG - panels of its own , later allegedly ignored the above - mentioned cooperation contracts , causing ORG financial difficulties . ORG considered that the agreements had been terminated and decided to build its own production line to make coated decorative panels . The production line was ordered through ORG , a NORP company apparently owned by DATE applicants , from a company called PERSON , owned by the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the managing director of ORG , PERSON , requested the police to investigate whether there had been a disclosure of their business secrets , alleging that their exclusive rights to the design of a production line to make coated decorative panels had been used without their permission to build the ORG production line in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The investigations were carried out by ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) , which appointed PERSON , a mechanical engineer , as their expert in the case . He had worked for a company called ORG , which belonged to the same consolidated group as ORG . ORG also requested expert statements from Professor PERSON in respect of technical questions , and from Professor PERSON in respect of the legal aspects of the protection of business secrets . Professor PERSON was asked to address in particular whether the first and second applicants had provided ORG with information covered by business secrecy . Further , he was asked to give an opinion on the third applicant \u2019s activities in the planning of the production line , whether he had possessed information covered by business secrecy and whether he had availed himself of such information . Professor PERSON was provided with the pre - trial statements of the applicants and CARDINAL others . On DATE he submitted his opinion comprising CARDINAL pages of which CARDINAL pages concerned his assessment of the nature of the applicants\u2019 alleged actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested that an NORP citizen , PERSON , also be heard as a witness in the pre - trial investigation , but ORG made no attempt to call him as a witness . The applicants were not able to appoint their own expert as the ORG production line , with which the ORG production line was to be compared , was protected by the exclusive business secrecy of ORG . According to the applicants , their expert was therefore prevented from examining the ORG production line . The ORG production line went into operation only after ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) proceedings had come to an end .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor brought charges against the applicants for , inter alia , disclosure of a business secret . In the indictment , he alleged that the applicants had undertaken to carry out a project for the production of coated decorative panels on the basis of information they had on the production and marketing of a similar product known as ORG - panels of ORG , in cooperation with ORG . ORG had been established for the purposes of the project , which was to provide ORG with the production line for the panels corresponding to ORG - panels and otherwise to take care of the supply of equipment , training and know - how . According to the indictment , the information used for carrying out the project constituted a business secret of ORG . Although the third applicant had no association with ORG , he was allegedly aware of the fact that the project in which he had participated was to a large extent based on the business secrets of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) began its examination of the charges . The applicants pleaded not guilty , arguing , inter alia , that ORG had deliberately given up its allegedly exclusive right to any secrets as it had handed over all the relevant information to ORG anyway . They also argued that the design was a matter of common knowledge and was not protected in any way , as the patent for ORG - panels had already expired at the time of the events in question and the ORG factory had been accessible to anyone . They also noted that a similar panel was produced in GPE . According to the applicants , ORG intended to exploit its monopoly status with the help of the court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants called GPE , among others , as their witness . They also requested that the former members of ORG \u2019s board of directors , Mr PERSON and PERSON , called by ORG , should not be heard as witnesses as their real status was that of a complainant given their close relationship with the company . ORG rejected their claims and took evidence from ORG and TIME ORG also heard oral evidence from the applicants , from CARDINAL witnesses called by the prosecution and from CARDINAL witnesses for the defence . CARDINAL witness for the complainant company was also heard .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , during a DATE hearing , the fourth applicant requested that CARDINAL engineers , both witnesses for the defence , should be allowed to acquaint themselves with ORG \u2019s production line . However , he withdrew the request during the hearing . At no stage during the proceedings did anyone request that Professor PERSON , who had given a written expert opinion during the pre - trial investigation , be heard as a witness before ORG . Nor was there any objection to the inclusion of the opinion in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicants guilty as charged and fined them . Professor PERSON \u2019s written expert opinion was quoted several times in the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The parties appealed . The applicants were each represented by different counsel and therefore lodged separate writs of appeal . The second applicant explicitly requested that Professor PERSON , among others , be called as a witness before ORG , as the applicants had not had an opportunity to put questions to him . The first and fourth applicants for their part drew the court \u2019s attention to the fact that Professor PERSON had given his written opinion in the course of the pre - trial investigation , having had at his disposal only limited knowledge about the facts of the case . Thus , no weight should be given to his written opinion . The applicants also complained that ORG had failed to take into account any of the statements made by the witnesses called by them . Some of these arguments were advanced by all of the applicants , others by CARDINAL of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . However it refused to hear any witnesses , finding that the allegation that the evidence had been wrongly assessed did not warrant a rehearing since the credibility of the evidence in question had not been challenged . It also considered that the taking of witness evidence would not produce any new information relevant to the case .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG upheld most of ORG reasoning . It did not give any reasons for its decision not to hear Professor PERSON even though the second applicant had explicitly requested that he be heard . It upheld their conviction and increased their sentences to suspended terms of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested leave to appeal , alleging , inter alia , that the principle of equality of arms between the public prosecutor and the defence had been violated . The applicants had not been able to appoint an expert who could have examined the production line in question , nor had they been allowed to put questions to Professor PERSON at an oral hearing , even though ORG judgment had essentially been based on the expert opinion he had submitted to the police during the pre - trial investigation .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The rules of evidence are laid down in LAW of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; Act no . CARDINAL ) . In criminal proceedings , the forms of submission of evidence are CARDINAL ) examination of witnesses , CARDINAL ) hearing of experts , CARDINAL ) hearing of parties under oath ( in criminal proceedings only the injured party can be heard under oath and only about the establishment of losses suffered by him or her ) , CARDINAL ) hearing of parties without an oath , CARDINAL ) submission of documentary evidence , and CARDINAL ) inspection in situ .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that a fact that is a matter of common knowledge or known to the court ex officio need not be proven . In addition , evidence need not be presented on the content of domestic law ( jura novit curia ) . If the court does not know the foreign law applicable to the case , it is for the parties to submit evidence on it .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that if an expert witness with special professional knowledge is deemed necessary , the court can obtain an opinion on the matter from , for example , a public official or an expert in the relevant field who is known to be honest and competent . Section CARDINAL provides that an expert who is heard before the court must take an oath .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that an expert must give a detailed account of the findings in his or her investigation and , on the basis of the account , a substantiated opinion on the questions put to him or her . The opinion shall be compiled in writing , unless the court deems it necessary that the opinion be presented orally . An expert witness who has given a written opinion shall be heard orally in court , if a party so requests and the hearing of the expert witness is not clearly irrelevant or if the court deems the hearing of the expert witness to be necessary . If there are several expert witnesses , CARDINAL or more of them may be called to be heard .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( Act no . DATE ) provides that if a party to the proceedings relies on an expert not appointed by the court , the provisions on witnesses apply . However , such an expert may be ordered to give a substantiated opinion , as mentioned in section CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
