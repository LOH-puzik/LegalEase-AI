It was represented before the ORG by PERSON V. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was the proprietor of a NORP patent in the area of chip technology . The patent was contested in an opposition proceeding before ORG ( \u201c EPO \u201d ) . At first instance , on DATE ORG of the EPO maintained the patent in an amended ( limited ) form , that is , the proprietor added further features to the granted claims of the patent in order to meet the requirements of LAW . The decision was appealed against by all parties to the proceedings . The applicant requested that the patent be upheld unamended , or , by way of auxiliary request , that it be maintained in accordance with CARDINAL of CARDINAL sets of amended claims filed with the grounds .", "On DATE , ORG of the EPO summoned the parties to oral proceedings to commence on DATE . ORG indicated that it \u201c may disregard evidence which is not submitted in good time prior to the oral proceedings . \u201d It added that the same applied to amendments to the patent documents , which \u201c should be filed as early as possible ( DATE before the date set for the oral proceedings ) . \u201d On DATE , DATE before the expiry of the time - limit , the applicant filed CARDINAL new auxiliary requests . In the course of the oral proceedings the applicant withdrew its previous main request and all but CARDINAL auxiliary requests . It requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that the patent be maintained in its amended form on the basis of the CARDINAL remaining auxiliary requests .", "By letter dated DATE one of the opponents filed new prior art documents . The opponents requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and the patent revoked .", "As to the procedural issues , the opponents further argued that those of the CARDINAL requests filed on DATE which opened up new issues were inadmissible , as they had not been lodged in due time . The applicant argued that the requests were admissible since they had been presented within the time - limit set by ORG in the summons to oral proceedings .", "At the end of the oral proceedings , on DATE , ORG quashed the decision under appeal and revoked the patent .", "It rejected CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s ( auxiliary ) requests as inadmissible . Referring to CARDINAL previous decisions , not published in ORG EPO ( \u201c ORG EPO \u201d ) , and to LAW ( see relevant law below ) , the ORG considered that requests filed at a point in time just before the minimum period set by the board in a summons to oral proceedings were to be regarded as belated if they raised issues which would require a further written phase in order to be properly dealt with . ORG further noted that , regardless of whether the opponents had been familiar with all the technical issues , they had not accepted that the invention according to the auxiliary requests was patentable . Thus , the divergent features would still have required extensive discussions .", "ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL remaining requests . In its reasoning it also took into account the documents filed by the opponents on DATE . With regard to the admissibility of these documents the ORG found that their slight lateness had been of no importance and admitted them into the proceedings . It argued that it could always exercise certain discretion to admit documents and that there had been sufficient time left for all parties to study the documents . The written version of the decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication . Referring to its caselaw establishing the principle that it would refrain from exercising its jurisdiction as long as the protection received within the framework of ORG fundamental rights was in general equivalent to the standard of LAW , it held that the applicant had failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the fundamental rights protection within LAW did not meet this standard .", "ORG is an intergovernmental organisation that provides for an autonomous protection mechanism for individual inventors and companies seeking uniform patent protection in CARDINAL NORP countries . When the events at issue occurred , LAW DATE was in force . A revised version of LAW entered into force on DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Patents granted by virtue of this Convention shall be called NORP patents .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP patent shall , in each of GPE for which it is granted , have the effect of and be subject to the same conditions as a national patent granted by that ORG , unless otherwise provided in this LAW . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A NORP patent shall , subject to the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL , confer on its proprietor from the date of publication of the mention of its grant , in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted , the same rights as would be conferred by a national patent granted in that ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) Any infringement of a NORP patent shall be dealt with by national law . \u201d", "Article DATE of LAW DATE provides :", "\u201c The NORP patent application and the resulting patent shall be deemed not to have had , as from the outset , the effects specified in GPE CARDINAL and CARDINAL , to the extent that the patent has been revoked in opposition proceedings . \u201d", "LAW leaves it open to the Member GPE to provide for their own national patent protection system . GPE provides for such a protection mechanism with LAW ( Patentgesetz ) and ORG ( GPE Patent- und Markenamt ) . Neither LAW nor LAW exclude a patentee from applying under the other protection mechanism . Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In any designated Contracting ORG a NORP patent application and a NORP patent shall have with regard to a national patent application and a national patent the same prior right effect as a national patent application and a national patent .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG national patent application and a national patent in a Contracting State shall have with regard to a NORP patent in which that ORG is designated the same prior right effect as they have with regard to a national patent .", "( CARDINAL ) Any Contracting State may prescribe whether and on what terms an invention disclosed in both a NORP patent application or patent and a national application or patent having DATE of filing or , where priority is claimed , the same date of priority , may be protected simultaneously by both applications or patents . \u201d", "With regard to appeals to ORG , LAW DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP In order to ensure uniform application of the law , or if an important point of law arises :", "( a ) ORG shall , during proceedings on a case and either of its own motion or following a request from a party to the appeal , refer any question to ORG if it considers that a decision is required for the above purposes . If ORG rejects the request , it shall give the reasons in its final decision ;", "( b ) the President of ORG may refer a point of law to ORG where CARDINAL ORG have given different decisions on that question . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG ( ORG EPO DATE , CARDINAL ) in force at the relevant time provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG shall ensure that each case is ready for decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings , unless there are special reasons to the contrary .
