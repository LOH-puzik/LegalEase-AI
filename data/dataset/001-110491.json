As was the case during all previous visits , the delegation observed a number of shortcomings in the manner in which injuries were recorded at FAC .

Further , although objective medical findings relating to injuries were recorded in other cases , they were frequently not accompanied by an account of the statements made by the persons concerned which are relevant to the medical examination .
