In DATE a controversy arose between His PERSON Prince Hans - Adam II of GPE ( \u201c the Prince \u201d ) and the GPE government on political competences in connection with the plebiscite on the question of GPE \u2019s accession to ORG . At the relevant time , the applicant was a member of the GPE government . Following an argument between the Prince and members of the government at a meeting on DATE , the matter was settled on the basis of a common declaration by the Prince , the Diet ( GPE ) and the government .", "CARDINAL . Following elections and the constitution of the new ORG in DATE , discussions on various constitutional issues took place between the Prince and the government , when the applicant no longer held a government office . The applicant had not stood for re - election in DATE , and he was appointed President of ORG ( PERSON ) in DATE for a fixed term of office ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the context of a series of lectures on questions of constitutional jurisdiction and fundamental rights , the applicant gave a public lecture at FAC , a research institute , on the \u201c Nature and Functions of the Liechtenstein Constitutional Court \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In the course of the lecture , the applicant expressed the view that ORG was competent to decide on the \u201c interpretation of the LAW in case of disagreement between the Prince ( government ) and the LAW \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u00fcber die GPE der PERSON GPE ( PERSON ) und GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper PERSON published an article on the lecture given by the applicant , mentioning , inter alia , his views on the competences of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

I assume that the statements you made on the ORG \u2019s areas of responsibility have been correctly reproduced in this report , in particular the comment that ORG can , as a court that interprets the law , be appealed to in the event of a disagreement between the Prince and the people .", "You will doubtless remember the discussion between the government and me in the period before DATE , at which you were present as deputy head of government . I drew the government \u2019s attention during this exchange of views at FAC to the fact that it was not abiding by the LAW and read out the relevant Articles thereof . You replied that you did not agree ( or words to that effect ) with these parts of LAW in any case and that you therefore did not consider yourself bound by it . Since the other members of the government did not contradict you , I was forced to assume that the entire government was of the opinion that the CARDINAL bodies that hold supreme power , the people and the Prince , must observe the LAW and the ordinary laws but not the members of the government , who have sworn an oath of allegiance to LAW .", "I considered your statement at that time and the government \u2019s attitude to be incredibly arrogant and therefore informed the government in no uncertain terms that it had lost my confidence . Following the compromise that was fortunately reached a little later between the government and the ORG , on the one hand , and myself , on the other , I declared that I once again had confidence in the government , doing so in the hope that individual members had realised that they had taken up an inexcusable position in relation to our LAW and now recognised that they were bound by it . Just as I would have appointed Mr PERSON head of government , had his party won the election , I appointed you President of ORG on the ORG \u2019s recommendation .", "Unfortunately , I had to realise following the publication of the report in the Liechtensteiner Volksblatt that you still do not consider yourself bound by the LAW and hold views that are clearly in violation of both the spirit and the letter thereof . Anyone reading the relevant Articles of the LAW will be able to establish that ORG has no competence to decide as a court of interpretation in the event of a disagreement between the Prince and the people ( the ORG ) . In my eyes your attitude , PERSON , makes you unsuitable for public office . I do not intend to get involved in a long public or private debate with you , but I should like to inform you in good time that I shall not appoint you again to a public office should you be proposed by the ORG or any other body . I only hope that in your judgments as President of ORG you will abide by LAW and the ordinary laws for the rest of your term of office .", "Yours sincerely ,", "PERSON", "Prince of GPE \u201d", "\u201c PERSON , DATE .

NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the President of the ORG about the letter of CARDINAL DATE . He denied having ever made a statement to the effect that he did not consider himself bound by the LAW or parts thereof . He further explained his research on the competences of ORG in constitutional matters . According to him , the expression of an opinion not shared by the Prince could not be regarded as a failure to comply with LAW . However , taking into account the conclusions drawn by PERSON in the said letter , his office as President of ORG was called into question . The President of the ORG subsequently informed the applicant that the ORG had discussed the matter in camera and had come to the unanimous conclusion that the applicant \u2019s office was not called into question on account of his legal opinions as stated in the context of his lecture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant replied to the letter sent by the Prince on DATE , and enclosed a copy of his letter to the President of the ORG . He explained in particular that it was his conviction as a lawyer that his statements on the occasion of the lecture of DATE , namely that ORG was competent to decide on the interpretation of the LAW in case of a dispute between the Prince and the people ( ORG ) , were correct and did not infringe the LAW . The applicant concluded that the declaration made by the Prince that he did not intend to appoint the applicant to a public office , amounted to an interference with his rights to freedom of opinion and to freedom of thought , as guaranteed under LAW and LAW . It further called into question the constitutional right to equal access to public office and constituted an attempt to interfere with judicial independence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his letter in reply dated DATE , the PERSON noted that PERSON PERSON had distributed the letter of CARDINAL DATE to a large group of persons . The PERSON stated that it had been his intention to avoid a public discussion in informing PERSON , in a personal letter , about his decision as early as possible . He considered that a long debate between them on the question of PERSON qualification for the office of judge was inappropriate , as PERSON had remained in office and the PERSON \u2019s criticism had not been directed at the decisions of ORG , but at Mr PERSON \u2019s general attitude towards the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Prince added that it was left to his discretion whether or not to appoint a candidate for public office and that he was not obliged to give any reasons for such a decision . However , as he had known Mr PERSON for DATE , he had considered it appropriate to state the reasons for his decision regarding him . Moreover , the decision no longer to appoint him to the office of President of CARDINAL of the highest courts , on account of his attitude in the past as well as the opinions expressed by him , did not amount to an interference with PERSON rights to freedom of expression and to freedom of thought . All citizens were free to propose and to plead for amendments to constitutional or other legal provisions . However , PERSON , during his term of office as a member of the government and in his lecture , had not availed himself of such constitutional and democratic means , but had simply ignored those parts of the LAW with which he disagreed .", "CARDINAL . The Prince further explained that the relevant provision , namely LAW , concerned the competence of ORG to decide on the interpretation of the LAW in case of a dispute between the government and the ORG . Confusing the terms \u201c Government \u201d and \u201c ORG \u201d with \u201c Prince \u201d or \u201c people \u201d , as PERSON had done , would undermine the rule of law . As head of ORG , he was obliged to safeguard the constitutional order and the democratic rights of the people . He would be failing in his duties if he were to appoint to CARDINAL of the highest judicial offices a person whom , owing to his attitude and the statements he had made , he could not regard as being committed to upholding the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prince sent to the applicant , President of ORG , an open letter which was published in GPE newspapers . The PERSON noted that PERSON had made public at least part of the PERSON \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE . As this had given rise to various comments , the Prince considered it necessary to explain his point of view in an open letter .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion , in a democratic ORG based on the rule of law ( demokratischer PERSON ) , a distinction had to be drawn between freedom of expression and the means used by an individual for imposing his views in such a society . In that connection , the individual should respect the rules defined in the LAW and other statutory provisions . The Prince further stated that it was the right of PERSON , in his position as a judge , to express the opinion that the monarchy was no longer opportune ; that LAW should be amended ; that the Prince should be subject to the jurisdiction of the GPE judiciary ; and that ORG should be given supplementary competences . However , PERSON was not entitled to place himself above the existing LAW or incite ORG to lay claim to competences which were not vested in it by virtue of LAW . The Prince considered that PERSON , having regard to his education and professional experience , knew that the terms \u201c people \u201d ( \u201c Volk \u201d ) , \u201c ORG \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , \u201c Government \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) and \u201c Prince \u201d ( \u201c FAC ) and their respective rights and obligations were clearly defined in the LAW . The applicant \u2019s contention that these terms were interchangeable would jeopardise the LAW and the constitutional ORG as a whole .", "CARDINAL . The Prince also made reference to the political events in DATE and , lastly , he stated that , on the basis of the article in a GPE newspaper of CARDINAL DATE , he was forced to conclude that PERSON continued to have the intention of placing himself above LAW . He explained that he had therefore intended to inform PERSON , in a personal letter and as early as possible , about his decision not to appoint him to public office in future .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s term of office as President of ORG expired . On DATE ORG decided to propose the applicant again as President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE to the President of the Diet the Prince refused to accept the proposed appointment . He explained that , considering his experiences with PERSON , he had become convinced that PERSON did not feel bound by LAW . In these circumstances , he would be failing in his duties as head of ORG if he were to appoint PERSON PERSON as President of ORG . The Prince further stated that PERSON , on account of his other professional qualifications , had made important contributions as a judge of ORG and that he ( the Prince ) could therefore understand the proposal made to a certain extent . If the ORG did not share his doubts regarding PERSON , it could elect him as associate judge of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is currently employed as a researcher by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
