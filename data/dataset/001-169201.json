Friends , I would like to say a few words about how grateful we are to you . First of all , as you already know , we left \u015e\u0131rnak to go to the peace meeting , PERSON meeting which was organised by PERSON . As a result of the arbitrary security measures taken by the security forces and the fact that we were forced to wait TIME at each checkpoint for identity checks , we were not able to travel as fast as we wanted .
