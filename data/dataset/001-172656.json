On DATE he was working at a factory construction site in the city of GPE . Around TIME , while the applicant and CARDINAL other workers were standing on scaffolding QUANTITY above the ground , the scaffolding broke and all the workers fell to the ground ( hereinafter \u201c the accident \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he fell on his back and hit his head on a concrete surface , causing his helmet to break into pieces . CARDINAL of his coworkers and a metal tool fell on top of him . The applicant lost consciousness . He stated that while he was unconscious , he was moved away from the location of the accident on the orders of his employer and all traces of the accident were removed . At TIME an ambulance was called and the applicant was taken to hospital . It appears that the other workers sustained only minor injuries .", "CARDINAL . The site of the accident was examined DATE by an inspector from ORG . He noted that at the time of the examination the scaffolding was intact and no workers were present at the construction site . The inspector spoke to the construction site manager , ORG , who stated that he had not seen the accident because he had been elsewhere on the site . The inspector also spoke to the person in charge of work safety in the company ORG who informed him that , on the basis of the initial medical examination , the applicant had not sustained any serious injuries . Accordingly , the inspector decided that ORG would not investigate the circumstances of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another inspector from ORG looked into how the accident had happened and concluded that the applicant had fallen from the scaffolding because of his own recklessness . The applicant submitted a complaint against that conclusion and on DATE the ORG adopted a new conclusion , holding that the accident had been caused by \u201c the inappropriate organisation of dangerous work \u201d ( netinkamas pavojingo darbo organizavimas ) , in particular because the scaffolding had not complied with the applicable work safety requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the PERSON city prosecutor \u2019s office ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) to open a pre - trial investigation into the accident . The investigation was opened on DATE and conducted by an investigator from GPE police ( hereinafter \u201c the investigator \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the investigator instructed a court medical expert to examine the applicant \u2019s medical file in order to determine the number , severity and causes of his injuries . The report on the results of that examination , delivered on DATE , showed that the applicant had sustained a large cut on his head , face and right ear , as well as multiple fractures of his facial bones , and a contusion on the chest . The injuries had been caused by blunt objects and flat surfaces , and could have occurred when falling from a height . The report noted that the injury on the head had bled , so there should have been traces of blood at the site of the accident . It concluded that the injuries to the applicant \u2019s head and face amounted to a minor health impairment ( nesunkus sveikatos sutrikdymas ) while the injury to his chest amounted to a negligible health impairment ( ne\u017eymus sveikatos sutrikdymas ) . However , it also noted that the injury to the face would leave a big scar , possibly resulting in disfigurement and impairment of facial expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed as a witness in the investigation . He stated that just before the accident he and CARDINAL other workers had been carrying a metal platform to attach to a reservoir tank . The applicant and CARDINAL other workers had been holding the upper part of the platform while standing on the scaffolding and CARDINAL others had been on the ground , holding the platform \u2019s bottom part . The weight of the platform was QUANTITY . Suddenly , the scaffolding had collapsed and CARDINAL workers had fallen to the ground . At that point the applicant had lost consciousness . When he had come to , he had realised that he was not lying near the scaffolding , where he must have fallen , but in a different place . He had not seen any debris from the scaffolding around him , or any other traces of the accident .", "On DATE the applicant was granted the status of a victim in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator instructed a court medical expert to examine the applicant \u2019s scars caused by the accident . The report on the results of that examination , delivered on DATE , found that the facial injury had left a large , rough scar , causing a minor disfigurement and impairment of facial expression . It also found that the scar and the resulting deformation could only be removed by plastic surgery , so the injury was considered as irreparable . As a result , the report concluded that the applicant \u2019s injury was legally classified as serious health impairment ( sunkus sveikatos sutrikdymas ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the investigator interviewed several of the applicant \u2019s co - workers and other people who had worked near the factory construction site . It appears that the co - workers stated that no platform had been carried on DATE of the accident . None of those interviewed had seen how the applicant had fallen from the scaffolding . From DATE more witnesses were interviewed and the investigator requested various documents from the applicant \u2019s employer and from several ORG institutions which had assessed the applicant \u2019s health and ability to work after the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed again . He stated that before the accident he had sometimes felt dizzy and had a feeling of numbness in his legs , but he had been declared fit to work after a medical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation . He relied on ORG report that no damage to the scaffolding on DATE of the accident had been observed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and noted that none of the witnesses had corroborated the applicant \u2019s description of how he had fallen . The prosecutor observed that the applicant may have fallen from the scaffolding owing to his own recklessness ( d\u0117l savo paties neatsargumo ) , possibly because of the numbness in his legs . Accordingly , the prosecutor decided that the scaffolding had complied with safety requirements , and that there were no grounds to find that the applicant \u2019s employer had violated any laws .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision . He also asked for the appointment of a different prosecutor to supervise the case and to carry out a forensic examination in order to determine the causes of the accident . On DATE a senior prosecutor dismissed his appeal , noting that around CARDINAL witnesses had been questioned , but nobody had corroborated the applicant \u2019s claims . However , on DATE ORG overruled the prosecutor \u2019s decision and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court noted that the prosecutor had not addressed ORG conclusion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that other witnesses had only stated that they had not seen how the applicant had fallen from the scaffolding but had not disputed his account . The court also considered that the prosecutor \u2019s conclusion that the applicant had fallen because of his own recklessness or a medical condition had been \u201c speculative and not based on any objective facts \u201d . However , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request to appoint a different prosecutor as unfounded and did not examine his request to carry out a forensic examination , noting that the choice of investigative measures was the prerogative of investigators and prosecutors .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the investigator examined the site of the accident and interviewed more witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor instructed the investigator to carry out several additional investigative measures . Among other things , the investigator was requested to identify whether on DATE of the accident or earlier the applicant and other workers had been ordered by their employer to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the investigator carried out additional interviews with several witnesses and requested further information from the applicant \u2019s employer and from the medical institutions which had examined him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a prior complaint by the applicant , the deputy chief prosecutor of the Klaip\u0117da city prosecutor \u2019s office informed him that there were no grounds to find that the pre - trial investigation in his case had been unduly protracted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s co - worker PERSON submitted a written statement to ORG that on DATE of the accident he and other workers had been ordered by their supervisor ORG to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank . ORG also submitted that the scaffolding had been made of very thin wood and could have broken at any time . He further alleged that immediately after the accident the director of the company ORG had told other workers to repair the scaffolding . PERSON also asserted that he had previously given different testimony because of pressure from his employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a complaint by the applicant about the length of the investigation , the chief prosecutor of the ORG city prosecutor \u2019s office noted that \u201c the investigation had not always been of sufficient intensity \u201d ( tyrimo intensyvumas ne visada buvo pakankamas ) and that the prosecutor had been instructed to set a deadline for completing the investigation . The chief prosecutor also informed the applicant that it was still necessary to interview several witnesses living in various parts of the country and to carry out further investigative measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a new conclusion on the circumstances of the accident , holding that the scaffolding had not complied with applicable safety requirements and that the applicant had not been given appropriate instructions for working at height . Accordingly , the ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s employer had breached the legal requirements concerning safety at work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation . He observed that the applicant and other workers had been using the scaffolding for DATE before the accident and there had not been any accidents during that time , so there were no grounds to find that the scaffolding had been unsafe . The prosecutor also concluded that the workers had not been ordered by their employer to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank because the construction manager , ORG , had not been at work on DATE of the accident . Accordingly , the employer could not be held responsible for the workers\u2019 decision to carry the platform on the scaffolding . The prosecutor further observed that , in any event , the applicant had had the right to refuse to carry out tasks which were unsafe or for which he was unqualified , but he had not exercised that right . The prosecutor therefore concluded that the accident had been caused by the recklessness of the workers and not by the actions or omissions of the employer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision but on DATE a senior prosecutor dismissed his appeal . However , on CARDINAL DATE ORG overruled the prosecutor \u2019s decision and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court observed that the absence of previous accidents on the scaffolding could not be interpreted as evidence that the scaffolding was safe . It also held that the applicant \u2019s right to refuse to carry out tasks in unsafe conditions did not excuse the employer from a duty to ensure that unsafe conditions did not exist at the workplace . The court further noted that attaching the platform to the reservoir tank had clearly been part of the construction work , so the employer had a duty to properly supervise the workers and to instruct them how to carry out that task safely DATE and by failing to do so , the applicant \u2019s employer had acted contrary to the law .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed against that judgment , but on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . In its judgment the court noted that although DATE had passed since the accident , the prosecutor had still not determined the precise way in which the accident had happened , and that without doing that it was not possible to determine who had been responsible for it . The court also considered it unlikely that the workers would have decided to attach the platform without receiving an order from their supervisor or at least informing him , so it was necessary to examine whether the construction manager ORG had been present at the construction site at any time DATE . Lastly , the court drew attention to the fact that \u201c some witnesses \u201d had admitted to giving false testimony under pressure from the employer and so it was necessary to investigate those claims further .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the investigator arranged several formal confrontations between witnesses , interviewed additional witnesses , and requested further information from the applicant \u2019s employer and the hospital where the applicant had been examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a complaint by the applicant , the deputy chief prosecutor of the PERSON region prosecutor \u2019s office sent a note to the PERSON city prosecutor \u2019s office , observing that the pre - trial investigation had been going on for DATE , and requesting that it promptly carry out any necessary further investigative measures in order to make a well - founded final decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after an application by the prosecutor , ORG ordered a forensic examination of the precise way in which the accident had happened and its causes . The forensic expert examined the case file and delivered a report on DATE . The report noted that there was insufficient information in the case file concerning the technical characteristics of the metal platform and the scaffolding , so the way the accident had happened could be established only in part . On the basis of the available material , the report found that the weight of the platform had exceeded the weight limit of the scaffolding and had thus caused it to collapse . Accordingly , it concluded that the scaffolding had not been suitable for the work for which it was used , and that the workers had not been adequately informed about how to carry out their work safely . The report found that the employer had thereby breached the applicable work safety requirements .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the investigator interviewed additional witnesses and arranged formal confrontations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the pre - trial investigation . He held that witness testimony and other evidence showed that the applicant \u2019s supervisor ORG had not been present at the construction site on DATE of the accident and that he had not ordered the workers to attach the platform . As a result , the prosecutor concluded that ORG had not had any duty to ensure the safety of that operation . He further concluded that the accident had been caused by the workers\u2019 reckless decision to carry the platform , which had exceeded the weight limit of the scaffolding . The prosecutor noted that although the scaffolding had not fully complied with the applicable safety requirements , that had not been the main cause of the accident and thus the applicant \u2019s employer could be held liable only for an administrative offence of failure to comply with work safety requirements ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but not for a criminal offence .", "The prosecutor also observed that a separate pre - trial investigation should be opened in order to examine the claims of some witnesses that they had been pressured by their employer to give false testimony . However , from the material available to the ORG it appears that no such investigation was opened .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision , but on DATE a senior prosecutor dismissed his appeal . However , on DATE ORG overruled the prosecutor \u2019s decision and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court underlined that attaching the platform to the reservoir tank had been an inherent part of the construction work carried out by the applicant and other workers , so it could not be considered that they had decided to do that of their own free will . It referred to the expert report of CARDINAL DATE , noting that that report had given grounds to believe that the applicant \u2019s employer had failed to ensure safe working conditions . The court further noted that ORG had not been officially authorised to leave his workplace on DATE of the accident , and thus he had failed to ensure the safety of the workers under his supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.J.S. was officially notified that he , being a person authorised by an employer to supervise construction work , was suspected of violating safety requirements at work , which had resulted in an accident , as set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the investigator interviewed ORG and several witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant complained to ORG that the pre - trial investigation had been protracted , in particular because it had been discontinued and reopened several times . On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint and stated that the repeated discontinuation of the investigation did not give grounds to find that any requirements of LAW had been violated .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the investigator carried out additional interviews with several witnesses and requested further information from the applicant \u2019s employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that the pre - trial investigation had been completed . ORG submitted a request to continue the investigation and carry out additional investigative measures but that request was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor issued an indictment against ORG under LAW and on DATE the case was transferred to ORG for examination on the merits . On DATE the chairperson of that court noted that the case was complex and large - scale , and allowed DATE to prepare for its examination .", "CARDINAL . ORG held the first hearing on DATE and decided to adjourn the case until DATE because several witnesses were not present .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE but several witnesses were absent again and ORG fined them for failing to appear . The court also decided to adjourn the case until DATE in order to ensure the participation of all the necessary witnesses and , as requested by the applicant , to obtain the technical details about the metal platform .", "CARDINAL . It appears that subsequently the case was adjourned again and a new hearing was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a medical certificate to the court indicating that he would be sick from CARDINAL to DATE , and asked for a further adjournment .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE but because of the absence of the accused it was decided to adjourn and to schedule a new hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE V.J.S. \u2019s lawyer informed ORG that his client was still sick and had a medical certificate that was valid for DATE . The court scheduled new hearings for CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a civil claim against ORG , asking for non - pecuniary damages of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.J.S. \u2019s lawyer asked the court to adjourn the case again because his client had been admitted to hospital . Later , ORG submitted a medical certificate indicating that he would be sick from DATE , which also showed that he would undergo rehabilitation treatment from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE and decided to adjourn until DATE . Subsequently , owing to the continued illness of the accused , the case was adjourned until DATE , then again until DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to continue its examination of the case in the absence of the accused , complaining that the latter was deliberately avoiding appearing before the court . ORG dismissed that application , informing the applicant that ORG had submitted the required medical certificates to prove his illness and that domestic law did not allow for the examination of a criminal case in the absence of the accused . The court also noted that examination of the case had not been unduly protracted because the hearings had been scheduled with as little time between them as possible .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , owing to the accused \u2019s continued illness , the court further adjourned the case to DATE , DATE , and then to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the court to adjourn the hearing because he had to be admitted to hospital for surgery .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE from which the applicant was absent . During the hearing the prosecutor asked the court to terminate the case against ORG as time - barred . The court adopted a decision on CARDINAL DATE and terminated the case . It noted that ORG had been charged with a crime of negligence , and in such cases the statute of limitations , applicable at the time of the accident , was DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court also observed that the domestic law provisions on the statute of limitations , applicable at the time of the accident , were \u201c unconditional \u201d ( bes\u0105lygi\u0161kos nuostatos ) and did not provide for the possibility to suspend the limitation period . The domestic law was subsequently amended to allow such a decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but the new legal framework could not be applied retroactively to the detriment of the accused .", "The court did not examine the applicant \u2019s civil claim and noted that he had the right to institute separate civil proceedings for damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the examination of the case before the district court had been so protracted that it had become time - barred , and asked the regional court to identify the reasons for that protraction . The court considered that complaint as an appeal by the applicant against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE but refused to admit it because the applicant had not signed it or properly outlined the reasons for the appeal . The applicant did not submit another appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG appealed against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and asked the court to examine the case on the merits and to acquit him , but on DATE his appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in response to a complaint by the applicant , informed him that it had analysed the work of the prosecutors involved in the case and had not detected any \u201c substantial violations \u201d ( esminiai pa\u017eeidimai ) of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
