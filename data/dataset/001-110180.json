The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when he reached retirement age , the applicant worked as a minister of ORG . During DATE as a minister , he received remuneration from ORG . However , ORG did not pay any social security contributions on his behalf , as there was no provision in NORP law for it to do so .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had previously worked as an employee DATE and DATE . After being ordained he again worked as a salaried employee from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , while carrying out his duties as a minister .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG ( ORG ) for a retirement pension . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected his application on the grounds that he had not completed the minimum period of pensionable service , that is , DATE ( DATE ) . Added together , the CARDINAL periods during which the applicant contributed , DATE and DATE , totalled DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the LOC to reconsider his case . In CARDINAL decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG again rejected the applicant \u2019s claims , confirming its initial decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings against the LOC before ORG to secure a retirement pension . He alleged that he was being discriminated against in so far as the legislation provided for NORP priests to receive a retirement pension as they were part of the general social security scheme .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG no . CARDINAL allowed the applicant \u2019s claims and ordered the LOC to pay him a retirement pension . Analysing the changes in the legislation on the subject , the court considered that the law clearly treated NORP priests more favourably than NORP ministers , which was contrary to the secularity of the ORG enshrined in the LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court noted that even prior to the promulgation of LAW the first paragraph of LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE had already established that priests and ministers of all faiths and churches registered with ORG should be treated as salaried employees and be covered by the social security scheme . However , the second paragraph of that same Article specified that this was for immediate application only in respect of NORP priests , which was done by order of ORG on DATE . CARDINAL subsequent ORG ( nos . DATE and DATE of DATE ) provided for NORP clergy and priests who left the priesthood or ceased their religious activities to be able to count all their DATE of service with the church towards DATE of contributions necessary to qualify for a retirement pension , provided that they made the capital payments corresponding to DATE . ORG ministers were brought into the scheme DATE after their NORP counterparts , by LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , although they were not given the same possibility as NORP priests of making up the missing annuities to qualify for a retirement pension . The court observed that by the time this decree took effect the applicant had ceased his pastoral activities , and according to the provisions of the decree DATE as a minister could not be taken into account in calculating his years of contribution . The court considered that depriving the applicant of access to a retirement pension in the same conditions as those enjoyed by NORP priests violated his right to equal treatment and freedom of worship enshrined in the LAW . The court referred to LAW ( PERSON del Poder Judicial LOPJ ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and noted that LAW ) of LAW stated : \u201c It is the responsibility of the public powers to promote conditions so that liberty and equality of the individual and the groups he joins will be real and effective , to remove those obstacles which impede or make difficult their full implementation , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural , and social life \u201d . Consequently , in the interest of the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights the court considered that the provisions applied to NORP priests \u2013 particularly Royal Decrees DATE could be applied to the applicant by analogy , enabling him to accumulate the minimum number of DATE of contribution thanks to DATE as a minister , provided that he paid the capital corresponding to those missing DATE . It awarded the applicant a retirement pension from DATE , on the basis of MONEY ( ORG ) DATE .", "CARDINAL . The LOC lodged a s\u00faplica appeal against that decision . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside the first - instance judgment . It noted that ORG ministers had been included in the general ORG scheme by PERSON of DATE approving the cooperation agreement between the ORG and ORG religious entities of GPE ( FEREDE ) . The right of ORG ministers to contribute and to receive the corresponding benefits had thus come into being under that law and the practical conditions of their integration in the general ORG scheme had been laid out in LAW . In the instant case the court observed that the applicant had reached retirement age in DATE , prior to the enactment of PERSON , which would have allowed him to pay ORG contributions in order to be entitled to a pension . The fact that the applicant \u2019s DATE of pastoral activity could not be taken into consideration was not the result of inactivity on the part of the ORG but of a lack of legislation because of the failure of the ORG and the various ORG authorities to reach an agreement . In the light of these considerations the court deemed that the applicant did not satisfy the statutory conditions to qualify for a retirement pension , which was a matter of ordinary law and not of discrimination in comparison with the situation of NORP priests .", "CARDINAL .
