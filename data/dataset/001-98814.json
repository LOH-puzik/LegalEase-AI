DATE and DATE he was detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant described the conditions in FAC as follows : Since he was unable to fulfil the obligations incumbent on healthy inmates , he needed to sleep in his clothes in an undone bed and use his jacket as a blanket in order to avoid being sanctioned for violating the daily routine of making the bed on time . With no assistance from staff , he could wash or relieve himself only if his cellmates helped him do so . He was not provided with a proper bath chair ; instead , he was given a wooden toilet - seat which \u2013 unfit for the purposes of bathing \u2013 rotted away fast and on CARDINAL occasion , broke under him . Because of harassment from fellow inmates on account of his disability and incontinence , he did not participate in the DATE open - air stays . Classified as a ' Grade CARDINAL ' security - level prisoner , he was transported with his hands handcuffed to his belt at all times . While being transported in this posture in a van without a safety belt , he could keep himself in his wheelchair only by supporting his body by leaning his head against the door of the transport cabin . As a consequence , he regularly suffered swellings on his head . When entering or exiting the transport van , staff dragged him by his belt , sometimes on the floor causing him bruises ; an incident of this kind took place on DATE . On other occasions , his wheelchair \u2013 with the applicant , weighing QUANTITY , sitting in it \u2013 was rolled down the van 's steps .", "CARDINAL .

Its findings included the following :", "\u201c The applicant 's cell is located on the ground floor ... , next to the medical consultancy room . It is suitable for accommodating CARDINAL inmates , but CARDINAL inmates , including the applicant , are actually placed in it . The furniture is refurbished and adjusted to the applicant 's health needs : the table is elevated , the beds are single rather than bunk beds , the wardrobe and the mirror are placed at a height reachable by the applicant , entrance obstacles have been removed and a handrail has been fitted next to the toilet . A cellmate has voluntarily undertaken the task of keeping the cell tidy and helping the applicant perform his everyday duties . The applicant has never been reproached for a violation of the prison cell order .", "A hot water shower ( bath ) has been provided to the applicant on a DATE basis . A hand shower and a bath chair are available to him . ... A cellmate has voluntarily undertaken to help the applicant wash himself . ...", "...

According to the findings of the investigation , the applicant suffered light scratches and bruises [ while in transport ] in DATE and DATE . Therefore the prison management instructed staff to proceed with special care in respect of the applicant . According to the opinion of the competent health organ , the applicant 's transport did not require the participation of medical staff .", "On DATE the applicant requested to be transferred to ORG . His request was dismissed by ORG on DATE on the ground that he was serving his sentence in a penitentiary institution whose strictness was commensurate with the offence he had committed and with the regime imposed on him ; where his nursing and medical supervision was resolved and where physical obstacles had been removed in order to ensure his free movement in a wheelchair . The applicant filed a complaint against the decision . The complaint was dismissed by the ORG Commander on DATE and his transfer was not authorised . According to the reasoning of the decision , ' [ the applicant did ] not require permanent nursing or medical supervision . At his present place of detention , alterations had been made in the building , as required by his disability . Medical treatment , as appropriate in his present state , can be provided for him at his present place of detention , where the circumstances have been adjusted to his needs ...

Concerning open - air stays , he explained that the surface of the courtyard in question was uneven and therefore unsuitable for a wheelchair .", "CARDINAL . Given that other criminal proceedings were pending against him , the applicant had to be regularly transported to GPE to stand trial . In a complaint dated DATE and addressed to the head of ORG , the applicant submitted that on DATE , DATE he had been placed in an admission cell in which he had had to spend TIME with no access to water and without any possibility to change his diapers . He also submitted that during the transport he had been placed in a CARDINAL - person box of the van where he had suffered bruises : in a road curve , he had fallen out of his wheelchair and had been travelling on the floor of the van , handcuffed to his belt , with his arms under his body .

On DATE the applicant was transferred to FAC where he was placed in a single cell specially designed for disabled inmates . On DATE he was examined by a forensic medical expert . In his opinion the expert stated :", "\u201c ... [ In respect of standing up ] the inmate ... partly or wholly exaggerates his pains ... [ He is ] PERCENT disabled ...

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( VII.CARDINAL . ) of the Minister of ORG ) . Allocation is made either by the prosecutor , the court or the reception committee of the establishment . The ORG was informed that courts and prosecutors tend to attribute this grade to prisoners accused or convicted of serious crimes ( especially persons involved in organised crime activities ) and the prison reception committees , to persons with a previous record of ill discipline ( including those prone to escape or those who have attempted suicide ) or with a military background .", "The status of Grade CARDINAL prisoners is reviewed DATE .

However , the other long - standing recommendations of the CPT \u2013 concerning the provision to the inmates concerned of written information on the reasons for the measure and offering them an opportunity to express their views on DATE had not been implemented .", "Many Grade CARDINAL prisoners interviewed by the delegation complained that they had not been informed of the reasons for the measure , had had no involvement in the review procedure and had received no information on the possibilities to contest it . Further , it was generally felt that the periodic review of the Grade CARDINAL status was a pure formality . The examination of relevant documentation and interviews with inmates led the delegation to conclude that the determining factors in retaining the Grade CARDINAL status were historical ones , like the violent nature of the crime committed ( often many years before ) , rather than an assessment of the inmate 's current dangerousness or propensity to act again in an unacceptable way . ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
