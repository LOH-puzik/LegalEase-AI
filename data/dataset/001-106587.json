The court took note of that retraction and nevertheless observed that the applicant \u2019s new version of events contradicted other findings in the case . Those findings were based , inter alia , on full or partial confessions explicitly made by some of his accomplices during the trial , in the presence of their advocates . In addition , the court analysed the transcripts of the taped telephone conversations , arriving at the conclusion that , despite their coded language , they confirmed the existence of a conspiracy between the applicant and other defendants .
