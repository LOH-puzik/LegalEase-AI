THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and thereafter lived illegally at an address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Whilst living in GPE the applicant successfully applied for CARDINAL jobs using a false NORP passport . DATE and DATE he was employed by a recruitment agency . DATE and DATE he was employed in a cash and carry business and DATE and DATE he was employed as a forklift truck driver .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had used the false passport to support his assertion that he was entitled to work in GPE . All of his employers subsequently stated that they would not have employed him had they known of his true immigration status . DATE and DATE the applicant earned a total gross salary of MONEY ( GBP ) from his employment . At DATE he had total savings of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant applied to the Driving and ORG for a provisional driving licence . The application was accompanied by the same false NORP passport that the applicant had used to obtain employment in GPE . When the falsity of the passport was discovered , the police were informed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty in ORG at GPE to CARDINAL counts of dishonestly obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception ( counts CARDINAL , CARDINAL on the indictment ) . He also pleaded guilty to CARDINAL count of having a false identity document with intent ( count CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL count of driving whilst disqualified ( count CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL count of driving a motor vehicle without insurance ( count CARDINAL ) . On DATE the applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for the first CARDINAL counts together with a consecutive sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for the offence of driving whilst disqualified . No separate sentence was imposed for driving without insurance . The trial judge also recommended the applicant for deportation .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the custodial sentence and the recommendation for deportation , the prosecution sought a confiscation order under section CARDINAL of the Proceeds of Crime Act DATE in respect of the applicant \u2019s earnings ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . The trial judge accepted that the applicant had paid all the tax and national insurance due on his earnings and that the money he had made from his employment had been truly earned . After deducting tax and national insurance payments , it was calculated that the benefit the applicant received from his earnings was GBP CARDINAL . It was agreed that of the GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL the applicant still had assets of ORG . On this basis , on DATE the trial judge imposed a confiscation order in the sum of ORG upon the applicant , with a consecutive sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment to be served in default of payment . Thus , the confiscation order had the effect of depriving the applicant of all of the savings that he had accumulated during DATE of employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought an extension of time within which to appeal to ORG against the imposition of the confiscation order . In his grounds of appeal , he contended that the grant of the confiscation order had not respected \u201c NORP law \u201d . That application was refused on DATE . The Single Judge noted that the applicant had failed to establish good reason for the extension of time sought and that he had no arguable grounds of appeal because he had benefited from the use of the false passport to the extent that it had enabled him to work and earn money and there had been no breach of his rights under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant renewed his application before ORG which , on DATE , granted him an extension of time and leave to appeal . Leading counsel was appointed on his behalf . Counsel initially argued first ; that the applicant \u2019s earnings were not a relevant benefit from criminal conduct within the meaning of LAW DATE ; and secondly , that the prosecutor \u2019s decision to seek a confiscation order in this case constituted an abuse of process .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal heard part of the appeal on DATE . However , it decided to adjourn the appeal pending the publication by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of guidance for prosecutors on the circumstances under which a confiscation order could be sought .", "CARDINAL . In a supplementary skeleton argument dated DATE , counsel for the applicant accepted that in light of the decision in R v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] PERSON ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) , the court was bound to reject the first ground of appeal , namely that the applicant \u2019s earnings were not a relevant \u201c benefit \u201d . He therefore accepted that the issue on appeal was whether it was oppressive and therefore an abuse of process for the ORG to seek and the court to impose a confiscation order for what amounted to the applicant \u2019s entire savings over DATE of genuine work . In this regard , counsel submitted that there would be an abuse of process where , on a correct application of the law to the facts , the resulting \u201c benefit \u201d figure yielded a disproportionate or oppressive result . He further noted that ORG has intended LAW DATE to be applied in a manner compatible with the requirements of the Convention . Therefore , in light of LAW No . CARDINAL , in order to remain proportionate the application of the confiscation regime had to remain rationally connected to the public interest aims pursued and go no further than necessary to achieve them . It was therefore submitted that to seek the imposition of a confiscation order on the basis of a benefit figure which far exceeded the value of the defendant \u2019s crimes could properly be described as disproportionate \u2013 either in the traditional sense used in criminal sentencing ( \u201c not fitting the punishment to the crime \u201d ) or in the language of LAW and was therefore an abusive exercise of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that a confiscation order could be described as oppressive where it did not pursue any of the legitimate aims of the confiscation regime and/or did not further the Parliamentary intent of stripping defendants of the proceeds of crime . He reiterated that ORG had intended the legislation to be compatible with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the ORG guidance had been promulgated ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) , ORG held that the decision to seek a confiscation order against the applicant did not constitute an abuse of process . The court therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the order . In reaching this conclusion , ORG said that the guidance represented a fair analysis of the effect of previous ORG and ORG decisions on the confiscation order regime .", "CARDINAL . The court stated :", "\u201c Abuses of the confiscation process may occur and , when they do , the appropriate remedy will normally be a stay of proceedings . However an abuse of process can not be founded on the basis that the consequences of the proper application of the legislative structure may produce an \u2018 ORG result with which the judge may be unhappy . Although the court may , of its own initiative , invoke the confiscation process , the responsibility for deciding whether properly to seek a confiscation order is effectively vested in the Crown . When it does so , the court lacks any corresponding discretion to interfere with that decision if it has been made in accordance with the statute . The just result of these proceedings is the result produced by the proper application of the statutory provisions as interpreted in ORG and in this court . However to conclude that proceedings properly taken in accordance with statutory provisions constitute an abuse of process is tantamount to asserting a power in the court to dispense with the statute .", "As a matter of principle , that is impermissible , and this court has said so . This , in R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL CAR ( S ) CARDINAL , it was observed :", "\u2018 This jurisdiction must be exercised with considerable caution , indeed sparingly . It must be confined to cases of true oppression . In particular , it can not be exercised PERSON simply on the grounds that the judge disagrees with the decision of the ORG to pursue confiscation , or with the way it puts its case on that topic.\u2019", "We repeat what was said at an earlier hearing involving PERSON .", "\u2018 The abuse of process jurisdiction is one which needs to be exercised with great circumspection . The jurisdiction can not be converted on a case by case basis into a structure which involves , on proper analysis , something like wholesale undermining of the statutory provisions . It is not easy to conclude that it is an abuse of process for those responsible for enforcing legislation to see that it is indeed properly LAW \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that applicant \u2019s case could not be distinguished from its previous ruling in R v PERSON and Others ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It concluded :", "\u201c The reality is that throughout the period of his employment [ the applicant ] was relying on a continuing dishonest representation to CARDINAL different employers . He deceived them into thinking that he was entitled to obtain employment with them . That was a crucial element of his criminality . His earnings , of course , reflected the fact that he had done the necessary work , as we shall assume , to the satisfaction of his various employers . But the opportunity for him to do so , that is the pecuniary advantage , was unlawfully obtained . If the employee worked to his employer \u2019s satisfaction , and he paid his tax and ORG contributions on his earnings , and his deception either lacked any significant wider public interest , or , perhaps because of the passage of time , but for whatever reason , had ceased to have any meaningful effect on his ORG decision to continue his employment , the resolution of the issue might well be different . As it is there was here a wider public interest . The appellant was deliberately circumventing the prohibition against him seeking remunerative employment in this country in any capacity . No basis for interfering with the order made in ORG has been shown . In our judgment the appropriate link between the appellant \u2019s earnings and his criminal offences , in the context of the wider public interest , was plainly established . The appeal therefore fails . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to certify a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Enforcement proceedings have since been instigated against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum in GPE , alleging that his father had been killed in a land dispute between the PERSON and PERSON community and that he would be at risk in GPE owing to his PERSON ethnicity . On DATE his application was refused by the Secretary of ORG for ORG , who found no objective evidence that the PERSON were targeted solely on account of their ethnicity , and that the delay in claiming asylum had adversely affected the credibility of the rest of the applicant \u2019s claim . A deportation order made by the Secretary of ORG was served on the applicant on DATE . On DATE the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the refusal of asylum and the decision to make a deportation order . This application was refused by ORG on DATE as the application had been lodged out of time and , in any event , the applicant had failed to avail himself of his statutory appeal rights by applying to the then ORG . His renewed application for judicial review was rejected by ORG on DATE . However , it appears that on DATE the applicant submitted a notice of appeal to ORG . This was rejected by the ORG on DATE as out of time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
