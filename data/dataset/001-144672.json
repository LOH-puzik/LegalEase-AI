De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She has suffered from a psychotic disorder for a number of years and has been admitted to psychiatric hospitals for treatment several times since DATE . The present case concerns CARDINAL consecutive periods of confinement in such hospitals DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s family physician received a telephone call from the local police informing him that the applicant had broken into an unoccupied house , apparently with the intention of sleeping there , and that they were having trouble communicating with her . He referred her to ORG , a public healthcare institution , indicating that she was disturbing the environment and behaving psychotically .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the closed ward of ORG . On admission , she signed a consent form for confinement and psychiatric treatment . In her exchange with the hospital staff , the applicant said that she was \u201c possessed by energetic and physical people sent to her through the lens of cameras operated by President PERSON \u201d . The psychiatrists treating her diagnosed her with schizophrenia and noted that she exhibited \u201c delusional interpretations and perceptual anomalies as well as features of depersonalisation and derealisation \u201d . The applicant was started on medication consisting of DATE CARDINAL times a day , CARDINAL ORG tablets a day , QUANTITY of ORG CARDINAL times a day , and an ampoule each of GPE and ORG a day . No mention was made in her medical records of her having refused to take any medication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started to ask how long she would have to stay in the hospital and told the psychiatrists that she would resist . The hospital notified ORG of her confinement , indicating the reasons given by the family physician for referring her to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a lawyer , ORG , to represent the applicant in proceedings it had commenced in her respect . It also scheduled a confinement hearing for DATE . A notification of the hearing , addressed to the applicant , was sent to the hospital ; however , it is not clear when or whether it was received by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held regarding the applicant \u2019s confinement . The applicant and CARDINAL of the psychiatrists treating her were heard . The psychiatrist stated that the applicant had apparently been living in a garage and had broken into a house , and that she had been found wandering around and had been psychotic and uncontrollable . The applicant stated that she would rather be at home , that she did not understand why she had been taken to the hospital , but that other people she named , including a former politician , might have more of an idea . She provided an account of the events which had taken place prior to her confinement , in which she made no mention of having broken into a house . She also stated that she missed her father , and that she had been taking medication while at home .", "CARDINAL . In DATE that followed , the applicant continued her treatment and , according to the medical records , also continued to agree to therapy . On DATE the GPE was replaced with GPE and the dosage of ORG was reduced to CARDINAL mg a day . Eventually , the applicant was taken off the ORG altogether .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant gave PERSON , a lawyer from GPE , power of attorney . She told the representative that she was receiving treatment against her will , but was afraid to refuse it for fear that medication would be administered to her by force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative PERSON notified the hospital that the applicant did not consent to her medical treatment and requested ORG to inform the applicant of her treatment and its side effects . She also pointed out that the applicant had the right to express her own free will and to refuse the treatment if she so wished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through her representative PERSON , lodged a constitutional complaint against the \u201c material act \u201d of her involuntary confinement and an application for a review of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of ORG , and of sections CARDINAL of ORG . She alleged , inter alia , that she was unable to effectively enforce her right to judicial review in the involuntary confinement proceedings , as no formal decision had been rendered until that time . She therefore argued that ORG should examine the alleged violations of her human rights committed through the \u201c material act \u201d of her confinement , as any other interpretation would constitute a breach of her right to judicial review within the meaning of LAW . In addition , she requested that the disputed legislation be repealed with immediate effect , and that she be released from the hospital pending a decision on her confinement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote to the hospital again , asking it to stop forcibly administering medication to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from the closed to the open ward of ORG . On DATE ORG was informed of the applicant \u2019s transfer and terminated the proceedings regarding her confinement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discharged from ORG at her own request . In this regard , it was noted by her psychiatrists that she no longer exhibited any manifestly psychotic symptoms , but that she should continue medical treatment to prevent herself from having a psychotic relapse with violent outbursts . The final diagnosis listed in the applicant \u2019s medical records was disorganised ( hebephrenic ) schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE against her involuntary confinement in ORG for failure to exhaust the available remedies . It also rejected a further constitutional complaint she had lodged on DATE relating to her confinement in ORG on the same grounds ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It found that these complaints had been lodged even before the first - instance decisions on the involuntary confinement were rendered . As regards the applicant \u2019s application for a review of the provisions of ORG , ORG reiterated its findings in an earlier decision ( no . ORG ) that the DATE time - limit for issuing a court order for confinement could be too long ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) . However , it was not possible to repeal the disputed legislation with immediate effect , as that would leave a sizeable gap in the legal system , so the application was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to the emergency medical services by the police . On arrival , she stated that she was being \u201c raped by the police , the emergency medical technicians , everybody \u201d . The emergency physician referred her to ORG , a public healthcare institution , where she was taken by ambulance . It was noted in her admission record that her speech was dissociated and that she exhibited signs of paranoia and megalomaniac delusions . Under the heading \u201c the degree of the patient \u2019s rejection of hospitalisation \u201d the emergency psychiatrist circled the statement that the applicant \u201c accepted hospitalisation owing to the situation ( the staff being present ) \u201d . Under the heading \u201c the need to use compulsory measures on patients rejecting hospitalisation \u201d the psychiatrist circled the statement \u201c negative attitude , no compulsory measures necessary \u201d . It is evident from the applicant \u2019s medical records that during DATE of her admission , she was restless , talkative and unable to follow the activity programme . She spent DATE of her treatment in the admission ward .", "CARDINAL . As of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was placed in the closed ward . Based on her medical records , it appears that she remained talkative but found it somewhat difficult to engage in meaningful discussion . She still exhibited delusions of persecution and was convinced that her father had bribed the doctors and the police to keep her in the hospital . She was also convinced that the garage where she had been living was bugged by the ORG . On DATE the applicant was visited by her representative PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was given CARDINAL drops of GPE CARDINAL times DATE , CARDINAL ORG tablets a day and CARDINAL mg of GPE CARDINAL times a day . The GPE was subsequently replaced with QUANTITY of ORG CARDINAL times a day . In the latter stages of her treatment , the applicant received ORG and CARDINAL mg of GPE CARDINAL times a day . Eventually , the applicant was only treated with GPE . During the treatment she often complained of various physical pains and discomfort , in particular painful muscle spasms and toothache .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG of her confinement and lodged an application for an interlocutory order that her medical treatment be discontinued and that she be released from the hospital pending a final decision on the matter . On DATE the applicant also lodged a constitutional complaint against the \u201c material act \u201d of her confinement and an application for a review of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of ORG and of sections CARDINAL of ORG . The applicant \u2019s notification of involuntary confinement was received by the local court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a lawyer , GPE , to represent the applicant in the involuntary confinement proceedings . On DATE a hearing was held which took TIME . The applicant \u2019s court - appointed representative was present , but , according to the applicant , did not participate actively . At the hearing , the applicant was examined by an expert from another healthcare institution , who immediately upon examination submitted an opinion stating that the applicant \u2019s narrative showed signs of a paranoid delusional system which had probably lasted for a long time and to which she was uncritical . She considered that the applicant needed treatment in a closed ward for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Based on this expert opinion , ORG ordered that the applicant be confined in the closed ward of ORG until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s application for an interlocutory order was dismissed by ORG on the grounds that personality rights could not be protected by injunctive relief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by her court - appointed lawyer GPE , who wanted her to give him the power of attorney . According to the applicant \u2019s medical records , the psychiatrist on duty was informed of the visit and gave his consent for the applicant to sign the document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG order regarding her continued confinement and the dismissal of her application for an interlocutory order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant spoke to the then head of the hospital , complaining that there was no reason for her to remain there . She also stated that she did not understand why she was on medication , although she did confirm that she was taking ORG as part of her outpatient treatment .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , which relied on her medical records , later that day the applicant was transferred to the open ward of ORG . The applicant , however , maintained that the transfer took place on DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative PERSON notified ORG of the applicant \u2019s transfer .", "CARDINAL . During the course of her stay in the open ward of the hospital , on DATE the applicant was allowed by her psychiatrist to withdraw some of the money she had received as social assistance . In addition , on CARDINAL DATE she was permitted to recover her clothes . She was allowed to leave the hospital LOC for TIME several times during her stay , on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE , and CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE . Her psychiatrists noted that she was disciplined in her outings and always returned to the hospital at the designated time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decisions of CARDINAL and DATE and remitted the case to the first - instance court . The higher court pointed out that the court \u2019s reasoning lacked reference to the decisive factors which would indicate that it was necessary to deprive the applicant of her liberty . As regards the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s application for an interlocutory order , the higher court rejected the lower court \u2019s interpretation that no legal basis existed for an interlocutory order for the protection of the applicant \u2019s personality rights . The court also pointed out that the applicant \u2019s request for her medical treatment to be stopped warranted separate consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision and a request for a procedure to be initiated for the review of the constitutionality of section DATE of ORG and of sections CARDINAL of ORG . She insisted that remitting her case to the first - instance court without ordering her release from the hospital had violated her right to personal freedom .", "CARDINAL . As already stated ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaints of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE against both periods of her confinement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with ORG regarding the proceedings before ORG . On DATE the Ministry informed the applicant that the local court had set the date of the hearing for DATE . The summons to the hearing was sent to the applicant \u2019s home address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the father of the applicant , PERSON , informed the local court that he had been served a summons addressed to the applicant for a hearing scheduled for DATE . The judge agreed to allow the applicant \u2019s father to attend the scheduled hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative PERSON informed the local court that the summons to the hearing of DATE was unclear as to whether the representative herself had been summoned , or whether the applicant had been summoned by way of her representative . In addition , she proposed that a new summons be served in which the reasons for the hearing be set out .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant \u2019s court - appointed representative GPE , the applicant \u2019s father GPE and her chosen representative PERSON were present at the hearing . PERSON proposed that the hearing be rescheduled since the applicant had not been properly summoned . She also informed the local court that the applicant was being held in the open ward of ORG but that the hospital was refusing to release her , or to discontinue her medical treatment . On DATE the local court appointed another expert to give an opinion on the applicant \u2019s condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ruled on the applicant \u2019s application for an interlocutory order concerning the termination of her medical treatment and her immediate release from the psychiatric hospital . Contrary to the reasoning of ORG decision of DATE , the application was again dismissed on the grounds that no legal basis existed for an interlocutory order for the protection of a person \u2019s personality rights . The applicant appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the judge sitting on the case be removed on the grounds , inter alia , that he had refused to adjourn and reschedule the hearing of DATE despite the fact that she had not been properly summoned . Furthermore , she alleged that the judge had violated her right to privacy by allowing her father to attend the hearing . She also requested that the appointed expert be withdrawn . She further requested the court to decide on her immediate release and to exclude her father from the proceedings . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request for the withdrawal of the judge was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended its decision of DATE by also including in its operative part the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s application that her father be prevented from participating in the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE and remitted the case to the first - instance court . It reiterated that a valid legal basis did exist for an interlocutory order for the applicant \u2019s release from the psychiatric hospital and that her request for her medication to be stopped deserved separate consideration . Moreover , the court took note of information in the case file that the applicant had meanwhile been transferred to the open ward . Accordingly , it pointed out that the rules of non - contentious procedure regarding involuntary confinement only applied to closed wards of psychiatric hospitals . It ordered the lower court to examine the question of whether the conditions for continuing the non - contentious proceedings still applied . Otherwise , the applicant was supposed to apply for injunctive relief against infringement of her personality rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through her representative PERSON , lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE on the dismissal of the application concerning her father \u2019s participation in the hearing . The court - appointed representative GPE responded to the appeal lodged by PERSON , arguing that it should be dismissed . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to ORG , requesting information about when the applicant had been transferred to the open ward .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local court received a reply from the hospital stating that the applicant had been transferred to the open ward on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings regarding the applicant \u2019s involuntary confinement in the psychiatric hospital because of her transfer to the open ward .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile the applicant renewed contact with her father , who arranged for her to spend TIME at his home . Arrangements were subsequently made for the applicant to move in with him after her release from the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her father visited the ORG , where the applicant declared that she wished her father to act as her guardian in financial and health matters , and her father declared himself willing to provide her with a home and to assume responsibility for her medical treatment and finances . A record was made of the applicant and her father \u2019s declarations and they were informed that they could address any possible disagreements regarding the arrangement to the centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decision of DATE and her application for constitutional review ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) for lack of legal interest . It observed that the applicant was no longer confined in the closed ward of the psychiatric hospital .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , stressing , inter alia , that her transfer to the open ward of the hospital did not change the fact that she was confined there against her will . She also complained about the lack of an effective remedy . Moreover , she pointed out that no decision had been made regarding the necessity of her confinement and that she had not been informed of the grounds on which her continuing confinement was based . She further lodged an application for her court - appointed representative GPE to be taken off the case for failure to act in her interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that , since the applicant had been placed in an open ward , the rules of non - contentious procedure were no longer applicable . The court referred the applicant to the rules of contentious procedure , under which it was possible to apply for injunctive relief against infringement of personality rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from ORG . The diagnosis listed on her release form was paranoid schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for an interlocutory order owing to the fact that the proceedings on the merits had been terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of DATE . She invoked , inter alia , LAW , and maintained that the fact that she had been placed in the open ward did not imply that she was held there voluntarily . She alleged that any attempt on her part to leave the hospital , while in the open ward , could result in her being brought back to the hospital by force and placed back in the closed ward , as in practice the transfer to the open ward constituted a privilege enjoyed by compliant patients . In this regard the applicant pointed out , relying on section CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that the legal basis for involuntary admission and treatment in a psychiatric hospital did not specify in which ward patients are to be placed . She also pointed out that psychiatric hospitals were not required to notify the competent courts of ORG possible readmission to the closed ward in cases such as her own , where they had already been transferred to the open ward while the order of confinement was still in effect . In her opinion the provisions on involuntary confinement in a psychiatric hospital and the related procedure were still applicable and she was entitled to obtain a decision on the lawfulness of her earlier confinement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicant lacked legal interest , since the confinement proceedings had been terminated and she had been released from the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision to reject her appeal on points of law in connection with ORG decision of DATE and ORG decision of DATE to terminate the proceedings regarding her involuntary confinement in ORG . She reiterated the complaints made regarding her stay in the open ward of ORG and those relating to the alleged breaches of procedural rules in the confinement proceedings . Further , she pointed out that she was entitled to obtain a decision on the merits with regard to her complaints , having regard to the importance of her constitutionally guaranteed right to personal liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against ORG decision as unfounded , and rejected her complaint against ORG decision on the grounds that it had been lodged out of time . The court pointed out that the lodging of an inadmissible appeal on points of law had not suspended the time - limit for lodging the constitutional complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-2", "5-4", "5-5", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
