The fraud was committed by entering stock in the inventory of [ FASTROM of Roman \u2019s ] central warehouse \u2013 stock that does not appear anywhere in the inventories of the undertakings under its control . It has been established that much of this stock was replaced by goods required by PERSON and his friends and family , or exchanged for cash , which was then shared out in fraternal fashion . It makes CARDINAL think of the highwaymen of old , who flouted the law both of God and of the land ( GPE ca - n codru ) ! ...", "The people of NORP are asking how this could have happened . Perhaps Senator PERSON , who , hitherto , has been the ORG representative on the board of FASTROM of Roman , will give us an explanation . He was paid CARDINAL of lei DATE in that capacity . Now we know why DATE or , to put it another way , how DATE he has been protecting the ORG \u2019s interests ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an article in issue no .

Noting that the public prosecutor \u2019s office had decided on CARDINAL occasions not to press charges against PERSON , the court found \u2013 without examining the police reports produced by the applicant in support of his allegations \u2013 that those allegations did not correspond to reality . With regard to Senator PERSON , the court found that his use of the car had been lawful .", "However , the court did set aside the ban on the applicant working as a journalist , \u201c because of the praiseworthy way in which he had conducted himself during the proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
