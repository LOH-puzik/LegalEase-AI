She specified as follows :", "\u201c As regards the issue of rehabilitation and compensation , the decision will apparently belong , according to the applicable rules of jurisdiction , to ORG . It will therefore be indicated in this court \u2019s decision that , given the fact that the remainder of [ the applicants\u2019 ] shares have been assigned and that the factory has become indebted , it is factually impossible to return the shares in their entirety , which would then lead to the award of GEL CARDINAL [ ( EUR CARDINAL ) ] in pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Ms T.B. then assured the ORG daughter that they could trust the ORG , as , in any event , should there be any improper conduct by the authorities , the applicants could always then complain to the ORG about the alleged hindrance of the right of individual petition under LAW , which allegation would be of particular harm for the respondent ORG \u2019s international image .
