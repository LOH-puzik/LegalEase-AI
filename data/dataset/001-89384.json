After the elections , he grew gradually disenchanted with the ORG \u2019s policies and some of its leaders . He was particularly disappointed by ORG , a UDF Member of ORG from the ORG constituency and head of the ORG branch in ORG . On DATE the applicant , together with a few other members of the ORG , formed ORG against corruption in the UDF \u2013 Pleven \u201d .

On DATE , in an interview discussing the widely publicised trial of CARDINAL NORP nurses facing the death penalty in GPE , Mr PERSON expressed the opinion that GPE was not a \u201c white \u201d country . This statement was severely criticised by the press and sparked a protest from the NORP ambassador to GPE . On DATE the DATE newspaper ORG ran an editorial expressing the opinion that with his statement Mr PERSON was \u201c on his way to being ranked \u2018 top idiot\u2019 of the year \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , together with some friends and political supporters , founded an initiative committee to campaign for Mr PERSON \u2019s resignation . On DATE he notified the mayor of ORG that on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE in the centre of GPE supporters would gather signatures calling for the resignation of \u201c the top idiot of ORG \u2013 Teodosiy NORP \u201d . The organisers planned to gather signatures TIME on DATE at CARDINAL stands placed in front of the town hall , the district police station , the theatre and the Monument to the Unknown Soldier \u2013 all in the centre of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy mayor , who at the time was acting as mayor , refused to give permission for the gathering of signatures .

At TIME on DATE , while on his way to CARDINAL of the signaturegathering stands , the applicant was stopped in front of the district police station by the head of the police department , who informed him about the deputy mayor \u2019s refusal .

The applicant decided to complete the planned action . He put in the centre of ORG CARDINAL stands and CARDINAL posters reading \u201c We , the supporters of the UDF , call for the resignation of the top idiot of the ORG Teodosiy NORP \u201d . A number of people , including some police officers , gathered around the stands .", "CARDINAL . At TIME DATE a police officer warned the applicant in writing that he should remove the stands , pending approval of their locations by the deputy mayor . The applicant refused to take them away , as he considered that the placing of stands on public ground did not amount to a breach of public order and that the law did not require him to seek permission from the mayor for that .", "CARDINAL . At TIME another police officer ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest . The order was based on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE ORG and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . It did not set out the specific acts alleged against the applicant . Immediately after that the police arrested the applicant and seized the CARDINAL posters .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE the police officer who had ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest instituted a criminal investigation against him for publicly insulting the Minister of ORG in his official capacity , contrary to LAW , and for performing indecent actions , grossly violating public order , and demonstrating overt disrespect for society , characterised by exceptional cynicism and arrogance , contrary to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . He did not specify exactly what acts the applicant had carried out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was questioned at TIME He pleaded not guilty and refused to make any statements until the arrival of his counsel .", "CARDINAL .

He noted that proceedings had been instituted against the applicant on charges of insult and hooliganism and stated , inter alia , that there was a real risk that he would flee or reoffend . The applicant \u2019s counsel immediately appealed against the order to ORG . She did not receive a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge of the case interviewed Mr PERSON . He said that he had felt very insulted and humiliated by the campaign for his resignation and by the description of him as a \u201c top idiot \u201d . He had learned about the events from his son and had immediately telephoned the deputy mayor , the vicechairman of the UDF in GPE and the head of the district police department , insisting that they \u201c ensure public order \u201d . The investigator also interviewed CARDINAL police officers who had eyewitnessed the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator interviewed the deputy mayor , the vicepresident of the UDF in GPE and the applicant \u2019s father . The interviews finished at TIME", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE ORG examined the request for placing the applicant in \u201c pre - trial detention \u201d at a public hearing . It heard submissions from the prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s counsel . It held that , while there were indications that the applicant had committed the offence alleged against him , it was not necessary to place him in \u201c pre - trial detention \u201d , because there was no risk that he would abscond or reoffend . The court also noted certain health problems experienced by the applicant . It decided to release him on bail . The applicant apparently paid the bail immediately after the hearing , which finished at TIME , and was released .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigation against the applicant was completed on DATE and the case file was sent to ORG . On DATE it indicted the applicant , accusing him of aggravated hooliganism . The insult charges had apparently been dropped earlier .", "CARDINAL . After holding a trial , in a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of aggravated hooliganism , contrary to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the applicant , on DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and acquitted him .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed on points of law . The appeal was examined by ORG at a public hearing which took place on DATE . The prosecution , which was represented by a prosecutor of ORG , expressed the opinion that the acquittal was correct and should be upheld .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s acquittal in the following terms :", "\u201c ... The court of first instance failed to give any arguments , but merely declared that [ the applicant \u2019s ] acts amounted to \u2018 a brutal demonstration against the established ORG and had caused \u2018 considerable harm\u2019 to this order . ... the testimony of the persons authorised to preserve public order \u2013 the [ police officers ] questioned as witnesses , and in particular , [ CARDINAL of them ] , who was specifically asked about this DATE shows that no \u2018 disarray , commotion or breach of public ORG had occurred at the place where [ the applicant ] and the other ORG supporters had organised the gathering of signatures in support of the removal from office of the then Minister of Justice PERSON . The only thing which could be characterised as scandalous is the label \u2018 top ORG accompanying the name of the witness ORG on the CARDINAL posters explaining the aim of the event . However , there is no evidence whatsoever that the use of these words was intended to discredit PERSON by lowering his prestige and dignity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court went on to say that it was public knowledge that DATE before the events of DATE Mr PERSON had made an unacceptable statement in respect of GPE , which , in view of its potentially damaging repercussions for relations between the CARDINAL countries , had been assessed very negatively by the press and had eventually led to the loss of his post . It was the press that had first called Mr PERSON a \u201c top idiot \u201d and there was no indication that any newspaper had been called upon to answer for this phrase . It was thus completely natural for the applicant , when calling for the Minister \u2019s resignation , to use the same phrase , thus expressing the public \u2013 and not merely his own \u2013 attitude towards Mr PERSON \u2019s activities . On this basis , the court concluded that :", "\u201c It is clear from the above , that , as regards the subjective element , no offence under LAW or CARDINAL [ of the DATE LAW ] has been committed , because there were no acts which meant to breach public order or demonstrate overt disrespect for society . The offence alleged against [ the applicant ] was not objectively committed either : there was no public disorder and the presence of police officers at the site was due to the need to prevent possible incidents . The expression of indignation by [ some of the persons who were present there ] , which was an act of political support for T.
