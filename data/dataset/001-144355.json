The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He was living in GPE together with a NORP national , to whom he was not married . On CARDINAL DATE a child was born to the applicant \u2019s partner ( \u201c the mother \u201d ) in GPE . The applicant is the father of the child . The child is both a NORP and a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . Following the birth , the applicant , the mother and the child lived together with the applicant in GPE until DATE , when the mother took the child from GPE to GPE . Neither of them has ever returned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother petitioned ORG Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) in PERSON ( GPE ) to make an order governing the exercise of parental rights and responsibilities in respect of the child . At the same time , she requested that , pending the final outcome of the proceedings , the ORG deal with these matters by way of an interim order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interim order , pursuant to which the child was placed with the mother and the applicant was ordered to contribute towards the child \u2019s maintenance pending the outcome of the proceedings on the merits . It was submitted by the applicant and not disputed by the Government that the written version of the interim order was not served on the applicant before DATE and that , upon its service , the applicant was contributing to the child \u2019s maintenance as ordered .", "CARDINAL . The interim order remained in force until the proceedings on the merits of the mother \u2019s petition were terminated by ORG on DATE and , following the mother \u2019s appeal , by ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) in PERSON ( GPE ) on DATE .", "These courts found that the relevant law for the determination of jurisdiction in the matter was ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility ( \u201c Regulation No . CARDINAL \u201d ) and that , under Regulation No . DATE , the crucial criterion for establishing jurisdiction over the matter was the place of habitual residence of the child . Having regard to the conclusions that had meanwhile been reached in that respect by the Bratislava I ( GPE ) ORG and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the place of the child \u2019s habitual residence was GPE , and the NORP courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had complained about the removal and retention of the child by the mother before ORG responsible for implementing LAW .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant lodged an application with the Bratislava I ORG under LAW . CARDINAL .", "In his application , he argued that the child \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE and that the mother had removed or retained the child wrongfully within the meaning of LAW .", "Accordingly , the applicant sought an order for the child \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed the social services department for the city of PERSON to represent the child \u2019s interests in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG called a hearing for DATE . However , DATE before that date , that is to say on DATE , the mother \u2019s lawyer asked for an adjournment on the grounds that the summons had only been received on DATE , that a copy of the application had been served on them without enclosures , and that they had consequently not had adequate time and facilities to prepare .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the mother \u2019s lawyer , in response to her request of DATE , that , in view of the short time limits in proceedings under LAW , it was not possible to have the hearing postponed and that it would take place .", "On DATE the mother \u2019s lawyer inspected the case file ; informed the court that , nevertheless , and on the same grounds as previously relied upon , they would not appear ; and insisted that the hearing be adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing as scheduled , in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer , who both made oral submissions . Neither the mother , nor the child , nor the social services department on the child \u2019s behalf were present . The hearing was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother \u2019s lawyer again inspected the case file and , on DATE , she lodged extensive written submissions . She explained the development of her client \u2019s relationship with the applicant and described it . She submitted that , in connection with her falling out with the applicant , the mother had sought care from a mental health specialist ; and that the child was closely attached to the mother and their separation was unthinkable . In addition , she submitted a letter from an association in GPE supporting women in need attesting that since CARDINAL DATE the mother had been receiving their support in connection with allegations she had made that the applicant had been mistreating her . While admitting that there was no risk of direct harm to the child , the lawyer submitted that the applicant \u2019s behaviour towards the mother should nonetheless be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the parties and their legal representatives , who all made oral submissions . The social services department on behalf of the child were not present .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the hearing , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim and ordered the child \u2019s return to GPE . The order had the procedural form of a decision ( uznesenie ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG established that the child \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE , that the mother had removed the child from there wrongfully , and that there were no obstacles to the return of the child there within the meaning of LAW . In addition , ORG pointed out that its ruling in the present proceedings had nothing to do with questions of care and residence .", "CARDINAL . As to the mother \u2019s specific claim that the return of the child should be declined in view of the applicant \u2019s behaviour toward the mother , ORG found that she had failed to substantiate her allegations . The letter from the association that had been offering care and support to the mother was solely based on the mother \u2019s allegations and as such could not serve to support those allegations . In her own words , the applicant had never mistreated her physically and there was nothing to support her allegations of psychological mistreatment . In that respect , ORG found it of relevance that the mother had not brought the alleged psychological mistreatment to the attention of the NORP authorities at the time when it had allegedly taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother filed an appeal ( odvolanie ) with ORG . In the first place , she reiterated her argument concerning the time and facilities made available for preparation prior to the hearing of DATE . Moreover , she challenged ORG conclusions as regards the letter from the association that had been providing her with care and support and contended that ORG had failed to obtain a report from the mental health specialist treating her . In addition , she argued that ORG had failed to take into account the loss which the child would suffer by separation from the mother . In that respect , she relied on a written statement of the court - appointed representative for the child . Moreover , the mother claimed that risk within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW did not have to be imminent , but could lie in the future . Lastly , in connection with ORG conclusions as regards the habitual residence of the child and the wrongfulness of the child \u2019s removal , the mother submitted that it had been her and not the applicant who had actually been taking care of the child and was better disposed and equipped to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the procedural form of a decision , ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the first - instance decision .", "ORG fully endorsed ORG reasoning and conclusions . In addition , it pointed out that the object and purpose of LAW was to ensure immediate restoration of the status quo which has been unlawfully changed by a person who wrongfully removes or retains a child by returning the child to the country of his or her habitual residence so that questions on the merits concerning care and residence may be examined by the court in that country . The purpose of the present proceedings had nothing to do with such substantive questions and they fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country of the child \u2019s habitual residence .", "ORG further held that LAW . CARDINAL represented a departure from the traditional private - international - law principle of nationality towards a principle based on the child \u2019s habitual residence .", "On the facts of the case , ORG found no merit in the mother \u2019s argument concerning the time and facilities given for preparation prior to the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , pointing out that time - limits under LAW had precedence over time - limits under the national procedural rules ; that the mother and her lawyer had been duly summoned to the hearings ; and that they had been granted ample opportunities to familiarise themselves with the case and to answer it . As to the mother \u2019s complaints of ORG alleged failure to obtain evidence she had sought to have adduced , ORG pointed out that , under LAW of LAW , in return proceedings it was the person opposing the return who bore the burden of proof . Moreover , and in any event , some of the evidence adduced by the mother bore on questions falling outside of the scope of the present proceedings . As to the mother \u2019s specific allegations of mistreatment , these were contradicted by the contents of the case file , in particular by copies of her e - mail communications with the applicant and his sister , as well as by photographs of the mother , the child and the applicant from the period between the child \u2019s birth and her wrongful removal from GPE .", "Lastly , ORG held that the order for the child \u2019s return by no means implied her separation from the mother , as the mother was free to return to GPE with the child and to assert her claims in respect of the child before the courts having jurisdiction to entertain them .", "CARDINAL . NORP The order for the child \u2019s return to GPE became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the mother lodged an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) with ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) of GPE . The applicant was then allowed to submit observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . As to the applicable principles , it acknowledged that , in LAW proceedings , the courts are duty - bound diligently to establish the facts , and not to limit themselves to the evidence adduced by a single party to the proceedings .", "As to the specific facts of the present case , ORG observed that the applicant \u2019s application for the commencement of the Hague Convention proceedings had been served on the mother without its enclosures . However , it held that this error had quickly been corrected when , on DATE , the mother \u2019s lawyer had inspected the case file ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .", "Moreover , ORG held that it had been wrong of the Bratislava I ORG to hold the hearing of CARDINAL DATE in the absence of the mother and her lawyer and without giving them adequate time and facilities to prepare . However , that error had also been rectified by hearing the case again on DATE . At that hearing , the mother had made extensive submissions and , in addition , she had had further ample opportunity to make her case before ORG .", "Finally , as to the child , whose court - appointed representative ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had failed to show up without any excuse at either of those hearings , ORG observed that the representative had duly been summoned and held that , in the circumstances , the representative \u2019s absence had been no obstacle to the ORG proceeding with the determination of the case .", "CARDINAL . In parallel to her appeal on points of law , the mother also petitioned ORG ( \u201c PPS \u201d ) to exercise their discretionary power to challenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG decided not to act upon the petition , on the grounds that the mother \u2019s appeal on points of law and her later petition for reopening ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) were still pending , these remedies having precedence over an extraordinary appeal on points of law . This position was upheld in a letter of ORG of the PPS of CARDINAL DATE .", "In that letter , the ORG endorsed the reasoning behind the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and , in addition , expressed a detailed and reasoned opinion that the order for the child \u2019s return was correct on merits .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the extraordinary remedies mentioned above , on DATE the mother filed a petition to have the LAW proceedings reopened ( n\u00e1vrh na obnovu konania ) .", "CARDINAL . The petition was dismissed by the Bratislava I ORG on CARDINAL DATE and , following the mother \u2019s appeal , by ORG on DATE . The grounds for the rejection were that LAW proceedings had been concluded in the procedural form of a decision ( see paragraph DATE above ) , as opposed to a judgment ( rozsudok ) , and that , in the circumstances , the reopening of proceedings concluded by a decision was not permissible by law ( LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended \u2013 the \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant invited the mother to abide by the return order , to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a warrant to have the return order enforced , pointing out that the order had become final and binding on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG called upon the mother to abide by the return order voluntarily and summoned her for an interview on DATE . In response , the mother asked for the proceedings to be stayed in view of her extraordinary appeal and petition for reopening that were still pending ( see paragraphs DATE above ) , and she did not show up for the interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed ORG as the representative of the child \u2019s interests for the purposes of the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the enforcement case on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . At a further hearing called specifically for that purpose on CARDINAL DATE , it delivered a warrant for the enforcement of the return order and authorised the applicant to carry out the enforcement .", "CARDINAL . The mother and the child \u2019s court - appointed representative appealed to ORG , which DATE on DATE decided to stay the proceedings on their appeal . It did so observing that , in the meantime , the mother had petitioned for reopening of the LAW proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that , if her petition was granted , the enforcement proceedings would be stayed by operation of law .", "CARDINAL . Following the dismissal of the mother \u2019s petition for reopening ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG resumed the appeal proceedings , only to stay them again , on DATE , this time in view of the mother \u2019s petition to the PPS for an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which was still pending .", "CARDINAL . Following the dismissal by the PPS of the mother \u2019s petition for an extraordinary appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the appeal proceedings were again stayed on DATE , this time on the basis of the judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) of ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting in her own name as well as that of the child , the mother challenged the decision of ORG of DATE to reject the appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by way of a complaint under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The complaint was directed against ORG . The applicant was neither a party to the ensuing proceedings nor informed of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it gave a judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits in so far as it had been brought by the mother and , at the same time , in so far as the child was concerned , finding that ORG had violated the child \u2019s rights as specified below .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , a violation of the child \u2019s rights was found under LAW judicial protection ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( procedural equality ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( hearing in one \u2019s presence and opportunity to comment on evidence ) of the LAW ; LAW ( fairness ) of the LAW ; and Articles QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ( consideration of the best interests of the child ) and CARDINAL ( protection and care necessary for the child \u2019s well - being ) and QUANTITY and CARDINAL ( expression of the child \u2019s views and being heard in judicial proceedings ) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .", "CARDINAL . ORG endorsed ORG view that ORG error in respect of the mother had been rectified at the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the child was concerned , however , the child \u2019s views were to have been expressed by the court - appointed representative , whose failure to appear had not been a valid reason for ruling on the matter without having the child \u2019s views established . There were tools , including procedural fines , for ensuring the proper involvement of the court - appointed representative in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the Constitutional Court quashed the challenged decision and remitted the mother \u2019s appeal on points of law to ORG for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was final and not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG re - examined the mother \u2019s appeal on points of law of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) against the return order . Being bound by ORG assessment of the case , it quashed the order and remitted the case to the first - instance court with a view to having the views of the child established by means appropriate for the child \u2019s age and maturity .", "CARDINAL . The Bratislava I ORG heard the case on CARDINAL and DATE . A further hearing was scheduled for DATE , but it was cancelled on the grounds that DATE before , the mother \u2019s lawyer had been appointed the head of ORG responsible for implementing LAW . Consequently , the lawyer had had to resign and the mother had appointed a new lawyer .", "At a subsequent hearing on DATE , ORG ruled that the child was not to be returned to GPE . This ruling was upheld on DATE by ORG following the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The courts\u2019 reasoning may be summarised as follows . The child \u2019s habitual residence for the purposes of the Hague Convention proceedings was GPE and her retention by the mother in GPE had been wrongful .", "However , in view of the mother \u2019s objections , it had to be examined whether there was any grave risk that the child \u2019s return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . For that purpose , in addition to the other evidence taken , ORG had interviewed the child , aged CARDINAL at the time , and the child \u2019s courtappointed representative , and the courts had also examined complex documentary evidence , including a report from ORG as to the circumstances to which the child would be returned there .", "CARDINAL . The courts were guided by the best interests of the child , which they considered to be twofold , namely the interest in preserving relations with the child \u2019s family and the interest in developing in a healthy environment .", "CARDINAL . The courts found that the child was attached to the mother and , in view of the child \u2019s age , also to the child \u2019s home environment , to which the child had been introduced when it had been CARDINAL months\u2019 old . The child only spoke NORP , attended a kindergarten in GPE and was part of an extended family circle there . The courts concluded that the child \u2019s removal from this environment would give rise to the risk of considerable detriment to the child and that , in the circumstances , the child \u2019s best interests prevailed over those of the applicant .", "As regards the applicant , the courts concluded that it had been DATE since he had seen the child , that he had not been displaying a genuine interest in the child and that he had not been contributing to the child \u2019s maintenance .", "A separation of the child from the mother did not come in question . However , the mother \u2019s vulnerable financial situation made it impossible to ensure proper care for the child in GPE . The child \u2019s removal to GPE with the mother would thus expose the child to the risk of living in poverty .", "CARDINAL . In view of those circumstances , the courts examined whether adequate arrangements within the meaning of LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had been made to secure the protection of the child on its return .", "In that respect , the courts expressed the view that adequate arrangements had to eliminate with the highest possible probability the risks that the child would face and that they should entail the provision of low - rent housing for the mother and the child , free of charge specialised social and psychological counselling , and a detailed explanation of the welfare benefits and supervision by social services available to the mother in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The courts held that , in so far as any guarantees had been identified by the NORP central authority , they were not specific enough . In so far as the applicant had been offering to cover the costs of the mother \u2019s and the child \u2019s air travel , the child \u2019s health insurance and kindergarten in GPE , and a room free of charge in his apartment there , these guarantees were found not to be adequate and the courts noted that their \u201c doubts as to whether he would actually keep his promises had not been assuaged \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The courts considered that they had established an overall picture of the social environment to which the child would return and had thoroughly examined the entire family situation . Based on the findings mentioned above , they concluded that the child \u2019s return under LAW was not permissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
