POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has owned a plot of land located in the municipality of PERSON , near GPE . It is listed in the local land register under entry no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the local land development plan adopted in DATE , which was in force in DATE when the applicant acquired the land concerned , it was situated in an area described as \u201c the agricultural area without the right to construction , reserved for a future zone designated for recreational purposes \u201d . The DATE plan remained in force until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Milan\u00f3wek , in a public procedure provided for by relevant planning legislation , adopted a resolution by which the local land development plan was accepted . The applicant 's land was included in an area in which a ring - road and a hospital were to be constructed in the future .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his neighbours lodged a complaint against the ORG 's resolution with the GPE Governor , arguing inter alia , that the plan breached their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions . They submitted that the local land development plan had been prepared in a manner which failed to take into consideration and to reconcile various interests of the municipality and the local owners . As a result , the plan which had been adopted was unreasonable and did not comply with standards of good land administration .", "CARDINAL . They were informed that ORG was competent to examine their complaint .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the complaint , finding that there were no indications that the municipal authorities had failed to take into consideration and properly weigh the various competing interests involved in the preparation of the local land development plan . It noted that restrictions on ownership imposed by the land development measures were not per se incompatible with the nature of ownership as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that an initial approval for a development project on his land be issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to the Mayor of PERSON a request that his land either be acquired by the municipality or that he be given another plot of land .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that his request of DATE had not been examined as he had failed to submit an appropriate plan with it . He was further informed that the validity of the DATE plan had been prolonged by ORG for DATE , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Marshal of the Mazowsze Region informed the applicant that the construction of the roadway was undoubtedly in the interests of the inhabitants of PERSON , but that no funding would be provided for it in the financing scheme for the regional land development plan until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant renewed his request for an initial approval for a development project on his land . He wished to have a house built on it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of PERSON refused his request , finding that the project as submitted by the applicant was incompatible with the local land development plan .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , submitting that there were no immediate plans to build the road , there was no financing earmarked for it in the relevant public budgets , and that his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property had been breached by the continuing restrictions on the use of his land in view of its future expropriation at some undetermined point of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on the ground that his construction project was incompatible with the land development plan for the municipality of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that since the adoption of the DATE plan he had been restricted in the use of his property ; that the municipality had refused to acquire his land or to provide him with another plot ; and that this amounted to a breach of his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as well as of various provisions of LAW . He stressed that under the applicable laws he did not have any right to compensation for the protracted restrictions on the exercise of his ownership .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested the municipality CARDINAL times to either acquire his land or to grant him another plot . His requests were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal against the decision of DATE . The court observed that its jurisdiction was limited to the examination of the lawfulness of the impugned decision . It found that the decision was lawful as it was common ground between the parties that the applicant 's construction project was incompatible with the local land development plan .", "It further noted that the applicant had complained that his situation could not be seen as being compatible with the LAW , given that owners affected by plans adopted prior to the LAW 's entry into force could not benefit from compensation claims provided for by section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . The court referred to the judgment of ORG given in DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) . ORG had examined the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE insofar as it excluded the application of the owners ' right to compensation provided for in section CARDINAL of that Act to land development plans adopted before DATE . It found that this provision was compatible with the LAW .", "ORG observed that it was not its task to amend or to criticise existing laws and that it was bound by this provision . Otherwise there were no grounds on which to consider that the decision challenged by the applicant was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the validity of the DATE land development plan expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted an initial planning permission ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy ) and on DATE a final building permission ( zezwolenie na budow\u0119 ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE to DATE questions of land development were governed by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted which repealed LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of DATE owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property or the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at an undetermined future date .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW enacted in DATE created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were designated for expropriation at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by the competent municipal authorities . The municipalities were obliged to buy such property , replace it with other land within DATE of an owner 's request , or provide compensation for the damage caused by the designation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , pursuant to LAW , these obligations and the corresponding claims of the owners applied only to plans adopted after LAW had entered into force , i.e. to plans adopted by local municipalities after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the DATE Act , plans adopted before its entry into force were to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an amendment to LAW was adopted under which the validity of such plans was extended for DATE until DATE . Again , on DATE , ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE which extended until DATE the validity of the land development plans adopted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , all local plans adopted before DATE remained valid , but not beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation entitlements for owners , provided for by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , were in essence maintained by the CARDINAL Act . Pursuant to LAW , when , following the adoption of a new local land development plan , the use of property in the manner provided for by a previous plan has become impossible or has been restricted , it is open to the owner to claim compensation from the municipality , or to request the municipality to buy the plot . Any litigation which may arise in this respect between municipalities and owners can be pursued before the civil courts . It would appear that the operation of LAW is not retroactive , thus limiting the scope of any such claims to the period after the adoption of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Other relevant legislative provisions are extensively set out in the ORG 's judgment of DATE in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG examined the request submitted to it by the ORG to determine the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE insofar as it excluded the application of section CARDINAL of that Act to land development plans adopted before DATE . The court referred to its established case - law to the effect that ownership could not be regarded as ius infinitivum . Consequently , its exercise was normally restrained by many legal and practical considerations , including the necessity of balancing the owners ' interests against those of other persons . Local land development plans were to be regarded only as a practical expression of restraints originating in numerous statutes regulating the lawful exercise of ownership . In particular , owners of properties \u201c frozen \u201d for the purpose of future expropriations as a result of the adoption of such plans could normally continue to use their properties as they had been using them prior to the adoption of such plans . This did not amount to such an interference with ownership that it could be regarded as being incompatible with the constitutional protection of ownership ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
