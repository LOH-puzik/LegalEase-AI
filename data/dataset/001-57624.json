Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG A number of serious incidents between rival groups in GPE in the DATE culminated in a fire - raising attack on industrial premises , followed by a petrol - bomb attack on an apartment resulting in the death of CARDINAL members of the same family .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , who is a NORP citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE , was interviewed by the police during their investigations ; on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , in signed statements , he gave details of how the crimes had been committed and named the persons responsible , that is PERSON and CARDINAL others . This evidence was considered by the ORG to be important and was a major basis for the decision to prosecute those persons . Steps were taken to secure the applicant \u2019s safety until the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG The trial of PERSON and the CARDINAL others on charges relating , inter alia , to the fire - raising and the murders took place before ORG of GPE in DATE . PERSON appeared as a principal witness for the ORG . However , once in the witness - box , he denied all knowledge of any matters relevant to the crimes . He also denied that he had given the above - mentioned statements , claiming instead that they had been made up by the police , who had pressurised him into signing them .", "CARDINAL . ORG Shortly afterwards , the applicant was arrested and prosecuted on indictment in ORG of Justiciary for perjury . He was held in custody pending and during his trial . In summary , the charges against him were that , while giving evidence at the PERSON trial , he had untruthfully :", "( a ) stated that marks on a plan which he had drawn had been placed there by him on the instructions of the police rather than on his own initiative ;", "( b ) denied making a detailed statement to the police on DATE about the fire - raising ;", "( c ) denied making a detailed statement to the police on DATE about the murders ;", "( d ) claimed to have been pressurised and assaulted by the police and forced to sign statements previously prepared by them ;", "( e ) pretended that he had told his solicitor that he had been assaulted by police officers and forced to sign a statement against his will .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant received legal aid for the preparation of his defence by his solicitor and for representation at his trial by both senior and junior counsel .", "The ORG was represented by ORG for GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , since the gravity of the charges was considered to warrant the presence of a senior prosecutor and since the most senior Advocate Depute , who had appeared for the prosecution at the PERSON trial , was to be a witness at the applicant \u2019s trial .", "After a DATE trial before ORG of GPE in DATE , PERSON was found guilty of the first , second and fourth charges against him and not guilty of the fifth ; the third was found not proven . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "The trial judge certified , for the purposes of determining the fees payable under the legal - aid scheme , that the case had been CARDINAL of exceptional length , complexity and difficulty .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant \u2019s solicitor subsequently lodged an intimation of intention to appeal against conviction ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The legal aid granted for the perjury trial covered this work , as well as the solicitor \u2019s advising on the prospects of an appeal , obtaining counsel \u2019s opinion on the same point , having counsel frame a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal ( ibid . ) , lodging the note of appeal and making an application for legal aid to pay for representation at the hearing of the appeal itself .", "CARDINAL . ORG Such an application was submitted on behalf of PERSON , who had insufficient means to pay for legal assistance , to ORG of the Law Society of GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE . It was accompanied by a memorandum , a copy note of appeal ( with a supplementary statement of the grounds ) and the judge \u2019s summing - up to the jury at the applicant \u2019s trial ; later a copy of the indictment and a note of previous convictions were also lodged .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considered the material before it to be insufficient and asked the applicant \u2019s solicitor to furnish counsel \u2019s opinion on the prospects of the appeal . This he did on DATE .", "The solicitor had , in fact , already obtained such an opinion , on DATE , from the senior and junior counsel who had represented PERSON at his trial ; the senior counsel , in particular , had considerable experience in presenting appeals before ORG of Justiciary . The authors of the opinion concluded that they could not advise that the appeal should proceed : in their view , neither of the CARDINAL possible stateable grounds of appeal was of sufficient substance as to have reasonable prospects of success and , in any event , there was no real prospect of satisfying the court that there had been a miscarriage of justice ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The solicitor also provided the ORG with a copy of his letter of CARDINAL DATE to his GPE agents , indicating that he disagreed with counsel \u2019s opinion . Although he had obtained on DATE , for the purposes of the applicant \u2019s trial , a psychiatric report which stated that the applicant was of modest intelligence but with a poor command of LANGUAGE and poor comprehension of written material , he did not communicate this to the Committee . Neither did he refer , in any material he placed before it , to any intellectual or linguistic limitations of his client .", "CARDINAL . ORG By decision of CARDINAL DATE , which was stated to be final , the ORG refused the application , since it was not satisfied that PERSON had substantial grounds for his appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant nevertheless continued to receive advice and assistance from his solicitor and decided to proceed with the appeal . The grounds were the same as those considered by counsel in the opinion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant maintained that there had been a miscarriage of justice ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in that ( in summary ) :", "( a ) during the cross - examination of a police officer , the trial judge had intervened with the comment - alleged to be tantamount to a premature direction in law to the jury and incorrect - that the line being followed by the defence was incompetent and irrelevant ;", "( b ) the judge had erred in admitting in evidence a statement made by the applicant on DATE , notwithstanding a defence objection that it was inadmissible as being in the nature of a precognition , that is a statement made by a potential witness at an advanced stage of an investigation outlining the evidence he is likely to give at a forthcoming trial ;", "( c ) the judge had erred in repelling a further objection to the admissibility of the same statement , namely that it was evidence of crimes not charged against the applicant and would lead to prejudice ;", "( d ) the judge had erred in directing the jury that it would not be unfair for a police officer - if he genuinely believed that his superiors intended to use the applicant only as a witness - to have told the applicant , prior to obtaining the aforesaid statement and certain sketch plans , that he would not be charged with any offence ;", "( e ) the judge had erred in rejecting a defence submission that the evidence given by the applicant at the PERSON trial had not been \" material \" and accordingly could not form the basis of a charge of perjury .", "CARDINAL . ORG The hearing of the appeal opened before ORG of Justiciary , sitting in GPE as an appellate court of CARDINAL judges , on DATE . The ORG was again represented by ORG for GPE , accompanied by junior counsel and a member of the staff of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Since the refusal of legal aid precluded the instruction of counsel and since solicitors do not have rights of audience in the High Court of Justiciary , PERSON presented his appeal himself . He read out a statement , prepared by his solicitor , which elaborated on the written grounds of appeal . ORG replied , addressing the court for TIME .", "CARDINAL . ORG The principal point discussed at the hearing was whether the court could determine ground ( b ) of the appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) without considering a transcript of the relevant parts of the evidence given at the applicant \u2019s trial . Notwithstanding the Solicitor General \u2019s arguments to the contrary , the court decided that it could not . It therefore ordered that a transcript be prepared and adjourned the hearing to CARDINAL March CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s solicitor subsequently assisted in the preparation of the transcript .", "Following this adjournment , PERSON did not renew , or request reconsideration of , his legal - aid application , nor did he advise ORG of the court \u2019s order .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the resumed hearing the applicant had again been provided by his solicitor with a written speech , which dealt with all the grounds of appeal . Although the court pointed out that it wished to hear submissions on ground ( b ) only , it allowed the applicant , who was unable to comprehend the legal niceties , to read out the speech in full .", "CARDINAL . ORG of Justiciary unanimously refused the appeal on all grounds . In his written judgment the Lord ORG , who presided , gave full consideration to each of the grounds , but was satisfied that none of them had substance and that there had been no miscarriage of justice ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He described the appellant \u2019s submissions as \" well prepared and clearly expressed \" .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was released from prison on DATE after serving CARDINAL of his sentence , the remainder having been remitted .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE before the first hearing in the applicant \u2019s appeal - the Lord Advocate referred , under section CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , for the opinion of ORG of Justiciary CARDINAL questions of law that arose from the judge \u2019s directions to the jury , at the perjury trial , concerning the charge which had been found not proven ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The questions were :", "( a ) whether , in a trial for perjury where the accused was not an accused in the previous trial , it is of any relevance that a statement made by him and falsely denied under oath was allegedly obtained by means described as unfair ; and", "( b ) whether , in a trial for perjury , the \" materiality \" of the false evidence to the issue in the earlier trial is ( i ) a prerequisite to conviction and in any event ( ii ) a matter of fact to be left to the jury .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the High Court heard submissions on the reference . PERSON exercised his statutory right to be represented at the hearing , the fees of senior counsel instructed for this purpose being paid by the Lord Advocate ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In its opinion of DATE the court held that the trial judge \u2019s directions - which had been favourable to the applicant - had not been an accurate statement of the law . This opinion did not affect the applicant \u2019s acquittal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Every person convicted of a criminal charge in GPE has an automatic right of appeal - there being no requirement of prior leave - against conviction or sentence or both . In cases , such as the applicant \u2019s , tried on indictment , the right is conferred by section CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE , as amended by ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In an appeal against conviction , the appellant may bring under review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the earlier proceedings . \" Miscarriage of justice \" is not defined by statute , but covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge to the jury or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence , as well as breaches of natural justice .", "An appellate court which holds that there has been a miscarriage of justice retains a discretion not to allow the appeal if it determines that the miscarriage is not such as to warrant the quashing of the conviction ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Anyone wishing to appeal against conviction must lodge an intimation of his intention to do so within DATE of the final determination of the proceedings against him ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .

ORG At the hearing submissions will first be made by or on behalf of the appellant ; whilst unusual , this may be done in writing ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Counsel for the ORG will then address the court .", "Counsel for the ORG has a duty to act with complete fairness and to assist the court by providing impartial information and , if need be , argument so that the appellant \u2019s case can be evaluated in the best possible light . This is especially important where the appellant is not represented by counsel . Such cases are common , firstly because the unrestricted right of appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) results in the filing of many appeals which are without merit and , hence , do not qualify for legal aid ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Secondly , and irrespective of the availability of legal aid , counsel must , according to ORG , refuse to act further in a criminal appeal if he has formed the opinion that there are no grounds which he is prepared to state to the court .", "Whether the appellant is represented or not , the court will undertake a thorough examination of the appeal and will be scrupulous in examining the points which might be favourable to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing of appeals in ORG of Justiciary the ORG will always be represented , either by the Lord Advocate or ORG ( who are ORG of the Crown ) or by one of ORG . In an appeal against conviction following a long trial , the ORG will usually be represented by the counsel who appeared for it below , on account of his familiarity with the case .", "As Ministers of the ORG , ORG are liable to be called away from court at short notice to carry out other duties . They will therefore normally be accompanied by another counsel , but he will play no active part unless LAW has to leave . Counsel for the ORG will also invariably be accompanied by the member of the ORG staff who prepared the DATE \u2019s papers for the court ; his function is entirely clerical and administrative and he will not participate in the discussion of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG Legal aid granted for a trial on indictment covers certain work done in contemplation of an appeal , as listed in paragraph CARDINAL above . If it is thereafter intended to proceed with the appeal , legal aid may be sought for that purpose . Its availability was , at the relevant time , governed by ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE , as amended ( \" LAW \" ) . Applications therefor were then determined by ORG of the Law Society of GPE , whose members were independent advocates and solicitors with substantial current experience of court practice .", "The whole system for the administration of legal aid was reformed by ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE , which repealed and replaced LAW with effect from DATE .
