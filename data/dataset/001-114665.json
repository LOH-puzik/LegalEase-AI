The applicant was transported in an ambulance from ORG to the emergency ward of ORG for further medical examinations , which took place from TIME . The diagnosis was abdominal trauma and abrasions .", "CARDINAL . As no traumatic injuries or clinical indications requiring an immediate operation were diagnosed , the applicant was discharged from the hospital and presented himself at the police station for questioning .", "CARDINAL . After questioning , the applicant gave a written statement , which according to the prosecutor was barely legible . He was assisted by his lawyer during the questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant and issued a report that stated that his injuries could have been caused DATE by being hit with a hard object . It noted the existence of bruising and abrasions on the upper abdomen and on both hips , and estimated that the applicant would need DATE to recover .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate issued by ORG on DATE showed that the applicant had been hospitalised on DATE for TIME . The certificate stated that the applicant had been diagnosed with a minor cranial trauma , abdominal trauma and abrasions , and concluded with the expression \u201c Affirmative assault \u201d ( \u201c PERSON agresiune \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that although on DATE he had submitted a request with ORG to be provided with a copy of the order to which the police officers had referred in order to justify the deprivation of his liberty , he had not received a copy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG attached to ORG decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant for making threatening phone calls on the grounds that his guilt could not be proved .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE of the police officers against whom the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint were heard by the prosecutor . Their written statements were all identical .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached to ORG of Appeal decided not to prosecute on the grounds of lack of evidence that the offences in question had been committed . The decision stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated against the applicant on DATE . His deprivation of liberty had been justified by the necessity to interview him immediately , even before summoning him on the basis of an order to appear before the investigating body ( mandat de aducere ) issued by a prosecutor . The decision further stated that the applicant had agreed to accompany the police officers and that , in any event , the applicant \u2019s allegation that he had not been given a copy of the warrant could not lead to the conclusion that the police officers had abused their position , as his legal interests had not been infringed . In addition , the prosecutor held that the applicant had been provided with the order on the way from ORG to ORG . In respect of the applicant \u2019s allegation that he was subjected to physical violence by the police officers , he concluded that the injuries noted by the forensic doctor had been self - inflicted .

While he was being examined by a doctor , he had had a panic attack and had started to hit the hospital \u2019s bed with his body , hands and feet .

On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG of Appeal against the prosecutor \u2019s decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the grounds that it had been lodged outside the time - limit . It stated that the decision of DATE had been communicated to the applicant by registered letter on CARDINAL DATE , but had not been collected by him from the post office . It concluded that the legal term of DATE for lodging an appeal against the prosecutor \u2019s decision had begun on DATE and not on DATE , the date on which the applicant had allegedly found out about the decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed again , claiming that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had never been communicated to him and , therefore , that the term for submitting his complaint against it had not started to run .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court of Cassation and ORG allowed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on the grounds that the appeal had been lodged within the time - limit set by law , quashed the judgment of DATE and referred the file back to ORG of Appeal .", "CARDINAL .

The rest of the file contained copies of documents submitted by the applicant and copies of documents not related to the case . It also noted that the prosecutor , in deciding not to prosecute , had provided no explanation as to why CARDINAL police officers out of CARDINAL had been interviewed , why their statements were identical and why he had not taken into account the documents submitted by the applicant attesting that the applicant had suffered injuries . It made particular reference to the medical certificate issued by ORG on DATE , as well as the medical certificate issued by ORG on DATE . It concluded that in the light of such medical certificates , a competent court could not decide that there was a lack of evidence that the offences in question had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by ORG attached to ORG . Consequently , the decision to continue the investigation was upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor questioned for the first time the CARDINAL other police officers involved in the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer made a written statement that she had not only heard during her phone conversation with the applicant but had also seen how the latter had been subjected to ill - treatment by the police officers on DATE .

The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the chief prosecutor , claiming that the prosecutor in charge had not observed the instructions of ORG and Justice in respect of the evidence to be re - administered . He also claimed that despite the fact that he had been summoned to appear before the prosecutor on DATE , he had not been heard because the prosecutor had been absent from his office for DATE . The applicant also submitted that not all of the police officers against whom he had lodged the criminal complaint had been heard by the prosecutor ; he made the same claim with respect to other individuals who had witnessed the events of DATE but had never been heard by the investigating body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the grounds that the injuries mentioned in the forensic certificate had been self - inflicted while he was simulating an epileptic seizure . He held inter alia that the order to appear before the investigating body had been issued because the applicant had failed to appear before the prosecutor , despite the fact that he had been summoned .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that the prosecutor had not complied with its decision of DATE and again remitted the case to ORG , ordering it to commence criminal proceedings against the QUANTITY police officers mentioned in the initial criminal complaint .", "CARDINAL .
