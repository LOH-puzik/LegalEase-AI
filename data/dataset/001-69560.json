It also has to strike a fair balance [ gerechter PERSON ] and proportionate relationship [ ausgewogenes PERSON ] between the legitimate interests of the persons concerned . Unilateral favourable or unfavourable treatment of some rather than others would not be in keeping with the constitutional foundations of a socially just system of private property ...", "In exercising its legislative power under LAW , second sentence , of LAW , the legislature can also , in certain circumstances , nullify existing legal positions protected by a property safeguard when undertaking a general reform of a particular legal area ... Moreover , fundamental changes in the economic and social situation can broaden its margin of manoeuvre when creating new legislation . The legislature can also , in enacting provisions on the basis of LAW , second sentence , of LAW , take account of the difficulties caused by the transition from the socialist legal order and its property regime , including the legal positions subsequently acquired , to the legal system of GPE and to the fact that such a transition can not be implemented TIME . This will have implications for the interpretation of a particular law . Individual provisions imposing a burden can not be examined in isolation regardless of their legislative context , or without regard to the fact that the desired legal position can only be put in place step by step ...", "( dd ) Judged in the light of those criteria , the rules under LAW ) , paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , taken together with section ORG ) , paragraph CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , letter ( c ) , and paragraph CARDINAL of LAW to LAW are compatible with LAW .", "( aaa ) The provisions complained of pursue a legitimate aim .", "According to the legal reasoning of ORG , which was adopted by ORG in the original proceedings , section CARDINAL ) , paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , taken together with section ORG ) , paragraph CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , letter ( c ) , and paragraph CARDINAL of LAW to LAW remedies a hidden legislative loophole in LAW DATE regarding the inheritance of title to property acquired under the land reform , which is at the heart of the instant case . In theory , this finding binds ORG . Like the establishment and assessment of the facts relevant to the decision , the interpretation and application of the law of another ORG are matters for the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts . Only under certain conditions does ORG have corrective power in that regard . Those conditions would only be met here if the assessment of the law of the German GPE relating to a hidden loophole in the PERSON of DATE , which forms the basis of ORG judgment , had breached LAW ... in so far as it prohibits arbitrariness ... This is not the case , however .", "In the light of the relevant statutory provisions , ORG established that the deliberations in ORG [ ORG ] on DATE were designed to prepare GPE statutory agricultural regime for adjustment to a social market - economy orientated agriculture . It noted in that connection that priority had been given to amending LAW . At the same time , however , the restrictions on the disposal of land acquired under the land reform were also to be lifted and inheritance rights guaranteed in the future . In doing so , ORG apparently did not realise that the repeal ( deemed necessary for that purpose ) of ORG Decrees without any transitional provisions for those transfers and returns that had not been implemented also extended to cases where title to property acquired under the land reform had passed to the owner 's heirs . ORG found that simply transferring title to land used for agricultural purposes to the heirs of beneficiaries who had died , even where the heirs in question did not live in GPE or did not work in the agricultural sector ... did not contribute to the adjustment of a State agricultural system to a market one .", "That reasoning is understandable [ nachvollziehbar ] and does not in any way support the assumption that the assessment of ORG and therefore of ORG was based on considerations that were irrelevant to the facts of the case and thus breached the prohibition on arbitrariness contained in LAW . It is not for ORG to decide whether the drafting history of LAW DATE and legal development in the territory that subsequently acceded to GPE up until reunification indicate that it was the legislature 's intention to repeal \u2013 without any transitional provisions , including for cases where land acquired under the land reform had passed to the owner 's heirs \u2013 the restrictions on the disposal of title to land acquired under the land reform and ORG Decrees .", "( bbb ) Nor is the manner in which the legislative loophole identified by ORG was remedied by the provisions in question open to criticism from the point of view of compatibility with LAW . It leads , against the background of the former decrees of GPE on changes of possession , to an appropriate system of ownership reflecting the factual situation and one that is , moreover , acceptable to the interested parties and clarifies the position for the future .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Change of Possession Decree of DATE , in the version set out in the Decree of DATE , provided that , on the request of an heir to land acquired under the land reform , the district council was to transfer the rights and obligations relating to the use of the land to the heir or to a member of his family designated by him , with the proviso that the heir or the member of his family concerned use the land for agricultural purposes as a member of a ORG or as a labourer . Where there were several heirs , they had to inform the district council promptly to which heir or other member of their family the rights and obligations associated with farming the land should be transferred . If the conditions for transfer were not satisfied , the land would return to the pool of ORG - owned property , in accordance with LAW of the decree .", "CARDINAL . NORP By enacting section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , taken together with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , the parliament of reunified GPE transposed these legal principles wholesale . The parties have therefore been placed in the situation that they would have been in if ORG Decrees had been properly applied and implemented by the authorities of GPE prior to the entry into force of LAW DATE or if , before reunification , the legislature of GPE had enacted transitional provisions akin to the rules previously governing changes of possession . The provisions complained of , as ORG rightly held , moreover , did not destroy the legitimate confidence [ schutzw\u00fcrdiges Vertrauen ] of the heirs of owners of land acquired under the land reform .", "It was not generally possible to have confidence in the continued application of the laws of GPE at the time of the change of regime [ PERSON ] , given the possible reunification of the two GPE . Such confidence would have been justified only if there were special reasons for believing that the law of GPE would exceptionally remain in force ... The expectation that property ownership acquired prior to the entry into force of LAW in the territory that had acceded to ORG would in principle be recognised could not be as extensively protected as the expectation that the rights acquired by virtue of LAW would be maintained . In any event , the only factor to be taken into consideration for the protection of this expectation is the factual and legal position the NORP federal legislature found to obtain in GPE when it ceased to exist as a ORG and which , in the course of reunification , was so to speak transposed as a legal element into the sphere of application of LAW ...", "Consequently , the heirs of the owners of land acquired under the land reform could no longer legitimately expect to maintain the title they had acquired by virtue of the failure to implement the Change of Possession Decrees enacted at the time of GPE . Nor did the transition , in terms of both the general and the constitutional law , of GPE to a legal order protecting private property offer particular grounds for expecting that , where land acquired under the land reform passed to the owner 's heirs , title to the land \u2013 described in the law in question as full ownership DATE would be maintained . Once transition had been achieved , only ownership of private property knowingly and intentionally conferred on an individual was to be protected . This was not the case regarding the ownership of land that had been acquired under the land reform and subsequently inherited from the owners , since , as observed by ORG , there was a hidden legislative loophole in LAW DATE . It therefore has to be assumed that the legislature of GPE would itself have enacted analogous provisions to those by which the land became ORG - owned property again if it had been aware of the factual and legal position regarding cases where there were no heirs satisfying the conditions by which the rights and obligations governing use of the land could be transferred to them .", "In these circumstances , the legislature of reunified GPE was justified in compensating , comprehensively , for provisions that had been overlooked at the material time . The fact that it did not remedy this loophole when LAW was signed does not justify a legitimate expectation that the legal position created by LAW DATE would be maintained . Having regard to the multiplicity and complexity of the tasks that had to be undertaken in connection with reunification , the authors of LAW were not in a position to enact in a single stroke of the pen , as it were , and in a definitively satisfactory manner , all the rules necessary to ensure the smooth adjustment of the law of GPE to that of GPE ... Thus all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the courts had to expect that legal positions initially transferred as they stood would be modified and clarified by the reunified NORP legislature once it had ascertained the scope of the laws enacted by GPE .", "The same also applies to ownership of land acquired under the land reform , which the legislature of GPE had transformed into full ownership when privatising the agricultural system . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant had inherited land in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , she had been a member of an agricultural cooperative in the GPE .

This judgment was upheld on DATE by ORG , which held , among other things , that the mere fact that the applicant had technically always been a member of an agricultural cooperative , even after starting her job at ORG , did not suffice to give her valid title to the land in question . Moreover , referring to the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE , ORG held that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) did not infringe the right of property or the principle that laws could not apply retrospectively even if the \u201c new farmer \u201d had paid a certain sum on being allotted his or her land under the land reform .", "CARDINAL .
