GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , and the second applicant , PERSON PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in LOC . They were represented before ORG by PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The applicants , a married couple , are the parents of a girl , ORG . , born on DATE , and of a boy , PERSON . , born on DATE .", "Since his birth PERSON . has been in hospital CARDINAL times , namely from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE because of pneumonia , from CARDINAL DATE until DATE due to a haemangioma in his mouth and from DATE to DATE due to bronchitis . Otherwise , he has been looked after only by his parents , mainly his mother .", "During this last stay in hospital , acute shortness of breath put his life at risk , which was saved by intubation . Several radiographies disclosed fractures of several ribs and of his right upper arm . Having consulted a radiological expert , the doctors treating him concluded that PERSON . \u2019s injuries had not been caused by illness , in particular not by a pathological structure of his bones , but by third persons . Having been confronted with the suspicion of having ill - treated their child , the applicants vigorously denied having injured PERSON .", "On DATE ORG , having regard to PERSON . \u2019s injuries and having heard the applicants , withdrew the applicants\u2019 right to determine PERSON . \u2019s and PERSON . \u2019s whereabouts and their right to decide on their health care by way of an interim injunction .", "Both children were placed in foster families . ORG subsequently excluded the GPE access to their children for DATE and then allowed the parents supervised contact with both PERSON . and PERSON . once a week and later once every two weeks .", "In their report of DATE to ORG , the paediatricians PERSON and PERSON , who had also consulted PERSON . , a child radiologist , concluded that the CARDINAL fractures of his ribs PERSON . had suffered and the fracture of his right upper arm had not been caused by an illness , in particular not by osteogenesis imperfecta ( \u201c OI \u201d , commonly known as brittle bone disease ) , or by his medication . They could thus only be explained by the use of massive force by an adult or teenager on CARDINAL occasions . At least some of the fractures had been caused during periods of time in which PERSON . had stayed only with his parents and not in hospital .", "In his report dated DATE , psychiatric expert PERSON . concluded that , even though neither of the parents was prone to violence , it could not be excluded that CARDINAL of them had ill - treated PERSON . The mother did not suffer from a psychiatric illness , but could have been under strain from raising PERSON . with his fragile health in addition to PERSON . However , it was more likely that PERSON . \u2019s father , who suffered from a narcissistic personality disorder and was unhappy with the strain put on the rest of the family by PERSON . , had caused the boy \u2019s injuries .", "In his report of DATE , psychological expert PERSON . found that the applicants\u2019 family did not as such pose high risks of ill - treatment . Assuming that CARDINAL of the parents had ill - treated PERSON . , there was an enhanced risk of repeated ill - treatment , particularly for PERSON . , but also for PERSON . , as the parents denied any responsibility for PERSON . \u2019s injuries , which made it difficult to provide them with assistance .", "On DATE ORG withdrew the applicants\u2019 parental custody of PERSON . and PERSON . and appointed a guardian for the children . Relying on Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , it found that the children \u2019s physical well - being had been endangered by the applicants\u2019 abuse of their parental authority and that there were no less intrusive means to avert this danger .", "Having heard the applicants and their counsel , the first applicant \u2019s brother , the children \u2019s curator and curator ad litem , ORG and the experts PERSON , PERSON . and PERSON . in person , ORG was convinced that PERSON . had been subjected to physical ill - treatment in his GPE home . In particular , having regard to the findings of expert PERSON as to the periods of time in which the fractures , which had not been caused by an illness , had probably occurred , and to the fact that PERSON . \u2019s state of health had never deteriorated in hospital , ORG found that it could be excluded that the boy \u2019s numerous injuries had occurred in the CARDINAL different hospitals in which he had been treated since his birth . They had thus been caused at Ma . \u2019s home either by CARDINAL of the parents or by both of them . The psychological and psychiatric expert reports had disclosed that the parents , who continued to deny having injured PERSON . , had been partly overstrained by having to raise CARDINAL young children . This finding was not put into question by the fact that CARDINAL paediatricians whom PERSON . had seen on several occasions due to shortness of breath had not noticed any signs of ill - treatment .", "As to PERSON . , ORG considered that she risked becoming the victim of ill - treatment in the future as well . It was impossible to avert the danger to her in practice by less intrusive measures .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the applicants and their counsel , the experts PERSON and PERSON . , the ORG expert ORG , a doctor having treated PERSON . in hospital , the children \u2019s guardian and their curator ad litem in person , and having regard to the written expert reports submitted by PERSON . and PERSON . , dismissed the ORG appeal concerning the withdrawal of custody of PERSON . It quashed the withdrawal of custody of PERSON . as of CARDINAL DATE but imposed several conditions on the parents aimed at safeguarding and controlling PERSON . \u2019s welfare .", "In a decision running to CARDINAL pages ORG found that withdrawing the GPE custody of PERSON . was presently the only means of averting danger to the boy \u2019s welfare .", "Having regard to the expert reports of PERSON and PERSON . , ORG found that CARDINAL of the boy \u2019s ribs had been broken during a period when he was at home , another CARDINAL had been broken during a period when PERSON . was both in hospital and at home , and on CARDINAL further occasions CARDINAL and CARDINAL ribs respectively had been broken in periods in which PERSON . had stayed at home . The boy \u2019s right upper arm had been broken in a period in which he had stayed both at home and in hospital . None of these injuries could have been caused by an accident . ORG conceded that the experts PERSON and PERSON . had partly modified their diagnosis compared to their initial report of DATE , finding that PERSON . had been injured not only on CARDINAL , but on CARDINAL occasions , and partly modifying the periods in which the injuries had occurred . However , their new findings were based on a particularly thorough further examination of the radiographies in question and were thus convincing .", "Moreover , having regard to the reports of experts PERSON and PERSON . and to the CARDINAL reports dated DATE and DATE drafted by a laboratory for human genetics , no illness , in particular no osteogenesis imperfecta , could be diagnosed which could have caused PERSON . \u2019s bones to break . It was therefore virtually certain that PERSON . \u2019s injuries had been caused by an abuse of parental authority . It could also not be explained otherwise that several radiographies done since PERSON . \u2019s separation from his parents in DATE had not disclosed any further fractures which had occurred either during his stays in hospital or with his foster family . ORG assumed that the parents had not been aware that PERSON . had suffered numerous fractures before the injuries had been discovered in hospital . As it could not be determined which of the parents , who had both denied being responsible for the injuries , had caused those injuries , the boy could not currently be returned to his parents as his welfare would otherwise be at risk .", "In reaching that conclusion , ORG also had regard to the submissions of a paediatric expert consulted by the applicants on their own motion , PERSON , who had invited the court to examine more thoroughly whether PERSON . was suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta . A report drawn up on DATE by a human genetics laboratory obtained by the applicants had concluded that it could not be totally excluded that PERSON . was suffering from such a condition . ORG , on ORG \u2019s proposal , had then obtained an additional expert report dated DATE from that laboratory , which found after another analysis that no such genetic illness could be diagnosed . It had refused to allow PERSON to examine PERSON . , arguing that it had already obtained a report from a paediatric expert .", "In ORG view , which did not follow the additional report submitted by expert PERSON . in this respect , the physical well - being of PERSON . , who had never been injured and had a close relationship with both parents , was no longer endangered if she was returned to her parents under conditions safeguarding her well - being . It further stated that it considered PERSON . \u2019s separation from his family not to be permanent , but that his return could be examined when he reached the age of three and went to kindergarten , provided that PERSON . \u2019s return to her family had gone well .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . They claimed that the decisions of the family courts ordering their separation from PERSON . disproportionately interfered with their right to respect for their family life . It had not been proved that either or both of them had injured the boy and the courts had not sufficiently examined whether the boy suffered from a condition which made his bones particularly fragile .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint PERSON ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG , having consulted psychological expert PERSON . , decided to retransfer custody of PERSON . to his parents as of DATE under several conditions , including psychological assistance for the parents and regular medical examinations of the boy . It found that the applicants had sought the help of therapists and had had regular access to PERSON . , who was now old enough to complain to others about potential ill - treatment . Therefore , the withdrawal of the GPE custody was no longer necessary to safeguard PERSON . \u2019s well - being . Since then PERSON . has again been living with the applicants .", "Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG provides that the family courts are under an obligation to order the necessary measures if a child \u2019s welfare is jeopardised .", "Pursuant to LAW , measures entailing a child \u2019s separation from his or her family are permissible only if the danger to the child \u2019s welfare can not be averted by other means , including public assistance . LAW that Code stipulates that full parental custody may only be withdrawn if other measures have proved ineffective or have to be considered insufficient to remove the danger ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
