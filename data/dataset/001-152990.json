On DATE the first and the second applicants\u2019 daughter , who was the third applicant \u2019s sister , was killed in a bar by GPE , who at the time served as a soldier in the NORP army .", "CARDINAL .

Meanwhile , on DATE the applicants withdrew their civil action against GPE but maintained their action against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Owing to the failure of the ORG representative to appear at several hearings , of which the first applicant was informed , on DATE ORG found that the civil action was considered to have been withdrawn ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ; section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicants challenged the decision of ORG by lodging an appeal before ORG . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal , holding as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW ( Official Gazette , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) provides that a person intending to bring a civil suit against GPE must first submit a request for a settlement to the competent ORG . When there is no doubt that before lodging the civil claim the claimant has failed to settle the case with the competent ORG , the first - instance court is correct to declare such a claim lodged directly before it inadmissible ( VS Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "The duty to seek settlement with the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG is a procedural requirement for lodging a civil action which must be complied with at the moment when the action is lodged .", "Section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW is inapplicable to claims for damages lodged before the courts prior to DATE .", "It is not in dispute that the plaintiffs on DATE lodged an identical claim against the same defendants before ORG ... It is also not disputed that on DATE , after the conditions for the stay of proceedings had been met twice , a decision was adopted finding that the claim against the first defendant , GPE , was withdrawn .", "However , these undisputed facts do not mean that the plaintiffs were released from their obligation under section ORG ) of LAW because they had previously submitted an identical claim . With the amendments to LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the duty to seek settlement with ORG is a procedural requirement for lodging a civil action which must be complied with at the moment when the action is lodged . Further amendments to LAW ( Official Gazette nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE ) did not [ alter this obligation ] with regard to the actions against GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG , challenging the decision of ORG on the grounds that it unreasonably restricted their right to access to court . They argued that before they brought their civil action of CARDINAL DATE before ORG they had attempted to settle the matter with the State Attorney \u2019s Office . However , their request had been refused , and later during the proceedings the State Attorney \u2019s Office had also challenged their claim in the court . The applicants therefore considered that there was no reason to seek another settlement concerning the identical claim brought before the court after it was decided that it had been withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) on DATE , reiterating their above arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the decisions of the lower courts did not concern individual acts deciding on their civil rights and obligations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law , endorsing the reasoning of ORG that the applicants had been obliged to seek settlement with ORG before lodging their action of CARDINAL DATE . ORG pointed out :", "\u201c It should be noted that the procedural requirement for the admissibility of an action under section ORG ) of LAW , and the reliance of the lower courts on that provision , do not represent a violation of a plaintiff \u2019s right of access to court . This is because the plaintiff , by complying with that provision , does not lose any of their rights to claim [ damages ] since , for example , the lodging of a request for settlement interrupts the running of the statutory prescription period ( [ Article CARDINAL ) ] \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and the plaintiff may lodge an action in the court if ORG refuses the request [ for settlement ] or does not decide on it within DATE it was lodged ( [ Article ORG ) ] \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "It can not therefore be said that the obligation of the plaintiffs to seek settlement of the claim with ORG before lodging an action against GPE represents an unreasonable restriction of access to a competent court which can decide the case on the merits as required under LAW of LAW ( Official Gazette - International Contracts , ORG . CARDINAL , ORG text , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . This is because section CARDINAL of LAW neither impaired the right to lodge a civil action nor the right to have the case decided on the merits ...
