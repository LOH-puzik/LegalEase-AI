NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP Overseas Territories Citizen and NORP and Caicos Islands Belonger , who was born in DATE and lives on GPE , an island in the NORP and GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a barrister practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP and GPE ( \u201c the Territory \u201d ) are ORG in LOC . At the relevant time , the CARDINAL Constitution set out the rules regarding government of the Territory . The LAW was made pursuant to powers conferred by LAW DATE which allowed Her Majesty to make Orders in Council for , inter alia , the peace , order and good government of the Territory . The LAW provided for a Governor , a ORG and an elected ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the former Premier of the NORP and GPE and was , at the relevant time , the elected representative of the LOC constituency and so an elected member of ORG . He is a citizen of the Territory and has been active in politics there for DATE . He became the head of ORG in DATE .

On DATE the Governor issued a statement responding to ORG . He indicated that ORG had formed the view that parts of the CARDINAL Constitution would need to be suspended and had decided to take steps to enable it to do so . On DATE he made public a draft ORG which would suspend parts of the CARDINAL Constitution initially for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant resigned as Premier on DATE . He remained an elected member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Order in Council was subsequently made by Her ORG in the form of the NORP and LAW DATE ( \u201c the Order \u201d ) and laid before ORG . The Order provided that parts of the CARDINAL Constitution were suspended and direct rule was assumed over the people of the Territory . In particular , the Order dissolved ORG and removed all elected officials for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review to challenge the legality of the Order . Regarding the removal of direct rule , the applicant argued that the LAW was inconsistent with the international law principle of self - determination ; that it was inconsistent with the right to stand for election and , once elected , to sit as a member of parliament , guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW ; that it was contrary to the principle of legality and a disproportionate and irrational response to the alleged crimes of certain elected representatives ; and that it was based on the recommendations of a flawed Inquiry and on recommendations which were themselves ultra vires the Inquiry \u2019s terms of reference .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place in ORG on DATE . Following the hearing , and at the request of the court , the Government confirmed by letter that before bringing the Order into effect they would withdraw the application of LAW No . CARDINAL from the NORP and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused permission to seek judicial review . Regarding specifically the applicant \u2019s argument under LAW No . CARDINAL , Lord Justice Carnwath indicated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]his aspect of the argument has in my view been overtaken by events . Following the hearing we have been informed by the Treasury Solicitor that , if a decision is taken to bring the Order into force , the GPE will in effect withdraw LAW . This can be done without Parliamentary sanction . It requires a declaration to ORG under LAW modifying the application of the LAW to the territory by withdrawing the application of LAW . It will be made clear that this is a temporary measure , pending steps to restore the principles of good governance in the Territory . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to potential limitations on the ORG \u2019s power to make laws for the peace , order and good government of the Territory , ORG examined , inter alia , the special status of human rights in judicial review . He referred to ORG judgment in R ( Bancoult ) v Home Secretary ( No CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , where that court had examined the statutory language conferring the power , and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Even allowing for the differences between the various speeches [ in GPE ] , those of the majority in my view provide a clear message that the ORG \u2019s power to legislate for the good government of a territory ... , although in principle subject to judicial review , is in practice not open to question in the courts other than in the most exceptional circumstances , which did not include the abrogation of the basic right relied on in that case . I see no reason to think the rights claimed in this case , important as they are , should be accorded greater weight . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the refusal of permission to ORG arguing , inter alia , that ORG had erred in finding that the ORG \u2019s power to legislate was not limited by any requirement to comply with fundamental rights .
