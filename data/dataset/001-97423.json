The respondent could only have dismissed the plaintiff for business reasons by giving her notice . Therefore , the termination of employment in question and the rescission of the employment contract represents a flagrant breach of the employee 's rights because the respondent \u2013 contrary to the legislation in force \u2013 unilaterally rescinded the plaintiff 's employment contract on the basis of a ' mutual agreement ' the plaintiff did not sign and was not obliged to sign . \u201d", "The plaintiff 's representative also emphasised that ORG had already declined jurisdiction in the case and invited ORG , should it find that it did not have jurisdiction either , to apply to ORG in order to resolve the conflict of jurisdiction with the ordinary courts thereby created .", "CARDINAL .
