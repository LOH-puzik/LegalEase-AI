He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their former Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a singer and well - known person in the entertainment industry in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a call on his personal mobile telephone from a journalist at the newspaper \u201c PERSON \u201d . The journalist informed the applicant that he was in possession of information regarding the fact that the applicant had fathered a child outside marriage . The information was to be published in a forthcoming issue of the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not consent to the publication , and on DATE obtained a court injunction prohibiting the newspaper from publishing the information .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the injunction , on DATE the newspaper went ahead with the publication . The article was called \u201c NORP hides his son born outside marriage \u201d , and was printed on pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the newspaper , with a large headline on the front page . The article included statements such as : \u201c PERSON reveals that a famous singer has not CARDINAL , but CARDINAL children \u201d ; \u201c ORG \u2019s secret DATE a child born outside marriage \u201d ; \u201c the boy does not know that his father is a famous singer \u201d ; \u201c before marrying PERSON , a singer [ the applicant \u2019s current wife ] , \u017d. ORG had a short , yet passionate love affair with L. \u201d ; \u201c \u017dilvinas did not disappear from the woman \u2019s life \u201d ; \u201c passionate love affairs fade over time . Nevertheless , sometimes children who come into the world and are rejected by their fathers remain a reminder of such affairs . Such a shadow of the past caught up with the famous singer PERSON \u201d ; and \u201c there will be much gossip following the publication of information about LOC child born outside marriage \u201d . The names of the boy and his mother were changed in the article , which also pointed out the fact that the boy \u2019s mother was a dancer in a famous dance group in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In addition , on the second page of the same issue , an article entitled \u201c Hostages of love \u201d appeared , describing the applicant \u2019s private life as the journalists imagined it to be .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON printed another article entitled \u201c PERSON in the arms of a new woman \u201d . The article stated that \u201c on DATE , while partying , PERSON was restless . Needless to say , there were plenty of young women at the party \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started court proceedings for breach of privacy and damage to his reputation . He claimed that the publications had caused him serious humiliation , as well as great distress to both him and his family . He also claimed that the newspaper had recorded his telephone conversation with the journalist without prior permission . The applicant requested that CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) be awarded to him in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "The applicant also asked that the newspaper be fined LTL CARDINAL for having disregarded the court order prohibiting the publication ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG concluded that the newspaper had breached the applicant \u2019s right to privacy , which was protected under LAW . The court found that the applicant \u2019s wife and the child \u2019s mother had attempted to persuade the newspaper \u2019s chief editor and the journalist who had written the article not to publish it . The QUANTITY women had not been successful . On the contrary , the newspaper had blackmailed the child \u2019s mother to make her portray the applicant in a negative light , in return , promising not to disclose the identity of the child .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the fact that the applicant \u2019s son had been conceived out of marriage was a matter relating to his private life , and , despite being a singer , the applicant did not come under the category of public figures . Moreover , even if the applicant could be considered a public figure , this would not give grounds to publish the information in question , given that there was no public interest in disclosing the fact that he had fathered the child . The publisher \u2019s and the journalist \u2019s argument that she had been aiming to disclose a story about how famous men did not raise or take care of their own children was devoid of substance . On the contrary , the court established that the child \u2019s mother had no claim against the applicant to the effect that he did not take care of the child . Quite the contrary , the child had a father whom he knew to be his father . The court agreed with the finding of the Inspector of ORG that the information in this particular case had been published in a sensational manner , with a large headline on the front page , thereby seeking to satisfy the readers\u2019 curiosity , and denying the applicant \u2019s right to protection of his privacy , and also being in breach of journalistic ethics . The court emphasised that , according to the practice of ORG , the disclosure of information about a child being conceived out of wedlock was to be considered a violation of the right to a private life , even if that information concerned a public figure , because there was no public interest in making such information known .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the court found that the journalist had breached the applicant \u2019s privacy by recording a telephone conversation with him without his consent ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as well as by unlawfully observing or watching him , collecting information about him , and using that information in the article entitled \u201c PERSON in the arms of a new woman \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the sum to be awarded in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG determined that the publication at issue had caused the applicant serious distress . Until then , only his wife and certain members of his family had known about what the publication had revealed . The court also attached importance to the fact that the newspaper had disregarded the court injunction and gone ahead with the publication of article , even though it had received that injunction in time to stop its publication . Moreover , the newspaper had had a large print run . Consequently , a large number of people had learnt about the relevant information .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court observed that , prior to the present litigation , the applicant had been rather open with the mass media , having disclosed private matters such as the fact that he was having another child [ with his wife ] and details about that child \u2019s birth . As a result , it was possible to conclude that up to the moment when the information at issue had become public , the applicant had not vigilantly protected his private life from the media , and had not considered his private life to have great value . For the court , that particular aspect of the case allowed it to lower the compensation award for non - pecuniary damage to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , an award to cover all the violations of privacy .", "CARDINAL . The court also ordered the newspaper to pay the applicant LTL CARDINAL in respect of legal costs . The applicant , in turn , was ordered to pay LTL MONEY , the newspaper \u2019s legal costs , on the basis that legal costs are reimbursed proportionately in relation to the claims granted ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG partly upheld the first instance court \u2019s decision . The court observed that , whilst the applicant was a singer and therefore had to be tolerant of media attention , he still retained the right to determine the boundaries of his private life , which no one had the right to cross without his consent . The information at issue had been made public without his consent . Moreover , that information was purely private and the publication thereof had had no connection to the applicant \u2019s professional activities . The court of first instance had been correct in finding that the aim of disclosing the information had been to cause a sensation , and not to inform society about matters of public interest . The publication had caused the applicant distress , and this was clearly proved by his wish to prevent public disclosure by obtaining a court injunction .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court noted that , according to the guidelines of ORG , the circumstances of any particular situation had to be evaluated when assessing non - pecuniary damage . In the light of the facts of the case , ORG considered that the sum of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL which had been awarded was too low to compensate for the non - pecuniary damage the applicant had sustained . Given that there had actually been CARDINAL violations of privacy in the case \u2013 the disclosure of information regarding the applicant having a child outside marriage , which was the more serious breach , and information about his behaviour at a party \u2013 it was appropriate to make CARDINAL separate awards . On that basis , the appellate court awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL for the first breach of privacy and LTL CARDINAL for the second . The court observed that there was no legal basis for a larger award , particularly given ORG guidelines that , when determining the sum to be awarded , it was necessary to take into account the economic situation of the country and the standard of living of its citizens . The newspaper was also ordered to cover the applicant \u2019s legal costs in respect of the part of the civil claim which had been allowed .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of LAW , ORG also imposed a fine of LTL CARDINAL on the newspaper , the maximum amount possible , for disregarding the court injunction forbidding it from going ahead with the publication of information breaching the applicant \u2019s right to a private life . ORG established that the newspaper had received the court injunction in time , but had failed to comply with it , thus grossly breaching the maxim that court rulings are imperative ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the newspaper both lodged appeals on points of law . On DATE ORG changed the decision of ORG in part . ORG had regard to the need to balance rights under LAW ( it relied on Editions PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIV , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . ORG agreed with the lower courts\u2019 reasoning to the effect that the applicant \u2019s occupation did not automatically mean that he consented to the publication of all information about his private life . The information which had been disclosed was exclusively private ; there was no public interest in society learning of it . Consequently , the court found that the newspaper had overstepped the boundaries prescribed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the question of non - pecuniary damage , ORG concurred with the lower courts that a mere finding of a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to privacy would not be sufficient compensation . However , ORG deemed it important to ensure the continuity of its earlier case - law and take into consideration past awards in analogous cases . Given the scarcity of case - law on breach of privacy matters , it was necessary to consider the non - pecuniary value ( neturtin\u0117 vertyb\u0117 ) which had been breached . The more important the value ( for example , health or life ) , the more it was protected ( the ORG relied on its earlier ruling in case no . CARDINALKCARDINAL/CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , the right to a private life had to be balanced with another constitutional value \u2013 the right to disseminate information . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided a list of criteria to be taken into account when assessing compensation , also providing for court discretion in this matter .", "CARDINAL . Continuing with its assessment , ORG noted that the newspaper \u2019s transgression had been deliberate , given that it had consciously chosen not to comply with the court injunction . However , the publication of the information had not carried grave or long - term consequences for the applicant , because his wife had known about his son who had been born outside marriage , and the applicant had discussed certain aspects of his private life with journalists on many occasions in the past , and was used to media attention . All this was relevant when assessing compensation for nonpecuniary damage . Moreover , the lower courts had not established that , by breaching the applicant \u2019s right to a private life , the newspaper had attempted to obtain economic gain , for example by printing more copies of the newspaper , and such a point was relevant when determining compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , ORG concluded that the firstinstance court had properly examined all of the relevant circumstances , and taking into consideration , inter alia , the sums awarded as compensation in similar cases , had reasonably awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL . That decision was to stay in force .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG reviewed the issue of legal costs , in the light of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and lowered the costs of representation to be reimbursed to the newspaper , because they were higher than those recommended by ORG . Once all the sums in respect of both parties\u2019 representation at the CARDINAL levels of court had been calculated , the applicant had to pay the newspaper LTL CARDINAL for legal costs and court fees . He therefore received LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) following the civil litigation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the newspaper Private printed an article about the applicant \u2019s family life , where he and his wife PERSON were interviewed about their family . They stated that they were able to lean on each other at any time .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE reads :", "\u201c A person \u2019s private life shall be inviolable ...", "The law and the courts shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference in his private and family life , or from encroachment upon his honour and dignity . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG decided civil case no . DATE . The plaintiff had asked to be awarded LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage , which he had suffered as a result of physical injury . He had been attacked by CARDINAL people and beaten , thereby suffering facial injuries and being rendered disabled . ORG held that health was one of the most important values , which was often not repairable or restorable . Health therefore merited particular protection . The court also took into account that the non - pecuniary damage in this case had been caused by a crime \u2013 the deliberate and brutal actions of the respondents . It was therefore fair to grant the civil claim in full .", "CARDINAL . As regards the amounts awarded for non - pecuniary damage to redress breaches of privacy , the Government referred to a number of ORG decisions . In cases concerning the reputation of a legal entity , for example , the awards were between LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "The Government also referred to cases where protected values other than privacy had been at issue . In cases concerning injury to one \u2019s health , the awards for non - pecuniary damage were between LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL - CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LTL CARDINAL , depending on the severity of the injury .

A worker who had fallen off a building platform and cracked his skull was thus awarded LTL CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of that injury .", "On DATE ORG gave a ruling in civil case no . CARDINALKCARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning an accident at work following which the plaintiff in question had become handicapped . ORG noted that the worker was partly to blame for his injury , because he had not followed safety instructions at work . Accordingly , although the plaintiff had asked for LTL CARDINAL and the first - instance court had awarded him LTL CARDINAL , ORG considered that a sum of LTL CARDINAL would be sufficient to compensate for the non - pecuniary damage suffered .", "On DATE ORG examined case no . CARDINALKCARDINAL/CARDINAL , which also concerned an accident at work . The plaintiff in that case was awarded LTL CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage suffered as a result of physical injury .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in civil case no .

For ORG , LTL CARDINAL was sufficient to compensate for the non - pecuniary damage sustained .", "On DATE , in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG agreed that an award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in a civil case was sufficient to compensate for the plaintiff \u2019s mental suffering , where a local television station had wrongfully accused the plaintiff of having committed a traffic violation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a ruling in civil case no . ORG - CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning a civil claim by a woman , PERSON , for breach of privacy in respect of an article in a DATE newspaper , PERSON , entitled \u201c A date with a lesbian \u201d ( \u201c Pasimatymas su lesbiete \u201d ) . The case concerned an article which had included CARDINAL photographs . PERSON was in CARDINAL of those photographs , which was in a large format . She had been photographed from the front , although her name had not been disclosed . The first - instance court considered that , \u201c taking into account society \u2019s negative opinion about people of non - traditional sexual orientation \u201d ( \u201c teismas , \u012fvertin\u0119s susidariusi\u0105 neigiam\u0105 visuomen\u0117s nuomon\u0119 apie netradicin\u0117s seksualin\u0117s orientacijos \u017emones \u201d ) , the publication of PERSON \u2019s photograph in such a context could cause her to be evaluated oddly ( gal\u0117jo sukelti prie\u0161taring\u0173 ie\u0161kov\u0117s vertinim\u0173 ) . The court also noted that the newspaper \u2019s financial situation was good , it had a large print throughout GPE . However , the newspaper had not apologised to the plaintiff or paid her damages , even though it had initially promised to do so . However , the sum claimed by the plaintiff , LTL CARDINAL , was clearly excessive . It was therefore reasonable to award her LTL CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage . That sum was upheld by the appellate court , which underlined that the article \u201c A date with a lesbian \u201d was conflicting ( vertinamas prie\u0161taringai ) in a homophobic society , and people whose photographs were linked to that article could therefore experience negative consequences , as indeed in GPE \u2019s case . She had had to explain herself to her parents , colleagues at work and friends from times of studies . The award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL would also not impede the DATE commercial activity of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . The newspaper lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing that the award for non - pecuniary damage was too high . ORG noted that it was important to adhere to the principle of non - discrimination , which meant that similar cases should be decided similarly , and which also meant that , in analogous situations , awards for non - pecuniary damage should be comparable . ORG also relied on its earlier case - law to the effect that courts should not only follow the criteria established in legal norms and court practice , but should also take into account the awards already granted in analogous cases .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus distinguished CARDINAL categories of cases .", "Firstly , there were cases where a plaintiff \u2019s privacy had been breached on account of the arrangement of his or her nude photographs with offensive text and headlines ( ORG referred to the case of PERSON PERSON and PERSON ) , or where information regarding \u201c family secrets \u201d or health had been made public ( ORG referred to its ruling of DATE in the instant case of NORP ) , or where information about private life had been published together with photographs , which had amounted to a breach of the right to a private life . The awards in those cases were , respectively , LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL , LTL CARDINAL and LTL CARDINAL .", "As to the second category , ORG referred to some cases where the press had used plaintiffs\u2019 private photographs without permission , or had accused them of crimes , where the non - pecuniary damage awards were LTL CARDINAL .", "The third category concerned cases where photographs of plaintiffs who were well - known people in society had been published without their consent , and for the purpose of a newspaper gaining financial benefit from advertisement , where the awards for non - pecuniary damage were LTL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG then held that , in the case of GPE , the award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL was too high , because it did not correspond to the abovementioned court practice . PERSON \u2019s photograph had been published only as an illustration of the article , and neither her personal data nor information about her private life had been made public . Moreover , the photograph had been taken at a public event when PERSON was posing ( vie\u0161ame renginyje , ie\u0161kovei pozuojant ) . In the view of ORG , an award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be fair and adequate in respect of the non - pecuniary damage sustained by PERSON in relation to the breach of her right to protection of her image , and to prevent the abuse of freedom of expression by the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a ruling in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which concerned ORG civil claim for defamation against a television channel , Tele-CARDINAL .

ORG held that information about PERSON \u2019s fatherhood , his sexual orientation , and his unverified operation concerned his private life , notwithstanding PERSON being well - known because he was a singer . Moreover , disseminating such information had no public interest . On the contrary , having had regard to the manner in which the information had been presented , ORG held that the only aim in disseminating it had been to spread gossip to satisfy the curiosity of a certain category of television viewers . The fact that PERSON had communicated with the media before did not mean that he had lost his right to privacy . Having examined the case in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law ( ORG v.
