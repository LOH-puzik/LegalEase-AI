On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant lodged a claim against ORG seeking compensation for damages incurred through the inappropriate administration of justice , notably the excessive length of proceedings in respect of her claims against the company . She argued that the courts had failed to observe the time - limits prescribed by LAW , which had undermined the possibility of enforcement of the final judgment in her favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim without consideration on the merits . Referring to Ruling no . ORG , adopted by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG noted that current laws did not determine the grounds or procedure for adjudicating a claim for damages on account of failure by the courts to comply with statutory time - limits . In particular , the court noted as follows :", "\u201c According to LAW , the rules of civil procedure in federal courts of general jurisdiction are determined by LAW , LAW , LAW and other federal laws .", "The law has not determined the territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over civil claims for compensation for damage incurred in civil proceedings in cases where a dispute has not been heard on the merits as a consequence of unlawful acts ( or failure to act ) of a court ( a judge ) , including breach of a reasonable - time guarantee .", "Pursuant to LAW , the judge shall dismiss a statement of claim if the claim is subject to examination not in civil proceedings but in another judicial procedure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE on appeal , finding as follows :", "\u201c In dismissing the claim with reference to Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE of ORG of GPE , the court came to the correct conclusion that its examination by a district court of general jurisdiction would only be possible if a federal law determined that the district court of general jurisdiction had territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over such claims .", "At the present time , however , neither the Code of Civil Procedure of GPE nor any other federal law ... determines the territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over claims concerning compensation for damage caused by judicial acts not touching upon the merits of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code contains general provisions on liability for the infliction of damage . It establishes that damage inflicted on the person or property of an individual must be reimbursed in full by the person who inflicted the damage ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code determines liability for damage caused by the unlawful actions of law - enforcement authorities or courts .

By Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG found that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with LAW in so far as it provided for special conditions in respect of State liability for damage caused in the framework of the administration of justice . It clarified , nevertheless , that the term \u201c administration of justice \u201d did not cover judicial proceedings in their entirety , but only extended to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case . Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature DATE fell outside the scope of the notion \u201c administration of justice \u201d . State liability for damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act , such as a breach of the \u201c reasonable length \u201d requirement of court proceedings , could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings . ORG emphasised , moreover , that the constitutional right to compensation by the ORG for damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge . An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . ORG held that ORG should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the ORG for damage caused by the unlawful acts or failure to act of a court or judge and determine territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over such claims .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that a civil claim must be dismissed by a judge , in particular , if it is amenable to examination not in civil proceedings but in another judicial procedure ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
