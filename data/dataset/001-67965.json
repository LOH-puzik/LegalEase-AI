SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She was represented before the ORG by Mr O. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a dentist and runs a private dental practice in ORG . As such , under LAW ( Law no . PERSON ) , as amended ( PERSON o zdravotnej starostlivosti ) , she is under an obligation to provide health care .", "In DATE and DATE the applicant provided dental care to patients who were insured by a private insurer P. Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG Law no . PERSON ) , as amended ( PERSON o zdravotnom poisten\u00ed ) , PERSON was obliged to pay the applicant the costs of this care upon request within DATE , latepayment interest being set pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that Act at PERCENT per day . P. has however failed to make any payment .", "On DATE ORG withdrew ORG 's licence to provide health insurance as it did not have the prescribed number of insurance policies . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG decided that ORG 's insurance policies would be assigned to ORG ( GPE zdravotn\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a ) . ORG noted that pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of that LAW guaranteed ORG solvency and that , in the circumstances , the latter was the most appropriate body to secure the policyholders ' constitutional right to healthcare . ORG ruled , lastly , that pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW liabilities to private healthcare establishments and its receivables ( insurance premiums and latepayment penalties ) were transferred to ORG . The decision became final and binding on DATE .", "On DATE , at ORG request for a review under a special procedure , ORG upheld the decision of DATE . It observed that under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG the withdrawal of P. 's licence meant that the winding up and liquidation proceedings had begun automatically , by operation of law . The liquidator 's powers were confined to liquidating ORG 's assets . The exact procedure was governed by the relevant provisions of LAW . Should the liquidator discover that ORG 's assets did not suffice to satisfy its creditors , he or she was required to seek an insolvency order . ORG held that ORG could by no means be considered to be P. 's general legal successor . The transfer of ORG 's liabilities and claims to ORG was governed by special legal provisions contained in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . Pursuant to that provision , the liabilities of an insurer on a winding - up passed to the designated insurer only to the extent that they could not be satisfied from the assets of the insurer that was being woundup . In the present case it had not yet been established by the liquidator that ORG 's assets were insufficient to satisfy its creditors . According to ORG , therefore , PERSON 's liabilities could not be considered as having been assumed by ORG for the time being .", "On DATE PERSON 's liquidator filed a petition with ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) seeking an insolvency order against ORG made the order on DATE and it became final and binding on DATE . Under LAW the declaration of insolvency automatically stayed the liquidation proceedings . The insolvency proceedings are still pending .", "On DATE the applicant unsuccessfully lodged a demand with ORG for payment of the costs of the dental treatment .", "On DATE amendment no . PERSON . to ORG entered into force . It added inter alia a new paragraph DATE of the Act . It stipulated that where the outstanding liabilities of an insurance company in liquidation were passed on to a designated insurer , like ORG in the present case , they were to be settled within DATE from the date the liquidation accounts were approved or an insolvency order made . Such liabilities would to be settled from the liquidated insurance company 's assets , from the ORG budget or from other sources designated by the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , brought a civil action against ORG in the Bratislava V ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) . She sought an order for the payment of CARDINAL NORP korunas ( SKK ) for the above dental care plus latepayment interest . She submitted that the newly adopted paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of ORG was not applicable to her case as P. 's debt towards her had passed to the defendant prior to the entry into force of amendment no . CARDINAL . In support of that argument she maintained that in DATE the defendant had settled PERCENT of P. 's outstanding debts to Stateowned pharmacies . If PERSON 's outstanding debts had not been assumed by ORG , there would have been no valid legal basis for such settlement . In its observations in defence , the defendant acknowledged the PERCENT settlement but maintained that it had been financed from extrabudgetary resources which had not been intended for it or for the liquidator .", "On DATE , on a protest by ORG , the ORG quashed the ruling in its decision of DATE that ORG 's liabilities towards private healthcare establishments had been transferred to ORG . The remainder of the decision of DATE remained unaffected .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action after hearing the parties and examining complex documentary evidence . ORG observed that although PERSON had been wound up and subsequently declared insolvent , it had not been struck off the business register and had retained its legal personality . The transfer of its liabilities to ORG was not automatic . As the insolvency and liquidation proceedings had not yet been completed , it could not be determined whether PERSON had any liabilities that could not be settled from its assets . It therefore could not be said whether DATE and if so which \u2013 of P. 's liabilities had been transferred to the defendant . Therefore , at the material time , there had been no cause of action against ORG . Moreover , and in any event , the action was also premature in that , even assuming that ORG 's debt to the applicant had passed on to the defendant , the timelimit under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG for its settlement had not yet expired . As to the temporal application of LAW , ORG observed that amendment no . CARDINAL contained no transitional provisions . It concluded that LAW was thus to be applied as worded on DATE of the judgment . ORG dismissed the applicant 's argument based on the partial settlement of ORG 's debts towards ORG owned pharmacies observing that the settlement had been arranged by ORG 's liquidator and financed from nonbudgetary resources , the defendant merely having played the role of an administrator in the transaction . ORG observed , lastly , that DATE period laid down by amendment no . CARDINAL had been adopted in order to enable the ORG to raise the financial resources necessary to settle the liabilities of insolvent private health insurers .", "On DATE the applicant , assisted by a lawyer , appealed against the judgment of DATE . She reiterated the arguments she had made in ORG . In its observations in reply , ORG pointed out that P. 's insolvency and the liquidation of its assets had not affected its legal existence , and it still had assets that needed to be realised and the proceeds distributed . Only then could it be established which , if any , of P. 's liabilities could not be settled and would consequently pass to ORG . Furthermore , only at that point would it become clear what additional funds would have to be raised in order to cover the transferred liabilities , a process for which amendment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had afforded a period of DATE .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . It noted that the order declaring P. insolvent became effective on DATE . Pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG any of P. 's liabilities which had been taken over by ORG were not payable until DATE after the insolvency order , that is to say until DATE . Thus , above all , the action was premature .", "On DATE amendment no . PERSON . to ORG entered into force . It inter alia modified the wording of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) by providing that if the amounts obtained by realising the liquidated insurance company 's assets did not suffice to cover its liabilities in full , only that portion of the outstanding liabilities that represented principal ( exclusive of any penalties for late payment ) was payable .", "In DATE the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW of the LAW . She formally directed her complaint against ORG and ORG and objected that the decision to apply LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , as amended by amendment no . CARDINAL , and to dismiss her the action she had brought on DATE had infringed her right to equality of ownership ( LAW of LAW ( Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch pr\u00e1v a slob\u00f4d ) ) , her right to equality ( LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW ) , her freedom of choice of occupation and business ( LAW ) and her property rights ( LAW . She also maintained that the alleged violations constituted a breach of the principle of the rule of law enshrined in LAW . She asserted that amendment no . MONEY had retrospectively and substantially changed the conditions under which she had entered the entrepreneurial environment and had disproportionately and without any acceptable justification postponed the settlement of her claim .", "On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . Observing that the complaint was formally directed against ORG and ORG , it found that there was no connection between those courts ' decisions , which were in conformity with the relevant laws , and the alleged violation of the applicant 's right to equality , equality of ownership and freedom of choice of occupation and business . ORG also observed that the right to freedom of choice of business did not afford any protection from entrepreneurial risk , a part of which was the risk that one 's business partners may became insolvent . That part of the complaint was therefore manifestly ill - founded . In so far as the applicant complained of a violation of her property rights , ORG observed that the task of protecting those rights had been entrusted to the ordinary courts . It therefore found that in accordance with the subsidiarity principle it had no jurisdiction to entertain that part of the applicant 's complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
