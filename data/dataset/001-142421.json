From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant underwent an examination in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission of CARDINAL experts ( with the involvement of the CARDINAL experts who had prepared the previous report of CARDINAL DATE ) delivered its report on the basis of a psychological and psychiatric evaluation of the applicant and the case - file materials . The experts also heard several witnesses . In particular , they questioned a person who had worked with the applicant in DATE and who described him as an intelligent but impulsive person who had some strange ideas and liked to be the centre of attention . The applicant \u2019s former wife gave a similar description , having also noted that he was a kind person despite his difficult character . The applicant \u2019s current wife refused to be questioned . A general practitioner who had treated the applicant for some unspecified condition in DATE submitted that he remembered the applicant for his emotionally - expressed nationalist ideas . A lawyer who had often encountered the applicant in court when acting as a representative described him as a bold and provocative person with a tendency to insult others . A circuit police officer , who had inspected the gas pipeline repairs site , submitted that he remembered the applicant on account of certain \u201c hysterical outbursts \u201d and that he had had the impression that the applicant had some mental issues . The general conclusions of the commission were worded as follows :", "\u201c At the time of the events [ ... ] Mr PERSON was suffering , and is suffering presently , from a chronic psychiatric illness in the form of a paranoid personality disorder with delusional inclusions ( \u201c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u201d ) .", "This conclusion is confirmed by the anamnestic data , the materials of the criminal case file , the results of the present clinical psychiatric and experimental - psychological evaluation , which has disclosed that throughout his life the applicant has manifested such personality characteristics as egocentrism , rigidity in his attitudes , extremely high self - esteem , arrogance and extreme self - confidence , irrational feelings of injustice , a tendency to make categorical and subjective judgments , susceptibility and extreme sensitivity to failure and situations infringing on his personal interests , a tendency towards a distorted perception of reality and the attitudes of those around him , militant and persistent assertion of his rightness and importance , rigidity of opinions and emotions , bluntness , a tendency to be tendentious and contrived in forming judgments , tenacity in the defence and implementation of his ideas coupled with a tendency towards inertia and philosophising , and , as a result of all the aforementioned and against the background of what he perceives as the difficult and unfavourable development of the criminal investigation and trial , he has formed some fixed and delusional ideas about being persecuted .", "The aforementioned personality characteristics of [ the applicant ] manifest themselves to such a high degree that they can be considered to have undermined his ability to be aware of and to control his actions at the time of the offences he has been charged with . [ ... ]", "The present psychiatric condition of [ the applicant ] does not enable him to be aware of his actions ( or inactivity ) or to control them .", "He requires involuntary medical treatment by way of admission to a psychiatric hospital with ordinary supervision .", "As to the [ similar ] questions regarding [ the charge of extortion from Ms B. ] , they were already resolved in the report of DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of extortion from PERSON As to the charge of extortion from PERSON , the court held that there was insufficient evidence of the applicant \u2019s guilt . It also established that the applicant had impeded the gas pipeline repairs . The court noted that the applicant could not be held accountable for the criminal offences in question and required involuntary medical treatment in a mental facility . It stated , in particular :", "\u201c It has been established that , at the time the offences were committed , Mr PERSON behaved in a bold manner and without respect for the victims and others involved , that he made threats to the health and lives of the victims , and that he took deliberate steps to impede the gas pipeline repairs , thus endangering the health and lives of the public . Although PERSON PERSON has not made a direct attempt on anybody \u2019s life , his present mental condition warrants his involuntary admission to a psychiatric hospital , because he is a dangerous person ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision of the first - instance court of DATE as it had been delivered in the applicant \u2019s absence . It stated that his presence had been obligatory unless he had expressly refused to attend or had been prevented from attending by the nature of his illness . The appellate court also noted that although ORG had found that the applicant \u2019s guilt had not been proven in respect of the charge of extortion from PERSON , no decision had been taken as regards the termination of that part of the proceedings . The case was therefore remitted to the first - instance court for fresh examination . The appellate court also decided to keep the preventive measure in respect of the applicant ( detention ) unchanged , without explanation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s waiver of the services of several lawyers who had been representing him . Instead , it appointed a lawyer from the local bar association to represent his interests in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at a hearing attended by the applicant and his appointed lawyer , ordered another forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant , with a view to answering the following questions : ( CARDINAL ) whether the applicant was suffering from any mental illnesses at the time ; ( CARDINAL ) whether he was aware of and able to control his actions ; and ( CARDINAL ) whether the nature of his illness could be regarded as an impediment to his participation in court hearings . The applicant did not object in principle to such an examination , as long as it was carried out by an independent expert .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE an examination was carried out at ORG . According to the ensuing report , the applicant was suffering , at the time of the examination , from a \u201c chronic paranoid personality disorder with delusional inclusions \u201d . His psychiatric condition was deemed to prevent him from participating effectively in court hearings . As noted in the part of the report entitled \u201c Psychological examination \u201d , the applicant behaved in a free and friendly manner , demonstrating an advanced intellect and good memory and analytical skills , but also demonstrating a certain superiority and rigidity in his opinions . The overall findings of the report were practically identical to those of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor dropped the charges against the applicant as regards the interference with the gas pipeline repairs and the extortion from Mr S.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings against the applicant in so far as the aforementioned charges were concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , following a hearing at which the lawyer earlier appointed for the applicant , but not the applicant himself , had been present , found the applicant guilty of extortion from PERSON on the medical reports concerning the applicant \u2019s mental health , ORG held that , although the applicant had been aware of his actions when he had committed the offence in question , his mental health had subsequently deteriorated to an extent warranting involuntary medical treatment . The court therefore ordered that the applicant be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment under ordinary supervision . The proceedings were stayed until the applicant \u2019s recovery .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son ( who had joined the proceedings as his representative ) appealed . He complained , in particular , that the applicant had wrongly been denied his right to participate in the hearing . He also complained that the applicant \u2019s right to be presumed to be of sound mind had been violated . He noted in this regard that the experts had reached opposite conclusions about the applicant \u2019s mental health , without any explanation for such a change in their position . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s son submitted that neither the applicant nor his family had agreed to the appointed lawyer representing the applicant and that the lawyer had been acting contrary to the applicant \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision on the involuntary medical treatment of the applicant . It noted that , as the medical experts had found , the nature of his illness had been an impediment to his participation in the court hearings . The appellate court also held that the application of the chosen measures in respect of the applicant was justified by the fact that he had committed a \u201c socially dangerous \u201d crime and that he was suffering from a mental illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from the GPE to ORG in the GPE region ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a panel of CARDINAL doctors from the PERSON hospital who concluded that his condition had stabilised and that he was not in need of any involuntary inpatient treatment . More specifically , the doctors observed that despite his chronic paranoid personality disorder with \u201c delusional inclusions \u201d , the applicant had been demonstrating orderly behaviour and a stable mood , with no aggressive tendencies . He regretted his earlier behaviour and had submitted that he understood that it had been wrong . The panel therefore sought the lifting of the involuntary medical treatment order imposed by the court , and an order for outpatient psychiatric treatment to replace it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the application of the ORG specialists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same panel of the Geykivska Hospital specialists issued another report , in which they noted a drastic deterioration in the applicant \u2019s mood and behaviour : he had become irritated , angry and aggressive and had conflicts with other patients . Accordingly , the doctors retracted their earlier conclusion of CARDINAL DATE as premature and asked the court to order that the applicant continue to be treated on an involuntary basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE , with reference to the medical report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the involuntary medical treatment of the applicant ordered on DATE should be continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal ( submitted via his son ) against the lower courts\u2019 decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined again by a panel of CARDINAL specialists from ORG ( CARDINAL member had been replaced ) . They noted that he was well oriented and gave adequate replies to questions , was brief and monotonic , expressed some delusional ideas about being persecuted by criminals , and remained self - confident and categorical in his judgments . As a result , they considered that the applicant \u2019s involuntary medical treatment should be continued .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled accordingly . Although the applicant , who was present at the court hearing , objected to that decision and submitted that he was in perfect health , the court considered , on the basis of the aforementioned medical report , that he was not able to critically assess his condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the panel of doctors from ORG ( in the same composition as on DATE ) examined the applicant again . Their conclusions were similar to those set out in the report of CARDINAL October CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the ORG request and lifted the order for involuntary medical treatment in respect of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discharged from the hospital . There is no information in the case file on the resumption of or any developments in the proceedings that had been stayed earlier ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . On DATE he was examined by ORG at his own request .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG issued its report . It noted that the only condition the applicant had been diagnosed with in the course of his previous forensic psychiatric examinations was a paranoid personality disorder . Such a diagnosis could not be regarded as fully grounded as it did not comply with the diagnostics criteria of the international statistical classification of illnesses . In particular , while that diagnosis implied a lack of social integration , the applicant had always been well adapted socially and had run a successful business . The wording \u201c delusional inclusions \u201d also raised questions as to its clinical accuracy . The applicant \u2019s excessive personal involvement in various situations , as well as the fact that he had been overly emotional and made peculiar statements , did not imply delusion .", "CARDINAL . Generally , it was concluded that there was nothing in the case file to show that the applicant had suffered from any serious psychiatric disorder rendering him unaccountable for his actions . Even if , presumably , the applicant \u2019s behaviour in the stressful situation of his criminal prosecution and detention had disclosed some peculiarities , the report concluded that , given his sufficient social adaptation prior to the criminal proceedings and the absence of a record of any psychiatric issues in the past , the applicant had not suffered from a psychiatric disorder DATE and DATE which would have warranted his involuntary treatment and prevented him from participating in court hearings .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG expert criticised the report of DATE as having reversed the earlier conclusion of CARDINAL DATE that the applicant had not been in need of involuntary psychiatric treatment without any persuasive grounds . This reversal had been made even though the description of the applicant \u2019s psychiatric condition had remained the same .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , an independent forensic psychiatric expert with DATE of work experience issued a report regarding the applicant \u2019s examinations of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . The expert considered only the first - mentioned report to be scientifically grounded . He criticised the other CARDINAL for their incompliance with the rules of diagnostics and the absence of any explanation as to why the same behaviour of the applicant , which had earlier been regarded as normal , had later been considered as disclosing a psychiatric disorder . The expert also concluded that the applicant \u2019s right to attend court hearings in person had been restricted without any valid medical reason ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c", "5-1-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
