The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed armed robbery . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question , the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fear that he might tamper with evidence . The court also observed that other measures designed to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings would be insufficient , given the fact that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had already been released under police supervision in another case . That , in the court 's opinion , convincingly showed that only detention could prevent him from committing another offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention . It reiterated the grounds originally given for his detention . Referring to the fact that more lenient preventive measures had not prevented the applicant from having committed another offence , the court considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would abscond . Furthermore , it considered that since the applicant had not admitted the charge and that there had been other persons involved in the offence who had remained at large , there was a reasonable risk of collusion .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , the applicant 's detention was several times prolonged by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) . The court reiterated the grounds originally given for his detention and stressed that keeping him in custody was necessary to secure the process of obtaining evidence . The relevant decisions were given on DATE ( prolonging the applicant 's detention until DATE ) and DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) . The applicant 's appeals against those decisions DATE in which he contested the reasonableness of the charge against him \u2013 were rejected by ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention DATE which had meanwhile exceeded DATE time - limit set for detention pending the investigation under LAW of LAW until DATE . It considered that the case was \u201c particularly complex \u201d within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged his detention until DATE . On DATE ORG ordered that that term should further be prolonged until DATE . The court reiterated the previous grounds given for the applicant 's detention and added that the case was very complex , given that CARDINAL further suspects had in the meantime been charged and detained in the case and that several other potential suspects were still being searched for .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , new charges were laid against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Further prolongation of the applicant 's detention pending the investigation were ordered by ORG on DATE ( up to DATE ) and on DATE ( up to CARDINAL DATE ) . In its decision of DATE , ORG relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the severity of anticipated penalty . It also considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and the other CARDINAL detained co - suspects , if released , might obstruct the proceedings or attempt to evade justice , having regard to the nature and the scale of the offences with which they had been charged ( numerous counts of armed robberies ) and the number of suspects involved . In its decision of DATE , ORG added that the prolongation of detention was justified by the need to obtain DNA evidence .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Gda\u0144sk Regional Prosecutor ( Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy ) indicted the applicant on CARDINAL charges comprising , among other things , numerous counts of armed robbery before ORG ( PERSON ) . The bill of indictment listed CARDINAL charges brought against CARDINAL accused , who were all remanded in custody . The case - file comprised CARDINAL volumes . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses . It appears that the principal witness was a certain ORG , who had been indicted together with all the defendants but gave evidence against them .", "CARDINAL . The trial began on DATE . However , as at DATE the reading out of the bill of indictment by the prosecution was still continuing .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention several times . The relevant decisions were given on DATE ( extending his detention up to DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging that period until DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( extending his detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending that term until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending that term until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) and on DATE ( extending that period until DATE ) . As at the latter date , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL accused were still detained on remand and the trial court had heard most of the prosecution witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In all those decisions ORG considered that the original grounds given for the applicant 's detention were still valid . It stressed that keeping him in custody was necessary in order to prevent him \u2013 and his co - defendants \u2013 from evading justice or tampering with evidence .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG found that holding the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants in custody was the only measure which would prevent them from obstructing the trial , having regard to the nature of the offences in question , the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that such attempts had been made in the course of the investigation . It also instructed the trial court to increase the number of hearings held DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG considered that the applicant 's detention was justified under LAW since that provision established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce him to obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG observed that up to DATE the main reason for the delays in the trial was the obstructiveness of the defendants and the abuse of the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court made a severance order with a view to expediting the proceedings , and thereafter CARDINAL defendants ( ORG , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , who in the meantime had been released from detention , were to be tried separately from other defendants .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeatedly , but unsuccessfully , asked for release and appealed against the decisions prolonging his detention . He maintained that the length of his detention was unreasonable and contested the charges against him , stressing that they were based on unreliable evidence from ORG", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant is still in detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE and from DATE to DATE ( i.e. for DATE , DATE and DATE ) the applicant served a sentence of imprisonment imposed in other criminal proceedings . He was , however , simultaneously remanded in custody in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , defines detention on remand as CARDINAL of the so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures . That provision reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and , exceptionally , also in order to prevent an accused 's committing another , serious offence ; they may be imposed only if the evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

NORP If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of DATE imprisonment , or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
