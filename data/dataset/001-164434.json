On DATE the applicant was convicted of shoplifting . ORG ( rechtbank ) imposed the measure of placement in a Persistent Offenders Institution ( inrichting voor stelselmatige daders ) for the duration of DATE on him . It took into account the statements of different police officers and probation officers who had had direct contact with the applicant . From these statements it appeared that the applicant was a drug addict who would not voluntarily cooperate with treatment plans . ORG further decided that the measure would be reviewed DATE from the date the judgment became final ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reviewed the measure and decided not to terminate it , because it was deemed that there was still a high risk of the applicant reoffending . The applicant appealed against this decision on DATE , but on DATE ORG ( gerechtshof ) dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the applicant \u2019s personal case officer , issued a progress report about the applicant , containing , amongst other things , the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is currently residing in ORG . The placement is progressing reasonably well . ( ... )", "If the measure should be terminated , [ the applicant ] will immediately find himself in a situation where he has no income , housing or DATE activities . The risk of reoffending is consequently high . To lower the risk of reoffending the measure should be continued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to prolong the measure further , holding that there was a considerable likelihood that the applicant would reoffend after his release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE counsel for the applicant made inquiries with ORG about the progress of the appeal and requested that its examination be given priority . Prior to the hearing before ORG , counsel for the applicant requested in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that , for the benefit of the applicant , an interpreter be present who spoke Aramaic or Assyrian , and he gave the name of an interpreter who spoke the correct language .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG . It appeared that the applicant was unable to understand the interpreter who spoke NORP . With the applicant \u2019s agreement , the case was adjourned for a maximum period of DATE to allow counsel for the applicant to put written questions to certain of the applicant \u2019s counsellors . It was also determined that case officer PERSON should be heard as an expert witness and that an interpreter speaking Aramaic should be present at the next hearing .", "CARDINAL . After DATE had elapsed , counsel for the applicant inquired with ORG into the progress of the proceedings on DATE and again on DATE . The proceedings were resumed on CARDINAL DATE , when a hearing took place . On that occasion case officer PERSON declared the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is no longer addicted to substances . The risk of reoffending is maximally reduced at this moment . The parole board has made several attempts to include [ the applicant ] in a treatment plan , but unfortunately this has not been sufficiently achieved . The clinical features of [ the applicant ] play an important role in this , but PERSON [ the institution ] could have signalled earlier that there were no further possibilities to treat [ the applicant ] . The measure has contributed to the protection of society since [ the applicant ] is no longer addicted , thus reducing the risk of him reoffending . [ The applicant ] is now residing in a halfway house and has been placed on the waiting list for sheltered accommodation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It would appear that sheltered accommodation became available for the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its decision , holding , amongst other things , the following :", "\u201c No violation of LAW", "ORG considers that in the present case it can not be said that the appeal was dealt with speedily within the meaning of LAW . It took DATE after the appeal was lodged before it was dealt with on the merits . Unlike counsel [ for the applicant ] , the court is of the opinion that the decision to accept that a violation of the LAW has occurred in itself constitutes sufficient satisfaction for the outrage to his sense of justice .", "Termination", "ORG has held that the execution of the measure has not been sufficiently expeditious in all stages . ORG deems that the difficult progress of the measure can not only be attributed to [ the applicant ] and finds that ORG could have signalled the difficult progress of the measure earlier .", "Having regard to the fact that [ the applicant ] currently has accommodation where he can stay as well as a prospect of placement in appropriate sheltered accommodation where he can also stay if the measure is terminated , and the fact that partly due to this the risk that the termination of the measure will lead to endangerment , nuisance and degradation of society is small , ORG considers that continuation of the measure is no longer necessary . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
