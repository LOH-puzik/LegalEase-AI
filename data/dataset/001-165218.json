NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and according to the most recent information available to the ORG is currently detained at FAC in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a law firm based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant secured CARDINAL contracts to supply vehicles to ORG , then under the rule of FAC . He was paid MONEY ( \u201c USD \u201d ) for the first contract and MONEY for the second . He paid all sums into CARDINAL accounts in ORG in GPE ( \u201c BOIJ \u201d ) . He subsequently paid MONEY to accounts in GPE and elsewhere connected with LOC and Colonel PERSON , a close collaborator of FAC .", "CARDINAL . Following General PERSON \u2019s death in DATE , a ORG was set up in GPE to investigate the use of Government monies during General PERSON \u2019s regime . The Panel was chaired by the Deputy Commissioner of ORG , Mr PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant converted the balance of the CARDINAL ORG accounts into CARDINAL ORG drafts totalling almost ORG CARDINAL million . On DATE he couriered the ORG drafts to GPE . The ORG drafts were subsequently returned to GPE and , on DATE , the applicant deposited them into CARDINAL accounts at the BOIJ .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the GPE police commenced a criminal investigation into money laundering in respect of the applicant . On DATE the Attorney General of GPE sent a letter of request to ORG asking for assistance with the money laundering investigation . The NORP authorities instructed PERSON to gather relevant evidence . Mr PERSON and Colonel PERSON , a retired army officer who had worked closely with General PERSON , made witness statements to a GPE police officer in GPE and GPE . PERSON also gathered various business documents which he provided to the GPE authorities . The Attorney General of GPE provided an undertaking that ORG would use its best endeavours to ensure that the necessary witnesses travelled to GPE to give evidence at any future criminal trial against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained declarations from ORG ( \u201c the NORP judgment \u201d ) that ORG was unconstitutional and that all investigatory actions undertaken by it in respect of the applicant were \u201c null and void , and lacking any valid or legal effect whatsoever \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of converting the proceeds of criminal conduct and CARDINAL count of removing the proceeds of criminal conduct from the jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Following delivery of the NORP judgment , the applicant made CARDINAL applications to the court .", "CARDINAL . In the first , he sought a stay on proceedings on grounds of abuse of process . He contended that the use of the business documents by the Attorney General of GPE was an abuse of power because the NORP court had ruled that they had been unlawfully obtained and because they had been obtained for an \u201c investigation \u201d only , so that there had been no consent to their use at trial . On DATE the ORG delivered its ruling on this application , declining to stay proceedings . It held that there was no evidence of an abuse of power and that since the purpose of an investigation into a criminal offence was to prosecute that offence , there would be little point in providing the information for the former but not the latter . The court noted that the defence conceded that the admission of the relevant NORP evidence did not prejudice the fairness of the applicant \u2019s trial . The judge said :", "\u201c DATE ... [ I]t follows that I would not exercise my discretion under LAW of [ the DATE Law ] to exclude it on the grounds set out in this application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his second application , the applicant relied on LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which allowed the court to exclude admissible evidence \u201c in the interests of justice \u201d . He argued that since the case was focused on alleged corruption at the highest level of government in GPE at the relevant time , it should not be assumed that the business documents were reliable . On DATE ORG allowed the admission of the business documents . It noted that there was nothing on the face of the documents to indicate that they were not authentic . While it was true that the applicant could not controvert the documents , it was necessary to balance the competing interests . There were a substantial number of documents that the applicant was in a position to controvert and he was also able to give evidence as to the nature of his involvement with LOC and Colonel PERSON . It was in the interests of justice that the business documents be admitted .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution subsequently applied under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to read the witness statements by PERSON PERSON and Colonel PERSON The defence argued that further steps should be taken by the prosecution before the judge could conclude that it was \u201c not reasonably practicable \u201d , in terms of LAW , to secure the attendance of the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held that the witness statements were admissible . It was satisfied \u201c to the criminal standard \u201d that it was not practicable to secure the attendance of the witnesses . It further rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the admission of the statements would breach his rights under LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW . The court recognised the conflict between the approach of the LANGUAGE courts , as outlined in NORP v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] ORG , with the approach of a Chamber of this Court in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and ORG , DATE . It concluded that the \u201c sole and decisive \u201d test had no application in GPE . There was nothing inherently unreliable on the face of the statements and it would be in the interests of justice to admit them .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile the Attorney General of GPE wrote to the Attorney General of GPE requesting that NORP witnesses attend in GPE to give their evidence . The Attorney General of GPE replied that , following the NORP judgment , he was unable to accede to the request for NORP witnesses to testify at the trial in GPE \u201c as the crux of the matter is centred on the national interest and I have a constitutional duty to protect the judicial integrity of ORG \u201d . He asked for the business documents to be returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have the NORP evidence excluded and his prosecution stayed on grounds of breach of international law and comity , based on developments since DATE ruling of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , with reasons delivered on DATE , ORG refused the applications . It noted that the defence did not contend that the admission of the NORP evidence would adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings and that the application to exclude was not therefore brought under LAW DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) but was brought instead under the court \u2019s inherent jurisdiction to exclude evidence as a matter of comity . The court considered that the only conduct being impugned by the defence was the decision of the Attorney General to lead admissible evidence at trial . The only remedy available to a defendant whose complaint was based solely on the merits of the decision to lead admissible evidence was the exclusion of the evidence under LAW of the DATE Law .", "CARDINAL . The trial subsequently commenced in ORG before the Commissioner and CARDINAL jurats ( professional judges of fact ) . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of money laundering . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal against his conviction and sentence . He raised CARDINAL grounds of appeal , dated DATE . Ground CARDINAL , which it was stated was intended to be taken together and supplemented by matters addressed in grounds CARDINAL to CARDINAL , related to the admission into evidence of \u201c the whole of part of the NORP evidence \u201d , namely , the business documents and the witness statements . The grounds explained that the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal in relation to the NORP evidence under grounds CARDINAL proceeded on the premise that it was open to him to challenge the admissibility of evidence either by an application for a stay on the basis of abuse or an application for the court to exercise its statutory discretion under LAW DATE PERSON to exclude the evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s challenge in ground CARDINAL was to the decision of the trial judge of CARDINAL DATE not to stay proceedings as an abuse of process ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Ground CARDINAL was also a challenge to the decision of CARDINAL DATE , this time on the basis that the use of the business documents at trial breached the applicable law on mutual legal assistance because they had been used for a purpose other than that for which they had been provided . Ground CARDINAL was a challenge to the decision of DATE to admit the witness statements ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It explained that their admission had resulted in unfairness in that the applicant had been denied the opportunity to test and controvert that evidence in circumstances where it was the sole and decisive evidence relied on by the prosecution to prove a part of its case . The ground referred to the trial judge \u2019s finding that the \u201c sole or decisive \u201d test had no application in GPE \u2019s law and that the admission of the statements would not breach Articles QUANTITY ( d ) . Ground CARDINAL concerned the judgment of DATE to refuse to exclude the NORP evidence on grounds of breach of international law and comity and the refusal to stay proceedings on that basis ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Ground CARDINAL concerned the admission of a statement made by the applicant which he does not challenge in the present application .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently prepared a written skeleton argument dated DATE , which ran to CARDINAL paragraphs , and a bundle of authorities placing before the court CARDINAL case - law authorities . In his skeleton argument , he explained that in grounds CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , he contended that the exercise by the trial judge of his discretion to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process was flawed ; that the judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion to exclude evidence under his inherent jurisdiction to uphold comity and international law ; that the judge had erred in not excluding the evidence under the \u201c overlapping jurisdiction between stay for abuse of process and LAW the DATE PERSON ; and that the judge had erred in admitting the NORP evidence when it had been obtained for a different purpose . He contended that his challenge to the prosecution application in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had included an argument that , if it failed to grant a stay , the court should exclude the evidence under LAW DATE PERSON , but that this argument had not been addressed by the trial judge . He further elaborated on his LAW submission , referring to authority on the exclusion of unlawfully - obtained evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In further developing ground CARDINAL in his skeleton argument , the applicant challenged the trial judge \u2019s decision that the admission of the witness statements was not unfair . He relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He criticised a number of determinations by the trial judge , including that the prosecution had done all that it practically could to ensure the attendance of the witnesses , that the inability to controvert the evidence of PERSON gave rise to only a minimal risk of unfairness , that there was no unfairness in admitting Colonel PERSON \u2019s statement and that the applicant \u2019s actions in seeking the NORP judgment were the direct cause of the non - attendance of the witnesses and should be taken into account . He referred to the LANGUAGE law equivalent of LAW as well as relevant LANGUAGE authorities as to the interpretation of the provision . He made no reference in his skeleton argument to LAW or to relevant case - law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its skeleton argument in response , the prosecution said :", "\u201c The ORG assumes that the Appellant has abandoned its challenge to the learned [ trial judge \u2019s ] conclusion that the \u2018 sole or ORG test has no application in GPE ... This challenge is not mentioned in the Appellant \u2019s skeleton argument . It would also require the court to come to a different conclusion to ORG in NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the subsequent hearing , the applicant \u2019s counsel argued , in respect of grounds CARDINAL of the grounds of appeal , that the use of the evidence was an abuse of executive power because the Attorney General knew that it had been obtained unlawfully , the NORP authorities did not consent to its use and the NORP authorities had asked for the return of the evidence . There had also been a breach of NORP sovereignty , international law and comity for these reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was refused by ORG . The court considered whether unlawfully obtained evidence could be fairly admitted and concluded that it could . It noted that \u201c additional grounds relied on in the skeleton argument were not developed in oral argument ... We list them only for completeness and deal with them briefly \u201d . It then addressed the witness statement argument in Ground CARDINAL as follows :", "\u201c ORG . It was contended that the evidence of Commissioner [ PERSON ] and Colonel [ B. ] should have been excluded as hearsay when it was reasonably practicable to have secured their attendance , and its admission was unfair to Mr PERSON who , accordingly , could not cross - examine them . We note that Mr PERSON objected to the Commissioner \u2019s decision that he had been responsible for the absence of the CARDINAL witnesses in GPE by instructing the claim for declarations before ORG : and Advocate PERSON sought to explain the dilemma in which his client was placed by the possibility of prosecutions in CARDINAL jurisdictions .", "In our view the attribution of responsibility was a finding of fact open to the Commissioner , and the admission of hearsay evidence was a matter for his discretion which there is no basis to impugn . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Leading NORP counsel provided advice on appeal in writing on DATE . While the advice referred to the invitation to counsel to consider whether there were arguable grounds for leave to appeal sentence , the advice also appeared to address grounds for appeal against conviction . Counsel referred to various \u201c significant and unusual \u201d features of the case , but noted that these did \u201c not necessarily found compelling matters of law of general public importance \u201d , which , counsel said , was the test applied by ORG for granting leave .", "CARDINAL . As regards grounds of appeal CARDINAL to CARDINAL , counsel referred to the submission to ORG that use of the unlawfully - obtained evidence without the consent of ORG was an abuse of executive power and a breach of NORP sovereignty , international law and comity . He discussed at some length the position as regards use of unlawfully - obtained evidence . As to the specific comments on Ground CARDINAL , counsel said :", "\u201c I am unimpressed by the observations at paragraph ORG of the judgment that the failure of witnesses to attend was the \u2018 responsibility\u2019 of Mr PERSON . This implies that he was at fault in circumstances where he merely sought a declaration from ORG upon the lawfulness of what had occurred . There was a basis for impugning the exercise of the Commissioner \u2019s discretion but I do not consider that ORG [ of ORG ] will find this an argument involving matters of law of general public importance . In any event , the evidence given by Commission [ PERSON ] and others which was read was not determinative of guilt . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Counsel concluded his advice by emphasising the difference between advising on the merits of an appeal to ORG and seeking the special leave of the judicial committee of ORG . He explained :", "\u201c In the latter case it is necessary to identify a point or points of law of general public importance , in the former there is I understand an appeal as of right on matters of law . I would be failing in my responsibility if I encouraged hopes of success when my view was that no such hopes exist . Considering the case objectively as an outsider who was not involved in the trial or first - tier appeal process I am able to stand back and consider the grounds of appeal dispassionately and I have no hesitation in concluding that there is no prospect of leave being granted in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE Law deals with the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings . LAW provides , inter alia , that a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings if the person who made the statement is outside of GPE and it is not \u201c reasonably practicable \u201d to secure his attendance . DATE allows documents to be admitted provided that certain conditions are satisfied .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ) provides that if a court is of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of Article CARDINAL or Article CARDINAL ought not to be admitted , it may direct that the statement should not be admitted . Article CARDINAL ) provides that the court must have regard :", "\u201c ( a ) to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not , having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant , it is likely that the document is authentic ;", "( b ) to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available ;", "( c ) to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings ; and", "( d ) to any risk , having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings , that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL allows the court to exclude evidence if it appears to the court that , having regard to all the circumstances , including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained , the admission of the evidence would so adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it .", "CARDINAL . The Human Rights ( Jersey ) Law CARDINAL ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) incorporates the LAW into GPE law . Article CARDINAL provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account relevant case - law from this ORG . Article CARDINAL provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right . Under article CARDINAL , a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with Convention rights may rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and ORG v. Attorney General DATE ORG CARDINAL , ORG was asked to consider whether hearsay evidence at a criminal trial had been \u201c sole and decisive \u201d evidence against the appellant and had thus breached his right to a fair trial under LAW . On DATE it dismissed the appeal . It considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and PERSON and the subsequent judgment of PERSON in which ORG had declined to apply it ( both judgments cited above ) . ORG concluded that it was not necessary for it to decide , for the purposes of the case before it , whether PERSON should be followed . It therefore proceeded on the basis that the ORG judgment in PERSON and PERSON represented \u201c the law of this Island \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
