The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was driving his car along a road in the region of GPE on TIME DATE . As established subsequently by the prosecution and the domestic courts in criminal proceedings opened into the incident that took place that evening , his car was weaving in an unsteady manner and he was spotted by patrolling police officers parked on the side of the road . They signalled for him to pull over , but instead of complying he sped away . According to the applicant \u2019s own statements given in the context of those proceedings , he was afraid that the police would charge him or take his licence away as he had consumed alcohol TIME . The prosecution and the courts established that the officers chased after him in their car , using flashing police lights and their siren . He only stopped when his car reached a field and could not go further . The police car stopped too .", "CARDINAL . The parties have presented differing accounts of the circumstances in which the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , CARDINAL of the officers kicked him in the left leg and then pushed him violently to the ground as he was trying to get out of his vehicle . The applicant fell on his back and then CARDINAL officers continued to kick him . The assault lasted TIME , after which they handcuffed him . CARDINAL of the officers hit him on the head with a rubber truncheon before they drove him to the police station .", "CARDINAL . According to the police officers , the applicant had jumped out of his car after it had come to a halt and had started running through the field in an attempt to escape . The officers had run after him , the applicant had slipped and fallen and the police had caught up with him . As he had resisted arrest , wriggling and struggling , they had used force which had consisted in twisting his arms in order to handcuff him . Once they had managed to handcuff him , the officers had driven him to the police station .", "CARDINAL . According to written statements made during the criminal proceedings by several police officers present at the police station when the applicant was taken there , he told everyone present at the time that his clothes were muddy because he had tripped and fallen , which was also why he had a limp . As stated by the officers and by the applicant himself in the course of those proceedings , he made no complaints at that point in time . According to police records of the evening when the applicant was arrested , he refused to take an alcohol test or to sign the arrest report and was given a fine for refusing the alcohol test . As it emerges from the ORG statements , they discovered that he had no identity documents on him and called his brother , who brought them to the police station accompanied by a friend . The records indicate that the officers released the applicant immediately after checking his papers .", "CARDINAL . According to a written statement made on DATE by the applicant \u2019s brother to the police in the context of an official follow - up conducted into the events , on leaving the station , he asked him what had happened but the applicant stated that he did not wish to speak about it and preferred to be left alone in his home . Instead , his brother drove him to the local medical centre as he had noticed that the applicant was having difficulties breathing . On examination , a doctor noted a suspected broken left ankle and told the applicant to go to hospital . No ambulance was provided and the applicant \u2019s brother drove him there . It follows from medical documents that the doctors operated on him immediately as they had established that he had a broken rib which had pierced CARDINAL of his lungs .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s hospital record , signed by the doctor who had treated him and the head of the unit , stated that the applicant had been in hospital CARDINAL and DATE and that he had a broken rib and a broken ankle . Upon his discharge on DATE , a different doctor examined the applicant and issued him with a medical certificate which recorded that he had a broken rib , a bruise of about QUANTITY on his right eyebrow , and a fracture of the fibula close to the ankle that was in a cast . It also contained the phrase that it was not excluded that the injuries had been sustained in the manner suggested by the applicant , namely as a result of being hit or kicked . The certificate stated that no other traumatic injuries were present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police officer in charge of radio communications between patrolling officers and who was on duty on the night of the incident produced a written report to provide information for his superior and to receive whatever orders were deemed necessary . As well as repeating the account of the CARDINAL arresting officers , he stated that he personally had seen the applicant at the station and that the applicant had told him that he had fallen while running and that his back was hurting . The officer had offered to call in medical staff from the local medical centre to check the applicant on the spot , but he had refused , saying that he did not need a doctor and wished to be released instead .", "CARDINAL . A different police officer was sent to the local medical centre . In a written report he drew up on DATE on his visit , he confirmed the existence of a record there that the applicant had visited it the previous evening and had been checked by a doctor who had directed him to the hospital for treatment of a suspected fractured ankle . Another officer visited the hospital DATE . In a written report he listed his findings , namely that the applicant had been admitted and treated for a broken rib and broken leg TIME . The report indicated that in a conversation with the applicant conducted during that visit , the latter had told the officer that he could not remember the events in detail , but that he was certain that after the car chase CARDINAL police officers had beaten and then handcuffed him before taking him to the police station . The applicant also gave a handwritten statement to an officer DATE . In it he referred to the car chase , stated that he had wanted to escape as he had felt drunk , that when he had got out of his car the policemen had grabbed him , that CARDINAL of them had pulled him to the ground and that the other one had handcuffed him . He concluded by saying that the injuries had most likely been caused during his arrest , given that immediately beforehand he had only been driving his car and did not remember breaking his leg and rib when he had brought the car to a stop .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s brother also gave a written statement to the police ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY police officers involved in the car chase and the arrest also gave written statements on DATE . In addition to the description above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , the officers stated that once the applicant had been handcuffed and put inside the police car , he had leaned on CARDINAL of them and moaned . When asked if he had a problem and wished to be taken to a medical centre , he had refused and said , \u201c It \u2019s nothing \u201d . At the police station the applicant had refused to be tested for alcohol or to sign the arrest report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting on his own initiative , opened criminal proceedings in relation to the conduct of the CARDINAL officers who had arrested the applicant . The order for the opening of those proceedings indicated that it was \u201c against the guilty official from ORG who , acting in the context of his professional functions , had caused bodily harm to the applicant on DATE in GPE \u201d . A number of investigative steps were carried out . The investigating authorities questioned several police officers as witnesses , including the CARDINAL involved in the applicant \u2019s arrest and those who had been at the police station on TIME of the incident . The latter all stated that they had seen the applicant at the police station on TIME in question . He had been calm , had smelt of alcohol and been visibly intoxicated , his clothes had been muddy and he had limped . The applicant , his brother and the friend of the brother who had accompanied him to collect the applicant from the police station , were also interviewed . The brother and his friend stated that the applicant had not told them anything about the circumstances of his arrest and that the brother had learned that the applicant had been beaten by the police from the doctors at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . A forensic medical expert was appointed on CARDINAL DATE to establish the nature of the injuries sustained by the applicant and the type of instrument used . The expert was given a list of specific questions that needed to be answered . The forensic medical report , containing a comprehensive and independent assessment , concluded that the CARDINAL injuries recorded in the medical certificates drawn up in the immediate aftermath of the events ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were incompatible with the applicant \u2019s allegations that the officers had hit him all over his body for TIME . In particular , being kicked by someone wearing boots or being hit for TIME would have left the applicant with many more traces on different parts of his body , not just the CARDINAL strictly localised injuries mentioned above . The report further indicated that the injuries could have been received as a result of falling over while moving in accelerated fashion , for example by running and falling .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of DATE for terminating the criminal proceedings , the prosecution established that the version of events given by the applicant at different stages of his questioning were not consistent . In particular , he had stated initially that he had sprained his ankle after tripping and falling , but had later changed his story and said that the injury had been the result of an intentional and prolonged beating by police officers . Furthermore , when questioned on DATE , the applicant had stated that the police officers had started hitting and kicking him after he had left his car voluntarily . When interviewed again on CARDINAL DATE , he had asserted that the officers had brutally pulled him out of the car and had thereafter only kicked him rather than hit him . He had tried to use his arms to protect his head from the kicks . He had stated that he could not remember or recognise the police officers who had beaten him , whether in a personal confrontation or from pictures . He had also complained that CARDINAL officers had beaten him , while it had been unequivocally established that there had only been CARDINAL patrolling officers . In addition , when on DATE the investigator had handed the investigation file over to the applicant , he had signed the related acknowledgement , indicating that he did not wish to acquaint himself with the evidence , read the documents in the file , which was voluminous , and that he had no requests , comments or objections to the investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor concluded in the decree for termination of the proceedings that the applicant \u2019s complaints were not supported by the evidence . The force used by the officers had been necessary for neutralising and detaining him in the circumstances , given that he had effectively been running away from the police and actively disobeying their orders to stop . The force had involved CARDINAL officer holding the applicant on the ground , using CARDINAL knee to press on his body , while the second officer had helped by handcuffing him . There was no evidence pointing to the officers having used violence or undue force when apprehending the applicant . The applicant challenged the prosecutor \u2019s decision in court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor \u2019s decision to terminate the proceedings was confirmed at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . In particular , the first - instance court , ORG , observed in its decision of DATE that CARDINAL officers had arrested the applicant after a long car chase , when he had tried to escape despite clear orders to the contrary . The officers had worn police uniforms that had been clearly visible and identifiable and had been driving a police car with flashing police lights and a siren while chasing the applicant . He had not only refused to stop but had actively avoided being caught . As to the differing versions of the events thereafter , the court found that the applicant \u2019s submissions were inconsistent and not supported by the evidence . As a consequence , the court gave no weight to his testimony , finding that it was incompatible with the rest of the evidence .", "CARDINAL . The second - instance court , ORG , upheld those findings in a final decision on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
