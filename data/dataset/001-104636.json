In the same memo , ORG explained to the Minister that on DATE a regional manager from his department had informed him that a Mercedes ML that had been seized as evidence in a criminal case was being taken to LOC . ORG had taken an interest in the vehicle and , on learning that it was a silver Mercedes ML , had decided to question a number of ORG employees about it . He had thus been able to establish that on DATE around TIME the car had left the courtyard of the Ministry with G.A .- ia and CARDINAL other ORG staff members , A.A.uri and GPE .- ava , on board . After seeking the necessary information from the mobile phone operator , ORG had been able to reconstitute G.A.ia \u2019s movements and to conclude that on the night concerned he had been in the vicinity of the cemetery at PERSON and had spoken on the phone with M.B.dze , another ORG employee .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in the same written memo , ORG informed the Minister that he had asked LAW if he had been present at the scene of the crime on the night in question . G.A .- ia , strangely unsettled , had denied being there .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , all this seemed to indicate that G.A.ia , A.A.uri , GPE .- ava and GPE .- dze might have had a hand in committing the crime in question . He asked the Minister to decide what course of action should be taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG cancelled the decision granting the first applicant civil party status on the ground that only the direct victim of the crime , that is , the son , was entitled to civil party status . As the direct victim in this case was dead , the only standing one of his parents could claim was as his heir .", "CARDINAL .

L.B .- dze identified GPE .- ava , a subordinate of GPE .- ia \u2019s , as \u201c possibly being \u201d the driver of the Mercedes ML , but he could not be certain .", "CARDINAL . L.B .- dze also said that ORG .- uri , another of G.A .- ia \u2019s subordinates , \u201c was probably \u201d the man who had sat next to PERSON in the car .

Finally , when faced with CARDINAL unknown persons among whom M.B.dze , the second Deputy Director of Constitutional Security at ORG , had been placed , L.B .- dze said that the man next to GPE .- dze could be one of the perpetrators of the crime , but he was not PERCENT sure . The man \u2019s face and stature resembled the man who had beaten ORG , who was the one with whom he had had the least contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE .- ia , GPE .- ava and A.A .- uri , but also M.B.dze , were arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE L.B .- dze was questioned as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . According to the video recording of the interview , the investigator asked L.B .- dze if he wished to be assisted by a lawyer . L.B .- dze said he did not . He then confirmed his previous statements , adding that PERSON had made a phone call to someone from the taxi before suggesting that they stop by ORG . When they entered the caf\u00e9 , L.B .- dze had gone to the toilet and then joined PERSON at a table . By the time ORG . M .- dze had joined them at their table , music was playing . ORG . M .- dze and the ORG son had been sitting quite close to one another , so it had been impossible for him to hear what they were talking about . Anyway , a friend had come to sit and talk to L.B .- dze for CARDINAL to TIME . This last sentence does not appear in the record of the interview included in the case file . According to L.B .- dze , ORG . M .- dze and PERSON had not had an argument , but the discussion between them had been tense .", "CARDINAL . L.B .- dze added that he himself had not had any argument with anyone in the caf\u00e9 . He could not say for sure whether PERSON had , as he had left him to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . L.B .- dze explained that when they had left the caf\u00e9 , he and PERSON had not crossed the room together , but they had gone out into the street together . That statement does not appear in the record of the interview in the case file . However , the video recording shows that when L.B.dze said that , the investigator suggested including the following wording in the record , which he dictated himself : \u201c I can not remember if PERSON and I went out through the caf\u00e9 door together . ( ... ) it is possible that I was a little way behind him . \u201d L.B .- dze then added himself that if he remembered rightly , before leaving the caf\u00e9 he had gone to the toilet again . The investigator told him to note it down in the record .", "CARDINAL . In answer to the investigator \u2019s question whether anyone could have followed them as they left the caf\u00e9 , L.B .- dze said he did not think so .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the investigator asked L.B .- dze if he thought the assailants had intended to kill him with ORG . L.B .- dze thought they probably had not , considering that they had just abandoned him there , still alive , instead of killing him .", "DATE . Still on DATE , L.B .- dze was questioned again , with no lawyer present , about the fourth person who had arrived on the scene later .", "CARDINAL . L.B .- dze said he could not rule out the possibility that the person concerned had not come alone . It was this man who had fired the shot in the air . In answer to a question from the investigator , L.B .- dze replied that he had indeed been invited by an MP into his office in the ORG to look at a photograph and say whether he recognised the man in it . L.B .- dze had said that he could not be sure , but he thought the man in the photo \u201c looked just like \u201d the fourth man , who had joined them at the cemetery later . The MP had recorded the procedure , with L.B .- dze \u2019s consent , and as the man in the photo was GPE .- ov , the recording had been made public . To the investigator , L.B .- dze said that the man in the photograph resembled the \u201c fourth man \u201d , but that he could be mistaken .", "CARDINAL . When questioned on DATE , G.A .- ia said that he had been at work late on DATE in the evening . Before going home , he had decided to stop by ORG , with LAW , to wish PERSON a happy birthday . He had been invited , he explained . To get there , he had taken a Mercedes ML that was parked in FAC , having been impounded as evidence in a criminal case . G.A .- ia explained that he had given PERSON .- uri number plates with the number ORG to put on the car .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL men had stopped the car in LOC street near the caf\u00e9 . Only G.A .- ia had got out of the car . At the entrance to the caf\u00e9 , he found someone he did not know ( PERSON ) insulting G.D .- dze \u2019s mother . On hearing this , PERSON .- ia asked what the problem was . In response , Mr PERSON insulted him too and walked away . PERSON .- ia decided to follow him \u201c to find out why he was hurling insults \u201d . He returned to the car and asked A.A .- uri , who was at the wheel , to follow the CARDINAL men . He also asked his CARDINAL colleagues if they had their pistols on them , as he thought they might need to make an arrest . When they replied that they were not armed , G.A .- ia called GPE .- dze on the phone and asked him to come and help them and to bring his gun .", "CARDINAL . A.A .- uri pulled up alongside PERSON and PERSON , and G.A .- ia got out of the car and asked the CARDINAL men to show their identity documents . Mr PERSON asked him in a very disparaging tone who he was . G.A .- ia said they were from ORG and asked him for his papers again . PERSON and PERSON insulted him again . The discussion grew more heated and A.A .- uri got out of the car and told them to calm down . PERSON pushed him and A.A - uri fell over . According to LAW , PERSON and PERSON told the other men that they could go anywhere they liked and sort things out . They all decided to get in the car and go somewhere else . They drove twice round the main square in GPE , while G.A .- ia tried to understand why PERSON had been insulting G.D .- dze . Then they stopped the car and told PERSON and his friend to get out , but they refused , saying that was no place to talk and they should go elsewhere . So they had gone to PERSON , and stopped the car near the cemetery . Then they had all got out and started fighting . It was TIME and there was fairly good visibility .", "CARDINAL . M.B .- dze had soon come along to assist his colleagues . He had dealt mainly with PERSON . When PERSON had escaped , PERSON .- ia had told ORG .- dze not to bother following him . The scuffle had lasted TIME and it must have been TIME when they left PERSON .", "CARDINAL . G.A .- ia also maintained that on the way back from PERSON he had received phone calls from ORG and ORG .- dze asking him if he was coming to PERSON birthday party ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . When questioned on DATE , ORG .- dze maintained that after receiving a call for help from his superior , G.A .- ia , around TIME , he had taken his weapon and gone to ORG to pick up an official car , thinking that it would be necessary to arrest someone . When he reached PERSON street he realised his colleagues had gone , so he called LAW , who told him they were on their way to PERSON . When he drove there he spotted the Mercedes ML \u201c which he thought his colleagues were using \u201d . He headed towards the cemetery , where the noise was coming from . He found PERSON lying on the ground and L.B .- dze putting up a fight . His colleagues were accordingly concentrating their efforts on L.B.dze . PERSON had got up again , however , and attacked him . They had started to wrestle . PERSON clothes were ripped in the struggle . At CARDINAL point GPE .- dze thought he saw a knife in PERSON hand . He took his gun out and fired into the air . That was when PERSON had taken the opportunity to run away . The struggle had lasted no longer than TIME .", "DATE . M.B .- dze stated that neither he nor his colleagues had used any sharp weapons , and that he could only assume that , after escaping , PERSON must have injured himself on the wire fencing round the tombs or in the bramble bushes .", "CARDINAL . When questioned on DATE , GPE .- ava confirmed GPE .- ia \u2019s account of events . He also said that he and his colleagues had identified themselves to PERSON and PERSON .- dze as employees of ORG . He said that PERSON and PERSON had got into the car of their own free will . GPE .- ava confirmed , like GPE .- dze , that it had been a clear night and that none of his colleagues had been carrying a knife or any other sharp object .", "CARDINAL . When questioned on DATE , ORG .- uri gave exactly the same account as LAW , GPE .- ava and GPE .- dze . As to the origins of PERSON wounds , A.A .- uri made the same suppositions as ORG .- dze .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor from ORG placed GPE .- ia , GPE .- ava , A.A .- uri and ORG .- dze under investigation for wilful bodily harm resulting in death ( LAW ) and premeditated false imprisonment by a group of persons with life - threatening violence ( LAW ( a ) , ( c ) and ( h ) of LAW ) . On DATE they were remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE L.B .- dze , with no lawyer present , was called to identify the \u201c fourth man \u201d , who had arrived last at the cemetery . According to the video recording of this investigative measure , among the CARDINAL men in the line - up to be presented to L.B .- dze , GPE .- ov took the third position from the left . The public prosecutor then invited L.B .- dze into the room and asked him to look carefully at the CARDINAL men . L.B .- dze hesitated before saying : \u201c I ca n\u2019t be PERCENT sure ... the man must have been bigger , but I do n\u2019t know ... , I do n\u2019t recognise , let \u2019s say , going by the face ... , I could say it was the second man from the left , or the third from the left . \u201d The public prosecutor replied : \u201c So you do not recognise any of these QUANTITY people for sure . \u201d L.B .- dze explained that he did not \u201c recognise anyone for sure , but the CARDINAL men he had picked out looked like the assailant who had arrived last at the cemetery \u201d . The public prosecutor then invited him to write the report , including sentences he dictated to him : \u201c Among the CARDINAL individuals presented to me , I am unable to identify anyone as the individual who on DATE committed the unlawful acts against me and against PERSON \u201d . The public prosecutor then asked PERSON to start a new paragraph , and L.B .- dze complied . The doubts and resemblances noted by L.B .- dze are not mentioned in the record of the proceedings , which also contains another error : according to the record , GPE .- ov was in the third position from the right , not from the left as seen in the video recording .", "CARDINAL .
