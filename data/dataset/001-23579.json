They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants , who are brothers , run an international diamond business , which involved , inter alia , importing diamonds to the family business in GPE , GPE . They state that in DATE the family business took the decision not to import diamonds from NORP countries which were undergoing civil war or political instability .", "By resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) of DATE , ORG imposed an embargo on the export of diamonds by ORG due to that organisation 's role in the continuing war in GPE . In paragraph CARDINAL , it requested GPE to take measures against persons or bodies which violated the sanctions and to impose appropriate penalties . On DATE , ORG formally adopted sanctions , binding on its member states . By DATE , GPE and GPE had adopted legislation to give effect to resolution DATE . The legislation as amended in GPE prohibited the importation into GPE of diamonds from GPE unless certified by ORG .", "On DATE , in answer to a parliamentary question , Mr PERSON , the Minister of State at ORG responsible for LOC , gave a written response stating inter alia ;", "\u201c We fully support ORG sanctions against ORG ... We have also called for stricter enforcement of sanctions by all ORG member states . ... The GPE fully implements ORG sanctions decided upon by ORG Information concerning potential breaches of sanctions by GPE nationals or companies is passed immediately to the appropriate GPE enforcement authorities . \u201d", "On DATE , in answer to further questions about Government measures to enforce ORG sanctions , PERSON stated :", "\u201c It is vital that private individuals and companies engaged in breaking the law by deliberately breaching the ORG sanctions on ORG are stopped . I can inform the ORG that we are referring to the ORG sanctions committee and its expert panels the details of CARDINAL such individuals which we hope that they will be able to follow up ... \u201d", "On DATE , PERSON stated in the ORG :", "\u201c We are ready to name , shame and take action where we can on those who break sanctions . For example , we would take action in respect of the illegal provision of ORG with supplies , without which it could not keep on fighting in GPE . I have named in the ORG several people included in breaking ORG sanctions by supplying ORG and I shall now name more . PERSON is involved in exporting diamonds to GPE for ORG . Based in NORP , GPE , GPE paid a DATE fee to NORP officials to enable him to operate without interference . We estimate that in DATE PERSON was moving MONEY worth of diamonds per DATE . His brother , PERSON , is carrying out similar activity for ORG in GPE . PERSON , a NORP pilot , flies diamonds for PERSON from GPE , via GPE ... Those individuals are making money out of misery . It is vital that all the ORG , agencies and companies where they operate take urgent action to stop their illegal activities ... We have passed these names to the ORG and in particular to ambassador PERSON , for his work on ORG responsible for tackling ORG and GPE generally . \u201d", "This declaration was published in ORG and was available on the parliamentary website . The press reported on the matter , repeating the names of the persons included in the declaration \u2013 this included a report from ORG on CARDINAL DATE repeated by ORG , an article in the ORG on DATE and an article in the NORP newspaper ORG on DATE . PERSON declaration was repeated in ORG by the deputy minister for foreign affairs on DATE .", "The applicants stated that an investigation was opened into the allegations by the parquet in GPE in DATE . No proceedings have since ensued . The applicants provided a letter dated DATE from the GPE procureur stating that the investigation had been closed with a decision not to prosecute or issue charges . A letter ( undated but apparently sent in DATE ) from the NORP Foreign Minister to a NORP Member of ORG stated that the NORP secret service had provided information to the NORP secret service but that it had not been established on the basis of that information that PERSON was guilty of the acts that Mr PERSON had accused him of .", "By letter dated DATE , the first applicant wrote to Mr PERSON denying the facts imputed by the Minister and requesting a meeting with himself and his brother . On DATE , Mr PERSON replied that he stood by the statement which he had made , that the matter was in the hands of ORG and that he saw no need for a meeting .", "On DATE , the Panel of Experts assisting ORG stated in a report that it has received information from several sources that PERSON had been involved in importing diamonds to GPE for ORG and that similar allegations had been made publicly . It considered that further investigation was warranted and passed on the information to the Chairman of ORG .", "On DATE , following disclosure of the letter by the NORP Minister for ORG , the first applicant 's counsel wrote to Mr PERSON requesting that he retract his allegations publicly and meet with the first applicant on his visit to GPE in DATE , or alternatively , to waive the parliamentary privilege attaching to his statements in order to permit the first applicant to take proceedings in the courts . No response was received to this letter .", "In the report of ORG dated DATE , a detailed analysis of the status of the sanctions on diamond trading in the region was made . PERSON was named as the junior partner in the GPE firm of PERSON which had created ORG that had been the largest mining operation in the NORP valley before the imposition of sanctions . In the additional report dated DATE reporting on the enforcement of sanctions , no mention was made of either applicant .", "Since then the applicants have alleged that the stigma attaching to their reputation has led to other businesses refusing to trade with them e.g. providing CARDINAL letters referring to the appearance of the name of CARDINAL of the applicants in ORG documents concerning diamond smuggling .", "Words spoken by MPs in the course of debates in ORG are protected by absolute privilege . This is provided by LAW , which states :", "\u201c ... the freedome of speech and debates or proceedings in ORG ought not to be impeached or questioned in a court or place out of Parlyament . \u201d", "The effect of this privilege was described by Lord Chief Justice PERSON in the case of Ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) QB CARDINAL at CARDINAL :", "\u201c It is clear that statements made by Members of either ORG of ORG in their places in the ORG , though they might be untrue to their knowledge , could not be made the foundation of civil or criminal proceedings , however injurious they might be to the interest of a third party . \u201d", "Statements made by MPs outside ORG are subject to the ordinary laws of defamation and breach of confidence , save where they are protected by qualified privilege .", "The question whether or not qualified privilege applies to statements made in any given political context turns upon the public interest . In the case of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , which concerned allegations made in the NORP press about an NORP political crisis in DATE , Lord PERSON of GPE stated in ORG , at page CARDINAL :", "Depending on the circumstances , the matters to be taken into account include the following . The comments are illustrative only . CARDINAL . The seriousness of the allegation . The more serious the charge , the more the public is misinformed and the individual harmed , if the allegation is not true . CARDINAL . The nature of the information , and the extent to which the subject matter is a matter of public concern . CARDINAL . The source of the information . Some informants have no direct knowledge of the events . Some have their own axes to grind , or are being paid for their stories . CARDINAL . The steps taken to verify the information . CARDINAL . The status of the information . The allegations may have already been the subject of an investigation which commands respect . CARDINAL . The urgency of the matter . News is often a perishable commodity . CARDINAL . Whether comment was sought from the plaintiff . He may have information others do not possess or have not disclosed . An approach to the plaintiff will not always be necessary . CARDINAL . Whether the article contained the gist of the plaintiff 's side of the story . CARDINAL . The tone of the article . A newspaper can raise queries or call for an investigation . It need not adopt allegations as statements of fact . CARDINAL . The circumstances of the publication , including the timing . \u201d", "Press coverage , to the extent that it fairly and accurately reports parliamentary debates , is generally protected by a form of qualified privilege which is lost only if the publisher has acted \u201c maliciously \u201d . \u201c Malice \u201d , for this purpose , is established where the report concerned is published for improper motives or with \u201c reckless indifference \u201d to the truth . A failure to make proper enquiries is not sufficient in itself to establish malice , but it may be evidence from which malice ( in the sense of reckless indifference to the truth ) can reasonably be inferred .", "MPs can waive the absolute immunity which they enjoy in ORG as a result of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where the conduct of a person in or in relation to proceedings in ORG is in issue in defamation proceedings , he may waive for the purposes of those proceedings , so far as concerns him , the protection of any enactment or rule of law which prevents proceedings in ORG being impeached or questioned in any court or place out of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Where a person waives that protection \u2013", "( a ) any such enactment or rule of law shall not apply to prevent evidence being given , questions being asked or statements , submissions , comments or findings being made about his conduct , and", "( b ) none of those things shall be regarded as infringing the privilege of either ORG of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The waiver by CARDINAL person of that protection does not affect its operation in relation to another person who has not waived it .", "( CARDINAL ) Nothing in this section affects any enactment or rule of law so far as it protects a person ( including a person who has waived the protection referred to above ) from legal liability for words spoken or things done in the course of , or for the purposes of or incidental to , any proceedings in ORG . \u201d", "General control is exercised over debates by the Speaker of each ORG of ORG . Each ORG has its own mechanisms for disciplining Members who deliberately make false statements in the course of debates . Deliberately misleading statements may be punishable by ORG as a contempt . Alternatively , as the parliamentary ORG on Procedure ( DATE ) has observed :", "\u201c ... there already exists a wide range of avenues which can be pursued by an aggrieved person who wishes to correct or rebut remarks made about him in the ORG . He can approach his Member of ORG with a view to his tabling DATE , or an amendment where appropriate ; there may be cases which can be raised through Questions if some ministerial responsibility can be established ; he can petition the ORG , through a Member ; and he can approach directly the Member who made the allegations in the hope of persuading him that they are unfounded and that a retraction would be justified . We believe that in these circumstances , the ORG would not expect a rigid adherence to the convention that one Member does not take up a case brought by the constituent of another , particularly if the latter was the source of the statement complained of , and so long as the courtesies of proper notification were observed . \u201d", "A ORG of both ORG was set up in DATE and tasked with reviewing the law of parliamentary privilege . ORG received written and oral evidence from a wide variety of sources from within GPE and abroad and held CARDINAL sessions of evidence in public . Its report was published in DATE . LAW sets out its conclusions on parliamentary immunity :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The immunity is wide . Statements made in ORG may not even be used to support a cause of action arising out of ORG , as where a plaintiff suing a member for an alleged libel on television was not permitted to rely on statements made by the member in ORG as proof of malice . The immunity is also absolute : it is not excluded by the presence of malice or fraudulent purpose . Article CARDINAL protects the member who knows what he is saying is untrue as much as the member who acts honestly and responsibly . ... In more precise legal language , it protects a person from legal liability for words spoken or things done in the course of , or for the purposes of or incidental to , any proceedings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . A comparable principle exists in court proceedings . Statements made by a judge or advocate or witness in the course of court proceedings enjoy absolute privilege at common law against claims for defamation . The rationale in the CARDINAL cases is the same . The public interest in the freedom of speech in the proceedings , whether parliamentary or judicial , is of a high order . It is not to be imperilled by the prospect of subsequent inquiry into the state of mind of those who participate in the proceedings even though the price is that a person may be defamed unjustly and left without a remedy .", "CARDINAL . It follows that we do not agree with those who have suggested that members of ORG do not need any greater protection against civil actions than the qualified privilege enjoyed by members of elected bodies in local government . Unlike members of ORG , local councillors are liable in defamation if they speak maliciously . We consider it of utmost importance that there should be a national public forum where all manner of persons , irrespective of their power or wealth , can be criticised . Members should not be exposed to the risk of being brought before the courts to defend what they said in ORG . Abuse of parliamentary freedom of speech is a matter for internal self - regulation by ORG , not a matter for investigation and regulation by the courts . The legal immunity principle is as important DATE as ever . The courts have a duty not to erode this essential constitutional principle . \u201d", "LAW provides :", "\u201c a. ORG , representatives of members and the ORG shall enjoy in the territories of its members such privileges and immunities as are reasonably necessary for the fulfilment of their functions . These immunities shall include immunity for all representatives to ORG from arrest and all legal proceedings in the territories of all members , in respect of words spoken and votes cast in the debates of the ORG or its committees or commissions .", "b. The members undertake as soon as possible to enter into agreement for the purpose of fulfilling the provisions of paragraph a above . For this purpose ORG shall recommend to the governments of members the acceptance of an agreement defining the privileges and immunities to be granted in the territories of all members . In addition , a special agreement shall be concluded with ORG of GPE defining the privileges and immunities which the ORG shall enjoy at its seat . \u201d", "In pursuance of paragraph b above , the member GPE , on DATE , entered into LAW . This provides , as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c Representatives to ORG and their substitutes shall be immune from all official interrogation and from arrest and from all legal proceedings in respect of words spoken or votes cast by them in the exercise of their functions . \u201d", "\u201c During the sessions of ORG , ORG and their substitutes , whether they be members of ORG or not , shall enjoy :", "a. on their national territory , the immunities accorded in those countries to members of ORG ;", "b. on the territory of all other member GPE , exemption from arrest and prosecution . ... \u201d", "LAW to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe provides :", "\u201c Privileges , immunities and facilities are accorded to the representatives of members not for the personal benefit of the individuals concerned , but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with ORG . Consequently , a member has not only the right but the duty to waive the immunity of its representative in any case where , in the opinion of the member , the immunity would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded . \u201d", "LAW on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG , adopted in accordance with LAW establishing a ORG and a ORG of ORG , provides :", "\u201c Members of ORG shall not be subject to any form of inquiry , detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
