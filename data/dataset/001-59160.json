THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant came to the GPE on DATE where he married a NORP woman on DATE . Upon his request he was granted a residence permit by the head of the GPE police on DATE which enabled him to live with his spouse and to work in the GPE . This residence permit was valid for DATE and , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was given a document showing that as a result of his marriage he was allowed to reside in the GPE indefinitely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a son , PERSON , was born to the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife separated in DATE and divorce proceedings were initiated . As the applicant 's right to reside in the GPE indefinitely had been dependent on his being married and cohabiting with his spouse , he lost this right ex jure from the moment of separation . On DATE , the applicant applied for and was granted an independent residence permit in order to work in the GPE pursuant to the relevant provisions of LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ; see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . This permit was valid for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the period immediately following the separation the applicant made no attempt to see PERSON , but at a later stage he requested ORG ( ORG ) to establish an arrangement concerning parental access ( omgangsregeling \u2013 \u201c formal access arrangement \u201d ) . ORG requested ORG ( PERSON ) to investigate the feasibility of such an arrangement .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its report of DATE , ORG stated that after an initial refusal to cooperate in a formal access arrangement , the mother had agreed for the applicant to meet PERSON several times on a provisional basis at the maternal grandparents ' house but that the applicant had failed to contact the Board . ORG concluded that the applicant 's situation had not become sufficiently clear and for this reason the ORG found that a formal access arrangement would not be appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested a prolongation of his residence permit in order to work in the GPE from the head of the GPE police on DATE . At this time the applicant was in receipt of unemployment benefits and for this reason his request was rejected on DATE . As regards LAW , the head of the GPE police considered , inter alia , that since it appeared that the applicant had no regular contacts with his son there was no family life between them within the meaning of this provision . In this respect it was held that the applicant 's claim that it was not his fault that no regular contacts took place could not be taken into account , since regard could only be had to the factual situation . Furthermore , even assuming there was family life between the applicant and his son , an interference with the right to respect for this life would , according to the head of the GPE police , be justified under paragraph QUANTITY of Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested the ORG Secretary for ORG ( ORG ) on DATE to review ( herzien ) the decision of the head of the GPE police . He submitted that he was in the process of obtaining a permanent employment contract . He conceded that at present the contacts with PERSON had not yet been regularised but that ORG of GPE was expected to examine and to grant a request for a formal access arrangement shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's marriage was officially dissolved on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was heard by ORG for Aliens ' Affairs ( PERSON voor ORG ) . The applicant stated that since DATE he had visited PERSON CARDINAL times a week .", "CARDINAL . ORG proposed to the ORG Secretary for ORG that the applicant 's request for revision be rejected . Even though it considered that there was family life between the applicant and PERSON and that the refusal to grant the applicant continued residence in the GPE would constitute an interference with the applicant 's right to respect for his family life , ORG held that this interference was justified for the protection of the economic well - being of the country . In this respect ORG considered that the applicant was in receipt of unemployment benefits . Although it might be true that these benefits would be withdrawn in view of the applicant 's contract as a stand - by employee in the clothing industry , ORG did not regard these activities as serving an essential national interest since it had appeared that on the GPE labour market other people , having priority over the applicant , were available for this kind of work .", "CARDINAL . ORG further took into account that the applicant had only lived with PERSON for DATE , that he saw PERSON irregularly and briefly , and that he contributed irregularly to the costs of PERSON 's upbringing and education .", "CARDINAL . In line with the opinion of ORG , the ORG Secretary for ORG rejected the applicant 's request for revision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG ( ORG ) of ORG sitting in GPE ( nevenzittingsplaats GPE ) on DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that contrary to what ORG had held , he had an intense relationship with PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , following a hearing on DATE , ORG on DATE appointed the applicant 's former wife as guardian ( voogdes ) and the applicant as auxiliary guardian ( toeziend voogd ) of PERSON . It further ordered that as a contribution to the costs of the maintenance and education of PERSON , the applicant should pay to the mother any child benefits he might receive under the statutory regulations . In view of the circumstances and the relationship between the parties ORG found it inappropriate , however , to lay down in a formal access arrangement the varying contacts which the applicant was having with PERSON at that time . ORG assumed in this respect that the contacts which the applicant had had and was still having with PERSON would be continued in the future ; it added that , as part of the upbringing of the child , it was incumbent on the mother to ensure that these contacts between father and child took place .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) against the decision of ORG not to establish a formal access arrangement . A hearing took place on DATE , during which the applicant 's former wife stated that she was not willing to cooperate in a formal access arrangement , since she felt that the applicant only wished to have such an arrangement established in order to obtain a right to reside in the GPE . Furthermore , she did not believe that the applicant was capable of maintaining regular contacts with PERSON and submitted that irregular contacts would not be conducive to the boy 's well - being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a hearing took place before ORG sitting in GPE on the appeal filed by the applicant against the rejection of his request for revision of the decision not to prolong his residence permit . ORG rejected the appeal by decision of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the refusal to grant the applicant continued residence in the GPE constituted a justified interference with his family life . ORG considered in this respect , inter alia , that ORG had rejected the applicant 's request to establish a formal access arrangement . It found , furthermore , that the contacts between the applicant and PERSON were irregular and short and that the applicant did not contribute regularly to the costs of his son 's maintenance and education . ORG further held that the economic well - being of the country should be taken into account as well . It noted that the applicant had submitted an employment contract from which it appeared that his probationary period had not yet been concluded and that , in any event , there was a sufficient amount of work force with priority over the applicant available on the GPE labour market for the kind of work the applicant was employed to do .", "CARDINAL . When this decision was sent to the applicant , that is , on DATE , the applicant 's probationary period had come to an end and he was in possession of a contract of employment for an indefinite period .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's request for the establishment of a formal access arrangement , ORG decided in an interlocutory judgment of DATE to adjourn these proceedings . The ORG found that at the present time there was insufficient reason to deny the applicant right of access to his son . As it was not clear to what extent the applicant was genuinely interested in ORG requested ORG to organise a number of supervised trial meetings between the applicant and PERSON in order to have the applicant 's motives clarified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed that ORG had further adjourned the proceedings until DATE in view of the heavy workload of ORG . By letter of DATE , the applicant asked ORG whether a different organisation might be appointed to organise the trial meetings as he wished to see PERSON and a further delay would be detrimental to both the applicant and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was placed in detention with a view to his expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant again requested a residence permit in order to work in the GPE , to be able to be with his child and for reasons of a compelling humanitarian nature . On this occasion he told the head of police that as of DATE he had stopped contributing financially to his son 's maintenance since his former wife no longer allowed him to see PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The first trial meeting between the applicant and PERSON , organised by ORG , took place on DATE at the offices of this organisation . Since the applicant was still in detention , he was accompanied by CARDINAL police officers who observed the meeting between the applicant and PERSON from a different room .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's representative contacted the officer of ORG who had also been present at the meeting between the applicant and his son . In the opinion of this officer , the meeting had gone well given the circumstances under which it had taken place . Although father and son initially had had to re - accustom themselves to being together , it had been clear that PERSON knew his father and was familiar with him . After the meeting PERSON had spontaneously gone to the window to wave to the applicant . The officer submitted as her opinion that another trial meeting should be organised by ORG , perhaps in the presence of a psychologist , following which the possibility of a supervised access arrangement should be considered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's request of CARDINAL DATE for a residence permit was rejected by the ORG Secretary for ORG on DATE . The ORG Secretary held that no relevant new facts had been adduced by the applicant . On the basis of the information submitted by the police officers who had observed the meeting between the applicant and PERSON on DATE , the ORG Secretary considered furthermore that it had not appeared that the relationship between the applicant and his son at the present time was meaningful , mutual or anything more than shallow and neither was it realistically foreseeable that a closer relationship would develop .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against the refusal of a residence permit with the ORG Secretary for ORG on DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that proceedings concerning access to his son were still pending before ORG and that the trial meeting which had been ordered by ORG on DATE had only taken place as late as CARDINAL DATE . Given the fact that at that time the applicant had been in detention , it was unreasonable to expect that this meeting between the applicant and PERSON would give a true impression of the nature of the relationship between them . The applicant also requested an interim measure from the President of ORG sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was expelled to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG rejected both the objection which the applicant had filed against the refusal of a residence permit and the request for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . The appeal proceedings concerning the formal access arrangement before ORG were adjourned for some time and finally continued in the absence of the applicant who had not been granted an entry visa in order to attend either more trial meetings or the hearing before ORG . On DATE ORG confirmed the decision of ORG not to lay down a formal access arrangement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having regard to the report of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the fact that PERSON and his father had not seen each other since DATE , that it had not been possible for the trial meetings \u2013 except for the CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE to take place within a reasonable time , the uncertainty as to whether the father would come to the GPE and stay there temporarily , the continued doubt as to whether the father was capable of maintaining regular contacts with PERSON and the continuing tension in respect of the father 's uncertain situation , ORG considered that such an arrangement would be contrary to the compelling interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this decision with ORG ( PERSON ) which was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant re - entered the GPE with a visa valid for DATE . He submitted a new application for a formal access arrangement to ORG on DATE , arguing that there had been a change of circumstances since the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in that he was currently in the GPE and had employment . Following a hearing on DATE , during which PERSON 's mother stated that the boy did not want to see the applicant , ORG requested ORG to examine whether it would be in PERSON 's best interests to be brought into contact with his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request for a formal access arrangement and denied him the right of access to his son . It noted the conclusion reached by ORG , after another trial meeting had taken place , to the effect that the interests of the child militated against access since PERSON had displayed strong opposition to the idea and the applicant had not proved able to overcome this opposition . The applicant has lodged an appeal against this decision , which proceedings are currently still pending .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) residence permits granted for a specific purpose , such as family reunification or family formation , can be granted subject to restrictions relating to that purpose . If the purpose for which the permit was granted is no longer complied with , the residence permit may be revoked pursuant to section ORG ) of LAW , and prolongation may be refused pursuant to section GPE ) of the Act on grounds relating to the public interest . An alien who has been granted entry to the GPE but is not or is no longer eligible for admission is under an obligation to leave the country pursuant to section CARDINAL(d)(CARDINAL ) . If he or she does not leave voluntarily , expulsion may follow ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE authorities pursue a restrictive immigration policy in view of the high population density . Admission is only granted on the basis of treaty obligations , if the individual 's presence serves an essential national interest or if there exist compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature . This policy is laid down , inter alia , in the \u201c Circular on Aliens \u201d ( Vreemdelingencirculaire \u2013 \u201c the Circular \u201d ) : a body of directives drawn up and published by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant period , the requirements for admission of aliens for the purpose of family reunification and family formation , and for continued residence after separation , were laid down in LAW of FAC . Aliens married to either a GPE national , a recognised refugee or a holder of a permanent residence permit ( vestigingsvergunning ) acquired , after DATE of legal residence , ex jure an indefinite right to remain pursuant to section ORG ) of LAW . This right expired ex jure when the spouses no longer cohabited .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL paragraphs ( a ) and ( d ) of LAW PERSON of FAC an alien whose marriage had lasted for DATE before it broke down could be granted DATE residence from DATE of the de facto breakdown of the marriage , subject to the restriction \u201c for the purpose of finding work , in paid employment or self - employed \u201d . During DATE , dependence on social security or unemployment benefits would not be held against the alien . When assessing an application for a subsequent prolongation of the residence permit , the authorities had to determine whether the person concerned was in paid employment or was self - employed , and would continue to be so for DATE , regardless whether this durable income was obtained from work in a sector where there were sufficient nationals of ORG member GPE or aliens residing lawfully in the GPE available to fill all vacancies . Where no such employment existed for DATE , the right of continued residence would be denied . Employment found subsequently would not change that decision unless that work served an essential national interest .", "CARDINAL . Respect for family life as enshrined in LAW constitutes one of the treaty obligations which may lead to the granting of admission or continued residence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL of Chapter BCARDINAL of FAC provided in this respect that where an alien was not eligible for ( continued ) residence on the basis of the applicable rules , the question whether a refusal of ( continued ) residence was in accordance with LAW should always be examined . Similarly , LAW of FAC stipulated that in the decision whether or not to grant continued residence , regard should be had to the individual 's family life within the context of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa of Book CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) regulates access between a child and the parent who was not awarded parental responsibility following the divorce , as well as the grounds on which access can be denied . This provision , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A child and a parent on whom parental responsibility has not been conferred shall have the right of access to each other .", "CARDINAL . At the request of CARDINAL or both parents , the court shall establish an arrangement , for an indefinite period or otherwise , for the exercise of the right of access , or shall deny the right of access , for an indefinite period or otherwise .", "CARDINAL .

If the parents disagree about the access arrangement , the courts request ORG for a report . Where the father has seen the child only occasionally since the child was very young and the parents are in dispute about the question of access , the ORG may organise a number of meetings on Board premises , in order to determine how the child responds to the father and how the father treats the child . Such observations are then used to decide on the request for an access arrangement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG on DATE . He maintained that the authorities ' refusal to grant him continued residence and his subsequent expulsion had infringed Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commission declared the complaints under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL inadmissible , and on DATE it declared the complaint under LAW admissible .", "CARDINAL .
