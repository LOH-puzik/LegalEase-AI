The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant and his CARDINAL siblings were named dependents on that claim . The Secretary of ORG for ORG refused the asylum claim on DATE . Following a reconsideration of the case in DATE , the Secretary of ORG again refused the asylum claim but granted the family CARDINAL years\u2019 exceptional leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant , who was then DATE , received police cautions for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and robbery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was convicted of robbery and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , his mother and his siblings were granted indefinite leave to remain in GPE .

On DATE he was convicted of burglary , theft and impersonating a police officer . He was sentenced to a community punishment order of TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of robbery and was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 detention in a ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or around this time the Secretary of ORG considered instigating deportation proceedings against the applicant . On DATE he decided not to pursue such proceedings owing to the length of his residence in GPE . However , he warned him that should he come to the adverse attention of the authorities through criminal offending in the future , he could be liable to deportation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s father was granted indefinite leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to the supply of Class A drugs . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The sentencing judge addressed him in the following terms :", "\u201c this case has been a copy - book example of how people in your position are able to continue to operate outside the law by the use of interchangeable street names , preying upon the most vulnerable addicts and by the indiscriminate use of fear and violence to ensure that no - one informs the police of your criminal activities ... Your evidence to the jury was that you were the main man for drugs in GPE ... Your nickname of \u2018 Bruiser\u2019 ensured that when the \u2018 workers\u2019 as you called those who sold drugs on your behalf , \u2018 messed up\u2019 it was your policy , to use your own words , of \u2018 roughing them up a little bit\u2019 . You told the jury , with some satisfaction , that this policy was successful ... I regard you as close to the source of supply and wholesaling to retailers in GPE on a persistent and regular basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed on DATE . However , on CARDINAL DATE ORG substituted the applicant \u2019s sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with CARDINAL of CARDINAL years\u2019 detention in a ORG . While in detention he received CARDINAL adjudications , which included the use of threats and abusive behaviour , disobeying lawful orders , fighting with other inmates , and attempting to commit / incite another inmate to commit assault on staff .", "CARDINAL . He was released on licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section ORG ) of GPE DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the Secretary of ORG was required to make a deportation order in respect of foreign criminals sentenced , inter alia , to a period of imprisonment of DATE , unless CARDINAL of the exceptions in section DATE namely that removal would breach their rights under either LAW or LAW applied ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG notified the applicant of his liability to automatic deportation and asked him to submit reasons why he should not be deported . His representatives responded to that letter ; however , on DATE he was served with both a deportation order dated DATE , and a decision that section ORG the DATE Act applied ( that is , he was liable to automatic deportation and removal would not breach his rights under either LAW or LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In a section of the decision headed \u201c Consideration under ORG \u201d , the Secretary of ORG had regard to her obligations under LAW . Although she accepted that the applicant had family ties in GPE with his mother , father , brother and sister , in the absence of further elements of dependency she found that these ties did not constitute family life . She did accept that he enjoyed private life in GPE but did not consider that his removal would be disproportionate to the legitimate interest of preventing disorder and crime . In particular , she noted that he had an elderly grandmother in GPE and as an adult he could be expected to readjust to life there . Furthermore , as LANGUAGE was one of the official languages of GPE , he would not face a language barrier on return . Finally , she had regard to the seriousness of his criminal record , the CARDINAL adjudications he had received while in detention , and the fact that he had been warned about the risk of reoffending in DATE . She therefore concluded that his deportation would not be in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision . In support of his appeal , he submitted a report by PERSON , a consultant forensic psychiatrist . The report indicated that he suffered from dyslexia ; that he had developed Adolescent Conduct Disorder which could manifest itself in antisocial behaviour but was not inevitably associated with continued offending in adult life ; and that although he presented a medium risk of reoffending , there existed a number of positive factors which would decrease the likelihood of continued criminal involvement , including his family \u2019s abstention from criminal activity , his sustained and supportive parental relationships , his wish to improve himself , and the absence of substance misuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First - tier ORG ( ORG ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on LAW grounds , having found that his deportation would be neither proportionate nor necessary in a democratic society . It found that the applicant did enjoy family life with his parents and younger siblings , his unfortunate history having resulted in a particular dependency on them , since he required their support to \u201c help him to change from being a criminal offender to an employed adult and useful member of society \u201d . In addition , it found that he had also established a private life in GPE ; that he had no experience of living in GPE , save for a short period as a baby and DATE in DATE ; that he had no close relatives in , and no ties to , GPE ; that he had indicated his remorse and given assurances that he would not offend again ; and that his working and studying whilst in detention supported those assurances .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG was granted permission to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) found there to have been a material error of law in the decision of the First - tier ORG . The decision was set aside in its entirety and the case submitted for a full rehearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considered the principles established by this ORG in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX , GPE v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE . In its view , the single most compelling factor in the applicant \u2019s favour was the length of his residence in GPE . It also had regard to his family ties . Although it did not accept that there was any additional element of dependency which would enable it to find the existence of family life for the purposes of LAW , it nevertheless accepted that the applicant \u2019s parents and siblings were an important part of his private life .", "CARDINAL . Balanced against his long residence and established private life , the ORG considered the applicant \u2019s criminal record . It noted that he had a long history of offending , beginning at DATE ; that he had received fair warning from the Secretary of ORG in DATE that any further offending would not be tolerated ; that notwithstanding that warning and the subsequent assurances given to the Secretary of ORG that he was turning his life around , he was already engaged in drug dealing ; that his criminal behaviour had not only continued but had also escalated ; that whilst serving his most recent sentence , he had received CARDINAL adjudications , the majority of them for violence and disobedience ; that his problems with dyslexia could not be used as an excuse to justify his poor behaviour and repeat offending ; and that whilst the majority of his offending had occurred when he was a child , his most recent and most serious had occurred after he had attained his majority .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the issue of future offending and risk to the public , the ORG found it difficult to accept his assurances that he had had a genuine change of heart and no longer posed a risk to the public . He had made similar assurances when faced with deportation in DATE , and since his criminal associates were in prison the fact that he did not see them was not a weighty factor indicating a lifestyle change . Furthermore , there was no evidence that either of his parents would be able to exert any positive influence over him , as they had been unable to do so in the past . Although he was in employment on DATE , there was no evidence of a contingency plan should he not progress into more secure employment .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , whilst accepting that the applicant \u2019s removal would be difficult , the ORG concluded that he was of an age where he could be expected to \u201c stand on his own QUANTITY and make a life for himself \u201d . His family could visit him in GPE and there was evidence to suggest that he had a number of relatives living there . The ORG further noted that he had no girlfriend or children in GPE , he was in good health , and he would not face any language difficulties as there was a universal use of LANGUAGE in GPE . Consequently , the ORG concluded that in spite of his long residence and family circumstances , serious reasons ( as required by ORG in PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) existed to justify the applicant \u2019s expulsion , and that the public interest in effecting deportation outweighed his Article CARDINAL rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant permission to appeal . ORG similarly refused permission to appeal on DATE , and again on DATE following an oral hearing . It found that although the case had required a difficult and delicate balancing exercise , ORG had provided a thorough and careful determination , and the conclusion reached was CARDINAL which had been open to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG amended ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . In so far as relevant , the new Rules ( which have since been further amended ) provided that the deportation of foreign criminals would be conducive to the public good if they were sentenced to CARDINAL or more GPE imprisonment . In such cases , the public interest would only be outweighed in \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant submitted further representations to the Secretary of ORG based on his DATE relationship with a NORP national , who had no connection to GPE , and the birth of their son on DATE . The Secretary of ORG treated those representations as an application to revoke the deportation order and refused it on DATE . She also certified the applicant \u2019s claim , which meant that he was not afforded an automatic incountry right of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to certify his claim . Along with his application , he provided medical evidence that his son required an operation in DATE to correct an umbilical hernia , and that he had been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus and bronchiolitis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG agreed to withdraw the certification decision and to issue a new decision taking account of the applicant \u2019s further representations of DATE and those lodged with the judicial review application in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG considered the applicant \u2019s further representations in light of the amended Immigration Rules . In a decision dated DATE , she refused to revoke the deportation order since there were no \u201c exceptional factors \u201d which outweighed the public interest . In particular , she noted that the applicant had entered into a relationship in the full knowledge of the intention to deport him ; that both the applicant and his partner should have been fully aware of the implications of conceiving a child in those circumstances ; that no valid reason had been given to explain the applicant \u2019s failure to make submissions regarding his relationship at either ORG hearing in DATE or ORG hearing on DATE ; that if the applicant \u2019s partner wished to continue the family unit in GPE , suitable medication would be available in that country to treat their son \u2019s bronchiolitis condition ; that there was no evidence of any exceptional , compelling or compassionate factors ; and that deportation remained a proportionate response to the applicant \u2019s serious criminal offending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted a number of documents in support of his case , including a further psychiatric report by PERSON dated DATE . The report indicated that he had continued to make progress in adopting a \u201c pro - social lifestyle \u201d , that he had addressed his tendency to violence , that he no longer had any criminal associates , that he had demonstrated a commitment to his partner and their son , that he had secured employment , and that the risk of re - offending and of harm to the public was very low .", "CARDINAL . The First - tier ORG , having heard oral evidence from the applicant , his partner , mother , father , brother and sister , and having considered the evidence before it , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Using a CARDINAL - stage approach , the ORG first considered the applicant \u2019s case under LAW . It noted that the applicant \u2019s most recent conviction was for a serious offence which had attracted a sentence of DATE detention ; that following the amendment of ORG , \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d would be required to prevent deportation ; and that those \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d were inextricably bound up with the applicant \u2019s LAW .", "CARDINAL . In this regard , the ORG recalled that the applicant \u2019s family and personal circumstances had been examined with the most careful and thorough consideration by ORG in DATE . It had considered them in the context of the exceptionality requirements set out in PERSON ( the requirement of \u201c very serious reasons \u201d to justify the expulsion of a settled migrant : see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) and concluded that his deportation was justified . The ORG noted , however , that the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances had since changed . It therefore gave careful consideration to his CARDINAL - and - a - DATE relationship with his partner and the birth of their child . Nevertheless , it concluded that neither the relationship nor the birth of the child amounted to an \u201c exceptional circumstance \u201d within the context of ORG . Although it accepted that there would be an inevitable interference with the family life said to exist between the applicant , his partner and their child , it found there to be nothing \u201c exceptional \u201d about this . Consequently , the ORG did not consider that his family and personal circumstances amounted to the \u201c exceptionality \u201d required by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG moved on to consider LAW as a separate issue , having regard to the findings of ORG in DATE . It agreed with ORG that language would not be an obstacle for the applicant since LANGUAGE was widely spoken in GPE . It further noted that while the evidence as to the existence of family in GPE was somewhat confusing , it was perhaps not of fundamental importance for an adult quite capable of standing on his own QUANTITY ; that the applicant would continue to receive support from his parents following his removal to GPE ; and that his parents could visit him there as often as they wished .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s relationship with his partner and their child , it observed that he had failed to disclose his immigration status to his partner until after she had fallen pregnant ; that he and his partner had never lived together ; that his partner and child had the full support of her family in GPE , with whom they lived , and that support would continue following the applicant \u2019s deportation ; and that his child could visit him in GPE and maintain such a relationship as deemed appropriate . Therefore , having carefully considered the issue of proportionality , including \u201c section CARDINAL [ of the Borders , LAW DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ] and the best interests of the Appellant \u2019s child \u201d , the ORG concluded that the Secretary of ORG had a legitimate interest in maintaining appropriate immigration control and social order within GPE , and that the interests in effecting the applicant \u2019s deportation were not outweighed by his LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal on the ground that the ORG had erred in concluding that his circumstances were not \u201c exceptional \u201d for the purposes of ORG . The First - tier ORG refused permission to appeal on DATE . The applicant made a further application for permission to appeal to ORG , raising the same grounds as before the First - tier ORG . In addition , he also submitted that the application raised an important point of principle : namely , whether the decision of the ORG was contrary to the principle of double jeopardy , or constituted discriminatory punishment , since a NORP national could not be excluded from GPE . On DATE ORG refused the application for permission to appeal . Both Tribunals found that the applicant \u2019s grounds sought , in essence , to reargue the merits of the appeal and that no error of law had been disclosed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then sought permission to apply for judicial review of ORG refusal of the application for permission to appeal . Following ORG judgment in R ( on the application of ORG ) v. ORG ; R ( on the application of PERSON ( GPE ) ) v. ORG ) and Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG , ORG could only review decisions of ORG if the \u201c second appeal \u201d test was satisfied ; that is , if the appeal raised an important point of principle , or there was another compelling reason to allow it to succeed . In the present case the applicant once again submitted that the \u201c double jeopardy \u201d argument raised an important point of principle . However , on DATE ORG refused the application for permission to apply for judicial review . In refusing permission the judge expressly stated that while it was \u201c apparent that different views might reasonably be taken about whether the Claimant should be permitted to remain in the GPE in the light of his family ties and length of residence \u201d , that was \u201c not the test for the grant of permission \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following the refusal of the application for permission to apply for judicial review , the applicant had no right to renew the application at an oral hearing in ORG . However , it would have been possible for him to apply to ORG for permission to appeal against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . Removal directions scheduled for DATE were cancelled owing to the absence of a valid travel document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant advised the ORG that his relationship with his partner had broken down and that he had court - ordered direct contact with his son on DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the Secretary of ORG advised the applicant that an application to the NORP authorities for a travel document , required to effect his deportation from GPE , was pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
