THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and currently serving a prison sentence in the GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having raped CARDINAL prostitutes ( \u201c Ms A \u201d , \u201c Ms B \u201d and \u201c Ms C \u201d ) . In a statement made to police after this arrest , a fourth prostitute ( \u201c Ms D \u201d ) reported that she had also been raped . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was notified by the police and , without having had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the applicant , attended PERSON making of this statement , at which occasion the lawyer was able to question PERSON , PERSON and Ms D subsequently recognised the applicant as the man who had raped them from a series of photographs ; in the case of Ms B and PERSON this identification took place in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "A DNA - examination was carried out on sperm found in a swab taken from PERSON According to the results of the examination it could not be excluded that the sperm was the applicant \u2019s - the lowest possible degree of probability to be attached to such results .", "The applicant was convicted of attempted rape of Ms A and of rape of PERSON , Ms C and Ms D by ORG ( ORG ) of GPE on DATE . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE . He requested that PERSON , PERSON and Ms D be heard as witnesses by ORG and the court granted this request . However , at the hearing on DATE none of these witnesses appeared . It transpired that , although properly summoned , PERSON and Ms D did not have a known place of residence or abode ( zonder bekende woon- of verblijfplaats ) . An address was known for Ms C but the summons had not been sent there . ORG adjourned the proceedings in order for PERSON , PERSON and Ms D to be summoned again .", "At the hearing on DATE the witnesses again failed to appear , although all CARDINAL had been properly summoned . The proceedings were once more adjourned and the witnesses summoned again . This time , ORG also issued an order to have PERSON brought before it .", "At the hearing on DATE none of the witnesses appeared . A police officer told ORG that none of the CARDINAL witnesses had been seen at the local community centre for prostitutes ( \u201c huiskamerproject \u201d ) since DATE . PERSON had not been seen near FAC since DATE . The police had let other prostitutes in that area know that they were looking for PERSON address was known for her but when police went there on the morning of the hearing she was not there . The officer had furthermore been told that PERSON had gone to GPE where she was said to be staying at a drug rehabilitation centre but her address in GPE was not known . PERSON was said not to want to have anything to do with the case anymore . PERSON , finally , could not be found and her address was not known .", "ORG decided to dispense with a further summoning of Ms B , PERSON and Ms D as in the circumstances it considered it unlikely that they would appear before it within an acceptable time .", "Before ORG the applicant acknowledged that he had had intercourse with PERSON , saying that she had screamed and that he had not paid her , but he denied having raped her . He further denied the charges against him in relation to PERSON , PERSON and Ms D , submitting that he had been elsewhere when the alleged offences had supposedly been committed . Counsel for the applicant argued that in violation of LAW ( d ) of the Convention the defence had not had sufficient opportunity to test the statements of PERSON , PERSON and ORG further complained of the manner in which the collection of photographs from which PERSON , PERSON and Ms D had recognised the applicant had been compiled . Regardless of the fact that the witnesses had described the perpetrator as having long or shoulder - length hair , CARDINAL photographs in the collection shown to them had featured a person with such a hair style . Finally , counsel requested that the proceedings be adjourned so that a second DNA - examination could be carried out .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted rape of ORG and of rape of PERSON , PERSON and Ms D , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . ORG found that the use in evidence of the statements made to the police by PERSON , PERSON and Ms D without the defence having been able to examine these witnesses was not contrary to LAW . In this respect it took into account that considerable effort had been made to procure the appearance of the witnesses before ORG , that a further summoning of those witnesses appeared to serve no useful purpose , that the statements made by the witnesses were supported by other evidence , and that , as regards PERSON , the applicant \u2019s lawyer had been present both when she had been questioned and when she had identified the applicant from a photograph .", "In respect of the series of photographs shown to PERSON , PERSON and Ms D , ORG referred to the testimony given by an expert witness according to whom a computerised system had been used to select photographs of persons of a similar appearance . ORG also examined the photographs itself . It found that the fact that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL photographs featured men with long hair could not detract from its opinion that the collection had been compiled with the requisite care , since a hair style was only of relative importance in this respect . ORG further noted that each witness had , separately and with certainty , recognised the applicant .", "ORG further noted that the applicant had not disputed the findings of the DNA - examination , but that he had rather expressed the hope that a second such examination might exonerate him completely . However , as ORG did not use the findings of this examination in evidence against him , it considered that to refuse a second examination would not be prejudicial to the applicant \u2019s interests .", "ORG based its conviction of the applicant of the rape of PERSON , PERSON and Ms D on the following means of evidence , in respect of the particular charge to which each of them related only :", "- the applicant \u2019s statement before ORG that he wore tattoos , that he used to drive a blue - grey ORG which was registered in the name of a Mr H , and that he had subsequently obtained a ORG van ;", "- Ms B \u2019s statement to the police in which she related , inter alia , that the perpetrator had been driving a big , metallic - blue coloured NORP car , and in which she described him as having long blond hair , tattoos on both arms and wearing a number of chains ;", "- Ms B \u2019s recognition of the applicant as her assailant from CARDINAL photographs shown to her , at which occasion she stated , \u201c That is PERSON the rapist . He told me himself that he was called PERSON \u201d ;", "- a proc\u00e8s verbal drawn up by a police officer to the effect that the applicant \u2019s girlfriend had told this police officer that the applicant was generally known as \u2018 GPE ;", "- Ms C \u2019s statement to the police in which she related , inter alia , that the perpetrator had been driving a big , silver - blue coloured NORP - style car and that he had pulled a chain around her neck . She further stated that the man had long blond hair worn in a pony tail and a tattoo on his upper arm ;", "- a proc\u00e8s verbal drawn up by a police officer to the effect that the registration number of the car indicated by PERSON as the car driven by her assailant had proved incorrect ;", "- a proc\u00e8s verbal drawn up by a police officer to the effect that Mr H used to have a ORG registered in his name with a registration number that differed CARDINAL digit from the number indicated by PERSON ;", "- Ms C \u2019s recognition of the applicant as her assailant from a number of photographs shown to her ;", "- Ms C \u2019s confirmation that the chain featured on a photograph shown to her was of the kind that she had mentioned in her statement ;", "- a proc\u00e8s verbal drawn up by CARDINAL police officers to the effect that a silver - coloured chain had been found in the ORG van which they had investigated in relation to the suspicion that a number of rapes had taken place inside the vehicle ;", "- Ms D \u2019s statement to the police in which she related , inter alia , that the perpetrator had been driving a large silver - grey car and that he had long hair ;", "- Ms D \u2019s recognition of the applicant as her assailant from CARDINAL photographs shown to her ;", "- a proc\u00e8s verbal drawn up by a police officer to the effect that the owner of a breaker \u2019s yard had recognised the applicant from a photograph shown to him as the man whom he had given a purple - blue ORG in exchange for a metallic - grey ORG .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , raising the same arguments as he had before ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG found that LAW did not prevent the use in evidence of PERSON statement to the police despite the fact that counsel had not been able to question her as a witness . In this respect ORG did not find unreasonable the conclusion that further attempts to make PERSON appear before ORG would serve no useful purpose . ORG noted , moreover , that counsel had taken no initiative to examine the police officers who had taken PERSON statement . It also considered that PERSON statement was corroborated by other means of evidence used in respect of this charge , in particular concerning the physical appearance of the applicant and the car he used .", "As regards the use in evidence of Ms D \u2019s statement , ORG observed that counsel had attended PERSON interview with the police and that the applicant had thus had the opportunity to have this witness questioned on his behalf .", "ORG found no issue with the manner in which ORG had rejected the complaint concerning the compilation of the series of photographs from which the applicant had been recognised .", "ORG quashed the judgment of ORG in so far as it concerned the charge of rape of PERSON and the determination of the sentence . ORG held that a second DNA - examination could not be refused for the sole reason that the examination already carried out had been complete and that the results were not used in evidence . ORG referred this part of the case to ORG , which court was also to impose a sentence relating to the other offences of which the applicant had been found guilty .", "On DATE ORG The GPE convicted the applicant of the rape of PERSON It sentenced the applicant to six years\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . In these proceedings the applicant again complained of his not having been able to question PERSON The applicant filed an appeal in cassation against the judgment of ORG , which proceedings are currently still pending before ORG .", ""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
