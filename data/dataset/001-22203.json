{"ITEMID": "001-22203", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "TOKARCZYK v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "In DATE ORG instituted investigations in respect of a person or persons unknown on suspicion of aiding and abetting abortion . On DATE ORG ordered the interception of the applicant \u2019s telephone calls as he suspected him of having committed a criminal offence of aiding and abetting abortion .", "On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was remanded in custody . He was released on an unspecified date after DATE of detention .", "On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , submitting that the interception of his phone calls had exposed his family to harassment by the employees of the ORG telecommunications service . On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision , considering that it had been justified by the need to gather evidence in the proceedings . The recorded conversations had served as evidence , which enabled charges to be brought against the applicant . After the applicant was arrested , the interception of his phone calls was terminated on DATE .", "By virtue of a judgment of ORG of DATE the applicant was found guilty on CARDINAL counts of aiding and abetting abortion in return for payment . He was also convicted of inciting one of the women who had had an abortion , ORG , to give false evidence . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) was imposed on him .", "The court established that from DATE the applicant had been regularly placing advertisements in the local newspaper : \u201c Gynaecologist - inducing periods ; call after TIME \u201d , and giving a phone number of a flat owned by him . Numerous women had telephoned him . He offered a service of taking them by his car to a hospital in GPE in GPE , where abortion remained legal , for a fee of MONEY . He had travelled to GPE CARDINAL times , on various dates from DATE until CARDINAL DATE , with CARDINAL women who had had abortions in the local hospital . The court relied on the testimony of QUANTITY witnesses , including the QUANTITY women concerned , the staff of the newspaper in which the applicant had placed his advertisements , the persons living in his flat where he had been taking the phone calls , and other persons living in the neighbourhood . The court also relied on numerous documents in the case - file . As regards the charge of inciting ORG to give false evidence , the court relied on the transcripts of the applicant \u2019s conversation with her , in which he had suggested that she tell the court that she travelled to GPE to visit her family . The court further considered that the transcript of the CARDINAL conversations was consistent with the evidence that this witness had given in the court .", "The applicant appealed against that judgment . He submitted , inter alia , that the court had committed an error of fact in that it had failed to order expert medical opinions to establish whether the health of the women concerned had been such as to justify abortion under the law as it had stood at the material time . It was further argued that the court had failed to establish whether the women concerned were in a \u201c difficult personal situation \u201d within the meaning of ORG , and LAW . The court had limited its considerations in this respect to the women \u2019s financial situation , entirely overlooking all other aspects of what could legitimately be understood as their \u201c personal situation \u201d . The term \u201c personal situation \u201d should have been interpreted as referring to a woman \u2019s situation as a whole , including her subjective feelings . Regard should have been had to the particularly delicate situation of a woman in an unwanted pregnancy , often confronted with the hostility of her environment and having to cope with prejudices and negative opinions in respect of unmarried mothers . Only through a full assessment of all such circumstances could it be established whether the women in the instant case were in a difficult personal situation such as to render voluntary termination of pregnancy lawful under the provisions of the LAW . Lastly , the applicant argued that the lower court did not have any credible evidence on which to convict him of inciting ORG to give false evidence .", "On DATE ORG upheld the contested judgment . The court considered that there was in fact evidence concerning the charge of inciting ORG to give false testimony , namely the transcript of the telephone conversations between her and the applicant on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , numbered CARDINAL and CARDINAL . As to the health of the women who had had abortions , the court observed that there were no indications that the applicant had been interested in their health when he had offered his services . Therefore it could not be accepted that their health could have been such as to amount to a fact justifying the abortion within the meaning of the LAW then in force , or that the applicant had himself had any regard to this factor . Insofar as the applicant argued that the lower court had failed to establish whether the women were in a \u201c difficult personal situation \u201d , the court considered that the assessment made by the lower court was not arbitrary and that it was compatible with ordinary life experience .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG . submitting complaints similar to those advanced in the appeal against the first - instance judgment . On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "Subsequently , the applicant applied to ORG of ORG to grant him a stay of execution of the sentence as his health necessitated continuous medical care . On DATE the court granted him a stay of execution . On an unspecified date the applicant applied again for a stay of execution of the sentence and on DATE ORG refused , holding that there were no indications that the serving of a prison sentence would entail any deterioration of his health . Subsequently , the applicant applied to ORG to reopen the criminal proceedings in his case , submitting that ORG had , at his request , instituted criminal proceedings against witnesses who had testified in his case as their testimony had allegedly been false . Simultaneously , he applied for a stay of execution of the sentence .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant him a stay of execution .", "On an unspecified later date the applicant appealed against the ORG decision of DATE and on DATE ORG granted him a stay of execution of the sentence until DATE . Apparently , the applicant submitted further applications for a stay of execution and they all were refused .", "On an unspecified date the applicant requested ORG to set a date for the in respect of his application to reopen the proceedings in his case . On DATE he was informed in reply that the hearing could not be held until the final decision was given in the criminal proceedings against witnesses , as the decision was of significant importance for the decision on the reopening of the proceedings .", "On an unspecified date ORG discontinued the proceedings against the witnesses , finding that they had no case to answer . The applicant appealed against that decision and LOC ordered his appeal to be considered by ORG .", "LAW , applicable at the material time , provided that the prosecutor or the court was empowered to order that telephone communications , which could be of potential relevance to criminal investigations , be intercepted . The service of such a decision on the accused could be postponed for a specific period , considered necessary in the interest of the investigations .", "Under the Minister of ORG \u2019s Order of CARDINAL DATE on the interception of phone calls , recordings of telephone conversations were to be made on the basis of the prosecutor \u2019s or court \u2019s order , within the time - frame and scope specified in that order .", "A woman \u2019s right to seek an abortion was introduced in GPE in DATE . DATE until DATE voluntary termination of pregnancy on social grounds was in practice allowed .", "ORG , and Conditions Permitting Pregnancy Termination Act was subsequently adopted by ORG on DATE . It seriously limited the grounds on which abortion could be sought . On DATE an amended text of the Act entered into force . The law as amended provided that pregnancy could be terminated only in the following cases : where pregnancy endangered the mother \u2019s life or health ; whre pre - natal tests or other medical findings indicated a high risk that the foetus could be severely and irreversibly damaged , or be suffering from an incurable life - threatening disease ; where there were strong grounds for arguing that the pregnancy was a result of criminal activity ( rape or incest ) ; or where the mother was in a difficult personal situation .", "On DATE ORG ruled that LAW , making human life in its pre - natal stage dependent on the decision of the legislative , did not comply with LAW . That provision stated that GPE was a democratic state ruled by law and implementing the principles of social justice . ORG held that LAW was incompatible with LAW , which proclaimed the principle that marriage , motherhood and the family were to be placed under the protection and care of GPE The Court held that the provision in issue infringed the constitutional guarantees for the protection of human life at each stage of its development .", "As a result , further amendments were made in DATE to the text of ORG , and LAW of DATE . In particular , the right to terminate pregnancy where the pregnant woman was in a difficult was abolished . A pregnancy that risks a woman \u2019s life or health , or where the child suffers from a genetic malformation , may only be terminated by a physician in a public health - service institution . A physician other than the one who is to perform the operation must issue the certificate confirming the risk to a woman \u2019s health . If the pregnancy resulted from criminal activity , it may only be terminated by DATE and the prosecutor is required to issue a certificate stating that it is probable that the pregnancy is the result of a crime .", "Termination of pregnancy in situations other than those stipulated in ORG , and LAW is now a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for DATE . The person performing the abortion is held criminally responsible , whereas the woman herself is not ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
