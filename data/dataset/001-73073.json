{"ITEMID": "001-73073", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "JOCKS v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . DATE he worked as a judge at ORG ( Amtsgericht ) .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL criminal offences , including CARDINAL counts of fraud , CARDINAL count of instigation to falsification of official records , CARDINAL count of bodily injury , CARDINAL count of perversion of justice in connection with judicial bribery , CARDINAL count of illegal arms trade and CARDINAL counts of having failed to pay contributions to the social security on behalf of a company \u2019s employees . According to the preliminary investigations , the applicant was suspected of having been involved in a number of fraudulent real - estate transactions . He was further suspected of having , in his capacity as a ORG Judge , unlawfully released CARDINAL of his suspected co - offenders from detention on remand .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained on remand .", "On DATE ORG brought an indictment against the applicant , which had an overall length of CARDINAL pages .", "The hearing before ORG began on DATE and ended on DATE . During that time , the trial took place on DATE during which numerous witnesses were heard .", "On DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant and ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand .", "On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE the Schleswig - Holstein Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints against the continuation of his detention on remand .", "On DATE , in a reasoned decision of a total length of CARDINAL pages , ORG found that the preliminary examination had confirmed a strong suspicion against the applicant . This assessment had been based on numerous witness statements , which were corroborated by numerous documents and further circumstantial evidence .", "ORG considered that there was a risk of collusion ( GPE ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung , see relevant domestic law below ) , on the ground that if the applicant was released , he might try to influence other accomplices or witnesses . This was corroborated by the strong suspicion that the applicant had , in the past , built up a smoke screen which was aimed at preventing possible controls by hiding the real facts . The applicant was suspected of having employed a front man ( ORG ) in order to disguise his own role in the real estate business . According to the results of the preliminary investigations , there was specific evidence that the applicant and his co - offenders had , in the past , intimidated both business partners and accomplices by use of threats and violence . There were further indications that the applicant had influenced witnesses before his arrest .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention . It found that the reasons to suspect him of the alleged crimes , as laid down in the arrest warrant , persisted . While the risk of collusion did not persist , as the evidence was sufficiently secured by ORG preliminary investigations , there was the danger of the applicant \u2019s absconding . In case of his conviction , the applicant would have to face a severe prison sentence . Furthermore , he had been disallowed part of his income in disciplinary proceedings . In case of his conviction he would risk removal from office and the loss of his pension claims , which would mean the destruction of his social , professional and economical basis . As the applicant \u2019s children were already grown up , his social bonds were not of such a weight as to prevent him from absconding . On the other hand , the applicant had declared that his wife possessed considerable property . Under these circumstances , there was no less intrusive measure possible to prevent the applicant from absconding than the further continuation of his detention on remand .", "Also on DATE , ORG ordered the continuation of the detention on remand . Referring to its earlier decision of DATE , that court found that the risk of collusion persisted . It further found that the duration of the detention was justified by the exceptional extent of the investigations .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s fresh complaint against his continued detention . Referring to its decision of DATE and examining the new arguments put forward by the applicant , it found that the grounds of suspicion against the applicant persisted . ORG further maintained that the danger of collusion persisted , as the raising of evidence before ORG had not yet considerably advanced .", "Furthermore , the danger of absconding persisted , as the applicant tried to evade the proceedings by rendering himself unfit to plead . In this respect , ORG referred to the Public Prosecutors submissions of DATE , which read as follows :", "\u201c In this respect the Chamber [ of ORG ] has rightly pointed out that the accused , on DATE , had rendered himself unfit to plead and that he , on another occasion , refused to take his medication , which led to similar results . Furthermore , the ORG could take into consideration that the accused \u2019s and his lawyer \u2019s behaviour did not give the impression that the accused was interested in a swift termination of the proceedings . This is confirmed by the fact that , during DATE of hearings , the accused respectively his lawyer had lodged a total of CARDINAL motions for bias against the court , which have so far all been rejected as being unfounded . It is therefore acceptable if the ORG deduces that there is the concrete danger that the accused would try to render himself unfit to plead if he were released from the supervision of detention on remand ... \u201d", "ORG followed these submissions .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a medical attestation according to which it was indicated to discontinue treatment with antidepressant medicine , as his state of health had stabilised and requested , once again , to be released from detention .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s fresh request inter alia for the following reasons :", "\u201c As the ORG has just pointed out in its decision of DATE on the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL motion for bias , the accused and his defendants pursue a procedural strategy which is primarily aimed at obstructing the proceedings . Accordingly , the ORG continues to expect that the applicant , if released , would do everything to evade the proceedings . It is obvious that such can not only be done by overdosing or refusing prescribed medication . Accordingly , the medical attestation ... was not fit to disprove the ORG \u2019s expectations . The danger that the accused would abscond from the proceedings had been further increased by the fact that the evidence presented so far has not yielded any facts in the applicant \u2019s favour ... \u201d", "In his complaint , the applicant contested that he had put himself into a state of being unfit to plead and that there had not been any evidence in his favour . Furthermore , ORG had failed sufficiently to expedite the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . Referring to its former decisions and examining the new arguments put forward by the applicant , that court confirmed that a strong suspicion against the applicant persisted and that there remained the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding and of collusion . With regard to the conduct of ORG , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c There is no indication that ORG failed sufficiently to expedite the proceedings , as prescribed by LAW sentence CARDINAL of the Convention . The latter provides that a detained person is entitled to trial within a reasonable time . As ORG correctly pointed out , the proposed dates for hearings could not be used because either the accused or his counsel were unable to attend . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged a further complaint against the arrest warrant , alleging , inter alia , that ORG had failed sufficiently to expedite the proceedings . He complained , in particular , that CARDINAL dates for hearings had been cancelled because of a judge \u2019s holidays and a lay judge \u2019s attendance of a funeral .", "On DATE ORG rejected the complaint , pointing out that the cancellation of the hearings had been justified and that the ORG had offered alternative dates for hearings , which could not take place as the accused \u2019s counsel had been unable to attend .", "On DATE ORG confirmed ORG decision .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a further request to quash the arrest warrant . Referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , the applicant maintained that only compelling reasons could justify his detention on remand for a period of DATE . According to the applicant \u2019s allegations , the domestic courts had failed to conduct the proceedings with due diligence .", "The applicant maintained that there had never been a strong suspicion against him . Furthermore , there had never been facts confirming a risk of collusion . He further maintained that there had not been any danger of his absconding , as he entertained close contacts to his wife and to his CARDINAL grown - up children . He pointed out that he had at no occasion attempted to evade . Finally , the applicant maintained that ORG had failed to hold hearings at all available dates . In this respect , he pointed out that the chamber had heard another criminal case on DATE from DATE to DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion . It found , first , that there existed the risk that the applicant might attempt to make himself unfit to plead by abuse of medication . In this respect , ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s medical condition on DATE had necessitated extensive medical treatment in order to restore his fitness to plead . A blood examination had revealed a toxic overdose of medication . The strong suspicion against the applicant had been confirmed by the evidence taken .", "With respect to the applicant \u2019s complaint about an alleged lack of diligence , ORG pointed out that , until DATE , it had held hearings on DATE . The parallel proceedings had been conducted with a partially differing composition of the ORG .", "ORG further maintained that the applicant had delayed the taking of evidence . A large part of the length of the proceedings was imputable to the applicant \u2019s own conduct .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . Referring to ORG comments in the complaint proceedings and to its previous decisions of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG confirmed that the strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences he was accused of persisted and that he was likely to tamper with evidence or abscond if released . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , ORG found that the domestic authorities had displayed special diligence given the complexity of the case . They had expedited the investigations following the applicant \u2019s arrest in DATE and continuously held hearings in the applicant \u2019s case since DATE . The chamber had generally held hearings at DATE . There was no indication that ORG could have considerably expedited the proceedings .", "ORG finally found the applicant \u2019s continued detention to be proportionate , given both the conviction the applicant was likely to face and the general interest in the integrity of the judicial system .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for lack of prospect of success .", "On DATE the further execution of the arrest warrant was suspended ( GPE ) and the applicant released .", "On DATE the applicant , who was at that time detained on remand , wrote a letter to the journalist PERSON He alleged that a prosecution witness had stated during a public hearing that he had been induced by ORG to give false evidence against the applicant . In return , ORG had discontinued prosecution in CARDINAL criminal proceedings directed against that witness . The applicant added that ORG actions had been unfair ( \u201c unlautere NORP \u201d ) .", "On DATE , the applicant wrote another letter to the journalist PERSON in which he repeated his allegations . He added that ORG had refused to hear the respective witness on these allegations .", "On DATE ORG ordered under LAW of LAW in conjunction with rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , of the Rules on the Execution of Detention on Remand ( Untersuchungshaftvollzugsordnung , see relevant domestic law below ) that the CARDINAL letters should not be delivered , but returned to the applicant . It found that both letters contained allegations of prosecution of innocent persons and defamatory statements directed against ORG and DATE with respect to the second letter DATE also against ORG .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint . He maintained , in particular , that his allegations had been true .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the content of the letters had been designed to jeopardise the purpose of detention on remand ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) , as the applicant had accused ORG of having employed illegal means . The transmission of the letters was also apt to disturb the prison order , as it could set an example for other prisoners . ORG further pointed out that it was not established that the applicant \u2019s allegation had been true . The applicant was in a position to pursue his interests by the means provided to him in the criminal proceedings .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment .", "The admissibility of detention on remand is governed by LAW ) , the relevant provisions of which read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Detention on remand may be ordered against the accused if he is strongly suspected of the offence and if there is a ground for arrest .
