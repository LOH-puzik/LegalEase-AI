On DATE , a NORP citizen living in GPE , drove through GPE in a jeep with a trailer to transfer a corpse from GPE to GPE . At TIME he stopped on the ringroad of GPE . A car stopped in front of the jeep , CARDINAL men came out of it and approached the vehicle . CARDINAL of them tried to hit Mr E.S.A. with a hammer through the jeep 's window . Another got into the jeep and attacked him with a knife . Mr E.S.A. managed to knock off the knife , but in the meantime the man with the hammer hit him in the face . Then the CARDINAL men threw Mr E.S.A. out of the vehicle , kicked him several times while he was lying on the ground , and drove away with the jeep .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE PERSON stopped her car in front of the house of a friend of her mother 's and stepped out to wipe the ice from the windscreen . A man wearing a wool hat approached her , threatened her , sat in the driver 's seat of her car and drove away .", "CARDINAL . An investigation into the first incident was opened on DATE . Mr E.S.A. was presented with photographs of several persons , including the applicant , and later was questioned . He identified the applicant as CARDINAL of the assailants and described the assailant as having a dark complexion and short brown hair . Apparently the identification procedure was tainted as the investigator did not , as provided by LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , question Mr E.S.A. about the distinctive features of the person to be identified prior to presenting him with the photographs . It also seems that the record was not signed by CARDINAL of the certifying witnesses , as required by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following the identification , the investigator drew up a ruling to summon the applicant . On CARDINAL and DATE a process server visited the applicant 's home to deliver the summons but was informed by a neighbour that the applicant was absent .", "CARDINAL .

DATE , DATE , the applicant 's mother went to ORG and , being a practising lawyer , requested permission to represent the applicant together with another lawyer . She requested the investigator to allow her to get acquainted with the charges and informed him that the applicant would appear for questioning in a DATE 's time . The investigator refused to acquaint her with the charges .", "CARDINAL . The applicant refused to appear for questioning . According to him , this was due to his believing that the accusation was \u201c false and absurd \u201d and to his fear of being illtreated in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police issued a nationwide search warrant for the applicant . According to the applicant , in practice no steps were undertaken in that respect and he was not hiding , but staying in hotels in PERSON and taking his examinations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from ORG ordered the investigator to allow the applicant 's mother to participate in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyers requested the examination of several witnesses who , it was asserted , could establish his alibi . They argued that at the time of the alleged offence the applicant had been in ORG in connection with the investigation of the robbery of the shop he was managing there . On unspecified dates later in the DATE CARDINAL witnesses testified that the applicant had been in ORG prior to and at the time of the attack on ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator proposed that the investigation be stayed on the ground that the applicant was missing and sent the case file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from that office refused to stay the investigation and ordered the carrying out of further investigative steps . She found , inter alia , that the photographs pursuant to which the applicant had been identified and the report from the examination of the crime scene were missing from the case file and that Mr E.S.A. had not been properly questioned .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's lawyers requested that the order for his detention be rescinded . They relied on the fact that the identification procedure with the participation of ORG was flawed and on the testimony that the applicant had been in ORG at the time of ORG robbing .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Prosecutor 's Office rejected the request by an order of CARDINAL DATE , reasoning that the proceedings were at a too early stage , that the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence and that there was no indication that he would not abscond , obstruct the investigation or commit another offence . In particular , the applicant was in hiding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator again proposed that the proceedings be stayed on the ground that neither the applicant , nor Mr E.S.A. could be located .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings because ORG had to be summoned from GPE , where he was living , for questioning .", "CARDINAL .

In contrast to his earlier statement , he testified that the attacker had been lightskinned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr E.S.A. was questioned again and said that during the DATE identification he had been presented with CARDINAL or CARDINAL pictures , not CARDINAL as had been stated in the record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyers again requested from ORG to rescind the order for the applicant 's detention . They argued that the evidence thus far adduced convincingly demonstrated that the applicant was not Mr E.S.A. 's attacker . ORG Office replied that it could not rule on the request .", "CARDINAL . A renewed request dated DATE remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator proposed that the proceedings be stayed because the applicant was missing .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE ORG refused to stay the proceedings and sent the case back to the investigator , reasoning that its earlier instructions for additional investigative steps had not been complied with and that key pieces of evidence had not been gathered . It also noted that no effective actions had been undertaken to locate and apprehend the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on or DATE , an investigation relating to the robbery of PERSON car ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was opened by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the picture of the applicant appeared in the DATE newspapers . When PERSON saw the pictures , she went to the police and stated that it was the applicant who had robbed her car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , after consulting with his lawyers , turned himself in . He was then formally presented with the charges against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was questioned . She described the offender as a DATE man with a large mouth and big eyes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with robbing Ms M.V. 's car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in the proceedings relating to Mr E.S.A. 's robbery recommended that the charges against the applicant be dropped , as it appeared that he was not the offender . By an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused and returned the case for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which was supervising the proceedings relating to ORG robbery , took charge of the investigation relating to PERSON robbery as well . It ordered an additional questioning of PERSON with a view to establishing , inter alia , on what basis she was able to identify the applicant and whether she was categorical about that .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL investigations were merged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator proposed that the applicant be committed for trial for the alleged robbery of PERSON car but that the charges in respect of the robbery of Mr E.S.A. be dropped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to drop the charges , ordered additional investigative actions , and decided that the applicant was to be indicted for both offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator presented the applicant with the amended charges , proposed that he be committed for trial and transmitted the case file to ORG .", "DATE . On DATE ORG submitted to ORG a twocount indictment against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the reporting judge set the case down for hearing on DATE and ordered that Mr E.S.A. be summoned from GPE , where he resided , by letter rogatory .", "CARDINAL . The summons was served on Mr E.S.A. not later than CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was held on DATE , at which another judge was presiding . The court heard testimony from CARDINAL witnesses . A second hearing was scheduled for DATE because Ms ORG and CARDINAL other witnesses failed to show up .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing on DATE the ORG questioned PERSON and the other witnesses . Mr E.S.A. 's testimony from the preliminary investigation was read out before the court because he was absent from the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment , acquitting the applicant of all charges against him . However , the court did not announce the reasons for its judgment until DATE . It held that PERSON and ORG testimony regarding the physical features of the offender was very unreliable . The court also refused to take into account the results of the photograph identification made on DATE by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , holding that it had been effected in breach of the relevant rules of evidence and was thus inadmissible . Finally , the court found it established that the applicant had an alibi in respect of both alleged offences . As regards the first alleged offence , it found that at the time of the robbery of Mr E.S.A. the applicant had been in ORG because the shop he had been managing there had been robbed DATE before that . As regards the second alleged offence , the court held that at the time of the robbery the applicant had been visiting a friend together with his girlfriend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against the judgment to ORG , stating that GPE had not properly established the facts . The appeal did not mention further particulars in support of this position and stated that additional arguments would be provided after the announcement of the reasons for the judgment by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested ORG to declare the prosecution 's appeal inadmissible for failure to specifically describe the non - elucidated facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having received on DATE the reasons for ORG judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG filed an \u201c additional submission \u201d which contained detailed arguments in support of its appeal . It submitted that GPE had erroneously assessed certain witness testimony and that its findings of fact had not reflect correctly the evidence presented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer made an objection , arguing that the prosecution 's appeal should be declared inadmissible as the first filing had been defective and the \u201c additional submission \u201d \u2013 allegedly the valid appeal \u2013 had been lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted the appeal for consideration , briefly noting that the detailed argumentation had been filed later because of the late announcement of the reasons for ORG judgment and that there was no indication that the appeal was out of time .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE at which oral argument was heard but no new evidence presented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the acquittal and remitted the case to ORG on the ground that on DATE the applicant had been charged in violation of the procedural requirements , his signature being missing from TIME of the charging . Thus , it was unclear whether he had understood the nature and the cause of the accusation against him . That amounted to a serious violation of the applicant 's defence rights , despite the fact that his lawyers had been present at the charging .", "CARDINAL . The court 's judgment was not subject to appeal , as it did not put an end to the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the case to the investigator , instructing him to carry out certain investigative actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was charged anew on DATE . The investigator recommended his committal for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted to ORG an indictment against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the reporting judge set the case down for hearing on CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court held several hearings on CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE and DATE .", "DATE . In a judgment of DATE the ORG again acquitted the applicant of all charges against him . The court held that Mr E.S.A. 's testimony about the physical features of the offenders was controversial and unreliable . It also held that the photograph identification was inadmissible because effected in breach of the relevant rules of evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court went on to hold that PERSON testimony about the physical features of the person who had robbed her was likewise unreliable . The court further held that the applicant had an alibi for both offences . As regards the first alleged offence , from CARDINAL till DATE the applicant had been in ORG , because the shop he had been managing there had been robbed on DATE . He had stayed at a friend 's house and had met officers from the local police station and several other persons . He had taken a train in TIME DATE , at TIME , and had arrived back in GPE in TIME of DATE . As regards the second alleged offence , the court held that at the time of the robbery the applicant had been visiting a friend together with his girlfriend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against the judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia Court of Appeals held a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the acquittal .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the judgment and it entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant turned himself in and was detained pursuant to the investigator 's order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the applicant was also charged with robbing PERSON car , his detention was confirmed by the investigator on the ground that another investigation was pending against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held , in response to an application for bail , that the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence , that there was a risk that he would flee , jeopardise the investigation , or reoffend . In particular , prior to his arrest he had been hiding . Also , another investigation was pending against him , which , according to LAW ORG , made detention mandatory . It therefore refused bail .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant again applied for bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from ORG granted bail , but apparently his order was not found in the case file and was never put into effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputyhead of ORG reversed the bail order , holding that under LAW of the ORG a detainee charged with a serious intentional offence could only be released if there existed serious indications that he or she would not abscond , obstruct the investigation or commit an offence . In the case at hand this prerequisite was missing . On the contrary , the available information indicated that there was a serious risk of the applicant fleeing or committing an offence , because he had been hiding for DATE prior to his arrest . Moreover , another investigation was pending against him , which excluded release on bail .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer appealed against this order to ORG . By an order of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that the applicant had been charged with CARDINAL serious intentional offences and that sufficient evidence pertaining to his guilt had been collected . Furthermore , in view of the nature of the alleged offences , the applicant 's release could seriously obstruct the investigation . There was also a danger that the applicant could flee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the reporting judge at ORG held of her own motion that there were no grounds for granting bail at that point and decided to continue the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested the applicant 's release . It was argued that the investigation had already been completed and that there was hence no risk of the applicant jeopardising it , and that there was no indication that if released the applicant , who was a student and wished to continue his education , would commit an offence . Moreover , the applicant had not tried to hide because he had never been properly summoned .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE made in private the reporting judge refused bail . She held that the applicant had been charged with serious intentional offences , which meant that release was only possible if the exception of LAW of the ORG was applicable . However , prior to his arrest the applicant had been hiding for DATE , thus demonstrating his intention to jeopardise the investigation . On the other hand , another investigation was pending against him , which , under LAW ORG , excluded the possibility for release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE or DATE the applicant 's lawyer again requested the applicant 's release , arguing that he had a permanent address and was enrolled in university and that his girlfriend had given birth to his baby on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The reporting judge at ORG rejected the applicant 's request in a decision of DATE made in private . She held , inter alia , that the applicant 's lengthy hiding had hindered the investigation and that another investigation was pending against him for a robbery allegedly committed in ORG . It appears that the judge was referring to the investigation into the robbery of the applicant 's girlfriend 's shop , in which the applicant was not the suspect , but the victim ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer appealed against the decision to ORG . She lodged the appeal with ORG , but on DATE the court rejected it as inadmissible , holding that , being his mother and having been questioned as a witness , the applicant 's lawyer could not also act as his defence counsel . Following this , the same day the applicant lodged an appeal in person . He argued that he had not been hiding : he had been taking his university examinations and staying in hotels ; the authorities had never made an effective effort to find him . He further explained the misunderstanding concerning the investigation in ORG . In addition , he complained that ORG had failed to address the question of the reliability of the evidence on which the charges had been based or to consider the factors militating against his continued detention .", "The reporting judge examined the appeal , and having found no grounds to vary its decision , sent it together with the casefile to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private and in the presence of a prosecutor who argued that the appeal was ill - founded , dismissed the appeal . It noted that the applicant had been charged with CARDINAL serious intentional offences , that he had been hiding and that there had been no change in circumstances warranting his release . Despite the applicant 's explanation concerning the misunderstanding in respect of the ORG investigation , ORG repeated the reference to an investigation pending against him there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE of the trial , ORG granted bail , setting the amount at CARDINAL old NORP levs . The court held that prior to his arrest the applicant had been in PERSON taking his university examinations , that there was no indication that he would abscond , that his clean criminal record suggested that there was little danger of him committing an offence , and that there was no risk that he would obstruct the investigation . The applicant posted bail DATE and was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

At the relevant time and until the reform of the ORG of DATE the accused could be detained by decision of an investigator or a prosecutor . In cases where the decision to detain had been taken by an investigator without the prior consent of a prosecutor , it had to be approved by a prosecutor within twentyfour TIME ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . ORG , LAW , ECHR CARDINALII ) .", "CARDINAL .
