De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The following summary of the facts is based on the applicants\u2019 submissions and the findings of the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . NORP The names of the applicants and their representatives are set out in the attached table . CARDINAL of the applicants , ORG , is an investment fund incorporated in GPE . As a result of transactions DATE it became the largest shareholder in LOC plc , with CARDINAL shares , amounting to PERCENT of the issued ordinary share capital . Another applicant , RAB Special Situations ( Master ) Fund Ltd is also an investment company incorporated in GPE . It acquired its shares in LOC by transactions DATE and DATE . By the date of LOC nationalisation , it owned CARDINAL shares , amounting to PERCENT of the issued ordinary share capital . The remaining applicants are individual small shareholders , some of whom acquired their shares on demutualisation ; others of whom acquired theirs as employees under an approved profit share scheme or share incentive plan , or other incentive schemes , or by contributions to the company pension fund . Others were small investors who bought their shares on the stock exchange . At the date of nationalisation there were CARDINAL small shareholders .", "CARDINAL . LOC was originally a building society . In DATE it was converted into a public limited company , listed on ORG and authorised to carry on business as a bank . On its demutualisation , shares were issued to its existing depositors . Its core business remained residential mortgage lending . It grew to become the fifth largest GPE mortgage lender and the eighth largest GPE bank .", "CARDINAL . Unlike most other banks in GPE , LOC financed a large part of the loans it made to lenders by borrowing money and by issuing bonds backed by a pool of mortgage loans . As a result of turbulence in the international financial markets , by DATE it had become impossible for it to raise sufficient money on the wholesale market . Moreover , the problems in GPE associated with the securitisation of subprime mortgages made it impossible for LOC to raise funds by securitising its own mortgage book .", "CARDINAL . LOC assets , as valued and stated in its balance sheet , exceeded its liabilities . However , because of the impossibility of borrowing in the wholesale financial markets it did not have the liquid funds to pay its current liabilities and to repay depositors , and so it could not pay its debts as they fell due .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC alerted ORG to its liquidity problems and its doubts over the sustainability of its situation . On DATE the ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) agreed in principle to provide financial support , as a \u201c Lender of FAC \u201d ( \u201c LOLR \u201d ) , to allow LOC to maintain liquidity . It was considered that LOC problems constituted a genuine threat to the stability of the financial system , with a risk of serious disturbance in the wider economy .", "CARDINAL . LOLR Assistance is made under procedures set out in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Tripartite Authorities , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP In exceptional circumstances , there may be a need for an operation which goes beyond the ORG \u2019s published framework for operations in the money market . Such a support operation is expected to happen very rarely and would normally only be undertaken in the case of a genuine threat to the stability of the financial system to avoid a serious disturbance in the GPE economy . If the ORG or the ORG identified a situation where such a support operation might become necessary , they would immediately inform the other authorities and invoke the co - ordination framework outlined in paragraph CARDINAL below . Ultimate responsibility for authorisation of support operations in exceptional circumstances rests with the Chancellor . Thereafter they would keep the ORG informed about the developing situation , as far as circumstances allowed .", "CARDINAL . In any such exceptional circumstances , the authorities\u2019 main aim would be to reduce the risk of a serious problem causing wider financial or economic disruption . In acting to do this , they would seek to minimise both moral hazard in the private sector and financial risk to the taxpayer arising from any support operation . \u201d", "The principles on which ORG is provided by ORG were further explained in a lecture given at ORG in DATE by the then Governor of the ORG . In particular , he underlined that PERSON is designed not to protect the individual bank or its shareholders , but to safeguard the financial system as a whole from contagion , thereby preventing damage to the wider economy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG broadcast leaked information about the bank \u2019s liquidity problems which , over DATE , led depositors to withdraw ORG CARDINAL , PERCENT of LOC retail deposits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tripartite Authorities authorised ORG to provide LOLR support , in the form of a secured loan at a premium rate of interest . On DATE the Chancellor of the ORG announced that ORG would guarantee the safety of all existing deposits in LOC . By DATE the loan provided by ORG was virtually exhausted . To prevent the company from collapsing , a further loan was put in place , which was repayable on demand , again at a premium rate of interest and secured against all assets of the company .", "CARDINAL . The Government had duly informed ORG of the measures it had taken in relation to LOC . On DATE the ORG issued a decision . The Commission concluded that the measures taken by the ORG DATE and those announced on DATE constituted non - notified ORG aid pursuant to Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW establishing ORG . However , the measures were compatible with ORG as rescue aid pursuant to LAW , and the ORG raised no objection to them . Nonetheless , it informed the Government that :", "\u201c ORG expects your authorities to respect their commitment to communicate to the Commission , not DATE , a credible and substantiated restructuring plan or a liquidation plan or a proof that the aid measures granted have been repaid in full and that the guarantees have been terminated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG announced that the preference of ORG was to find a private sector solution for LOC . However , if no suitable private sector solution could be found , the Government would bring forward legislation which would empower the ORG to take LOC into temporary public ownership , since it was not considered that it would be in the public interest to allow the bank to go into administration . If LOC were taken into public ownership , the legislation would provide for the assessment by an independent valuer of compensation payable to the former shareholders . The principles for assessing compensation , which would be set out in the legislation brought forward , would reflect :", "\u201c the principle that the Government should not be required to compensate shareholders for value which is dependent on ORG support and the fact that public sector ownership would be an alternative to an administration of the company . Accordingly , the compensation would be assessed by the valuer on the basis , among other things that all financial assistance to LOC from ORG or ORG ( including ORG existing guarantee arrangements ) had been withdrawn and no other financial assistance ( apart from ORG assistance on its usual terms through standing facilities or open market operations ) were made available by them to LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By DATE there were CARDINAL private sector proposals for the future of LOC . However , both involved the continuation of public financial support to the company , and the Government did not consider that either would deliver sufficient value for money for the taxpayer . The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore announced that legislation would be brought forward to take LOC into a period of temporary public ownership .", "CARDINAL . The power to nationalise LOC was conferred on the Government by ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) , which was passed into law on DATE . The nationalisation of the company was effected by the LOC plc Transfer Order CARDINAL , which was made on the same date and came into force on DATE . It transferred the shares in the company to the ORG Solicitor as nominee of the ORG at the beginning of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The total amount lent by ORG to LOC as at DATE was MONEY . In addition , the ORG had assumed contingent liability under guarantees of MONEY . As at DATE , GBP CARDINAL of the loans remained outstanding .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately before nationalisation , the market price of LOC shares was MONEY , giving a market capitalisation of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The statutory instrument making provision for the determination of the compensation payable to the former shareholders of LOC was the LOC plc Compensation Scheme Order DATE ( \u201c the Compensation Scheme Order \u201d : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , made on DATE . It required the independent valuer , when calculating the amount of compensation to be paid by the ORG , to assume that LOC was unable to continue as a going concern and was in administration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed GPE that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in LAW ) of LAW in relation to ORG aid potentially incompatible with the common market . However , it did not consider that the proposed compensation scheme was incompatible , for the following reasons :", "\u201c The decision of DATE already established that LOC is a firm in difficulty . Its situation has not improved since then . In particular , if all the rescue aid measures were withdrawn , the firm would immediately exit the market . ...", "The ORG has accordingly decided that the measures implemented on DATE are compatible with LAW and that if the shareholders are only compensated on the basis of an independent valuation of the company without any ORG support , the purchase of the shares from existing shareholders does not constitute ORG aid . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON wrote to the former shareholders informing them that his provisional view was that , applying the statutory assumptions , there would be no residual value in the company and therefore no compensation would be payable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the assumptions required by LAW by way of judicial review proceedings in ORG . They contended that , contrary to LAW , the assumptions imposed on the PERSON failed to strike a fair balance ; gave rise to procedural unfairness , since the PERSON could not take into account all relevant facts ; and wrongly prevented the regulatory failures of the ORG from being taken into account in the assessment of compensation .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the proceedings on CARDINAL DATE ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) . It took the view that the statutory assumptions imposed on the PERSON reflected the fact that , but for the support provided by ORG , LOC would have been unable to pay its debts as they fell due and would have had to cease carrying on business . The court further held that its function was one of review : to determine whether the ORG had exceeded its margin of appreciation . It held that the margin of appreciation in this case was narrower than it had been in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; and GPE and Others v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , since the decision to nationalise LOC was made on narrower economic grounds , by comparing the financial benefits to the taxpayer of nationalisation with the alternatives available . However , following GPE and Others v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , the court considered that the relevant test was whether the determination under challenge was \u201c manifestly without reasonable foundation \u201d , and it did not consider that the Compensation Scheme could be so condemned . Moreover , there had been no procedural unfairness and LOC problems were due to the failures of its managers , rather than the ORG \u2019s lack of regulation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . ORG held that the Government support accorded to LOC from DATE had constituted a \u201c Lending of FAC \u201d ( \u201c LOLR \u201d ) operation , carried out in the context of macro - economic policy , strictly and exclusively for the protection of the banking system as a whole and not in the interests of LOC or its shareholders . As with all PERSON support , it was always intended to be a short - term operation . The decision to take the company into public ownership was a strategic exercise of Government policy , intended to preserve for the sake of the national economy the benefits of the PERSON operation at the least possible cost to the taxpayer . In these circumstances , the margin of appreciation available to the ORG had to be wide . The court should only interfere if it were to conclude that the ORG \u2019s judgment as to what was in the public interest was manifestly without reasonable foundation , which was not the case here . LOLR assistance would not have been provided if support had been available on the market and nationalisation was only carried out because no commercial entity was prepared to acquire LOC except on terms that the ORG continued to provide support and carried the risk of default . There was no evidence to support the applicant \u2019s allegation that the Government were motivated by profit . The purpose of the statutory assumptions was to put the shareholders in the position they would have occupied had no PERSON support been provided . If the assumptions produced a nil value for the shares , this was only because the business was shown to be worthless without the support put in by the Government and there was nothing in the assumptions to prevent the PERSON from attaching a premium value to LOC loan book and other assets .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were refused further permission to appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act conferred power on the ORG to make an order transferring securities issued by an authorised GPE deposittaker to the ORG \u2019s nominee . By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) read with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act , the power was exercisable by the ORG if it considered it desirable to do so for either or both of the following purposes :", "\u201c ( a ) maintaining the stability of the GPE financial system in circumstances where the ORG consider that there would be a serious threat to its stability if the order were not made ;", "( b ) protecting the public interest in circumstances where financial assistance has been provided by the ORG to the deposit - taker for the purpose of maintaining the stability of the GPE financial system . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL required the ORG to make a scheme for determining the amount of any compensation payable by the ORG to persons who held the securities immediately before they were transferred . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In determining the amount of any compensation payable by the ORG by virtue of any provision in an order under this section , it must be assumed DATE", "( a ) that all financial assistance provided by ORG or the ORG to the deposit - taker in question has been withdrawn ( whether by the making of a demand for repayment or otherwise ) , and", "( b ) that no financial assistance would in future be provided by ORG or the ORG to the deposit - taker in question ( apart from ordinary market assistance offered by ORG subject to its usual terms ) . \u201d", "\u201c Ordinary market assistance \u201d was defined in subsection ( CARDINAL)(b ) and did not include the financial support that had been provided to LOC since DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It came into force on DATE , and transferred all the shares in LOC to the ORG Solicitor as nominee of the ORG with effect from the beginning of that date .", "CARDINAL .
