SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is an employee residing in GPE in GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the NORP customs authorities came across QUANTITY of propaganda materials addressed to the applicant , consisting of books and magazines of the NORP Workers\u2019 Party ORG . The materials were transmitted to ORG ( Bundesanwaltschaft ) which examined them and concluded that they propagated violence as the only alternative against the \u201c NORP terror ORG \u201d and insulted members of ORG . The ORG considered that the sale or dissemination of these publications endangered the interior and exterior security of GPE for which reason on DATE it decided to seise the materials based on PERSON ORG concerning propaganda materials endangering the State ( Bundesratsbeschluss betreffend staatsgef\u00e4hrliches PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal about the seisure was dismissed by ORG and Police on DATE .", "On DATE ORG PERSON ) decided on the basis of its Decree of DATE to confiscate and destroy the materials .", "The applicant filed administrative law appeals ( Verwaltungsgerichts - beschwerden ) with ORG ( PERSON ) against the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE .", "On DATE ORG decided to join the appeals and to dismiss them . In its judgment ( published in BGE [ Entscheidungen des Bundesgerichts ] CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) the court considered at the outset that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE to confiscate and destroy the materials replaced the decision of the authorities to seise the materials for which reason the applicant had lost interest in his complaint against the customs authorities .", "ORG then considered that in principle decisions of ORG could not be contested before ORG . On the other hand , the confiscation of the materials at issue related to the applicant \u2019s \u201c civil rights and obligations \u201d within the meaning of LAW for which reason the applicant was entitled to have access to court . There was no other judicial body on the Federal level which could decide the applicant \u2019s case , yet GPE could not invoke domestic law in order to avoid complying with obligations arising under international law . As a result , the court regarded itself competent to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "ORG , which noted that the applicant had not requested a public hearing , considered that the applicant had been duly informed of the reasons of the authorities for seising the materials for which reason he was in a position duly to contest the confiscation and to present his case .", "ORG then examined the grounds for confiscating the materials at issue in light of the applicant \u2019s freedom of information . It considered that LAW of DATE served as a legal basis for the measure . The judgment continued :", "\u201c The confiscated materials concern editions of the magazine \u2018 PERSON Alternatif\u2019 ( ORG ) No . DATE and , on the other hand , paperbacks with the title \u2018 PERSON ve Iktidar Olgusu\u2019 ( Woman and the ability to govern ) . With these CARDINAL publications ORG intends to win as many NORP and other like - minded people for the armed resistance against NORP authorities . Therein violence is advocated and glorified . The militarisation and the martyrs\u2019 death of women particularly are advocated . News about successful bomb attacks , suicidal attacks , and attacks upon institutions of ORG add further weight to the exhortation to employ violence .", "In ORG view , these writings served to radicalise groups tending to extremism among foreigners and the NORP . A danger for the peaceful co - existence and therefore for the interior security of GPE resulted therefrom ...", "Translated extracts in the case - file from the confiscated material demonstrate that the materials do not at all solely promote the concerns of the NORP population in GPE . Rather , it is intended to transmit the existing tensions in GPE into GPE and to create pressure among the emigrants living here . Even if the exhortation to armed struggle refers mainly to the NORP territory , there is also the intention to radicalise the NORP living here . Pressure should be exerted on emigrants who refuse to grant the expected support . Exhorting violence in general in order to implement NORP concerns will enhance the tendency also to employ violence towards compatriots living here who think differently . Such exhortation generally furthers extremist acts of violence . The writings therefore serve to endanger interior security . Since they are not at all limited to a criticism of the NORP authorities - this would be admissible - but also insult them , they also serve to jeopardise foreign relations and therefore the neutrality of GPE . ... In the present case , furthermore , it does not transpire that a less far reaching measure would have been possible in order to avoid endangering the interior and exterior security , all the more so as the exhortation to armed struggle can be found in all the publications and is not limited to certain parts which could , possibly , have been blacked out . \u201d", "PERSON ORG concerning propaganda materials endangering the State ( Bundesratsbeschluss betreffend staatsgef\u00e4hrliches PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE , in force until DATE , states :", "\u201c ORG is instructed , together with the Federal customs and postal authorities , to seise propaganda materials which serve to endanger the interior or exterior security of the ORG , in particular its independence , its neutrality , its relations with foreign GPE , the political and namely the democratic institutions of GPE or the interests of the defence of the country , as well as antireligious texts objects .", "The ORG shall decide on the confiscation . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
