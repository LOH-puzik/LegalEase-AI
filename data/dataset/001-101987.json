[ ... ] The allegations of a considerable discrepancy between PERSON . PERSON . \u2019s statements and the facts revealed by the corpse inspection record , pathologist \u2019s report and forensic expert \u2019s conclusion , are unsubstantiated . \u201d", "The appeal court rejected , as unfounded , the complaint about the lawyer \u2019s ineffectiveness , having observed , in particular , that the applicant had not objected to the lawyer \u2019s participation in the trial at earlier stages of the proceedings , had not requested another lawyer to represent him and had not complained to the trial court about any particular actions or omissions of the lawyer .", "On DATE the deputy Prosecutor General lodged an application for supervisory review with the Presidium of the Rostov ORG .
