FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Lack of jurisdiction (complaint inadmissible);No violation of Art. 7-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . PERSON , a driving test examiner , was charged on DATE with accepting bribes . It was alleged that he had issued driving licences in exchange for payment of a sum of money ( Article CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In the course of the investigation and following additional submissions from the prosecuting authority , the investigating judge charged him with \" corruption in the form of soliciting sexual favours \" and indecent assault with violence or coercion ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the person of P. , a driving test candidate . The investigating judge based the second charge on LAW as amended by LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was specifically alleged that PERSON had , on DATE , constrained a young woman who suffered from a slight mental handicap to submit to acts of buggery . At the material time such acts were classified as indecent assault rather than rape .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , CARDINAL of which were suspended , for accepting bribes as a citizen responsible for a public service and indecent assault with violence or coercion by a person in authority . In so doing , the court was applying the PERSON of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "ORG upheld that decision in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the latter judgment was quashed by ORG on the ground that no reply had been given to the pleas of nullity . The case was remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE that court rejected the pleas of nullity . It dismissed the charge of corruption in the form of soliciting sexual favours , but found the applicant guilty of accepting bribes and of indecent assault with coercion and abuse of authority . It reduced his sentence to DATE imprisonment by virtue of PERSON no . DATE of DATE , whose entry into force postdated the commission of the offences in question ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law with ORG . The fourth and last ground of this appeal was formulated as follows :", "\" Violation of LAW and the Citizen , of ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW as applicable to the alleged offences and LAW , failure to state reasons and lack of a legal basis ; In so far as the impugned judgment found the defendant guilty of indecent assault on the person of P. on DATE ;", "...", "Before the entry into force of Law no . DATE of DATE , under LAW the offence of indecent assault with coercion was not committed where no violence had been practised on the person who had been the object of that coercion ; no one may be convicted in respect of acts which the law did not regard as an offence before they were carried out and the alleged indecent assault with coercion of which the appellant is accused did not , at the material time , constitute any criminal offence ; nor did the mental deficiency of the ` victim ' constitute an aggravating circumstance . The acts in question could not therefore be punished under this head . By ruling as it did , ORG violated the principle that no act may be classified as a punishable offence unless the law makes prior provision to that effect . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It explained its rejection of the above - mentioned ground in the following terms :", "\" The finding of guilt on the count [ of accepting bribes ] justified the sentence imposed ; in accordance with LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] it is therefore unnecessary to rule on the fourth ground of appeal put forward by the appellant . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Article QUANTITY of LAW is worded as follows :", "\" Anyone who has solicited or accepted offers or promises , solicited or received gifts or presents shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of from DATE and a fine equal to double the value of the promises accepted or the articles received or requested , such fine not being less than ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , where he has done so", "QUANTITY as a person holding elected office , being a public servant in the administrative or judicial branch of the civil service , a member of the armed forces or having equivalent status , the agent or representative of a public administrative authority or of an administrative authority placed under the control of the public authorities or a citizen responsible for a public service , in return for performing or refraining from performing CARDINAL of his duties or CARDINAL of the tasks attaching to his post , whether fair or not , but not covered by his salary . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The relevant provisions of LAW were as follows :", "\" Any indecent assault committed or attempted without violence on the person of a child of either sex under DATE shall be punished by DATE imprisonment .", "The same penalty shall be imposed in respect of indecent assault by any relative in the ascending line carried out on the person of a minor , even if the victim is aged DATE provided that he or she is unmarried .", "Without prejudice to the more severe penalties laid down in the foregoing paragraphs or in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the present Code , whosoever shall commit an indecent or unnatural act with a person of the same sex aged less than DATE shall be punished by DATE imprisonment and a fine of between ORG and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . \"", "\" Whosoever shall commit the crime of rape shall be sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "If the offence has been committed on the person of a child not having fully attained DATE , the offender shall receive the maximum penalty available .", "Whosoever shall commit or attempt to commit indecent assault with violence on individuals of either sex shall be sentenced to CARDINAL ' imprisonment .", "If the crime has been committed on the person of a child not having fully attained DATE , the offender shall be sentenced to between QUANTITY and DATE imprisonment . \"", "\" If the offenders are relatives in the ascending line of the person on whom the indecent assault was carried out , if they belong to the class of those who have authority over that person , if they are his or her schoolteachers or hired servants , or hired servants of the above - mentioned persons , if they are officials or ministers of a religion , or if the offender , whoever he may be , was assisted in his offence by CARDINAL or more persons , the penalty shall be between CARDINAL and DATE imprisonment in the case provided for in the first paragraph of Article CARDINAL and life imprisonment in the cases provided for in DATE . \"", "As there was no statutory definition of the notions of rape and indecent assault , the case - law delimited the scope of those terms . Thus coercion or non - physical violence has been treated as equivalent to physical violence . Consequently the offences were constituted where they had been committed without the victim 's consent ( see judgments of ORG of DATE , Bulletin no . CARDINAL ; of DATE , Bulletin no . CARDINAL ; of DATE , Bulletin no . CARDINAL ; of DATE , Bulletin no . CARDINAL ; and of CARDINAL DATE , Bulletin no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

They now read as follows :", "\" Any act of sexual penetration , of whatever nature , committed on the person of another by violence , coercion or by taking the victim unawares shall constitute rape . Rape shall be punished by DATE imprisonment . However , rape shall be punished by DATE imprisonment where it has been committed either on a person who was especially vulnerable owing to pregnancy , sickness , infirmity or physical or mental deficiency , or on a person under DATE , or with the threatened use of a weapon , or by CARDINAL or more assailants or accomplices , or by a legitimate , natural or adoptive ascendant of the victim or by a person in a position of authority over the victim or by a person who has abused the authority conferred by his duties . \"", "\" Any other indecent assault committed or attempted with violence , coercion or by taking the victim unawares on a person other than a minor under DATE shall be punished by DATE imprisonment and a fine of between FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL and FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL or by one of these penalties alone .", "However , indecent assault as defined in the first paragraph shall be punished by DATE imprisonment and a fine of between ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL or one of these penalties alone where it was committed or attempted either against a person who was particularly vulnerable owing to sickness , infirmity or physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy , or with the threatened use of a weapon , or by a legitimate , natural or adoptive ascendant of the victim or by a person in a position of authority over the victim , or by CARDINAL or more assailants or accomplices , or by a person who has abused the authority conferred on him by his duties . \"", "The new law downgraded the offence of indecent assault from serious offence ( crime ) to less serious offence ( d\u00e9lit ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that \" in the event of conviction for several serious offences and less serious offences , only the heaviest penalty available for one of the individual offences shall be imposed \" . This principle that sentences are not to be imposed consecutively is part of the basis for the doctrine of justified penalty laid down in LAW , according to which :", "\" Where the penalty imposed is the same as that which would be imposed under the law that applies to the offence , any application to have the judgment quashed on the basis that there has been an error in the citation of the relevant provision shall fail . \"", "Thus ORG will declare the operative part of a judgment imposing a sentence to be justified where the sentence imposed is identical to that which the trial court would have ordered if the error of classification had not been committed . Where the appellant has been convicted of several offences , the court will not examine the ground based on the error and directed against CARDINAL of the offences if the penalty imposed is justified by the other offences ( see judgments of ORG DATE , Bulletin no .
