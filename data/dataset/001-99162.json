On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG filed a bill of indictment against the applicant , charging him under Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL , DATE ( CARDINAL ) , DATE and CARDINAL of the former Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation and armed robbery .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the judgment of ORG . The public prosecutor did not lodge an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG , finding that the classification of the applicant 's offence had been erroneous .

The applicant was consequently tried afresh before ORG . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant under LAW for attempting to undermine the constitutional order and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment .

On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment arguing , inter alia , that his acquired rights had not been protected . He maintained that , although the sentence imposed by ORG in its second judgment had been lower than that originally imposed , under the latter he would have been conditionally released pursuant to PERSON no . DATE after DATE , thus actually serving a shorter sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the reasoning in the judgment of ORG , and dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Following the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on DATE , ORG reopened the proceedings against the applicant in order to review his sentence , pursuant to the provisions of the new LAW . As an interim measure , on DATE the applicant was conditionally released pending the outcome of the proceedings . On DATE ORG found that the provisions of the former criminal code were more favourable to the applicant and therefore decided not to apply the provisions of the new LAW . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . In the meantime , following his release , the applicant fled to GPE , where he currently resides .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the former Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that , upon an appeal lodged solely by the accused , or by the prosecutor for the benefit of the accused , the new judgment may not impose a sentence which is more severe than that which was imposed originally ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
