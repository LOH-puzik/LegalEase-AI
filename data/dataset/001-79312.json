By judgment of DATE , it ordered the applicant to refrain from repeating the statement that the teachers were applying pressure on the pupils and parents to an intolerable extent and that this amounted in fact to an abuse of their authority . It noted that the statement was an insult and a defamation within the meaning of LAW . The applicant had to accept the most unfavourable interpretation of this statement which meant that the teachers had used unlawful and unobjective means in order to make parents and pupils agree to the boycott measures . The applicant had , however , failed to submit any evidence to prove this reproach . The court noted that it was true that , in the course of time the atmosphere between the pupils and teachers at the PERSON secondary school had been strained . The spokesperson of the pupils had complained that the teachers did not take her seriously and avoided any discussion about the boycott measures with her . She had , therefore , resigned from her function as spokesperson . The court further observed that the conflicting interests of teachers , parents and pupils in regard to the boycott measures naturally caused tensions . There was , however , no indication that the teachers had used unlawful and unobjective means , such as , for example , the use of their authority to assign marks , in order to make the parents and pupils agree to the compromise . It was , on the contrary , because of the teachers ' unbending attitude concerning the boycott measures that pupils and parents had finally resigned and agreed to the compromise .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the teachers ' further request for an injunction as regards the applicant 's statement that the conflict was detrimental to the pupils .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision . He submitted inter alia that he had alluded to the subtle measures the teachers had employed in order to reach a compromise , such as their threat to boycott the meeting of ORG and their tactics to undermine the authority of the pupils ' spokesperson . This was contrary to their official duties and , therefore , unlawful . He further referred their successful tactics to delay the meeting of ORG , the testimony of some pupils who had stated that they had felt under pressure and the fact that , in the context of the discussions concerning the boycott measures , both the pupils ' spokesperson and the chair of the parents ' association had resigned from their functions . The statement at issue was a value judgment with sufficient factual basis and was protected by his right to freedom of expression under LAW . From the context of the situation in which the statements had been made , it was clear that he had referred to the pressure which had led to the signing of a compromise . Neither the concerned pupils , nor the parents had understood his criticism to the effect that the teachers had applied psychical or verbal violence or had applied pressure by their authority to assign marks . Furthermore , the teachers had themselves attracted the attention of the public by their boycott measures which had provoked criticism and resistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted that the statement at issue constituted a statement of fact susceptible of proof . The applicant had failed to prove that the statement was true .
