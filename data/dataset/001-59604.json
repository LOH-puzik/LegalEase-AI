On DATE the applicant married Mr PERSON in a religious ceremony which was also valid in the eyes of the law ( matrimonio concordatario ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG for judicial separation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE ORG granted her petition and also ordered Mr PERSON to pay the applicant maintenance ( mantenimento ) of MONEY per month .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was summoned to appear before ORG of the Rome Vicariate on DATE \u201c to answer questions in the PERSON matrimonial case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went alone to ORG without knowing why she had been summoned to appear . She was informed that on DATE her husband had sought to have the marriage annulled on the ground of consanguinity ( the applicant \u2019s mother and Mr PERSON \u2019s father being cousins ) . She was questioned by the judge and stated that she had known of her consanguineous relationship with Mr PERSON but did not know whether , at the time of her marriage , the priest had requested a special dispensation ( dispensatio ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE and deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG annulled the marriage on the ground of consanguinity . The court had followed a summary procedure ( praetermissis solemnitatibus processus ordinarii ) under LAW of the Code of Canon Law . That procedure is followed where , once the parties have been summoned to appear and the defensor vinculis ( defender of the institution of marriage ) has intervened , it is clear from an agreed document that there is a ground for annulling the marriage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was notified by the registry of ORG that on DATE the court had annulled the marriage on the ground of consanguinity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with the Roman Rota ( Romana Rota ) against ORG judgment . She submitted first that she had never received a copy of the judgment in question and complained that the court had not heard her submissions until DATE , which was after it had delivered its judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant also alleged a breach of her defence rights and of the adversarial principle on account of the fact that she had been summoned to appear before ORG without being informed in advance either of the application to have the marriage annulled or the reasons for that application . She had therefore not prepared any defence and , furthermore , had not been assisted by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the registry of ORG informed the applicant that there had been a clerical error in the notification sent to her on DATE and that the judgment was dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defensor vinculis submitted observations to the effect that the applicant \u201c had acted correctly in appealing against the judgment \u201d ( la convenuta ORG agito giustamente facendo appello contro la sentenza ) of ORG . Accordingly , in a summons of CARDINAL DATE the reporting judge of the Rota summoned the parties and the defensor vinculis to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that the ORG would examine her appeal on DATE and that she had DATE in which to submit observations . On DATE the applicant , who was still unassisted by a lawyer , submitted her observations , in which she complained , inter alia , that she had not had adequate time and facilities for the preparation of her defence . She gave details of the financial arrangements between herself and her ex - husband and stressed that the annulment of the marriage would have substantial repercussions on her ex - husband \u2019s obligation to pay her maintenance , which was her only source of income .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was deposited with the registry on DATE , the Rota upheld the decision annulling the marriage on the ground of consanguinity . The applicant received only the operative provisions of the judgment , her request for a full copy of it having been refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant and her ex - husband that its judgment , which had become enforceable by a decision of the superior ecclesiastical review body , had been referred to ORG for a declaration that it could be enforced under NORP law ( delibazione ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s ex - husband summoned her to appear before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared before that court and requested it to set aside the DATE \u2019s judgment for infringing her defence rights . She stated that she had not received a copy of the application to have the marriage annulled and had been unable to examine the documents filed in the proceedings , including the observations of the defensor vinculis . She requested the court to refuse to declare the ORG \u2019s judgment enforceable , submitting that , in any event , the proceedings would have to be reopened in order to allow her to examine and reply to the documents filed in the proceedings under canon law . She requested , in the alternative , in the event that the court should declare the judgment enforceable , that her ex - husband be ordered to pay her DATE maintenance for the rest of her life .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG declared the judgment of CARDINAL DATE enforceable . The court found that the opportunity given to the applicant on DATE to answer questions had been sufficient to ensure that the adversarial principle had been complied with and that , moreover , she had freely chosen to bring the proceedings before the ORG and had been able to exercise her defence rights in those proceedings \u201c irrespective of the special features of proceedings under canon law \u201d . The court went on to hold that it did not have jurisdiction to award her maintenance \u201c for the rest of her life \u201d ; as far as a possible award of interim maintenance ( assegno provvisorio ) was concerned , which was a provisional arrangement , the court pointed out that the applicant had not in any event proved that she needed the money .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , repeating her submission that her defence rights had been infringed in the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts . She submitted , among other things , that ORG had omitted to take account of the following features of the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts : the parties can not be represented by a lawyer ; the respondent is not informed of the reasons relied on by the petitioner for having the marriage annulled until he or she is questioned ; the defensor vinculis , who acts as the respondent \u2019s guardian , is not obliged to lodge an appeal ; an appeal must be lodged personally by the party in question and not by their lawyer ; the ecclesiastical court is not particularly autonomous . She repeated that she had not been informed in detail of the application to have the marriage annulled or of the possibility of being assisted by a lawyer . Furthermore , the proceedings at first instance had been too quick . The applicant also criticised the fact that ORG appeared to have omitted to examine the case file relating to the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts , which might have yielded evidence in the applicant \u2019s favour . Besides that , the applicant submitted that she had shown herself to be in financial need and was therefore entitled to maintenance .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant had requested the registry of ORG to give her a copy of the documents filed in the annulment proceedings in order to produce them before ORG , but the court clerk had refused to grant her request on the ground that the parties could receive only the operative provisions of the judgment , \u201c which should be sufficient to allow them to exercise their defence rights \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . It held , first of all , that the adversarial principle had been complied with in the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts ; moreover , there was case - law authority to support the view that while the assistance of a lawyer was not a requirement under canon law , it was not forbidden : the applicant could therefore have taken advantage of that possibility . The court also held that the fact that the applicant had had a very short time in which to prepare her defence in DATE did not amount to an infringement of her defence rights because she had not indicated why she had needed more time . With regard to the request for maintenance , ORG held that ORG could not have decided otherwise , given that the applicant had mistakenly referred to maintenance \u201c for the rest of her life \u201d and , furthermore , had failed to show that she was entitled to maintenance and needed it . ORG did not rule on the fact that the case file relating to the proceedings under canon law had not been examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant \u2019s ex - husband ceased paying her maintenance . The applicant therefore began enforcement proceedings for payment of the maintenance by serving notice ( precetto ) on him to pay it . On DATE her ex - husband lodged an objection with ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld his objection and ruled that he no longer had to pay maintenance because ORG had declared that the decision annulling the marriage was enforceable . The applicant did not appeal against that judgment because on DATE she reached an agreement with her ex - husband ( under the terms of that agreement she also withdrew another set of proceedings that she had instituted in the ORG claiming joint title to property ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the ORG between GPE and the FAC , as amended by the Agreement of DATE revising the ORG , ratified by GPE under PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , a judgment of the ecclesiastical courts annulling a marriage , which has become enforceable by a decision of the superior ecclesiastical review body , may be made enforceable in GPE at the request of CARDINAL of the parties by a judgment of the relevant court of appeal .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal must check :", "( a ) that the judgment has been delivered by the correct court ;", "( b ) that in the nullity proceedings the defence rights of the parties have been recognised in a manner compatible with the fundamental principles of NORP law ; and", "( c ) that the other conditions for a declaration of enforceability of foreign judgments have been satisfied ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
