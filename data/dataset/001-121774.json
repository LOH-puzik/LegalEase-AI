Once the applicant had returned to GPE , he filed a criminal complaint under LAW , alleging that his wife was detaining GPE in GPE without his consent .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant moved to GPE . On DATE he travelled to GPE to visit his son . He alleged that A. \u2019s health and social conditions had worsened . On DATE father and son travelled together to GPE . On DATE joined them . On DATE they all travelled to GPE to pay a visit to PERSON \u2019s family . On DATE , M. and A. \u201c disappeared \u201d . The applicant eventually found out that they had returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided not to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON , as there was insufficient evidence to establish a punishable offence . The applicant contested the afore - mentioned decision on DATE . It appears that a district court dismissed the challenge as unfounded on DATE . The applicant filed an appeal with a higher court . No further information has been provided in relation to these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Minister of ORG , designated by GPE as ORG responsible for discharging the duties imposed on GPE by LAW of DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW ) . He asked the Minister to assist him in securing the return of his son , whom the child \u2019s mother had , he alleged , wrongfully removed to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the steps undertaken by the NORP and NORP authorities in accordance with the provisions of LAW , ORG initiated return proceedings before ORG ( Tribunale per i minorenni ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place in the applicant \u2019s presence .", "The following appears from the hand - written proc\u00e8s - verbal submitted by the Government .", "Following statements by the applicant and PERSON , the president of the court noted the existence of divorce proceedings brought by PERSON in GPE , together with an application for custody of the child ( objected to by the applicant ) , which were still pending . He further noted that while the couple had cohabited from DATE until DATE , the applicant had often been absent during DATE as he had been working in GPE .", "PERSON submitted that until DATE the parents had been in agreement on the whereabouts of the child , particularly in view of her employment in GPE and the fact that the child had obtained a residence permit there , started attending school and was being seen by the social and community health services . PERSON argued that according to changes in NORP law she had not needed to extend the [ validity of the ] notarial deed ( mentioned above ) to subsequent DATE . She claimed that the child had previously had health problems and that his father had always known where they were . PERSON asked the court to admit in evidence a psychologist \u2019s report on the child \u2019s conditions and submitted written pleadings accompanied by evidence substantiating her claim .", "The applicant submitted that the notarial deed between him and PERSON had only given consent to A. travelling to GPE for tourist purposes for the period DATE and thus he had not consented to the child \u2019s removal after that . In the absence of a custody decision the child could have lived with him in GPE , instead of in GPE with his mother without his consent . However , PERSON had failed to consent to this , despite the fact that he could give the child a better standard of living . He explained that he had tried to reach a friendly settlement , but when this had appeared impossible he had pressed charges against PERSON and those proceedings were still pending . Only at DATE had PERSON agreed to take the child back to GPE following a medical visit , which the applicant had insisted upon and which had found that the child was in poor health .", "ORG asked the court to accept the return application , noting that the child had possibly been in GPE for DATE and making reference to LAW . He further asked the court to order a report on the child \u2019s psychological condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the NORP Minister of Justice , informing him of the conduct of the hearing . The applicant explained that he had not been given the opportunity to challenge the statements made by his wife \u2019s attorney , in particular regarding : ( i ) the time it had taken the applicant to institute proceedings after the date of the wrongful removal or retention of the child , which according to the applicant had been DATE and not \u2013 as the court had assumed DATE ; the result of the court using the latter date was that LAW came into play , to the effect that after a period of DATE a child may not be returned if he has integrated into society ; ( ii ) the contention that the child \u2019s health and psychological problems were imputable to the time he had spent with his father before moving to GPE , which finding had been based on medical documents to which the applicant had had no access ; ( iii ) the allegation that PERSON had had his consent up to CARDINAL DATE , the date on which such consent was no longer necessary ( GPE having joined ORG ) , thus ignoring the notarial deed , which had stated a specific period of consent ; and ( iv ) the fact that PERSON had changed their son \u2019s residence without his father \u2019s consent , as required by law . The applicant further explained that ORG was considering custody issues in violation of its competence under LAW , custody issues being within the exclusive competence of the courts of the country of domicile , GPE . It would , moreover , not decide the case until the NORP courts had made a decision in the divorce and custody proceedings . He further contested the evaluation of the potential harm for the child in the event of his return to GPE which had been made by the social services , stating that it had only made reference to the biased account of the child \u2019s mother , without any direct evaluation of the relationship between father and son and of the social environment if A. were to live in GPE . The applicant asked the Minister to forward his letter to the competent authority in GPE and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , filed with the court registry on DATE , ORG refused the application for return . It noted that divorce and custody proceedings were still pending in GPE ; that PERSON had claimed that she and the child had lived in GPE since DATE ; and that since DATE had been known to ORG ( \u201c NPI \u201d ) of ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) . Moreover , it noted that PERSON had claimed to have had the required permission from her husband to keep the child in GPE in accordance with a notarial deed of DATE and that the applicant had contested this on the basis that he had only given permission for A. to travel to GPE for tourist purposes , and that , albeit he had moved to GPE in DATE , he wanted the child to be with him . In that light , the court considered that there were no grounds for returning PERSON and that , in view of the relevant international law , it could not be held that the mother had arbitrarily taken PERSON away from his father as legitimate custodian of the child . ORG noted that the NORP authorities had not yet taken a decision on custody , thus the parents had joint custody , and therefore the applicant did not have exclusive custody rights . Moreover , the applicant had consented to ORG \u2019s transfer to GPE and had eventually moved to GPE . Furthermore , ORG observed that the child had been in GPE for DATE and was integrated into NORP society , albeit with some problems . In this light , the court considered that psychological harm would ensue as a result of his return . Thus it was not obliged , according to LAW , to order his return . Indeed , from the social services report ordered by the court , it appeared that A. had arrived at the ORG \u2019s premises , accompanied by his mother , on the advice of his general practitioner and that since then A. had been subject to psychotherapy which included joint interviews with his mother . The doctor entrusted with the report had noted that the need for ORG \u2019s psychotherapeutic treatment was due to early and prolonged periods of separation from his parents , frequent changes of residence , and continuous parental conflict . It was therefore necessary to give NORP reference points and DATE routines . Overall , his psychological condition had been improving , save for a worrying regression following his return from GPE and GPE in DATE , from which he had recovered .", "The decision was notified to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities informed the NORP authorities about ORG decision of DATE , filed with the court registry on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The following day , ORG informed the applicant of the above and that it had requested further information on the final date to lodge the appeal on points of law and on the applicant \u2019s ability to obtain legal aid .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant repeatedly contacted ORG to obtain the response to those queries , together with the documents which would have allowed him to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forwarded to its NORP counterpart the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid in order to file an appeal on points of law . The application for legal aid was filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant legal aid to file an appeal , indicating ORG as the competent court and not ORG .
