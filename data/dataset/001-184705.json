On DATE the GPE - ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand on suspicion of drug dealing , as well as facilitating and benefiting from prostitution , committed in an organised criminal group . The domestic court relied on a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question , on the fact that he faced a severe penalty and that he was suspected of acting with accomplices . The likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question was established , in particular , on the basis of the testimony of a key prosecution witness ( the so - called \u201c crown witness \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision . It stressed that the sole fact that the applicant faced a severe penalty and had been suspected of committing offences in an organised criminal group justified a suspicion that , if released , the applicant would try to obstruct the proceedings by influencing witnesses or his accomplices .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention on remand was extended by ORG on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In these decisions , the court repeated the reasons originally relied on .

The domestic courts continued to rely on the same grounds for detention as in their previous decisions .

On CARDINAL DATE the trial court ordered the applicant \u2019s release on bail for MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .
