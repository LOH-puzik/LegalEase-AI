In GPE , school attendance is compulsory for all children DATE . For DATE , children attend primary school ( DATE ) . The following DATE are spent in the first cycle of secondary school ( DATE to CARDINAL) . After that , pupils spend a further DATE in school , depending on the subjects chosen , in an upper secondary school ( lise ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants asked ORG to initiate a consultation process with Alevi faith leaders with a view to overhauling the syllabus for religious culture and ethics classes and including Alevi culture and philosophy .", "They also requested the introduction of compulsory training for teachers of these classes and the setting - up of a monitoring and supervisory mechanism . They cited in that regard extracts from monitoring reports prepared by ORG which were critical of the content and the compulsory nature of the religious culture and ethics classes .", "CARDINAL . In its reply of DATE ORG of ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) stated that , in the textbooks used in religious culture and ethics lessons in the primary cycle , priority was given to the teaching of ethical and religious values common to society as a whole . As to the content of the classes at secondary level , the ORG stated that , while respecting the same principles , the syllabus took a supradenominational approach ( mezhepler \u00fcst\u00fc ) and that the religious culture and ethics textbooks also presented other understandings of ORG . It added that the syllabus for the DATE had been drawn up on the basis of this supra - denominational approach , which according to the ORG was centred on the Koran , did not favour any particular branch of ORG and respected the principle of secularism . ORG also mentioned that the syllabus for DATE ( DATE of upper secondary school ) featured public figures who had been important in shaping the NORP understanding of NORP , while the syllabus for DATE explained the different interpretations of ORG , and the Year CARDINAL syllabus contained a wealth of information on PERSON ( bekta\u015fi ) culture . In the same letter , the ORG further specified that teacher training had been introduced ahead of the entry into effect of the new syllabus . Lastly , it observed that topics relating to the Alevi faith had been included in the religious culture and ethics syllabus for secondary schools for DATE .", "CARDINAL . After receiving the letter from ORG rejecting their proposal , the applicants and CARDINAL other people challenged the ORG \u2019s decision in ORG . Referring to the ORG \u2019s caselaw on the subject , they argued that the teaching provided in religious culture and ethics lessons could not be said to satisfy the criteria of objectivity and pluralism . In support of their argument they presented CARDINAL reports drawn up by various experts who had studied the textbooks used for the subject . Referring to the findings of those reports , they maintained that the textbooks in question provided instruction based on a \u201c NORP \u201d interpretation of ORG and could by no means be regarded as neutral vis\u00e0vis other interpretations of ORG . They relied in particular on LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG appointed of its own motion a committee of CARDINAL experts tasked with drawing up a report on the teaching provided in the context of religious culture and ethics classes .", "CARDINAL .

The report stated in substance as follows .", "( i ) For the purposes of the study the experts had examined the religious culture and ethics textbooks used in schools by DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE as authorised by ORG . The religious culture and ethics syllabus for primary schools had been adopted by a decision of DATE of ORG attached to ORG and had been introduced in DATE to replace the previous syllabus of DATE . The new secondary syllabus had come into effect following a decision of DATE . The textbooks criticised by the applicants had therefore been prepared under the earlier syllabus .", "( ii ) The textbooks were structured around CARDINAL main themes : religious culture , ethics and national and spiritual values . The parts concerning ethics and national and spiritual values covered topics common to all citizens . The part concerning religious culture had been drafted using a supradenominational approach centred on fundamental concepts such as the Koran and the LANGUAGE ( PERSON ) , and did not favour any particular branch of ORG .", "( iii ) The syllabus did not give precedence to any particular faith . On the contrary , the textbooks reflected a supra - denominational approach . The syllabus observed the principle of objectivity and did not give priority to any faith or any religious group . The textbooks and the syllabus were designed to deliver information on ORG using pedagogical methods .", "( iv ) The use of the religious culture and ethics textbooks written by PERSON and PERSON for DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE had been discontinued in DATE following the changes to the syllabus .

In the course of preparing the school textbooks and choosing the topics relating to the Alevi faith , worship and ethics , extensive recourse had been had to publications written by prominent PERSON .", "( vi ) While the teaching of religion as such took account of the precepts of the Koran and the life of the prophet PERSON , the other interpretations of ORG were covered in the context of cultural information . Hence , the textbooks provided information on ORG , NORP ( caferilik ) , PERSON ( hanefilik ) , Shafism ( \u015fafilik ) , Shiism ( \u015fiilik ) and the NORP movements . They also provided teaching on the foundations of NORP and in particular the CARDINAL prayers , pilgrimage , charity and sacrifice . CARDINAL pages were devoted to the Alevi faith .", "( vii ) In conclusion , the report recommended the addition of references to certain aspects of the Alevi faith , for instance festivals , and specified that the cemevi was a place of cultural exchange for ORG rather than a place of worship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants contested the expert report and filed additional pleadings . They submitted that the teaching that was provided focused on the NORP interpretation of NORP and that the Alevi faith was presented in summary fashion . Providing examples , they argued that much of the information presented contained errors . In particular , they claimed that the symbols linked to their faith had been ignored and that the mosque was presented as the NORP place of worship . They asserted that certain NORP rituals , namely the prayers or Salat ( namaz ) and ablutions ( abdest ) were imposed and were presented according to the NORP interpretation of NORP . They also complained that the experts had denied that the cemevi was the LOC place of worship . They criticised the Year CARDINAL textbook , in which the main rituals of ORG were reportedly listed as Salat , fasting , pilgrimage and charity , arguing that the information provided was confined to the NORP interpretation of ORG , whereas , in their view , a theological debate was under way as to how Salat should be performed . Lastly , they alleged that the textbooks in question treated the Alevi faith as a tradition or culture rather than as a fully - fledged faith .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 claims on the ground that the refusal of their request by the respondent authorities had conformed to the relevant legislation . The court referred to the findings of the report on the teaching of religious culture and ethics ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , taking the view that religious subjects were dealt with using a supra - denominational approach in the textbooks for both the old and the new syllabus . The court considered that the principle of State neutrality had thus been respected and that the new topics had been chosen taking into account the country \u2019s educational needs .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the firstinstance judgment .", "CARDINAL .
