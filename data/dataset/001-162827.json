SAN MARINO", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Kristina Pardalos;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr F. Cocco , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant , a police superintendent , lodged a criminal complaint for defamation against a newspaper and a journalist , as well as PERSON the elected chief of the administrative district of PERSON ( Capitano di Castello ) ( who had given an interview to the newspaper ) , in connection with press articles which were published on DATE and DATE . The articles claimed that , inter alia , a policeman ( a title presumably traceable to the applicant ) was fraudulently obtaining benefits from the ORG , including the use of a ORG apartment , despite it being needed by other persons .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the articles , the administrative body in question removed the apartment from the applicant \u2019s possession . According to the applicant , the articles questioned his morality \u2013 they cast doubts over whether rent and service charges had been paid , hypothesised as to whether other benefits were also being enjoyed by the applicant , and posed questions regarding the possibility of the applicant \u2019s involvement in other minor fraud infractions , even though , according to the applicant , such infractions were common in lease contracts . The last article also focused on the applicant \u2019s profession and , in his view , was written in a manner intended to bring him into disrepute . Moreover , it was not based on the truth in so far as no substantiation was given to the allegations that the applicant was not wanted for the post of commander of the police brigade ; or that that there had been friction between him and the citizens of GPE ; or that some persons had in fact complained about the applicant , as had been claimed by PERSON in the interview .", "CARDINAL . Prior to this last article and following the first CARDINAL articles the applicant had written to various media outlets with a statement in his defence clarifying his situation . He also clarified the situation regarding the apartment that was the subject of the articles , which was in his possession by title of lease . The entirety of the applicant \u2019s statement was published , together with comments by the journalist who authored the press articles , in the third above - mentioned article .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings ORG were instituted against the abovementioned persons and testimony was heard from the applicant , the journalist and other witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge ( Commissario della PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) requested that criminal proceedings ORG be archived . The PERSON recalled the importance of freedom of expression , noting that this was not however unlimited and could be curtailed in view of the dignity , honour and reputation of other persons . Having regard to the principles derived from the right to freedom of expression , the articles complained of were not offensive , and thus could not be subject to criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON considered that neither the title ( \u201c A PERSON abita l\u2019ultimo giapponese \u201d \u2013 \u201c The last NORP living in GPE ) nor the content of the first article contained any criminally relevant statement . The applicant had confirmed that , as mentioned in the beginning of the article , he had lived in an apartment provided by the ORG situated in the cultural centre ( centro sociale ) of GPE . The PERSON authorities ( through PERSON ) had also confirmed that an application had been lodged to regain possession of the property ( as mentioned in the central part of the article ) . As to the questions posed in the last part of the article ( namely , concerning the rent of the apartment and the fact that a family was living in a cultural centre built for other purposes , and so forth ) , the subject matter was CARDINAL of public interest and the formulation of the questions appeared to be correct and did not exceed the limits of the exercise of journalistic functions . The same was valid for the second article ( called \u201c PERSON dello Stato , per i cittadini bisogna vederci chiaro \u201d \u2013 \u201c Clarification needed for the citizens on ORG - owned apartments \u201d ) which reconstructed the historical context in DATE , explaining the existence of an anti - drug unit and an anti - drug squad , and reiterated the content of the previous article . Nor was the third article , which contained an interview with PERSON , as well as the applicant \u2019s letter and a comment by the journalist and a third person , subject to any criminal liability . The article had not related to \u201c eviction \u201d as mentioned by the applicant , but correctly to the authorities\u2019 decision to have the apartment reassigned to someone else , a procedure which did not require the intervention of the applicant . Similarly the applicant \u2019s confused challenge to a reference to an anti - drug dog could not be upheld since the comment \u2013 to the effect that it had made sense for the applicant to benefit from the use of the apartment at the time when a canine squad existed , but no longer now that the squad had been disbanded \u2013 reflected reality and was a reserved statement . Lastly , the adjective sbroccato ( a person who lost it ) , which was DATE a term of general use ( sdoganato ) could not be considered defamatory , as the term was not offensive or intimidating . Any other considerations put forward by the applicant appeared to refer to disagreements within the police department , which even if they were true do not appear to be relevant to the present case .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON considered that as the information was true and in the general interest , the articles fell within the legitimate exercise of the right to information . Moreover , the applicant had been given a right of reply , and a faithful reproduction of his statement had been published in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON considered that a balance had to be reached between both constitutionally guaranteed rights , specifically , on the one hand that of the honour , reputation and dignity of the individual , and on the other that of freedom of expression and of the press to impart information and for persons to receive information . \u201c Justification \u201d was the crux of the right to report news , thus abstract \u201c defamatory \u201d statements made within the requisite limits were licit and part and parcel of freedom of expression as long as they did not exceed the requisite limits and thus amount to abuse . The balance between the right to respect for the dignity , honour and privacy of the individual and that of freedom of expression was not subject to precise definition , even more so given that that freedom of expression may take various forms \u2013 including rapidly developing trends or changes in DATE which remain in any event subjective . Indeed , according to domestic case - law , it was a priori impossible to dictate the general limits between what was licit and what was not .", "CARDINAL . In the light of such principles , the PERSON considered that in the present case the articles had been justified in order to impart information on a matter of public interest , specifically in reference to a policeman , the use of public property and the involvement of the authorities . They had not been intended to offend anyone \u2019s honour . The content of the articles did not overstep the limits of free speech , and the sole fact that the articles may have inconvenienced the applicant did not suffice to make them amount to a criminal act of defamation ( the sole matter subject to the court \u2019s jurisdiction ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Attorney General agreed and on DATE the PERSON ordered that criminal proceedings ORG be archived on the basis of the above - mentioned reasoning , noting that there were no elements to issue a bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision ( opposizione ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE notified on CARDINAL DATE the judge of criminal appeals ordered that criminal proceedings ORG be archived , and rejected the applicant \u2019s objection as manifestly ill - founded . The judge noted that the applicant had reiterated his arguments without referring to the reasons given by the first - instance court , and ignoring the fact that the allegations made by the accused had been substantiated by documentary evidence . Further , the judge stated that the CARDINAL impugned articles had not offended the applicant \u2019s reputation . They questioned the use of ORG apartments without attributing to the applicant any particular untoward behaviour . They contained whole truths and , although the articles were written as a form of criticism , the applicant had had a right \u2013 which he made use of DATE to defend himself in the press . Lastly , PERSON had provided a copy of his correspondence with the authorities which related to the use of the apartment in question and in respect of which he had given an interview which had then been published . Thus , his actions had not been a gratuitous accusation but a supply of correct information concerning the applicant \u2019s activity and functions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
