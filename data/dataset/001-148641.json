In DATE ORG was informed by a person , to whom they had guaranteed confidentiality and whose identity had remained unknown throughout the proceedings , that the applicant was selling large amounts of amphetamine .", "CARDINAL . The LOC police therefore mandated another police informer , PERSON , who was equally guaranteed confidentiality by ORG and was supervised by police officer PERSON , to test the veracity of these allegations . S. visited the applicant in his motorbike shop on DATE and pretended being interested in buying a motorbike . He visited the applicant in the shop for the second time on DATE . On that occasion , the applicant told PERSON that a former member of his motorbike club \u201c NORP \u201d had cheated the club and offered PERSON euros ( ORG ) if he would beat up that person . When the applicant showed PERSON , who had disclosed his acquaintance with arms , his firearms and asked PERSON whether he could supply him with weapons , PERSON asked the applicant whether he could sell him amphetamine . The applicant asked in reply how much S. would need and what price he would be ready to pay . PERSON offered to pay LAW per kilogram of amphetamine of a good quality . The applicant agreed to the offer and handed over to S. a sample of amphetamine which he had stored in a drawer of his garage . On DATE S. again visited the applicant and offered purchasing QUANTITY of amphetamine from the applicant , in accordance with the instructions from his supervising police officer . The applicant agreed to sell that amount of drugs at a price of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . He had carried a loaded revolver during all of his meetings with S. and had threatened S. with the revolver once , accusing him of being a traitor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG authorised the participation of an undercover police officer , C. , supervised by police officer L. , in the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. bought QUANTITY of amphetamine for EUR CARDINAL from the applicant , who carried a loaded revolver during the transactions , handed it over to C. who was awaiting him at a different place and brought the money supplied by C. to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. again visited the applicant in his garage and told him that he would like to buy further drugs from him . The applicant thereupon asked PERSON whether he would need QUANTITY or more . S. ordered QUANTITY of amphetamine , in accordance with his instructions from police officer PERSON , and announced that he would need higher amounts of drugs in the future . The applicant agreed to the proposals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. again bought QUANTITY of amphetamine for EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL in the presence of C. from the applicant , who carried a loaded revolver during the transaction . As advised by police officer PERSON then asked the applicant to supply a larger amount of drugs . The applicant explained that he could supply MONEY S. wanted , CARDINAL or QUANTITY . S. thereupon ordered QUANTITY of amphetamine for which he was to pay EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. and C. bought the amount of amphetamine ordered from the applicant ; the drugs were supplied by B. The applicant was arrested after having handed over the drugs to S. and while collecting the money from C. The police further seized QUANTITY of amphetamine in the applicant \u2019s flat and numerous guns in his garage .", "CARDINAL . B. , having been informed of his right to remain silent , confirmed to the police after his arrest and subsequently before the investigating judge that he had participated in the drug transaction on DATE and supplied the amphetamine seized on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of drug trafficking in not insignificant amounts while carrying a weapon and another count of drug trafficking in not insignificant amounts and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG established the facts as summarized above ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . It further took note of the fact that the applicant , a full member of the motorbike club \u201c MC Bandidos Chapter NORP \u201d , had previously been convicted , in particular , by ORG of trafficking in drugs ( amphetamine ) on DATE and sentenced to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant and his co - accused PERSON had not made any submissions on the drug charges during the trial hearing . Its findings of fact were based on the credible statements made by PERSON to his supervising police officer PERSON and , in respect of the last offence , on the confession made by co - accused PERSON during the investigation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the hearing , ORG , having rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to hearing police officer PERSON as a witness , had questioned PERSON as a witness giving hearsay evidence on the observations made by police informer S. It had not been possible to summon and question S. in person as the GPE - Palatinate Ministry for the ORG had issued a declaration dated DATE , supplemented on DATE following the trial court \u2019s proposal of alternative methods of questioning , blocking the disclosure of his identity ( Sperrerkl\u00e4rung ) . These declarations , running to CARDINAL pages respectively , had been read out in the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry had argued in these declarations that it was necessary to keep the identities of police informer PERSON , and also of undercover police officer C. , secret in order to protect their life and limb and that of their relatives . In the ORG \u2019s submission , there was a high risk that the applicant would organise a violent revenge against them . He was a member of the motorbike club \u201c PERSON , LAW \u201d , which was well - organised worldwide and known for violent , ruthless acts against persons considered as traitors . Members of the motorbike club were currently suspected of involvement in homicides . The applicant , on whose premises a considerable number of firearms had been found , had himself offered PERSON CARDINAL,CARDINAL for assaulting a former member of the motorbike club who was suspected of having deceived the club in the course of business transactions . Further perpetrators who had been involved in the drug deal might equally possess firearms and had not been arrested yet . The disclosure of the identity of the police informer and of the well - trained undercover agent would further compromise the police \u2019s ability to investigate serious crimes with their help or that of other informers in the future .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry further stated that there were no means other than the non - disclosure of their identity for the Land to protect the physical integrity of the police informer and of the undercover agent . In particular , keeping their names or places of residence secret or excluding the public and the applicant during their interrogation in court would be insufficient to protect them , owing to the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyers and possibly of contact persons of the applicant observing the court building at DATE of the trial . ORG also rejected ORG proposal to have PERSON questioned by a commissioned judge outside the main hearing as the applicant \u2019s lawyers would be present during such a hearing and might pass on information to the applicant allowing the latter to detect S. \u2019s identity . Likewise , a video conference including acoustic and optical shielding , as equally proposed by ORG , could not exclude PERSON \u2019s and C. \u2019s identification by their figure , by their gestures and language used or by the disclosure of details permitting the detection of their identity in the course of questioning by the defence .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the reasons given in the ORG \u2019s declarations for the non - disclosure of ORG , and also C. \u2019s , identities were neither arbitrary nor obviously unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that police officer PERSON had questioned PERSON on DATE and had reported PERSON \u2019s statements in the hearing . It had then given the defence the opportunity to put questions to S. in writing . On DATE PERSON again questioned PERSON , submitting to him the court \u2019s questions and those of PERSON \u2019s defence counsel , and again reported PERSON \u2019s statements in court . Both police officer PERSON and PERSON \u2019s detailed statements without contradictions were credible , having regard also to the fact that it had only hearsay evidence before it . ORG noted , in particular , that the applicant had contested having carried a loaded revolver during the first CARDINAL transactions , claiming that the object in his pocket had been a multi - tool . It found that PERSON had already mentioned on DATE that the applicant had carried a weapon . When again being questioned by police officer PERSON on the court \u2019s request on DATE , PERSON had given more details in respect of the revolver and had convincingly explained when and how he had seen that it had been loaded , which demonstrated the veracity of his statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the statements made by the police informer could be used as evidence . Under the well - established case - law of ORG ( ORG referred to ORG , file no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , BGHSt CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the use of police informers was permitted to combat serious crimes which were difficult to investigate , such as drug trafficking . It was not relevant in that context whether the applicant had been incited by a police informer to commit an offence as , in any event , this would not lead to an exclusion of evidence . In that event , the court would only have to state in the reasons of its judgment that there had been a breach of the right to a fair trial under LAW and would have to mitigate the penalty as a result thereof .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that PERSON \u2019s submissions had been supported by considerable further circumstantial evidence . In particular , the nature and amount of drugs trafficked was proven as PERSON had handed the drugs in question over to the police immediately after the respective transactions . Moreover , in respect of the last offence , the applicant and PERSON had been caught in the act and arrested at the scene of the crime . Furthermore , PERSON had initially confessed to the ( third ) offence in the investigation proceedings and his statements had been reported in the hearing by the police officer and the investigating judge who had questioned him at the time .", "CARDINAL . Finally , both PERSON \u2019s confession and PERSON \u2019s statements concerning the second offence had been confirmed by the submissions made by undercover police officer C. to police officer PERSON who supervised him . PERSON had testified as a witness giving hearsay evidence in the hearing , the court having dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection to hearing him . The identity of C. had remained unknown as he had equally been covered by the ORG \u2019s declaration blocking a disclosure of his identity . The investigations by an undercover police officer had been lawful under ORG CARDINALa and QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see DATE below ) , as they had been authorised by ORG and ORG and had been indispensable in order to further investigate suspicions of drug trafficking by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . When fixing the sentence , ORG considered as aggravating factors the frequency of the offences as well as the applicant \u2019s prior conviction for drug trafficking . It took into account as mitigating elements that the drug transactions had been under police surveillance from the outset and that the drugs could not , therefore , freely circulate on the market . Moreover , the applicant had trafficked in so - called soft drugs of average quality only . Furthermore , the applicant was disabled at a rate of CARDINAL per cent and therefore particularly susceptible to suffer from detention .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view the applicant had not , however , been unduly incited by police informer S. to commit the offences in question , within the meaning of the case - law of ORG ( ORG again referred to ORG judgment of DATE , cited above , BGHSt CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . ) . The applicant had already been involved in drug trafficking and been predisposed to sell drugs prior to his meeting with the police informer . This was proven , in particular , by the fact that he had supplied PERSON with an amphetamine sample already when they discussed drug transactions for the first time . Moreover , he had indicated on that occasion that he could supply S. with larger amounts of drugs . ORG found in that context that the price offered by PERSON to the applicant ( LAW ) was the average price for a kilogram of amphetamine of average quality in the region . Furthermore , the applicant had previously been convicted of drug trafficking . As his offences had not therefore been the result of unlawful police incitement , there was no ground for mitigating the sentence on that account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . He claimed , in particular , that his right to a fair trial under LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW had been breached as he had been unable to cross - examine police informer PERSON and undercover agent C. , on whose submissions his conviction had essentially been based . Moreover , PERSON had unduly incited him to sell drugs . The evidence obtained by the incitement should therefore have been excluded at his trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against ORG judgment as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained , in particular , that the judgment of ORG , confirmed by ORG , had breached his right to a fair trial under LAW . He had been unduly incited by the prosecution authorities to commit the offences he had later been found guilty of . Therefore , the evidence obtained by police incitement should have been excluded at his trial ( he referred to ORG Human Right \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE to support his view ) . Moreover , throughout the proceedings , he had not had an opportunity to question the police informer and the undercover police officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
