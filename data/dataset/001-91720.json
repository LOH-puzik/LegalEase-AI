The kick - off of the match was scheduled for TIME to kick - off there was a huge build - up of supporters outside LOC entrance to the ground which in turn caused pressure on those trying to get into the ground through the turnstiles .", "At CARDINAL . Chief PERSON , who was the police officer in charge of crowd control at the match , decided to authorise the opening of the exit gates at the LOC entrance in order to relieve the pressure at the turnstiles . The opening of CARDINAL of the gates , gate C , resulted in a sudden influx of CARDINAL supporters into the ground , the majority of whom continued through a tunnel into the central spectator pens , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Each of these pens was capable of holding CARDINAL people but both were already full when the gate was opened . The result of the sudden influx was the build - up of intolerable pressure on supporters at the front of the pens .", "Notwithstanding the late arrival of supporters , Chief PERSON decided not to delay kick - off .

A statement from Police Constable ( \u201c PC \u201d ) ORG was also orally summarised at the mini - inquest . His evidence suggested that PERSON was possibly still alive after CARDINAL .

In reaching this view , the Coroner took into account the interim report of ORG . Counsel for CARDINAL of the families argued against the cut - off point , primarily on the ground that there was evidence to suggest that not all the victims were dead by ORG .
