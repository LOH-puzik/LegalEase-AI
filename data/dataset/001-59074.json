THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1 and 6-3-b", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant used to work as a general practitioner in GPE , the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE preliminary judicial investigations were initiated into allegations of forgery and fraud perpetrated by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the course of these investigations the applicant stated on his own initiative that in DATE he had performed euthanasia on , and at the request of , CARDINAL of his patients . However , he had stated to the municipal coroner ( gemeentelijk lijkschouwer ) that the patient had died from natural causes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to appear before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on the following charges :", "( CARDINAL ) principally : murder ; alternatively : taking another person 's life at that person 's request ;", "( CARDINAL ) in his capacity of physician , falsifying a death certificate as regards the cause of a person 's death ;", "( CARDINAL ) NORP falsifying prescriptions ;", "( CARDINAL ) forging and presenting prescriptions for the acquisition of an opiate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against the summons ( dagvaarding ) with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing in camera on DATE , ORG dismissed the objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public hearing took place before ORG , during which the case was considered on the merits . Both the applicant and his defence counsel , CARDINAL lawyers from the same law firm in GPE , were present . In their pleadings , counsel for the applicant raised the following points :", "( a ) the indictment was invalid ( it being argued that certain points were not set out in sufficient detail ) ;", "( b ) the prosecution case was inadmissible ( the argument being that the use of far - reaching measures such as a house search and pre - trial detention was excessive and unlawful ) ;", "( c ) the obligation incumbent on physicians to report cases of euthanasia themselves , thus exposing themselves to the risk of criminal punishment , ran counter to LAW ;", "( d ) the evidence had been obtained unlawfully ;", "( e ) the prescriptions had only been forged in part , not in their entirety ;", "( f ) the applicant had confessed to euthanasia , which precluded a conviction of the more serious crime of murder ;", "( g ) there was a defence of force majeure in respect of the charges of euthanasia and forging the death certificate ;", "( h ) the applicant had not acted culpably ;", "( i ) in the event of a conviction , no sentence should be imposed as the applicant had suffered enough already as a result of the proceedings ( which had destroyed his reputation and his practice ) and further punishment would serve no legitimate purpose .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG gave judgment in public and in the presence of the applicant 's defence counsel .", "It is a matter of dispute whether the grounds of the judgment were read out in addition to the operative provisions or only the operative provisions . According to the Government , the President of ORG , in accordance with the usual practice , read out the considerations relating to the validity of the summons , the main considerations underlying the dismissal of the defence plea concerning the admissibility of the prosecution , a summary of considerations relating to the evidence , and considerations as to whether the applicant was criminally liable . The applicant submitted , however , that his lawyers only heard the President state that he was acquitted of the principal charge under ( CARDINAL ) and of the charge under ( CARDINAL ) , that the defence in respect of the alternative charge under ( CARDINAL ) was rejected , that the applicant was found guilty of the alternative charge under ( CARDINAL ) and the charges under ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and that the seriousness of these offences warranted a suspended term of imprisonment of DATE and a fine of MONEY ( NLG ) .", "CARDINAL . As to a written copy of the judgment , the ORG submitted that they had ascertained that a signed version of the judgment in abridged form ( kop - staart vonnis ) was available when judgment was pronounced on LAW DATE and that it was the policy of ORG of GPE at the relevant time to provide a copy of the judgment in abridged form if this was requested in writing . According to the applicant , however , his lawyers telephoned ORG registry before the expiry of the period within which an appeal could be filed and were told that no judgment was available . Furthermore , the applicant 's lawyers were not aware that ORG had a policy of issuing copies of judgments only upon a request in writing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal . The public prosecutor lodged an appeal but withdrew it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judgment in abridged form , a copy of which was submitted by the Government , contains , inter alia , ORG considerations as to the validity of the summons and as to the admissibility of the prosecution . As regards the latter , ORG rejected the applicant 's argument that the prosecution in respect of the charges of murder and euthanasia was inadmissible . It considered that since section CARDINAL of the Act on the Disposal of the Dead ( Wet op de Lijkbezorging ) had not yet entered into force at the time of the impugned act , there had not existed a legal obligation for the applicant to report the fact that he had committed an offence .", "CARDINAL . The judgment in abridged form further lists those offences of which ORG acquitted the applicant and those of which it found him guilty . In respect of the items of evidence on which ORG based its verdict , the judgment in abridged form only states \u201c TIME \u201d , for pro memoria , meaning that a detailed enumeration of the items of evidence would be produced at DATE , if necessary . ORG proceeded to deal with , and reject , the applicant 's subsidiary pleadings to the effect that if the prosecution was admissible , then the evidence had been obtained unlawfully . Subsequently , ORG examined the criminal liability of the applicant and determined the sentence to be imposed on him , rejecting the applicant 's claim that he had acted legitimately in a situation of force majeure . The judgment in abridged form concludes with a sentence stating that the judgment was read out in public on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ORG \u201d ) , a judgment must detail the items of evidence on which a conviction is based . However , since DATE pursuant to LAW CCP \u2013 the court has to deliver the judgment within DATE following the closure of the trial , it was not unusual at the relevant time that initially a judgment in abridged form would be drafted in cases where the accused was convicted . Such a judgment did not give an account of the items of evidence on which the conviction was based . A complete version of the judgment was not prepared unless the convicted person or the public prosecutor lodged an appeal against the judgment . In that case the items of evidence were detailed in the judgment and the case file , including the complete judgment , was transmitted to the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . Where a judgment in abridged form was prepared , compliance with LAW ORG , which required that a ( full ) judgment be signed within TIME after its delivery by the judges who examined the case , was precluded . However , the judgment in abridged form would be signed in that form and , as soon as this had been done , the accused or his counsel would be able to inspect it , as well as the official records of the hearings , at the registry of the trial court , as was prescribed by LAW CCP for full judgments .", "CARDINAL . It appears that at the relevant time ORG of GPE had a practice of providing the defence with a copy of the judgment in abridged form only if a request was made in writing .", "CARDINAL . According to Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with LAW ( a ) ORG , an appeal against a judgment of the regional court had to be lodged with the court of appeal ( PERSON ) within DATE following DATE on which the judgment was read out in public . Once lodged , the appeal could be withdrawn by the person who instigated it , at the latest just prior to the start of the hearing on appeal ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( PERSON ) has held that an appeal filed outside the DATE period is inadmissible even if the accused or his counsel have , through no fault of their own , been unable to inspect the judgment of the regional court within the DATE period ( judgment of DATE , PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . When the court of appeal examines the case , it should have before it a complete version of the judgment of the lower court . If this is not the case , the judgment is null and void and should be quashed ( vernietigd ) by the court of appeal on formal grounds pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL ORG . However , this does not mean that the court of appeal must refer the case back to the regional court : LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG provides that a case should be referred back to a regional court only if the judgment is quashed and the regional court has not decided on the merits of the case . This provision thus embodies the principle of the right to be tried at CARDINAL levels by courts competent to examine the facts .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings before the court of appeal offer a full new hearing since most of the provisions of the ORG which apply to the proceedings before the lower court also apply on appeal ( LAW ) . The accused who has lodged the appeal may at his discretion submit his objections and possible additional objections in writing , both before and during the hearing . He may also submit additional objections orally in the course of the hearing until the formal closure of the appeal court 's examination ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In a case which led to a judgment of ORG on CARDINAL DATE , the accused complained before the court of appeal that the judgment of the first - instance court did not detail the items of evidence . The court of appeal subsequently quashed the judgment because the items of evidence were not detailed but it did not refer the case back to the regional court , since the latter court had already decided on the merits of the case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In cassation the applicant invoked LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW .", "The Advocate - General ( PERSON ) at ORG submitted an advisory opinion ( conclusie ) to the effect that the fact that the judgment of the first - instance court had not detailed the items of evidence did not prevent the accused from conducting his defence on appeal since , firstly , an accused does not have to defend himself against the judgment by which he was convicted but against the accusation levelled against him by the public prosecution department ; and secondly , the court of appeal examines the case independently on the basis of the trial and the summons and not on the basis of the judgment of the first - instance court . ORG eventually dismissed the appeal and , for its reasoning , referred to the advisory opinion of ORG ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . When only the accused has filed an appeal , the court of appeal may impose a sentence heavier than that imposed at first instance if that decision is reached unanimously ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) . Unanimity is not required if the public prosecutor has also filed an appeal . If it is found that the public prosecutor has filed an appeal with the sole aim of preventing the unanimity requirement in LAW from applying , his appeal may be declared inadmissible ( see the judgments of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , and DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The practice described in paragraph CARDINAL above was subsequently codified in ORG and CARDINALa ORG , which entered into force on CARDINAL November CARDINAL , after the events complained of . If no appeal is lodged , a complete judgment will be made available upon request of the prosecutor or the accused or his lawyer within DATE after delivery of the judgment , unless this request is devoid of reasonable interest ( Article CARDINALc \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG , which also entered into force on DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
