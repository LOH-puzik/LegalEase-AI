This amount remained the same throughout DATE of service until DATE , notwithstanding that originally the law provided for adjustment according to inflation and a tri - annual revision . The latter had to be in accordance with a yet - to - be - enacted law on budget allocation ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ) which was never enacted . Moreover , pay rises provided by the ordinary law had been blocked by the Government by means of various legal provisions . It was only through the \u201c legge finanziaria \u201d of DATE that these pay rises were provided for , but only to take effect from DATE . As a consequence the applicants , up to DATE , allegedly lost PERCENT of what their salaries would have been if adjusted .", "During their service the applicants were not covered by an obligatory insurance and were not registered with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , an NORP welfare entity , the latter notwithstanding that they claimed that their right to registration and cover by ORG had been provided for by Law no .

CARDINAL ) and another CARDINAL individuals in their position instituted proceedings before ORG claiming that they had been denied social security cover and \u201c salary \u201d adjustments as a result of the failure to enact the law containing the relevant budgetary provisions . Such an omission was also contrary to ORG regulations on the matter .", "By a judgment of DATE filed with the relevant registry on DATE their claims were rejected . ORG considered of relevance only the legislation in force at the time and not subsequent legislation . Distinguishing between medici in formazione specialistica and \u201c medico strutturato \u201d , it held that the relevant ORG directive ( Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas , certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications ) left issues related to medici in formazione specialistica in a lacuna , the directive concentrating on reciprocal recognition of qualifications , freedom of movement of the profession and the coordination between GPE of the exercise of the medical profession . In particular , it did not provide specific criteria in relation to the principle of \u201c appropriate remuneration \u201d . In consequence it could not be said that the ORG directive created a right in respect of specific salaries for medici in formazione specialistica . Neither was it possible to derive that right from sections DATE and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , which aimed to transpose the said directive into national law . The limited time during which these provisions were in force before they were suspended by the same measures also suspending sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL did not allow for the creation of a substantive and actionable right on the part of the applicants . The stipulation of a contract of \u201c DATE training \u201d could not allow medici specializzandi to acquire a right to remuneration adjustment and social security cover as provided in sections DATE and CARDINAL of the said law which was suspended by express statutory norms , until the enactment of budgetary provisions . Neither did it appear that in the short time ( a bit DATE ) before the latter suspension , the relevant decree \u201c ORG dei NORP \u201d ( PERSON ) , which would have defined the work - training contract \u2019s scheme , had been adopted . Without this there could not be any activation of the norm . It follows that in the absence of the ORG and relevant budgetary provisions , the failure of universities to stipulate \u201c work - training \u201d contracts could not give rise to any consequences , since LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the said law never became operational .", "An appeal is still pending .
