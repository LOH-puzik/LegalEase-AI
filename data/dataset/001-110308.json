LAW in its LAW states the same . In my case there was no final judgment and therefore the second payment order issued has no legal value . I will soon have a whole collection of payment orders and decisions by which mistakes were corrected .", "The police can not and should not be a body deciding on minor offences ( see LAW ) . The charges of a criminal offence can , in accordance with LAW , be decided only by a judge .", "A time - limit for appeal or a request for judicial review is not compatible with LAW . It should also be indicated whether the time - limit concerns working or calendar days .

In particular , the court found that the applicant had not clearly stated why the police \u2019s findings were false and had not indicated that he had not committed the alleged offence . His generalised statements did not raise any doubts as to the facts as established by the police . The court then summarised the findings by the police , which it found had been correctly established . As regards the alleged procedural violations , the court , referring to the relevant provisions of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , noted , inter alia , that the police were authorised to decide on the minor offence in question by applying summary proceedings and the police officers had authority to conduct the proceedings . It also noted that the time - limit for lodging a request for judicial review was provided for in the legislation . The court also noted that the applicant , who possessed a driving licence , should have been aware of the regulations contained in FAC . Lastly , the court found that the police had correctly applied the law to the facts of the case and imposed a fine prescribed by law . The applicant was ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL for the costs of the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal , alleging a violation of fair trial guarantees \u2013 in particular , that any fine should be imposed by a judicial and not by a police procedure ; that he had been charged and convicted by the police ; and that the guarantees enshrined in Articles CARDINAL ( right to judicial protection ) , CARDINAL ( right to public trial ) and CARDINAL ( defence rights ) of the LAW had not been provided to him . In addition , he complained that no ordinary appeal lay against ORG judgement .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional appeal .
