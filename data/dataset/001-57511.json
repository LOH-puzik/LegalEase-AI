GERMANY (ARTICLE 50)", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of LAW ) in the present case . Accordingly , as regards the facts , the ORG will confine itself here to giving some brief particulars ; for the remaining details , reference should be made to paragraphs CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ibid . , pp . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . That judgment concerned the length of actions brought by Dr. PERSON before ORG in DATE and in DATE to challenge , respectively , the withdrawal of the permit to run his clinic and the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise medicine .", "In the second matter , ORG had dismissed the applicant \u2019s action by a judgment delivered on DATE which had been affirmed by ORG on DATE . Dr. PERSON lodged an appeal ( NORP ) and an application to quash ( Revision ) but these were rejected by ORG ) , in CARDINAL final decisions , on DATE and DATE .", "In the case concerning the clinic , ORG had dismissed Dr. PERSON \u2019s action on DATE . An appeal by him against that decision is still pending before ORG which , with the agreement of the parties , stayed the proceedings on DATE pending the outcome of the above - mentioned proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . After delivery of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG and the applicant attempted , with the ORG \u2019s assistance , to arrive at a friendly settlement of the latter \u2019s claims , details whereof had been given by Mr. PERSON in his letter of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The attempt met with failure in DATE : Dr. PERSON found that the ORG \u2019s offer of DM CARDINAL in full and final settlement was not sufficient .", "CARDINAL . The applicant seeks pecuniary compensation for the CARDINAL heads of damage allegedly caused to him by the violation of Article CARDINAL par . CARDINAL ( article DATE ) : he maintains that his financial and professional situation may have been permanently ruined and , secondly , that his personal and professional reputation had been indirectly lowered . Without quantifying his claims , he furnishes certain particulars DATE regarding notably the average annual income he could have anticipated as a medical practitioner and as the head of a clinic - on the basis of which he considers it possible to gauge the extent of his aggregate loss and to assess the fraction thereof attributable to the fact that the \" reasonable time \" was exceeded . In addition , the applicant asks for reimbursement of the expenses he incurred both in GPE , in order to expedite the hearing of his actions , and before the Convention institutions .", "Dr. PERSON leaves the assessment of the sum to be awarded to him to the ORG \u2019s discretion , thereby confirming the position he had adopted in DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , par . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In their observations of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG stated that they did not wish to comment on the first of the applicant \u2019s claims which they saw as being concerned with the consequences of the CARDINAL withdrawals of authorisation ; at the hearing , they submitted that in their opinion the attribution of specific material losses to the breach found by the ORG was impossible , at least on the strength of the evidence before it . On the other hand , the Delegates suggest that account should be taken of the fact that the applicant was left in a prolonged state of uncertainty as to his professional future , and this at a time of life - between the ages of forty - nine ( in DATE ) and CARDINAL ( in DATE ) - when a man is normally at the peak of his career . They also consider that the breach of LAW . CARDINAL ( article DATE ) , taken by itself , may be another factor having a bearing on an award of just satisfaction .", "As far as concerns the costs of the proceedings , the expenditure incurred by Dr. PERSON in order to expedite the domestic litigation and to present his case in GPE is regarded by the Delegates as a relevant item . They express no firm view as to whether the same applies to the expenditure arising from his applications to the NORP courts for restoration of the suspensive effect of his appeal against the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise ; in their opinion , those applications were aimed not at speeding up the proceedings but at limiting the consequences of their excessive length . Neither do the Delegates comment on the justification for the figures given by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s position is as follows : there is no causal link between the breach found by the ORG and the alleged damage to Dr. PERSON \u2019s professional career ; on the other hand , \" reasonable \" , \" necessary \" and proven costs resulting from the exercise of the domestic legal remedies can give rise to compensation to the extent that those remedies were aimed at accelerating the procedure ; furthermore , the \" reasonable costs \" incurred in connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions should be reimbursed ; finally , it is for the ORG to determine whether the applicant should be awarded monetary compensation for the \" non - material \" injury he suffered by reason of the mere fact that the \" reasonable time \" was exceeded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
