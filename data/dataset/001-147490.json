It further dismissed the property - related complaints on the grounds that it \u201c could not identify any link between the applicant \u2019s allegations and the contested judicial decisions in civil proceedings \u201d .

It concluded that \u201c the applicant and his employer were entitled to request the reimbursement of overpayments from the Majdanpek local community in tax ( administrative ) proceedings , within the time - limits and prescription periods laid down by law , given that the overpayments had been paid into its current account \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further summarily dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint alleging unequal protection of rights , considering that the general allegations before it , which were unsupported by evidence ( pau\u0161alno izneti navodi ) , provided no constitutional basis for claiming a breach of that right .

The legal status of the ORG at the relevant time for the present cases will be summarised below . With the gradual decentralisation of governmentance in DATE , the assessment , collection and control of several taxes and revenues , including the ORG , were redefined and transferred entirely from central to local government level ( ORG , Articles DATE in that order ) . Accordingly , the local government units ( municipalities , towns and the city of GPE ) have , in principle , the same rights and duties as ORG of ORG with its field offices ( there are certain exception which are not relevant for the present case ; see Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was initially defined as a source of primary public revenue either for local government units such as municipalities or for the lower tier of government , the local communities ( mesne zajednice ) , depending on whether the contributions in question were collected on and for the territory of the whole municipality or only the particular local community ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . However , LAW DATE and ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively ) stipulated that the ORG was designed as a source of primary revenue exclusively for the local government units , and that the collected funds were credited to their budgets and strictly intended for specific purposes , while funds for the functioning of the local communities were provided only under specific budget headings .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to ORG , where a majority of citizens vote in favour of imposing the ORG for specific investments ( for instance , to fund the building or maintenance of utility services or buildings of value to the community ) , contributions become mandatory and are required from all citizens with different taxable incomes , including those who voted against the ORG or did not vote at all ( Article CARDINAL ) . The competent local government authorities subsequently define the procedures for calculating and collecting the ORG in the relevant decision , except where this is done by applying the principle of \u201c deduction at source \u201d . In the latter case , the deduction of the ORG from taxable income is the responsibility of those who pay these personal incomes and/or revenues ( intermediaries ; poreski platci ) , who deduct it when paying other applicable taxes and benefits ( LAW ) . The LAW also provides that the legislation governing tax proceedings and tax administration should be applicable , as relevant , to issues such as the manner of determination and assessment of the ORG , its collection , deadlines for payments , statutes of limitation , calculation of interest and other issues not specifically covered by the relevant legislation ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the municipality \u2019s administrative departments ( op\u0161tinsko uprava ) and the executive council ( op\u0161tinsko ve\u0107e ) respectively decide at first and second instance on administrative matters which fall within the competence of the municipality ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL respectively of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

The lawsuits pending at first instance were stayed in the meantime . Article CARDINAL provided that ORG determined the request under the procedure for the adoption of its legal opinions and could refuse to examine it if the preliminary legal issue was not of prejudicial importance in a large number of pending cases .", "CARDINAL . LAW entered into force on DATE , thereby repealing the CARDINAL Act .
