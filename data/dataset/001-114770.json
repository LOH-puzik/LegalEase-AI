R.J. , who was born in DATE , arrived in FAC on DATE . He was placed in FAC , Section CARDINAL of the prison . Notwithstanding ORG \u2019s CARDINAL convictions for crimes ranging from theft ( in DATE ) and attempted murder ( in DATE ) to hooliganism ( in DATE ) , he was considered as serving an imprisonment penalty for the first time , given that following his first conviction the court had suspended the imposed sentence and the sentences for the second and third convictions had been combined .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL character reports drawn up by ORG administration in DATE describe the applicant as tactful with other inmates and respectful to the guards ; he was also said to have had \u201c certain authority \u201d with other prisoners . The authorities noted that the applicant had breached the prison \u2019s internal rules CARDINAL times ( for keeping his hands in his pockets in the presence of guards , being intoxicated , and staying at prison quarters he was not assigned to ) . Nonetheless , he had also been commended CARDINAL times for positive behaviour and good work in prison .", "As it appears from the documents submitted by the parties , in DATE PERSON had been assessed twice by the prison administration . He was described as having authority among other inmates and tactful with them , capable of easily adapting in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , a fight broke out between the applicant and PERSON As a consequence , the applicant suffered severe head injuries ; his skull was fractured . DATE he underwent an operation in a public hospital . He was later placed in the prison hospital in a coma .", "According to a doctor \u2019s report , ORG sustained an injury to his forehead and had blood on his face . His leg was broken and he had bruises on his arms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison governor started a pre - trial investigation into the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted PERSON of having caused the applicant severe bodily injury ( sunkus k\u016bno su\u017ealojimas ) . The court established that on DATE , at TIME , PERSON had hit the applicant CARDINAL times over the head and other parts of the body while in DATE at the prison . PERSON confessed to the crime . CARDINAL guards who testified before the court stated that once they had learned of the fight , which happened at QUANTITY , after the evening check - up , they had run to the applicant \u2019s cell and found him lying on the floor with his head covered in blood . The guards also stated that PERSON had smelled of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . The transcript of the trial hearing states that PERSON testified that \u201c the quarrel between me and the applicant had been spontaneous \u201d , and \u201c the fight had been short \u201d . He also stated that he had punched and kicked the applicant \u2019s body and head , and that as a result the applicant had fallen down and hit his head on an aquarium . Another inmate , PERSON , had attempted to separate them . \u201c Afterwards the guards had run in and it had all been over \u201d . In answer to a question by a prosecutor , PERSON stated that \u201c he had had no prior conflicts with the applicant \u201d . He added that \u201c everything had happened very fast ; until the guards had run into the cell , the applicant had only managed to reach the bed and lie down \u201d .", "ORG testified that the conflict had taken place after TIME check - up . He said \u201c I tried to separate PERSON and the applicant ... the conflict happened very fast \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The medical report stated that PERSON had not been intoxicated when blood samples had been taken from him \u201c on DATE \u201d . The court therefore decided to remove from the charges against him the accusation that he had been intoxicated when the crime was committed .", "The doctor \u2019s report reads that PERSON was tested for alcohol at TIME on DATE . The test showed PERCENT of alcohol in his blood .", "CARDINAL . When imposing the sentence , the court took into consideration PERSON \u2019s young age and the fact that he had confessed to the crime . PERSON was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , with confiscation of all his property . The court added that term of imprisonment to his prior conviction , and PERSON was ordered to spend in total DATE in prison . Upon a civil claim by a prosecutor , PERSON was also ordered to reimburse the costs which the ORG had paid for the applicant \u2019s hospitalisation and treatment , which amounted to CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL ) . At that time the applicant had not submitted a civil claim for non - pecuniary damages from PERSON", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal . The court found that there were no grounds for lowering the sentence imposed on PERSON The crime was particularly grave , with very serious consequences .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a ORG commission declared the applicant Category I disabled ( most severe condition of disability ) and unfit to work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC released the applicant from the remainder of his sentence . The court noted that after the incident of DATE , the applicant had become totally disabled . He could walk only by leaning on furniture and with the help of others and was unable to adequately assess his surroundings . Moreover , he had already served CARDINAL of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . After the incident , the applicant was treated in numerous hospitals and rehabilitation centres . According to a report from ORG municipality of DATE , the applicant could not speak clearly , had poor balance , and had trouble shaving , washing himself and climbing stairs . He required constant care from his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who believed that he was eligible for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages on account of his injury while in prison , lodged a civil claim against the ORG . He argued that the prison authorities were under an obligation to maintain order in the correctional facility and should have protected and defended him from the injury that nearly cost him his life . He submitted that there was a direct causal link between his injury and the prison authorities\u2019 alleged failure to act and guarantee safe conditions in which to serve a sentence .", "ORG was a third interested party in those proceedings , given that the outcome of the litigation for damages directly affected his pecuniary situation .", "CARDINAL . When the case was examined before ORG , the applicant \u2019s lawyer also argued that the administration of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison had failed to observe prison rules stipulating that certain prisoners should be kept separately . In that context , the lawyer referred to a letter of DATE in which the prosecutor said that ORG had to be kept in isolation . The lawyer also argued that PERSON , who had CARDINAL convictions in total , was a more hardened criminal than the applicant , so the CARDINAL should have been held separately . He also submitted that although , after the incident , PERSON had smelled of alcohol , blood samples had not been taken from him until TIME . In the past the applicant had also been punished for consuming alcohol while in prison . The lawyer argued that the guards on duty had not kept the prisoners under constant observation , as they were obliged to do under the prison regulations . He also maintained that the administration \u2019s decision to move an inmate from one section of the prison to another had to be justified , which had not happened in the applicant \u2019s case . Lastly , the lawyer argued that his client had not started the proceedings for damages earlier because of his state of health .", "CARDINAL . PERSON testified before ORG that he had been serving his sentence in the same section of FAC since DATE . In his view , \u201c it was the ORG that should bear responsibility for the injuries the applicant had sustained \u201d . He also argued that his relations with the applicant had always been tense , that \u201c the applicant did not fit in [ in Wing CARDINAL , LAW ] \u201d , \u201c the applicant was a \u2018 simple\u2019 person and the other inmates in that section were \u2018 ORG \u201d and \u201c the fight between the CARDINAL of them would have occurred sooner or later \u201d . In his opinion , \u201c the prison administration could have foreseen the tension between him and the applicant if it had wanted \u201d . PERSON did not answer the judge \u2019s question about the reasons for the fight . Nor did he reply to her question whether he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the fight . He nevertheless submitted that prisoners could obtain as much alcohol in the prison \u201c as they wanted \u201d . The guards caught them with alcohol very rarely and , as far as PERSON \u2019s recalled , the applicant had been sober at the time of the fight . PERSON also said that after TIME check - up , the guards carried out the first night - time check at TIME , and TIME at a later time .", "CARDINAL . The Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration and ORG , the defendants in the case , asked the court to dismiss the civil claim , arguing that the fight had been spontaneous and the conflict could not have been foreseen . They submitted that the applicant had never informed the prison administration that he had been in danger . Accordingly , the ORG was not liable for the incident that had caused the applicant \u2019s incapacity .", "The prison authorities also pointed out that the inmates should have been in bed by TIME , and that at TIME the guards checked the sleeping quarters twice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil claim . It noted , firstly , that the applicant had missed a statutory DATE deadline for lodging a claim for damages . Nevertheless , the court proceeded with the examination of whether the complaint was founded .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the complaint , ORG held that there was no evidence , either written or factual , of the applicant having ever approached the authorities claiming that he was unsafe in FAC , even though such a right was guaranteed by LAW ( see Relevant Domestic Law and Practice below ) . The court also emphasised that the prison administration had properly executed its duties as concerns the placement of inmates . Both the applicant and PERSON had been serving a prison sentence for the first time , so they could be held in the same wing and section . As to the suggestion by the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the applicant had been moved from CARDINAL part to another of the prison without a valid reason , the court held that \u201c the applicant could have challenged those actions [ but had failed to do so ] \u201d . Moreover , the applicant himself had not been an exemplary prisoner and had been punished a number of times for breaching internal rules ( ranging from alcohol consumption to leaving his living quarters ) . The court found weighty the prison administration \u2019s argument that the applicant had never approached them claiming , either verbally or in writing , that he was unsafe in prison in general or that he had had any conflicts with a particular inmate . Consequently , there were no grounds for finding the prison administration liable for not preventing the incident . According to the case - file , the fight was spontaneous and took place after the TIME check - up , when all the inmates , including the applicant and PERSON , should have been sleeping or at least in bed . Overall , there was no legal basis for granting the applicant \u2019s civil claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , invoking LAW and reiterating his earlier arguments that the ORG had not protected him from serious injury in prison , as a consequence of which his health had been permanently damaged . He also submitted that the prison administration had failed to ensure that prisoners could not obtain alcohol , arguing that alcohol made prisoners unpredictable and aggressive .", "ORG asked that the civil claim be dismissed as unfounded . They pointed out that there was no objective evidence that PERSON had been under the influence of alcohol during the incident . That fact had not been established in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal but dismissed it on the merits . There was no evidence in the case file that any action or inaction on the part of staff at FAC had contributed to the incident between the applicant and PERSON During the criminal proceedings , it had been established that it was PERSON who had injured the applicant , and PERSON had been convicted accordingly . Therefore , as it had not been possible to establish any illegal acts or failure to act on the part of the prison staff , the ORG could not be held responsible for the non - pecuniary damage the applicant had sustained .", "CARDINAL .
