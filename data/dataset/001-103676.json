GPE and PERSON v.

The applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , arguing that his submission that he would face ill - treatment in GPE had not been examined by the court . Again no reference was made to the applicant \u2019s alleged previous experience while in detention in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE . It reasoned as follows : the applicant had absconded from the NORP authorities ; the decision to arrest the applicant had been taken by a competent NORP court ; the applicant was not a NORP national ; ORG had guaranteed that the applicant would not be extradited to a third ORG or punished for another crime , and that he would be free to leave GPE when he had served his sentence ; there were no reasons to reject the extradition request ; the applicant \u2019s allegations that torture of detainees was a widespread practice in GPE had not been substantiated ; the applicant had not proved that he might be persecuted on the grounds of race , religion , membership of a social group , political convictions or anything else .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG of GPE ( \u201c the district court \u201d ) examined the complaint about unlawfulness of detention . It reasoned that , pursuant to LAW ORG , a prosecutor could place a person in custody where a foreign court \u2019s arrest warrant and a request for extradition existed . However , in the applicant \u2019s case , the district prosecutor \u2019s office had applied the preventive measure before the extradition request had been sent and thus had breached LAW ORG . At the same time , the second district prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s decision to remand the applicant in custody had been taken after the extradition request had been received . The district court concluded that the district prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s decision of DATE was unlawful . Nonetheless , it refused to release the applicant , arguing that the decision of DATE was compatible with domestic law and thus served as a legitimate ground for the applicant \u2019s detention .

On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office requested a court to extend the term of the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district court granted the prosecutor \u2019s request in part .

The term of the applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Verifying the compatibility of LAW of ORG in the GPE of DATE , ORG ruled that a foreign national liable to be expelled from the NORP territory could not be detained for CARDINAL without a court order .", "CARDINAL . Assessing the compatibility of LAW ORG with LAW , ORG reiterated its settled case - law to the effect that excessive or arbitrary detention , unlimited in time and without appropriate review , was incompatible with LAW in all cases , including extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the absence of specific regulation of detention matters in LAW did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with LAW . LAW ORG provided that , in executing a request for legal assistance , the requested party would apply its domestic law , that is the procedure laid down in the ORG . That procedure comprised , in particular , LAW and the norms in its LAW ( \u201c Preventive measures \u201d ) , which , by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the LAW ( \u201c General provisions \u201d ) , applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings , including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests .", "CARDINAL .

ORG dismissed the request on the ground that it was not competent to indicate specific provisions of the criminal law governing the procedure and time - limits for holding a person in custody with a view to extradition . That matter was within the competence of the courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court reiterated its settled case - law to the effect that the scope of the constitutional right to liberty and personal inviolability was the same for foreign nationals and stateless persons as for NORP nationals . A foreign national or stateless person may not be detained in GPE for more than TIME without a judicial decision . That constitutional requirement served as a guarantee against excessively long detention beyond TIME , and also against arbitrary detention as such , in that it required a court to examine whether the arrest was lawful and justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for DATE on the basis of a request for his or her extradition without a decision by a NORP court .

ORG dismissed as inadmissible a request for a review of the constitutionality of LAW ORG , stating that this provision \u201c does not establish time - limits for custodial detention and does not establish the reasons and procedure for choosing a preventive measure , it merely confirms a prosecutor \u2019s power to execute a decision already delivered by a competent judicial body of a foreign state to detain an accused .

By a Directive Decision No.CARDINAL adopted by LAW of ORG of GPE on DATE , ( \u201c Directive Decision of DATE \u201d ) ORG issued several instructions to the courts on the application of LAW ORG . The ORG reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by actions or the inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could invoke LAW ORG to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them . The ORG stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under LAW also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings , refusals to admit defence counsel or to grant victim status , a person could not rely on LAW to challenge a court \u2019s decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody . It was further stressed that in declaring a specific action or inaction on the part of a law - enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified , a judge was not entitled to quash the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to quash it , but could only request him or her to rectify the shortcomings indicated . Should the impugned authority fail to comply with the court \u2019s instructions , an interested party could complain to a court about the authority \u2019s inaction and the latter body could issue a special decision [ \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ] , drawing the authority \u2019s attention to the situation . Lastly , the decision stated that a prosecutor \u2019s decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him or her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a Directive Decision No . CARDINAL , adopted by LAW of ORG of GPE on DATE ( \u201c Directive Decision of DATE \u201d ) , it was stated that , pursuant to LAW ORG , only a court could order the placement in custody of a person in respect of whom an extradition check was pending and where the authorities of the country requesting extradition had not submitted a court decision remanding him or her in custody . The judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with LAW ORG and following a prosecutor \u2019s request for that person to be placed in custody . In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure . If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court , a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a NORP court \u2019s authorisation ( LAW ORG ) for a period not exceeding DATE , and the prosecutor \u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under LAW ORG . In extending a person \u2019s detention with a view to extradition a court was to apply LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The fact that the Government has rejected an international inquiry into the LOC events , independent scrutiny of the related proceedings , and that there is no internationally accepted account of the events , is deeply worrying . Against such significant , serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in GPE , I continue to find myself appealing to ORG to refrain from transferring persons to GPE . The prohibition of torture is absolute , and GPE risk violating this prohibition - their obligations under international law - by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture .
