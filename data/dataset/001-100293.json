GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits and dismissed (victim);No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE Department for ORG ( GPE ) started a long - term observation of the applicant . The latter was suspected of participation in offences committed by the so - called LAW ( Antiimperialistische Zelle ) , an organisation which was pursuing the armed combat abandoned since DATE by ORG ) , a left - wing extremist terrorist movement .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence , the applicant was occasionally kept under visual surveillance by staff members of ORG and the entries to his flats were filmed by video cameras . ORG also intercepted the telephones in the house in which the applicant lived with his mother ( from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) and in a telephone box situated nearby ( from DATE until DATE ) . Moreover , post addressed to him was opened and checked ( from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , PERSON , a presumed accomplice of the applicant , was subjected to surveillance measures from DATE . ORG intercepted telecommunications from the phone in his parents ' house as well as his post . Moreover , staff members of the ORG occasionally observed him .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG General instituted investigatory proceedings against the applicant and S. for participation in bomb attacks for which LAW had claimed responsibility . ORG was in charge of the investigations .", "CARDINAL . Following this , the applicant and PERSON were kept under visual surveillance by civil servants of ORG , essentially during DATE between CARDINAL DATE and their arrest on DATE . Moreover , the entry of the house in which the applicant was living with his mother was observed by means of an additional video camera installed by ORG ( from DATE ) . The telephones in that house , in a telephone box situated nearby and in LOC 's flat in GPE were tapped by order of the investigating judge at ORG ( DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) . That judge further ordered observation by the police of the applicant and PERSON as well as of the cars used by them . ORG also observed the entry of PERSON 's apartment by means of video cameras ( DATE ) . Moreover , it intercepted the professional radio communication used by S.", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG further installed CARDINAL transmitters ( Peilsender ) in PERSON 's car , which the applicant and PERSON often used together . However , the applicant and PERSON detected and destroyed the transmitters . As they suspected that their telecommunications were being intercepted and that they were being observed , they never spoke to each other on the phone and succeeded on many occasions in evading visual surveillance by the investigation authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of this , ORG built a ORG ( GPS ) receiver into LOC 's car in DATE by order of ORG . Thereby it could determine the location and the speed of the car once per minute . However , the data were only recovered every other day in order to prevent detection of the receiver . This observation lasted until the applicant 's and PERSON 's arrest on DATE .", "CARDINAL . GPS is a radio navigation system working with the help of satellites . It allows the continuous location , without lapse of time , of objects equipped with a GPS receiver anywhere on LOC , with a maximum tolerance of QUANTITY at the time . It does not comprise any visual or acoustical surveillance . As opposed to transmitters , its use does not necessitate the knowledge of where approximately the person to be located can be found .", "CARDINAL . In the criminal trial opened against the applicant and PERSON , ORG , by a decision of DATE , dismissed the applicant 's objection to the use as evidence of the results obtained by his surveillance with the help of GPS . It found that LAW no . CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) authorised the use of GPS in the instant case . The reliable information thus collected could therefore be used at trial . This information was confirmed by the evidence obtained by DATE video and personal surveillance of the defendants . Moreover , contrary to the applicant 's submission , the use of GPS did not require a court order because it had been aggregated with other , legal , methods of surveillance . According to LAW , surveillance via GPS did not have to be ordered by a judge , as opposed to measures interfering more profoundly with the right to self - determination in the sphere of information ( ORG auf informationelle PERSON ) . Whether or not a surveillance measure could be ordered in addition to measures already in place was a question of proportionality of the additional measure in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , inter alia , of attempted murder and of CARDINAL counts of causing an explosion and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It found that the applicant and PERSON , who had been the only members of the so - called PERSON since DATE , had placed bombs in front of the houses of members or former members of ORG and in front of the NORP Honorary Consulate DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant had availed himself of his right to remain silent when faced with the charges and that PERSON had admitted taking part in the bomb attacks only in general terms , without giving any details . However , circumstantial evidence obtained in the course of the surveillance measures taken against them proved that they had committed the offences of which they had been found guilty .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG found that for the bomb attack carried out following the GPS surveillance of LOC 's car , it had been shown that the car had been parked close to the scene of the crime on DATE the offence was committed and on DATE prior to it . Moreover , the car had been located close to the places where the defendants had photocopied , hidden and later posted letters claiming responsibility for the offence and close to sites in forests where the investigating authorities later found hiding places with material necessary for the construction of the bomb . This evidence was corroborated by information obtained by other methods of surveillance , in particular , the video surveillance of the entry of the applicant 's home and the visual surveillance of the defendants by staff of ORG . The defendants ' participation in the bomb attacks prior to their surveillance with the help of the GPS was proved by the similar execution of the offences as well as the information obtained by the video surveillance of their homes and the interception of telecommunications .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal on points of law the applicant complained , in particular , about the use as evidence at trial of the information obtained by his allegedly illegal surveillance notably with the help of GPS .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law as ill - founded . It found that the collection of data by ORG had a legal basis , namely LAW no . CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW . Therefore , the information obtained in this manner could be used in the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the use of technical locating devices such as the GPS did not interfere with the applicant 's home . As the applicant was suspected of offences of considerable gravity , namely participation in bomb attacks committed by a terrorist organisation , the use of GPS was a proportionate interference with his right to respect for his private life ( as protected also by LAW and his right to self - determination in the sphere of information . Other methods of investigation would have had less prospect of success , as the applicant and PERSON had often succeeded in evading other measures of observation .", "CARDINAL . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , ORG further found that the aggregation of several measures of investigation did not necessitate an additional legal basis or make a court order necessary . However , the investigating authorities had to examine whether ordering another measure of surveillance in addition to the measures which were already being taken was still proportionate . In any event , there had not been a total surveillance of the applicant , which alone could violate the principle of proportionality and a person 's right to privacy and could raise the issue of exclusion of evidence obtained in this manner from criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG conceded that following a change in the law in DATE , LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) provided that any long - term observation lasting for DATE had to be ordered by a judge , irrespective of whether or not technical means of surveillance were used . The need for a court order did not , however , previously emanate from LAW , constitutional law or LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a complaint with ORG . He claimed , in particular , that his surveillance by the GPE and ORG for ORG and by ORG from DATE until DATE and the judgments of ORG and ORG had infringed his right to privacy . Article CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW could not be considered a sufficiently precise legal basis for his surveillance with the help of GPS . There was no effective judicial control of this measure and the use of several means of surveillance at the same time would have necessitated a separate basis in law . Moreover , the use at trial of the information obtained by the said measures without a basis in law had infringed his right to a fair hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held a hearing , dismissed the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that his complaint was ill - founded in so far as he had complained about the use in the proceedings of evidence obtained by his observation via GPS in addition to other surveillance measures and that these measures were illegal .", "CARDINAL . The surveillance of the applicant with the help of ORG could be based on LAW CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW . That provision was constitutional . In particular , the term \u201c special technical means intended for the purpose of surveillance \u201d was sufficiently precise . As opposed to visual or acoustic surveillance , it comprised the location and determination of the whereabouts of a person by observing him or her by technical means such as GPS . The legislator was not obliged to formulate the methods of surveillance in a manner excluding the use of new forensic techniques . However , there was a risk of infringement of the right to selfdetermination in the sphere of information , that is , the right of the individual to determine the use of data on him or her . Therefore , the legislator had to observe technical progress and , if necessary , safeguard the respect of fundamental rights by the investigating authorities with additional legislative provisions .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the measure did not disproportionately interfere with the applicant 's right to privacy . His surveillance did not destroy the essence of his private life . On the contrary , such surveillance by technical means could in some cases make more serious interferences , such as the interception of communications , unnecessary . Therefore , it was not disproportionate to order the surveillance measure if there was only an initial suspicion of an offence ( of considerable gravity ) and if other methods of investigation had less prospect of success . Furthermore , the legislator had not been obliged to set up additional safeguards for long - term surveillance \u2013 which he later did by adopting LAW of LAW but could first observe the factual developments in this field .", "CARDINAL . Neither did the legislator have the duty to regulate the use of several surveillance measures at once . Full surveillance of a person by which an exhaustive personal profile could be drawn up would be unconstitutional , but could , as a rule , be prevented by the existing procedural safeguards . However , ORG , when ordering a surveillance measure , had to make sure by proper documentation in the case file and federal registers that it was aware of all other surveillance measures taken against the person concerned at the same time . Furthermore , the legislator had to observe whether , in view of future developments , the existing procedural safeguards were sufficient to grant an effective protection of fundamental rights and to prevent uncoordinated investigation measures by different authorities .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , the interference with the applicant 's rights by his surveillance by ORG was proportionate , notably in view of the gravity of the offences he had been suspected of and the fact that he had evaded other measures of surveillance . The use of several observation measures at the same time had not led to total surveillance . He had been observed with the help of GPS only when he had travelled in LOC 's car . Other surveillance measures had basically been used only at DATE and had consisted only to a minor extent of the interception of communications .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL was inserted into LAW by the LAW on the fight against drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime ( Gesetz zur Bek\u00e4mpfung des illegalen LOC und PERSON organisierten ORG ) of DATE . The relevant parts of LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Without the knowledge of the person concerned", "no .

Pursuant to Article CARDINALd \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , in its version in force at the relevant time \u2013 just as for an order to tap a person 's telephone ( Article LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) DATE a court order was necessary to authorise the use of technical devices to bug and to record conversations made in private under LAW no .
