NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are Mr PERSON and his wife PERSON , respectively NORP and NORP / NORP nationals born in DATE and DATE , and also their CARDINAL children ( born in DATE indicated in brackets ) , all of whom are NORP nationals : PERSON ( DATE ) , PERSON ( DATE ) , PERSON ( DATE ) and PERSON ( DATE ) . The first applicant lives in GPE and the other applicants live in GPE , GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON NORP Bj\u00f8rnstad , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts , may be summarised as follows .", "Mr PERSON , the first applicant , is of ethnic NORP origin . During DATE of primary education in GPE he was taught in GPE . In DATE his father travelled to GPE and in DATE the first applicant joined him there , at DATE . DATE also his mother , sister and CARDINAL brothers followed . They were all granted a residence permit .", "Following an introductory NORP course for foreigners in DATE , the first applicant joined a NORP secondary school , where he completed his studies after DATE . He then worked for DATE as an assistant in a car shop , DATE at a concrete factory and thereafter for DATE as an assistant warehouse manager in a furniture shop , until he was arrested in DATE .", "In DATE the first applicant married the second applicant , PERSON . She arrived in GPE , DATE , in DATE . She obtained NORP citizenship in DATE but kept her NORP citizenship . While her parents remained in GPE , QUANTITY of her CARDINAL brothers and sisters are living in GPE . CARDINAL of them , a brother , is married to CARDINAL of the first applicant \u2019s sisters in GPE . The second applicant has worked as a cleaning assistant at a school for DATE . She has no education beyond the CARDINAL years\u2019 primary schooling in GPE and a short course in NORP following her arrival in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG ( lagmannsrett ) convicted the first applicant under LAW ) , cf . ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW for complicity in the importation of QUANTITY of heroin from GPE and for having acquired QUANTITY of the drug in DATE . It sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . CARDINAL other persons were convicted in relation to these offences , CARDINAL of whom was the first applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON . In its judgment ORG stated that the evidence did not clarify the whole context of the case , which was only the tip of an iceberg . The first applicant and his brother were not deemed to be the principal perpetrators , but they had received the drugs in GPE and found a place to keep them , following the directions of someone else . The first applicant was considered to have had a more important role than his brother in the operation . Unlike the brother , the first applicant had not previously been convicted . The third person convicted , also a NORP national , had travelled regularly between GPE and GPE and was found to have been put under considerable pressure , in particular from GPE , but also from ORG and PERSON in order to act as a courier in the transport of the drugs in question . Because of the pressure he had been put under , he had reported the matter to the police in GPE and had sought police protection . The police had not been able to help him but had advised him not to act as a courier . Despite this he had carried out the operation and had later informed the police of the quantity he had imported and where parts of the drugs could be found .", "While serving his prison sentence , the first applicant took a DATE course in engineering and mechanics and a \u00bd-year course in building . After being released in DATE , he gained employment as a manager in the welding department of a company .", "On DATE LAW , referring to the criminal conviction , decided to order the first applicant \u2019s expulsion . The decision was subsequently replaced by a decision dated DATE of ORG ( PERSON ) , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Aliens Acts DATE ( GPE of DATE No . CARDINAL ) . On appeal , ORG upheld the latter decision on DATE . The Ministry observed that , considering the case as a whole and having regard to the serious nature of the offence , the expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the members of the first applicant 's close family . The family could , if it so wished , reunite in GPE .", "Subsequently the first applicant challenged the expulsion order before ORG ( byrett ) . He submitted , inter alia , that he felt like a NORP , that at present he had no links to GPE , which was only a holiday destination for him and his family , who wished to remain in GPE . By judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the decision by ORG . On appeal , this judgment was subsequently upheld by ORG , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) upheld ORG judgment and rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal . In his opinion on behalf of a unanimous court , Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\" [ I]n cases of serious narcotics offences , the expulsion of foreigners must fall within ORG margin of appreciation , even though the expulsion , because of the expelled person 's links to the host country , will have a serious impact on him and his family .", "There is no reason to doubt that the expulsion would constitute a heavy burden for [ the first applicant ] and his family . He , his wife and the children have resided in GPE for a long period , the children since their birth . However , \u2026 the family does not have its vital interests solely linked to GPE and should not be considered alien to NORP society . This is the case of [ the first applicant ] and his wife and also to a certain degree the children , who must be presumed to be or have become familiar with the NORP language and way of life , even if they live in GPE . There is no question here of such qualified attachment to the country of residence for the expelled person and his family and such a lack of ties to the country of origin as are described in ORG judgments in the cases of GPE and NORP .", "It is not possible for ORG to have any firm opinion about whether the first applicant \u2019s close family would elect to continue living in GPE . But even though expulsion would entail that Mr \u00d6zturk be separated from his family , it does not follow that the expulsion would transgress the limits of LAW , when he has been found guilty of such a serious offence , with such damaging consequences to society , as in the present case .", "ORG does not dispute that PERSON could be exposed to prosecution in GPE , where an indictment has been issued against him with respect to the exportation from GPE of the heroin in question in DATE ... From the point of view of criminal law , it concerns a different offence than that for which he was convicted in GPE . According to information obtained by the Attorney General via ORG in GPE about NORP penal practice in this area , the exportation of narcotic substances may be penalised with QUANTITY DATE imprisonment and a fine , assessed in the light of the quantity in question . In the event of heroin and certain other substances , the punishment may be doubled ; it may also be increased by PERCENT if the trial court finds that the trafficking is a part of organised crime . Punishment will normally be imposed even though the accused has been convicted and has served a sentence for the offence in another country , but will be deducted from that served in accordance with a judgment of the NORP court ... . In practice , prisoners are released after having served PERCENT when a sentence has also been served in another country . Therefore , according to what has been stated to the ORG , it is rare that , after deduction has been made of the sentence served in the other country , there will be anything left to serve in GPE . Moreover , it has been stated that the principle ne bis in idem , namely that punishment shall not be imposed twice for the same offence , is respected by NORP trial courts .", "Against this background I find it clear that the possibility of PERSON being prosecuted in GPE could not lead to the finding of a violation of LAW . \"", "From DATE the first applicant was committed for examination to the psychiatric ward of ORG , GPE . According to a psychiatric report dated DATE , the applicant was above all disappointed and bitter about the authorities . He had stated that he might as well die as go to a NORP prison , but that he would not commit suicide until DATE of his deportation , possibly after his arrival in GPE . He was assessed as not being psychotic but moderately depressed . There was no psychiatric ground for his being committed to a psychiatric hospital .", "In DATE the first applicant 's expulsion was put into effect .", "His brother , ORG , had been expelled in DATE , whereas his other brother had died . His sister continued to live in GPE and obtained NORP citizenship . Their parents returned to GPE in DATE for health reasons and , because of their long absence from GPE , forfeited their residence permit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
