They are companies in liquidation . They are referred to throughout as \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The fourth applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The third and fourth applicants were appointed as liquidators of the first and second applicants in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with PERSON , assisted by Mr J. PERSON and Mr PERSON , counsel .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In LANGUAGE law , a debenture is a document creating or acknowledging the terms of a loan . It may be secured by a charge , which is an interest in a company \u2019s property that is created in favour of a creditor . CARDINAL type of charge is a \u201c floating \u201d charge , which does not attach to any specific assets .", "CARDINAL . In LANGUAGE company law , administrative receivership is the process by which administrative receivers are appointed in respect of a company which is unable to meet its debts under a debenture . Administrative receivers may be appointed by the holders of any debenture which is secured by a charge ( see section CARDINAL ) of LAW at paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Thus , administrative receivership is essentially a debt enforcement mechanism for a debenture holder . When administrative receivers are appointed , their primary duty is to the debenture holder , and their function is to ensure that , through the disposal of the company \u2019s assets , they raise enough money to pay the amount due to the debenture holder .", "CARDINAL . Administrative receivership is to be distinguished from CARDINAL other processes which may apply to a company which is experiencing financial difficulties : liquidation and administration . Liquidation ( or winding up ) is the process by which an insolvent company is dissolved and its assets sold for the benefit of its creditors . Administration is a process which allows for the appointment of an external manager to run a company and manage its assets . It differs from administrative receivership in that it is done for the benefit of the company and its general creditors , not for a particular debenture holder . It is also different from liquidation in that its goal is to ensure the survival of the company .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . ORG conducted a major utilities construction business in DATE . Its major customer was ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which accounted for PERCENT of its turnover .", "CARDINAL . NORP OBG \u2019s business with ORG was based on a series of contracts , each of which contained a clause ( clause CARDINAL ) which meant that , if ORG went into liquidation , ORG could expel ORG from its sites and employ another contractor to do the work . Under clause CARDINAL , if the other contractor did the work more cheaply than ORG , then the savings made by ORG became due to ORG . If the other contractor cost more , then ORG had to pay the excess to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG mortgaged its assets and undertakings in favour of ORG ( \u201c RBS \u201d ) , by means of a debenture . The debenture was secured by a floating charge over ORG \u2019s assets and undertakings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a dispute arose between ORG and ORG , in which ORG alleged that it had been overcharged by ORG . As a result , ORG suspended payments to ORG and sought repayment of sums already paid to ORG under the contracts . This suspension of payments meant that ORG was unable to pay the debts which it owed to its sub - contractors , suppliers and other creditors . This included its debts to one of its major sub - contractors , ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) , of over GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , to ensure the continued solvency of ORG and PERSON , ORG entered into negotiations with PERSON for a secured loan . Those negotiations were inconclusive and no loan agreement was concluded between ORG and PERSON . However , in the course of the negotiations PERSON \u2019s solicitors , PERSON , drew up documents arranging for the transfer of the ORG debenture from ORG to PERSON . The documents were only executed by ORG and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The difficulty with these arrangements was that ORG had owed nothing to ORG under the floating charge in the debenture . Consequently , no secured debt was assigned to PERSON with the debenture . Nonetheless , PERSON was advised by PERSON that it could attach ORG \u2019s unsecured debts onto the debenture .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Penningtons\u2019 advice , on DATE PERSON appointed administrative receivers over all of ORG \u2019s assets and undertakings . It did so in order to recover the money which it was owed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that , because PERSON could not attach its unsecured debts to the debenture , PERSON had no lawful authority to take over the rights of ORG under the debenture . Therefore , it had no right to appoint administrative receivers to recover the money that it was owed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The receivers also took legal advice from PERSON and were told by PERSON that their appointments were valid . Pursuant to that advice , on DATE , the receivers took possession of all ORG \u2019s assets and business . The receivers negotiated with ORG for the release of funds owed by ORG to ORG , in order to fund future activity . However , these negotiations were also unsuccessful . Consequently , on DATE , the receivers instructed ORG \u2019s staff and contractors to cease all work due under the contracts between ORG and ORG . On DATE , the receivers also terminated the majority of the ORG \u2019s contracts with its staff and contractors .", "CARDINAL . The receivers then realised ORG \u2019s assets . They did so by selling its land , plant and equipment ; negotiating the settlement of its claims under its contracts with ORG ; completing , assigning or abandoning its contracts with other customers ; collecting its book debts ; and taking the credit balance in its bank account . In so doing , the receivers realised a total amount of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The negotiations with ORG resulted in an agreement that ORG would pay ORG GBP CARDINAL in full and final settlement of all claims under the contracts . This agreement was signed in DATE by ORG and by the receivers on behalf of ORG , with the concurrence of its liquidators . The entire sum realised by the receivers was used to repay ORG \u2019s debt to PERSON and to pay the fees and expenses of the receivers .", "CARDINAL . Having no further assets with which to pay their remaining creditors , ORG \u2019s directors called a meeting with their creditors on DATE , at which resolutions were passed to wind up ORG and to appoint liquidators . On DATE , it is estimated that ORG owed its creditors , excluding PERSON , approximately GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG \u2019s sole remaining asset was a claim against PERSON and the receivers for the unlawful appointment of the receivers and the ORG subsequent realisation of its assets .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , and with their LOC approval , ORG commenced proceedings on DATE against PERSON and the receivers , claiming that the appointment of the receivers had been unlawful and seeking damages .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , by this date , PERSON was neither solvent nor trading , and went into liquidation on DATE . It did not , therefore , take an active part in the proceedings commenced by the applicants . PERSON were subsequently added as defendants in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the first hearing in ORG , PERSON admitted that their advice to the receivers , namely that their appointment had been valid , had been negligent and that PERSON were accordingly liable to the receivers for any loss resulting from their advice .", "CARDINAL . By order dated DATE and a written judgment of DATE , ORG declared that the appointment of the receivers was invalid . It ordered the receivers to pay damages to be assessed at DATE .", "CARDINAL . At this stage of proceedings , ORG abandoned a claim it had made for an \u201c account \u201d . This is a claim requiring a party to account to another party for his dealing with property which has been held under a \u201c constructive trust \u201d . ( A constructive trust exists , for example , in respect of the assets of a company in receivership . )", "CARDINAL . Instead , ORG claimed damages inter alia for trespass and wrongful interference with its property , and loss and damages suffered as a result of the ORG invalid appointment .", "CARDINAL . The basis of ORG \u2019s claim was that , but for the invalid appointment of the receivers , ORG would have obtained orders for administration . ORG further claimed that , if orders for administration had been obtained , it would have survived as a business .", "CARDINAL . Alternatively , ORG claimed there would have been a better realisation of its assets , particularly in relation to the value of its contracts with ORG . This was because it had become apparent , through the disclosure of previously undisclosed documents by ORG , that , in DATE , ORG had made substantial savings when it gave ORG \u2019s work to another contractor . Accordingly , by operation of clause CARDINAL of the contracts between ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the fact that ORG had gone into receivership meant that the savings made by ORG became due to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In later pleadings ORG also alleged that the receivers had committed the tort of conversion ( a tort involving the misappropriation of property : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also alleged that this tort had occurred in respect of both its \u201c chattels \u201d ( tangible assets other than freehold land ) and its \u201c choses in action \u201d ( intangible assets such as contractual rights ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of proceedings it was made clear by ORG that its claim for damages was based on the valuation of the business at DATE ( the date on which the receivers took over ) . Its claim was not that the receivers were in breach of the duties they would have owed to ORG had they been validly appointed .", "CARDINAL . ORG also pleaded that these torts were committed on DATE . This had the consequence that the damages which ORG sought were the difference between the value of the business at that date and the amount actually realised by the receivers . ORG did not , however , allege negligence in the way the receivers had realised the assets or allege that there had been any intention on the part of the receivers to cause loss .", "CARDINAL . The High Court gave judgment for ORG on DATE . The trial judge rejected ORG \u2019s submission that , but for the ORG invalid appointment , it would have survived as a business . Instead , he concluded that ORG \u2019s liquidation or insolvency would have occurred even if the receivers had not been appointed .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge also rejected ORG \u2019s submission that the tort of conversion could apply to intangible assets such as contractual rights , finding that there was no basis in the common law for this approach .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge found , however , that ORG could rely on the tort of interference with contractual relations . This tort applied equally to the ORG interference with ORG \u2019s tangible assets and to the ORG interference with ORG \u2019s intangible assets ( such as the ORG contracts ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge accepted that liquidators would have realised a larger sum than the receivers did , particularly in relation to the value of the contracts with ORG . CARDINAL GBP CARDINAL more could have been realised from the contracts than the receivers had achieved . Therefore , he assessed the total damages due to ORG at ORG CARDINAL plus interest in the sum of GBP CARDINAL . The damages as assessed included both ORG \u2019s tangible assets and its intangible assets , such as its rights under the ORG contracts .", "CARDINAL . The receivers and PERSON appealed to ORG . They conceded that ORG could rely on the tort of trespass in respect of ORG \u2019s land , of which the receivers had taken control . They also conceded that ORG could rely on the tort of conversion in respect ORG \u2019s tangible assets , of which the receivers had taken control . However , the receivers and PERSON argued that the torts of conversion and wrongful interference with contractual relations did not allow damages to be recovered in respect of intangible assets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held unanimously that the tort of conversion did not apply to intangible assets . It was not open to the court to invent such a tort .", "CARDINAL . ORG was , however , divided as to whether the tort of wrongful interference with contractual relations allowed damages to be recovered in respect of intangible assets . Lord Justice PERSON and Lord Justice Carnwath found that it did not ; Lord Justice PERSON found that it did .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON considered that the issue was whether the tort of wrongful interference with contractual relations should be extended to cover situations where there was no intention by a third party to procure a breach of a contract or to impede the performance of a contract . He found that there was no authority for extending the tort in this way . To do so would be to change the nature of the tort : it had always required an intention to procure a breach of contract or a breach of duty .", "CARDINAL . For Lord Justice PERSON , the receivers had intended to manage the contractual rights of ORG . There had been an intention to interfere in ORG \u2019s business ( though no intention to cause loss or damage ) . However , this did not amount to an interference with contractual relations in any relevant sense . This conclusion meant ORG \u2019s claim had to be dismissed , a conclusion which he reached \u201c with regret \u201d : the wrongful taking control of intangible assets by an invalidly appointed receiver ought to have had consequences in law . Other claims brought in equity or negligence might have been successful , but ORG \u2019s claim based on tort had to fail .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice Carnwath agreed with Lord Justice PERSON . He found that it would have been a significant extension of the tort if it were to include cases where the interference was not directed at hindering performance of contractual obligations . There was also no policy reason for extending the tort to cases where negligence could not be established ( i.e. to impose strictly liability on the receivers ) . The unusual facts of ORG \u2019s case made it unsuitable for such an extension .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON , dissenting on this issue , found that the receivers had directly interfered with ORG \u2019s contracts with ORG . The interference was not intended to cause loss but , in the circumstances , this was not a prerequisite of liability for the tort . The tort of wrongful interference with contractual relations extended to any situation in which a person \u2019s pre - existing legal situation was altered , even if this did not involve any breach or non - performance of an obligation to a third party . The ORG intervention had changed significantly the way in which ORG \u2019s rights under the ORG contracts had been ascertained and settled . For ORG , this was sufficient for the purposes of the tort of wrongful interference with ORG \u2019s pre - existing legal position . It was immaterial that the receivers did not realise that they were acting without authority . It was also immaterial that they had no intention to cause harm to ORG . It was appropriate to find that an invalidly appointed receiver was strictly liable for interference with tangible assets and that he or she was also strictly liable for interference with contractual relations .", "CARDINAL . By order dated DATE , ORG reduced the amount of damages owed to the applicants to GBP CARDINAL plus interest . ( The difference between the damages as assessed by ORG and those as assessed by ORG is explained by the finding by the majority of ORG that the law of tort did not provide for damages to the applicants in respect of intangible assets , such as their bank account , sums due under contracts , or other debts . )", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to ORG . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , and by a majority of CARDINAL to CARDINAL , ORG upheld ORG judgment and dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The five Law Lords hearing the appeal unanimously rejected ORG \u2019s claim based on an interference with contractual relations . Lord PERSON , who gave the lead speech , held that there were CARDINAL possible causes of action : the tort of procuring a breach of contract or the tort of causing loss by unlawful means . ( Lord PERSON , concurring on this point , observed that there was no \u201c hybrid tort \u201d of interfering with contractual relations . ) It was plain and obvious to Lord PERSON that the requirements for liability under either of these torts were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . For the first , the tort of procuring a breach of contract was a tort of \u201c accessory liability \u201d ( the principle that a person who procures another to commit a wrong incurs liability as an accessory ) . The tort required ( i ) intention to cause a breach of contract and ( ii ) a breach of contract in fact to take place . In ORG \u2019s case , there had not been any breach or nonperformance of a contract . Therefore , there was no wrong to which accessory liability for procuring a breach of contract could attach .", "CARDINAL . For the second , the tort of causing loss by unlawful means required ( i ) the use of unlawful means and ( ii ) an intention to cause loss to the claimant . In ORG \u2019s case the requirements of the tort had not been met either . The receivers had neither used unlawful means nor intended to cause the applicants any loss .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON added that Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s approach ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) referred to the tort of causing loss by unlawful means . Lord PERSON reiterated , however , that this tort required both the use of unlawful means and an intention to cause loss . Neither of these elements was present in the applicants\u2019 case .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON disagreed with Lord Justice PERSON expression of regret that ORG did not have a remedy in law for the acts of the invalidly appointed receivers . He noted that this was not a case in which an invalid appointment of receivers had caused damage to a solvent company . The trial judge had found that ORG would not have survived as a business and that it had been heading for liquidation or insolvency . The receivers had acted in good faith , believing their appointment to be valid . Furthermore , ORG \u2019s liquidators had concurred in the agreement reached with ORG for the full and final settlement of all claims arising under ORG \u2019s contracts with ORG . Therefore , it could not be said that , as a result of the actions of the receivers , ORG had suffered a loss which it would not otherwise have suffered .", "CARDINAL . As to ORG \u2019s claim in respect of the tort of conversion , ORG were divided CARDINAL to CARDINAL . The majority concluded that this claim should also be rejected .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , writing for the majority , noted that the tort of conversion was historically a tort against a person \u2019s interest in a chattel ( tangible asset ) . Consistent with its ancient origin , it was a tort of strict liability ( i.e. a tort which did not require the claimant to prove that the defendant was at fault ) . The law had always been very wary of imposing any kind of liability for \u201c pure economic loss \u201d ( loss which does not arise directly from physical damage or injury ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the torts of procuring a breach of contract and causing loss by unlawful means were highly restricted in their application . They were not torts of strict liability : as he had noted , the tort of procuring a breach of contract required proof of an intention to procure a breach of the contract ; the tort of causing loss by unlawful means required proof of an intention to cause loss ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , it would be an extraordinary step suddenly to extend the tort of conversion to impose strict liability for pure economic loss on receivers who had been appointed and had acted in good faith . Such a step would be for ORG to take .", "CARDINAL . ORG and PERSON agreed with Lord PERSON . They both added that the facts of ORG \u2019s case made it singularly unsuitable for such a major change in law .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON and ORG dissented on this point . Lord PERSON argued that the tort of conversion had been extended in the past to cover not only tangible assets but also certain intangible assets which were embodied or recorded in a document ( such as share certificates ) . He saw no reason why the tort of conversion could not be extended still further to encompass intangible assets which were not so documented . This was a \u201c modest but principled extension \u201d of the doctrine , which fully accorded with the role of the courts in developing the common law and which respected the intentions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it made no sense for the receivers to be strictly liable for what was lost on ORG \u2019s tangible assets but not for what was lost on its intangible assets . It would be inconsistent with principle if the tort of conversion were not extended to encompass both tangible and intangible assets .", "CARDINAL . Part III of LAW DATE deals with administrative receivership . An \u201c administrative receiver \u201d is defined at section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) as being :", "\u201c a receiver or manager of the whole ( or substantially the whole ) of a company \u2019s property appointed by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures of the company secured by a charge which , as created , was a floating charge , or by such a charge and CARDINAL or more other securities . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the same LAW provides that :", "\u201c Where the appointment of a person as the receiver or manager of a company \u2019s property under powers contained in an instrument is discovered to be invalid ( whether by virtue of the invalidity of the instrument or otherwise ) , the court may order the person by whom or on whose behalf the appointment was made to indemnify the person appointed against any liability which arises solely by reason of the invalidity of the appointment . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The administrative receiver of a company \u2013", "is deemed to be the company \u2019s agent , unless and until the company goes into liquidation ;", "is personally liable on any contract entered into by him in the carrying out of his functions ( except in so far as the contract otherwise provides ) and on any contract of employment adopted by him in the carrying out of those functions ; and", "is entitled in respect of that liability to an indemnity out of the assets of the company .", "( CARDINAL ) For the purposes of subsection ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) the administrative receiver is not to be taken to have adopted a contract of employment by reason of anything done or omitted to be done within DATE after his appointment .", "( CARDINAL ) This section does not limit any right to indemnity which the administrative receiver would have apart from it , nor limit his liability on contracts entered into or adopted without authority , nor confer any right to indemnity in respect of that liability . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The acts of an individual as administrator , administrative receiver , liquidator or provisional liquidator of a company are valid notwithstanding any defect in his appointment , nomination or qualifications . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The tort of conversion is based on the ancient tort of \u201c trover \u201d . Historically , trover was based on the fictitious allegation that the claimant had lost a chattel and that the defendant had found it . The modern tort of conversion holds that anyone who \u201c converts \u201d a chattel ( that is , does an act inconsistent with the rights of the owner ) is liable for the loss caused , however innocent he may be . ORG is thus a tort of strict liability .", "ORG Act DATE defines wrongful interference with goods to include conversion of goods . \u201c Goods \u201d is defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to include \u201c all chattels personal other than things [ choses ] in action and money \u201d . The Act thus excludes intangible assets from the tort of conversion ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
