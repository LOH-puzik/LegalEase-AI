The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was diagnosed with type II diabetes and vascular spasms . While riding a bicycle on work - related business on DATE , the applicant suffered a heart attack which caused him to fall . DATE , he also suffered a cerebral stroke . On DATE he reported the accident to ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) of the County of PERSON which granted him early retirement pension as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also requested ORG to grant him life annuity ( livr\u00e4nta ) but , on DATE , ORG rejected the request . It found that the applicant \u2019s medical problems could not be regarded as work - related and that his ability to support himself by working was not sufficiently reduced as a result of the accident . According to medical opinions given on DATE and DATE by PERSON , ORG own medical doctor ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsl\u00e4kare ) , the main reason for the applicant \u2019s inability to work was diabetes , from which he had suffered for DATE at the time of the accident , and some other medical conditions from which he suffered and which together had caused the heart attack and the cerebral stroke . According to him , it was not probable that work - related factors , such as stress , had contributed to the deterioration of the applicant \u2019s physical condition .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s legal counsel appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that the applicant had a right to a life annuity since his illnesses had been work - related . At times he had had CARDINAL different jobs , each one of which , had been hectic and thereby created a difficult and very stressful situation . He produced a medical opinion by Dr. ORG , dated DATE , which stated that known risk factors for arteriosclerosis and heart attack were , among other factors , diabetes , smoking and high blood pressure . Recently , the feeling of severe stress , especially over a long period of time , had been shown to be an element that increased the risk of developing heart and vascular disorders as well . The interaction between various risk factors was complex but , in general , the more risk factors were present , the higher the risk of suffering a heart attack or developing vascular disorders . In the applicant \u2019s case , the physician considered that few risk factors were present and that it was highly probable that his stressful work situation had contributed to the heart attack and cerebral stroke .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . In reaching its decision , the court had regard to the medical certificates by PERSON , which established no link between the work situation and the applicant \u2019s illness , as well as to the medical opinion by Dr. PERSON which suggested that there existed such a link . On the basis of these and the parties\u2019 submissions , the court found that the applicant had been exposed to stress in his work but that the causal link between this fact and the applicant \u2019s medical condition could not be established with a sufficiently high degree of probability .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant , represented by the same legal counsel , appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining his claims . By letter dated DATE the applicant submitted to the court a further medical opinion given by PERSON on DATE which supported the opinion given by PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant requested that ORG hold an oral hearing in the case without , however , giving any reasons for his request . He repeated the request on DATE and specified that he wanted PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and Dr PERSON to be heard before the court about the existence of a causal link between his work and his injury . In another letter , dated DATE , he invoked LAW in relation to his right to an oral hearing and clarified that he wanted an oral hearing to deal with his case as a whole , including the question of leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for an oral hearing , finding that there was no reason to hold one to decide on the question of leave to appeal . The court asked the applicant to complete his written submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a new medical opinion , dated DATE , by PERSON and Dr B.C - D. This medical opinion also supported the opinion given by PERSON that there was a causal link between the applicant \u2019s work and his injury . On DATE the applicant requested again that an oral hearing be held in the case and that all the medical doctors who had submitted opinions be heard to prove that there was a causal link between his work and his injury . He also wanted to be heard himself about his work situation and the stressful environment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal . It noted that leave to appeal should be granted if it was important for the guidance of the application of law that an appellate court consider the appeal , if reasons existed to amend the lower court \u2019s conclusion , or if there were otherwise extraordinary reasons to entertain the appeal . As the court found that no such grounds were at hand , it refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the lower instances and requesting the court either to refer the case back to ORG for an oral hearing or to hold an oral hearing itself . He reiterated that he wanted to be heard himself and also to hear as witnesses the medical doctors whose opinions he had submitted to the court . Having been asked by the court , the applicant specified in his letter dated DATE that he wanted the court to hold an oral hearing even if it was for the purpose of deciding whether or not to grant him leave to appeal . He again invoked LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for an oral hearing as it found no reason to hold one in order to decide on the question of leave to appeal . The applicant was requested to complete his written submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal . It noted that leave to appeal was granted if the case was a precedent case or if serious material or procedural mistakes were involved . As this was not so in the present case , the court found no reason to try the case on its merits .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG ( lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL , hereinafter the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , as in force at the relevant time , the term \u201c work injury \u201d mainly refers to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful factors at a person \u2019s work place ( LAW , LAW ) . Under LAW , all gainfully employed persons working in GPE are insured against work injuries . The insurance scheme is mainly administered by ORG and includes , among other things , compensation for loss of earnings such as life annuity . The ORG must obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury and has physicians with different areas of medical expertise attached to it to assist in this exercise . The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as a work injury , as well as of the degree of reduction of a person \u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment , shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions , the insurance office doctor \u2019s assessment of these opinions and all other relevant information .", "CARDINAL . For an injury to qualify as a work injury , a causal link must be established between the accident or harmful effect in the workplace and the insured person \u2019s health problems . By \u201c harmful effect \u201d was meant the influence of a factor that is very likely to cause an injury or illness such as that suffered by the insured person ( LAW , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the amendments entering into force on DATE , which applied to the applicant \u2019s case , it had to be shown that it was \u201c highly probable \u201d , and not merely \u201c probable \u201d as prior to the amendment , that a certain factor in the working environment could cause a person \u2019s injuries and , thereby , be considered as having harmful effects ( LAW , Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL and p. CARDINAL ) state that this implies that the responsible authorities have to consider more extensively than previously whether the exposure to a harmful effect at work has been of such a degree , intensity and duration that , from this , it can be concluded that the existence of harmfulness is highly probable . Furthermore , the collected knowledge must indicate with a considerable degree of probability that a factor in the environment is harmful . The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted . This is the case where substantial knowledge exists , within medical or other science , that a certain factor has such harmful effects . If there is a lack of support , as when , for example , there are profound differences in expert opinions , this requirement can not be considered fulfilled . Thus , the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effects . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires also state that the more rigid requirement of harmfulness in many cases presupposes more careful investigations at workplaces regarding the harmful factors invoked and that the question of causes of certain diseases has to be discussed more thoroughly . This , in turn , will result in the authorities basing their decisions more extensively on different assessments of harmfulness within medical science .", "CARDINAL . A decision rendered by ORG regarding work injuries may be appealed against to the administrative courts . However , in these cases leave to appeal is required for ORG to consider an appeal on the merits against a decision or judgment delivered by ORG a of ORG , ORG , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW , compared with LAW , LAW of LAW ) . Likewise , leave to appeal is required for ORG to consider on the merits an appeal against a decision or judgment delivered by ORG ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW was worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to ORG emphasise that an oral procedure can be advantageous for the investigation of a case in CARDINAL respects in particular . Firstly , such a hearing may be needed in order to examine a witness , expert or party or in cases where a party has difficulty expounding his or her claim in writing . Secondly , an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute . In the latter case , the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature . Moreover , the oral form of procedure envisaged in the DATE Act is not to be seen as an alternative to the written form , but rather as a complement to that form ( see the Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act underlined , in connection with the provision in section QUANTITY concerning the right of a party to an oral hearing in certain cases , that while serious consideration should be given to the wishes of a party for such a hearing , the party could hardly be allowed to have a decisive influence in the matter . The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case , but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors , for example , if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the import of the decision to be given in the case . CARDINAL particular reason not to arrange an oral hearing could be that the case is of a trivial nature or that the costs of the hearing are high compared to the value of the object of dispute ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG has set aside a number of decisions on appeal and referred cases back to the administrative courts of appeal because of the lack of an oral hearing in the lower courts ( see , for example , R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL , R\u00c5 DATE note DATE , R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL , R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL and R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL ; as more specifically regards work injuries , see R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL and R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL ) . In the last mentioned case , an administrative court of appeal had changed the lower court \u2019s judgment to the applicant \u2019s disadvantage without holding an oral hearing . Furthermore , the applicant had requested that a medical doctor be heard as a witness .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of LAW ( Skadest\u00e5ndslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) deals with the civil liability of the State . According to LAW of that chapter , acts or omissions by a public authority may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault of negligence .", "CARDINAL . An individual who wants to claim compensation from the ORG may proceed in either of CARDINAL different ways : He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) in accordance with LAW on ORG against the State ( F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , or bring a civil action against the ORG before a district court , with the possibility to appeal to a court of appeal and ORG . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts . In such proceedings , the ORG is represented by the Chancellor of ORG ( LAW [ GPE med instruktion f\u00f6r NORP , DATE ] ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with a claim for damages brought by an individual against the NORP State , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW . The case concerned the excessive length of criminal proceedings and ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated . Based on this finding and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . With respect to the level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG took note of the criteria established in the ORG \u2019s case - law stating that the ORG \u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the above - mentioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article CARDINAL should be assessed in the first place under LAW and LAW and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . To the extent necessary , the relevant provisions of domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the LAW . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions . As concerned the determination of the level of compensation , ORG repeated that the ORG \u2019s case - law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from CARDINAL country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under LAW had been violated on the basis that a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above - mentioned cases of DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL to violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In view of this and with reference to , inter alia , LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these ORG , ORG concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damages for the violation of LAW . With regard to the levels of compensation , ORG concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under LAW . Generally speaking these levels should , however , be compatible with the case - law of the Court . In the same case , ORG had also concluded , in a judgment dated DATE , that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL and that an award for non - pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Another Supreme Court judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) concerned a claim for damages against the NORP State on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the LAW father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty , which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage . ORG referred in particular to the judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( NJA DATE N CARDINAL ) , ORG confirmed its previous case - law in a case concerning claims for damages against the NORP State on account of excessive length of tax proceedings . The court affirmed that it is now a general principle of law that to the extent that GPE has a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages , and that this duty can not be fulfilled even by interpreting national tort law in accordance with the LAW f\u00f6rdagskonform tolkning ) , compensation for damages may be ordered without direct support in law .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , on DATE ORG ordered compensation for non - pecuniary damage to be paid to an applicant for proceedings which had complied neither with the \u201c reasonable length \u201d requirement in Article CARDINAL nor the right to an effective remedy in LAW . The proceedings in question had concerned a claim for damages against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the Convention to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damages arising from disregard of the LAW and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its comments on the above report ORG , on DATE , stated that , since the autumn of DATE following ORG case - law developments ( as set out above ) , it had dealt with a large number of requests from individuals for compensation on the basis of violations of the Convention . It estimated that it had dealt with CARDINAL cases over DATE . During this time the Chancellor of ORG had also represented the NORP State in a number of cases before the civil courts concerning alleged violations of the Convention . A majority of the cases that the ORG had dealt with had concerned non - pecuniary damages for excessive length of proceedings under LAW . Since DATE , it had received CARDINAL such complaints and in CARDINAL of them , the Chancellor of ORG had found a violation and granted compensation . The level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage had been determined with reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law and varied CARDINAL and SEK CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LAW ) . Furthermore , the Chancellor of ORG had dealt with a substantial number of cases ( CARDINAL ) concerning the registration of individuals in the Security Police register . These cases had concerned one or more of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention . There had also been other individual cases relating to alleged violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , among others ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
