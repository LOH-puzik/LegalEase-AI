Pauty had told him that he had been a mercenary in the CSTM ( ORG sp\u00e9ciale des troupes m\u00e9tropolitaines ) , then a \u2018 ORG , and had smuggled cars to GPE . PERSON explained that he had found Pauty quick - witted and cunning and had therefore decided that he could give him a second assignment , consisting in obtaining information about PERSON . According to the defendant \u2019s version of events , Pauty was supposed to provide him with information on CARDINAL matters :", "( a ) the amount that Mrs. PERSON had inherited from her father ;", "( b ) whether she was having a house built in GPE ; and", "( c ) whether she had any funds in that country , perhaps as a result of a relationship he knew nothing about .", "A fourth matter also interested him , namely whether his wife had had any contact with the drugs world .", "According to Pauty , he was supposed to go to GPE , murder Mrs. PERSON , for MONEY , covering his tracks by simulating a rape , a burglary or an accident . It is known that at DATE PERSON went with Pauty to a GPE travel agency . For CARDINAL ORG , he bought him a DATE package holiday in GPE and in addition gave him QUANTITY , i.e. CARDINAL ORG , to cover his expenses . Pauty left for GPE on DATE . He went to Port - au - Prince , where Mrs. PERSON spends DATE of DATE . PERSON had given Pauty a photograph of his wife so that he could identify her . PERSON left GPE on DATE and returned to GPE . Having established that PERSON was not in GPE , Pauty completed his stay and returned to GPE on DATE , without moreover having obtained any information whatsoever , except for CARDINAL detail , which was inaccurate - namely that PERSON husband was dead . On his return to GPE , GPE was contacted by PERSON on a date which has not been established precisely , but which must have been DATE ( according to PERSON ) or CARDINAL or DATE ( according to Pauty ) . PERSON claims that he telephoned Pauty from GPE . This is possible , although it has not been proved . But neither has it been established that he rang him from GPE . During this telephone conversation , PERSON learnt that Pauty had returned empty - handed from GPE . He then instructed GPE to come to GPE to continue his assignment . According to Pauty , he was supposed to kill PERSON during DATE of DATE . According to PERSON , that was precisely the week in which GPE was not supposed to come to GPE , because it was then that Mrs. PERSON \u2019s daughter was expected to give birth . Thereafter , there does not appear to have been any direct contact between PERSON and GPE until DATE , when PERSON telephoned GPE . This conversation will be considered further below . On DATE , Pauty sent a telegram to ORG , worded as follows : \u2018 Contact necessary\u2019 . At this stage GPE was totally unaware of ORG \u2019s real identity . DATE , on DATE , when he entered ORG for an operation and after he had led Pauty to believe that he would be away for DATE in LOC , PERSON sent CARDINAL to Pauty in an envelope posted at GPE to the address \u2018 RD poste restante CARDINAL GPE - Gare\u2019 . The defendant underwent his operation at DATE . On DATE , PERSON came to GPE and began to look for Mrs. PERSON . He contacted her by telephone on TIME DATE , having , he claimed , decided to abandon what he alleges to have been his assignment , i.e. to kill Mrs. PERSON , either because he would have had to wait until ORG ostensible return in CARDINAL months\u2019 time to obtain more money , or because he realised that there was something suspicious about ORG \u2019s explanations . On DATE , Pauty met Mrs. PERSON . He explained to her that he had been instructed to kill her . Mrs. PERSON , who was terrified , asked Pauty on whose instructions and has stated that after a certain amount of explanation she realised that the order came from her husband . Pauty then suggested to Mrs. PERSON that she should disappear for a while so that he could collect his fee . Failing that , he proposed killing the defendant . Finally , Pauty and Mrs. PERSON went to the police to tell their story , and on DATE the investigation commenced . On DATE , Pauty was interviewed in GPE and on DATE by the NORP police . On DATE , having received the telegram of CARDINAL May , PERSON rang Pauty from ORG . Pauty , who knew that ORG , i.e. PERSON , would call him sooner or later , had put a cassette in a recorder which he had had for DATE and which belonged to his brother . Using the recorder \u2019s original microphone , he connected the apparatus directly to the second earphone of the telephone in his mother \u2019s flat . He attached the microphone to the earphone by means of self - adhesive tape . PERSON called from a telephone kiosk , although he had a telephone in his hospital room .

The resulting tape could then have been copied on the cassette recorder examined . The expert stated further that he had \u2018 found no evidence\u2019 to suggest that it was such a copy . That did not mean that it was not one , only that the editing would have required a very skilled operator , with sophisticated equipment at his disposal and plenty of time . At the trial the expert further clarified his opinion as follows .", "He explained that he had detected CARDINAL breaks ; that he had not been able to prove that there had been a cut ; that he was almost sure that no editing could have been carried out , since such editing would have required a DATE \u2019s work , even if the necessary equipment had been available . The expert noted in addition that in the most favourable circumstances with regard both to the equipment available and to whether a passage was in a position from which it could technically be simply removed , the removal of a passage would have required TIME work . He had not detected any such removal of a passage .", "Giving evidence on this recording , the defendant admitted that it was his voice . He stated that he did not remember any reference to a body and that he had the impression that the recording had been shortened .", "On the basis of the expert \u2019s findings , the court accepts that the recording which appears in the file is an accurate reproduction of the conversation between the defendant and Pauty on DATE . It considers that , as there is no evidence that the recording has been tampered with and in view of the short time available to GPE between the telephone conversation and his handing over of the cassette to the police , the possibility that the recording was edited can be ruled out . Moreover , having regard to the fact that the recording contained the initial and final greetings , the possibility that the beginning or end of the recording was simply removed without any editing does not arise .", "On CARDINAL and DATE , Pauty sent CARDINAL telegrams to ORG . The first ran : \u2018 GPE OK . GPE OK before CARDINAL . Need GPE d. for cigarettes.\u2019 The second was worded \u2018 Contract completed . Check ORG , no proof possible . Awaiting CARDINAL GPE d. contract before steps HR PERSON does not seem to have received these telegrams .", "court has found that the NORP , between whom there was an age - gap of DATE , were married in DATE . Until DATE it does not seem that the couple experienced any particular problems . It is , however , certain that Mrs. PERSON always felt very lonely . In DATE , whilst Mrs. PERSON was in hospital , an expert , [ A ] , came to discuss with her a draft marriage contract and agreement concerning inheritance rights which PERSON had had prepared . This draft , which provided for a separation of property , stipulated in substance that PERSON should waive any right to succeed to her husband \u2019s estate on the understanding that on his death she would receive a life interest in a portfolio of securities whose real value was to be CARDINAL and a half million CHF , yielding an DATE income of MONEY . It was also provided that if the marriage was dissolved for any reason other than death , PERSON would have a life interest in a portfolio of securities with a real indexed value of DATE half million CHF .", "PERSON refused to sign this agreement . In DATE , she sought protective measures . At DATE , she and her husband ceased to live together . PERSON instituted divorce proceedings in DATE . The spouses saw each other again only at the hearings in those proceedings , which were particularly bitter and lasted DATE . In DATE , PERSON changed lawyers . Since her new lawyer appeared to favour a final settlement as part of a divorce , the defendant \u2019s lawyer informed him of this and told him what he intended to do to compel the new lawyer to raise the problem with Mrs. PERSON and make it easier to persuade the latter to review her position . On DATE , counsel for the defendant wrote to him to inform him that he hoped to be able to fix a date for the final hearing before long . In the event , this hearing was held on DATE , and the divorce decree - which took effect from CARDINAL DATE - confirmed an agreement granting , inter alia , the wife the sum of CARDINAL and a half million CHF in respect of the liquidation of joint assets and an indexed annuity paid in DATE instalments of MONEY .", "The investigation showed that from the beginning of the divorce proceedings PERSON had doubts as to the faithfulness of his wife and suspected in particular that she had had a relationship prior to and during the early stages of the proceedings with a certain [ E ] .", "...", "The trial hearing did not reveal any facts other than those which are set out above . The defendant continued to assert his version of events according to which Pauty was instructed to obtain information and confirmed that , as he saw it , Pauty could get the information in any way that suited him , for example by visiting Mrs. PERSON on some pretext and obtaining the information sought \u2018 either by initiating an intimate relationship or by developing a friendship with her\u2019 . In an interview on DATE the defendant stated that he had wished to obtain the desired information from GPE within DATE if possible . In court he declared that this was not the case , that he had told GPE that he would be away for a while - so that the latter had plenty of time - and that he had instructed GPE that he should not come to GPE during DATE of DATE because Mrs. PERSON \u2019s daughter was due to give birth then . Finally , it had been agreed that Pauty would be paid on PERSON \u2019s ostensible return from abroad on the basis of the information which he provided . For his part , Pauty confirmed that his assignment in GPE was to kill Mrs. PERSON and that he had decided to change his plans when he saw that it would be a long while before he received any more money from ORG .", "PERSON personality is not particularly easy to determine . He was born in DATE and has had a number of somewhat ill - defined jobs . He has worked as a stunt man and has had various problems with the NORP civil and military authorities and with the NORP authorities . Legally he is resident in GPE , but he in fact lives at GPE . It appears that he has occasionally collaborated with the police , particularly the NORP police , on matters related to drugs .", "On the basis of the foregoing considerations , the court has , by a majority , reached the conclusion that PERSON gave to PERSON the assignment of killing PERSON . The court \u2019s view is founded partly on the recording of the telephone conversation of DATE . Where NORP states that he was not able to do the job until DATE , the defendant twice asks him where it happened , which is a ridiculous question if the job was merely a matter of obtaining information . At the end of a long sentence , spoken all at once without drawing breath and in which reference was made to a body taken in a car to somewhere near Montreux and not having been discovered because there had been no mention in the papers , the defendant does not reply \u2018 What on earth is all this nonsense?\u2019 or \u2018 I do n\u2019t understand what you \u2019re talking about\u2019 . He says and asks twice what is going to happen now . When Pauty confirms that the job has been done , the defendant does not say to him \u2018 In that case send me your PERSON , which would have been logical if the assignment had been to obtain information , but says to him , not once but twice , \u2018 it \u2019s odd the job \u2019s been done and there \u2019s been no news , is n\u2019t PERSON . The defendant explained that he wished by this to lead Pauty to believe that his organisation ( a non - existent organisation which was supposed to monitor ORG actions ) had not told him of it . We know that ORG actions were not monitored . We also know that the \u2018 GPE did not exist and that the defendant , who was in hospital , could not have known at the time whether or not Pauty had contacted Mrs. PERSON . Moreover , at the time , this meant that it was absolutely impossible for the defendant - if the assignment in question was to obtain information - to know whether or not Pauty had carried out the assignment . The defendant \u2019s reply is meaningless unless he knew that the job had not been done , and he could not have known this unless the matter was public knowledge , for example because it had appeared in the press - which NORP mentions , moreover . This consideration on its own lends credence to ORG version . But there is also all the other evidence before the court : the unbelievably elaborate precautions taken by the defendant ; the fact that for DATE the defendant had had to pay an allowance to his wife although her misconduct , which the defendant was aware of but unable to prove , would probably have dictated a different assessment of the position ; the fact that the agreement on ancillary matters was about to confirm that situation ; the utter improbability of anyone \u2019s wanting to send a man who claimed to be a former member of ORG and who lacked training , culture and ability to GPE , and then to GPE , to obtain relatively innocuous information which was in any event of dubious relevance for the purpose of the divorce proceedings ; the fact that after the failure of the [ HR ] assignment and the assignment in GPE - from where GPE could at least have been expected to return with the information whether PERSON had or had not had a house built - there was no reason to send GPE to GPE , where he had no contacts ; the fact that the defendant had spent QUANTITY to obtain ( if his version of events is accepted ) very innocuous information ; and , finally , the fact that at no time has the defendant taken any steps to lodge a complaint of malicious accusation .", "The defendant stated that he had no motive to kill [ HR ] . But objectively he scarcely had any greater motive for having him beaten up DATE after an alleged affront , anonymously and at a time when new commercial negotiations had begun . The fact that the private detectives he had employed had not yielded particularly good results did not mean that some kind of legionnaire who was more or less a police informer would be able to do any better . An intelligent person - and the accused is intelligent - does not replace the intelligence officer of a battalion with the commander of a company of grenadiers . The fact that the divorce proceedings were about to reach a conclusion did not alter the fact that a relationship established after DATE of separation would have very little effect on the amount of maintenance or the fact that the moment when it would be necessary to liquidate joint assets and pay an allowance which PERSON knew to have been obtained unjustly was approaching . The fact that Pauty did not receive a large advance is not decisive , since it is not difficult to appreciate that PERSON wanted to see results before paying . This mistrust might moreover explain why Pauty changed sides . The defendant considered it inconceivable that Pauty should not have received a large advance , seeing that he had no means of finding ORG , of whose identity he was unaware . That would be true if there had been only a single assignment , but not in the case of several . Moreover , the argument applies equally to an assignment to obtain information . It may be noted in passing that if it had been a question merely of information , it would not have mattered if Pauty had come to GPE in DATE in which Mrs. PERSON \u2019s daughter was due to give birth .", "The defendant put forward other suppositions , namely that Pauty tampered with the recording and used it to some extent with Mrs. PERSON \u2019s co - operation . There is , however , no evidence to support this theory . It should further be noted in connection with the recording that the defendant , who is hard of hearing ( he suffers from a PERCENT hearing loss ) , claimed that he did not understand what Pauty said on the telephone . This assertion is not consistent with the defendant \u2019s concise and clear questions and replies , or with the fact that he never said that he had not heard or that he had misheard what Pauty said to him . On the basis of all these considerations , therefore , the court has reached the conclusion that in regard to Mrs. PERSON the assignment given to GPE was to kill her .", "In the case of [ E ] , no steps were taken to carry out the assignment of giving him a beating . As far as [ HR ] is concerned , the court has been unable to reach a conclusion .", "The investigation into the charges against the defendant ended in a finding that there was no case to answer . On appeal by the prosecution , the defendant was committed for trial at FAC . During the investigation he was held on remand for DATE .", "Information obtained regarding the defendant \u2019s character is favourable . He is well known and respected in ORG . He is extremely wealthy . He has never had any dealings with the police and has never been convicted . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed on points of law . He complained in particular of the recording , arguing that it had been obtained unlawfully , after the investigation had commenced and with the aim of securing prosecution evidence ; moreover , its use contravened the criminal law and it had played a part as direct evidence in the trial .", "In a preliminary submission on DATE , ORG of the GPE of GPE contended that the court should dismiss the appeal . He expressed the view that \" the disputed recording [ had been ] made in the context of criminal proceedings and at the request of police officers \" . He did not provide any additional information on this point .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG of ORG dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\" The impugned judgment states expressly that the trial court relied partly on the disputed recording . Moreover , there is no doubt that the recording was such as to have a perhaps decisive influence , or at the least a not inconsiderable one , on the outcome of the criminal proceedings .", "Criminal procedure is subject to the inquisitorial principle , the aim of the trial being , by getting as close as possible to what actually happened , to establish the facts of the case and then to apply the law to the facts found . That being so , it is not possible to exclude automatically all evidence whose source is unlawful or criminal . However , the quest for the truth should not be carried out at the expense of disregarding principles which are sometimes more important ( Walder , \u2018 GPE erlangte ORG i m Strafprozess\u2019 , RPS [ Revue p\u00e9nale GPE ] DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . In ORG \u2019s view ( Initiation \u00e0 la justice p\u00e9nale en GPE , p. CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) , justice must be administered in accordance with the rules of good faith .", "According to precedent , which is scarce , the use of evidence which has been obtained unlawfully is excluded only where such evidence could not have been obtained under the existing law , but not where only a procedural rule has been infringed which was neither intended nor apt to prevent the search for evidence ( RO [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL I CARDINAL , c.

But the distinction between unlawfulness and procedural irregularity is often a fine one ( PERSON , \u2018 Probleme und Tendenzen i m Strafprozess\u2019 , RPS DATE , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "The criterion established by precedent has been considered unsatisfactory by academic opinion ( PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , ORG .

CARDINAL ) .", "In any event , as far as the admissibility of evidence is concerned , it is not decisive that it has been obtained by means of a criminal offence .", "ORG notes that as a general rule it is not so much the evidence as such as the manner in which the evidence has been obtained which may preclude its use ( p. CARDINAL ) . He distinguishes between the infringement of an important right and that of a purely procedural requirement , and between evidence obtained judicially and evidence obtained extrajudicially ( p. CARDINAL ) . In his view , certain evidence can not be used directly , although its indirect use , i.e. the use of evidence obtained as a result of it , is possible ( p. CARDINAL ) , or at least the use which has been made of evidence obtained unlawfully can not be disregarded ( p. CARDINAL ) . PERSON concludes that it is necessary to consider each case individually to determine whether the unlawfulness in question is so serious that the illegally obtained evidence can not be used ; this can be done only by weighing up the interests and rights at stake ( p. CARDINAL ) . Thus , in this author \u2019s view , it is entirely permissible to use information regarding the commission of a serious crime which has been obtained in breach , for example , of statutory provisions on telephones ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "In ORG view ( PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , it is necessary to assess the rules under which evidence may be excluded as inadmissible in terms of what they were intended to protect . Evidence obtained in breach of a prohibition designed to obviate risks associated with establishing the truth - such as an extorted confession - must be excluded .", "Generally speaking , it is accepted that the investigating authorities are prohibited from using coercion or threats , or from resorting to false statements or misleading questions ( PERSON , ORG . GPE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , PERSON , p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL II CARDINAL , and p. CARDINAL , para . QUANTITY ; Walder , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Examination of the foregoing in the light of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW , under which an accused may not be convicted unless proved guilty according to law , does not give rise to any different distinctions ( see in particular GPE , GPE protection de l\u2019accus\u00e9 par la FAC , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . According to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW ORG [ ORG ] , interference by a public authority with private life or with correspondence is permissible only where it is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of , inter alia , public safety and the prevention of disorder or crime .", "In the PERSON judgment of DATE , ORG took the view that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance over the mail , post and telecommunications is , under exceptional conditions , necessary in a NORP society . It recognised that , as regards the fixing of the conditions under which the system of surveillance was to be operated , the legislature enjoyed a certain discretion ( ORG A , no . CARDINAL , paras . CARDINAL and DATE , p. CARDINAL ; see the arguments before ORG of ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , esp . pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "In an earlier case , ORG took the view , on CARDINAL DATE , that the tape recording of a private conversation unbeknown to the participants or CARDINAL of them constituted in principle an interference with privacy but that the use by the court of the recording in evidence did not infringe the right to a fair trial guaranteed in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . The Commission expressed the same view ( ORG DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "More recently , ORG observed in a NORP case that the fact that the authorities charged with the telephone tapping generally did not fully respect the directives given to them - however regrettable it might be - did not by itself constitute a violation of the Convention , in particular of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW ( DATE , Decisions and Reports no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It is worth noting further that the ORG has accepted , firstly , that police officers may take confidential information from persons with a legitimate interest in remaining anonymous , failing which much information needed if crimes are to be punished would never be brought to the knowledge of the prosecuting authorities ; and , secondly , that the statements of an informant could be taken into consideration where the jury \u2019s attention had been drawn to the status of a statement which was not corroborated under oath during the proceedings in court and where the accused had been able to produce in court various witnesses who denied that the events in question had occurred ( CARDINAL DATE , Decisions and Reports no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "It may be inferred from the foregoing that the view taken by the institutions responsible for the application of the ORG is no stricter than the one adopted by ORG in the decisions cited .", "The rules set out and discussed here , which concern the investigating authorities , can not as such apply to evidence unlawfully obtained by private individuals . Certain methods which are unacceptable in the case of the former are not necessarily so in the case of the latter ( Walder , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . Academic writers accept , for example , that a victim of threats or blackmail may be compelled , where evidence of the fact is otherwise difficult to obtain , to make a secret recording of the perpetrator \u2019s statements ( ORG , p. CARDINAL ; Walder , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . As regards the acts of a private investigator , opinion is divided . PERSON considers that there are no grounds for distinguishing such investigators from official ones , since the dangers of falsifying facts are even greater ( PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . Previous decisions of the courts have left the question open ( RO CARDINAL V CARDINAL ; FAC , CARDINAL ; ORG DATE no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It would have been unlawful for the police to record a telephone conversation in GPE without the authorisation of a judge . However , such authorisation could have been granted , since the investigation was instituted as a result of a serious criminal offence , by virtue of Art . CARDINAL octies ORG . The disputed recording does not in itself constitute prohibited evidence either under NORP law or under the rules laid down by ORG . It may be conceded to the appellant that even in the absence of any complaint , the private recording of GPE \u2019s telephone conversation with the defendant amounts to an offence in itself ( RO CARDINAL IV CARDINAL CARDINALa , PERSON ) . On the other hand , the rule that was infringed - Art . CARDINAL bis ORG - protects individual privacy and is not designed to eliminate the risk of mistake .", "Moreover , if regard is had to the balance of the interests and rights at stake , as ORG recommends , it must be recognised that the difference between authorised tapping and unauthorised recording is not in itself sufficient to justify attaching greater importance to the protection of privacy than to the public interest in exposing a person guilty of a serious crime .", "The method used by Pauty to obtain the appellant \u2019s incriminating statements is undoubtedly contrary to the rules of good faith , since it consisted in stating untruthfully that the killer \u2019s assignment had been carried out , which amounted to ORG laying a trap for his interlocutor . However , although any attempt by the authorities to incite a person to commit an offence is open to censure , the stratagem of inducing an offender to confess to a crime is not ( PERSON , \u2018 PERSON moeurs de la police et la PERSON , in Varia Juridica CARDINAL , esp . p. CARDINAL ) . Thus the use of violence or even deceit to obtain a statement is unlawful but , on the other hand , it is permissible to use a trick ( PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . Such a practice is common on the part of the authorities where , for example , the lives of hostages are in danger . Besides , a given method might be legitimate in CARDINAL case and immoral in another ( op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It follows that the means used in this case remained within the limits of what is acceptable for the purposes of combating crime . In any event , the deceit concerned only one matter , namely the performance of the act contemplated .", "In sum , the contested evidence is admissible under NORP law and does not infringe the appellant \u2019s fundamental rights . Although the recording was made and acquired by the police in GPE , it is unnecessary to consider any more extensive rights which might exist under foreign law . After all , GPE also allows telephone tapping and the recording of telephone conversations , even though LAW Criminal Code likewise penalises such recording where it is not authorised by the competent authority ( PERSON , ORG p\u00e9nale , DATE , p. CARDINAL , ORG . CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) . Furthermore , although in GPE attempted incitement is not an offence , it would have been possible under LAW of DATE , to which GPE and GPE have acceded , for GPE to issue letters rogatory requesting such monitoring . Unlike GPE , GPE has not made a reservation whereby execution of any letters rogatory requiring a coercive measure is conditional on the alleged offence \u2019s being punishable in both the requesting and the requested country . Telephone monitoring is regarded as equivalent to such a measure ( ORG PERSON GPE in GPE , GPE thesis , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "The appellant argues further that authorised tapping would have provided all the necessary safeguards as to the accuracy and completeness of the recording . An authorised recording inevitably constitutes more weighty evidence than a private recording , in view of the risk of faking in the second case . However , in this instance the circumstances of the recording were known and an expert report , for the purpose of which the cassette and the recorder had been examined , was made available to the court . The court also knew how much time had elapsed between the recording and the handing over of the recorded tape to the police . It was thus able to assess the value of the evidence having regard to its authenticity .", "The use of a trick or subterfuge is similarly liable to affect the weight attributed to statements obtained in such a manner . The trial court was , however , in a position to assess the weight to be attached to the defendant \u2019s statements in the light of such a manner of proceeding , as the recording moreover reproduced a complete telephone conversation . In this respect too the contested evidence is admissible . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON lodged a public - law appeal and an application for a declaration of nullity with ORG against the judgment of ORG . Both were founded on the same complaints regarding the disputed recording . The applicant claimed in substance that the recording was unlawful ; that ORG should therefore have ruled it inadmissible as evidence ; and that in not so doing , the court had infringed in particular LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW , which guarantees the secrecy of communications , LAW implementing LAW of DATE and ORG CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ) dismissed the public - law appeal on the following grounds :", "\" ( a ) It can be accepted that the ingredients of an offence under Art . CARDINAL ter CC were present as far as the disputed recording is concerned . However , Pauty made the recording in order to prove the truth of his statements at a time when he was under investigation for attempted murder . If a complaint had been lodged under Art . CARDINAL ter , it is not certain that the proceedings would have resulted in the imposition of a sentence . But this question can remain open . The provisions of LAW and of the VACC LAW implementing LAW ] concerning telephone tapping define lawful and unlawful tapping and fix the penalties for the latter . They contain no rules for determining the validity of such tapping as evidence at a trial .", "( b ) It is true that NORP law authorises infringement of personal rights and of the confidentiality of communications in the form of telephone tapping only where such a measure has been ordered by the competent authority and approved by a judge . To conclude from this that any evidence derived from unauthorised tapping must never in any circumstances be used in evidence would be to adopt too dogmatic a position and would often lead to absurd results ( see PERSON , \u2018 GPE erlangte ORG i m Strafprozessrecht\u2019 , in DATE , pp .

CARDINAL ; see also PERSON , \u2018 PERSON zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen Stand der PERSON Beweisverboten i m Strafverfahren\u2019 , in GPE juristische PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . In such a case it is necessary to balance , on the one hand , the interest of the ORG in having a specific suspicion confirmed or disproved and , on the other , the legitimate interest of the person concerned in the protection of his personal rights . To this end , all the relevant circumstances should be taken into consideration .", "In GPE , ORG has reached the same conclusion . In a case where a person was suspected of having committed offences involving tax evasion , fraud and forgery of documents , the court refused to attach any probative weight to a recording made privately . It considered , however , that the position would have been different if there had been an imperative community interest at stake which took precedence over the private interest of the person concerned ; thus it held that it would not generally be contrary to constitutional law , in cases of necessity , to allow the authorities to use a recording that had been made by CARDINAL party and which could lead to the identification of a criminal or exculpate a person who had been wrongly accused , where serious offences were involved , such as offences against the person , serious attacks on the constitutional order and democratic freedoms , and offences against legally protected interests of the same order ( Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts DATE - pp . CARDINAL et seq . , esp . CARDINAL ) .", "In the instant case , it is necessary to weigh , on the one hand , the interest in confirming or proving unfounded the specific suspicions that PERSON was guilty of incitement to murder and , on the other , PERSON \u2019s interest in preserving the confidentiality of his conversation with Pauty . The conclusion is inescapable that the public interest in having the truth established in the matter of an offence relating to murder overrides PERSON \u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of a telephone conversation which in no way bore upon his privacy but related exclusively to the completion of an assignment entrusted to GPE . The need to protect a person \u2019s privacy can not have the effect of making such a recording inadmissible as evidence in criminal proceedings when there are strong suspicions concerning a very serious offence ( see PERSON , op . cit . , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "Moreover , it is relevant to point out that NORP law authorises tapping the telephone of an individual suspected of involvement in a crime . Admittedly , such tapping is subject to authorisation by a judge , but the recording of a conversation is not , as such , evidence which the ORG would have refrained from using as a matter of principle and in order to protect the higher interests of the individual . This type of evidence can not be compared with a truth drug , coercion or torture , which are absolutely prohibited as a matter of public policy . Accordingly , there would have been no legal bar to prevent the same recording , made in GPE on the line of the telephone kiosk in the hospital where PERSON was staying , from being lawful and being admitted in evidence . It follows that an infringement of personal rights which does not amount to a breach of the LAW under NORP law - when certain conditions are satisfied - may be classified as minor where it could have been ordered under Art . CARDINAL octies para . CARDINAL CC ( see ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL I CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) In this case , as PERSON was strongly suspected of having participated in a crime intended to result in a person \u2019s death ; as the judge would have been entitled to order that his conversation of CARDINAL DATE with Pauty should be recorded ; as it was the latter who made such a recording while under investigation for attempted murder with or without premeditation ; and as the conversation did not concern facts of an intimate nature , the [ FAC was entitled to refuse to rule the tape inadmissible in evidence and could assess it as evidence without infringing NORP constitutional law .
