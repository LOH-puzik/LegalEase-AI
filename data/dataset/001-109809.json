On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardian ad litem submitted his observations to ORG . Following a visit to the family home , he concluded that there existed a strong social and family relationship between the child and PERSON , and considered that it was most important to assure that the child was allowed to grow up undisturbed within her family .

On DATE , during the hearing , the parties unanimously declared that a social and family relationship existed between Mr E. and the child . Following the hearing , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . According to that court , the applicant was precluded from contesting paternity under LAW ( see Relevant domestic law , below ) because a social and family relationship existed between the child and her legal father . He did not have the right to have his paternity established or to demand genetic testing because the child already had a legal father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal lodged on DATE . It noted that it was no more in dispute between the parties that a social and family relationship existed between the child PERSON and her legal father , who , in the meantime , had married the child \u2019s mother and fathered CARDINAL further children . Confirming ORG judgment , that court further considered that the relevant legislation did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under the NORP constitution and under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . Referring to its own constant case - law and to the case - law of ORG , ORG considered that the legislature had been entitled to let the interests of the child and of her legal parents prevail over the biological father \u2019s interest to have his paternity legally established and to preclude the biological father from contesting paternity . There was no room for the court to examine in individual cases whether it was necessary in the child \u2019s best interests to allow the presumed biological father to contest paternity . This general approach also protected the concerned families from being forced to reveal intimate details of their family life .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further confirmed that the applicant \u2019s request to have his paternity established was inadmissible as the child already had a legal father . Relying on the case - law of ORG , the court considered that PERSON acknowledgment of paternity had been valid and that the relevant legislation did not violate the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights . It was , in particular , justifiable to make acknowledgement of paternity dependent on the mother \u2019s consent . The legislature was not obliged to make acknowledgment of paternity dependent on a genetic examination of descent . It was acceptable to base the granting of legal status on an assumption which was based on specific factual and social situations . Such an assumption existed if a man declared in a legally binding way and with the express consent of the mother of a child born out of wedlock that he was willing to assume parental responsibility . ORG further considered that the child \u2019s rights were sufficiently protected by her own right to challenge paternity upon reaching the age of majority .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the LAW protected a man \u2019s interest to learn whether a child was his descendant and to have this fact legally established . However , this did not include the right to examine descent in any conceivable case . When developing the procedure for examining a child \u2019s true descent , the legislature had to take into account the child \u2019s interest in the stability of his legal and social - family affiliation and the mother and child \u2019s interest not to have personal data and intimate circumstances revealed , and had done so in an acceptable way . There was , in particular , no right under LAW to have biological descent legally established as long as another man \u2019s legal paternity persisted .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that the applicant \u2019s alternative request to order the child to undergo genetic testing was inadmissible , because such a request had to be lodged in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a complaint by the applicant , ORG confirmed its judgment of DATE and stated that the alternative request to clarify the child \u2019s genetic descent was not inadmissible but unfounded , as LAW did not entitle the presumed biological father to demand genetic testing . Relying on ORG case - law , ORG considered that the applicant did not have the right to have biological paternity established without establishing legal paternity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , everyone is equal before the law ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; men and women have equal rights ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The ORG shall watch over them in the performance of this duty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child \u2019s father is either the man who on the date of the child \u2019s birth was married to the child \u2019s mother ( no . CARDINAL ) , or the man who acknowledged paternity ( no . CARDINAL ) , or whose paternity is judicially established under LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) . An acknowledgement of paternity is not valid as long as the paternity of another man exists ( LAW ) . Paternity can only be validly acknowledged with the mother \u2019s consent ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Paternity may be challenged within a time - limit of DATE . The period commences on the date on which the entitled person learns of the circumstances that militate against the established paternity ; and the existence of a social and family relationship does not prevent the period from running ( LAW ) . Under LAW , entitlement to challenge paternity lies with the man whose paternity exists under LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , with the mother and with the child , and also with the man who makes a statutory declaration that he had sexual intercourse with the child \u2019s mother during the period of conception . However , under LAW , the biological father has a right to challenge the paternity of the man who is the child \u2019s legal father under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL only if there is no social and family relationship between the legal father and the child . A social and family relationship is considered to exist if the legal father has or had actual responsibility for the child at the relevant point in time . There is , as a rule , an assumption of actual responsibility if the legal father is married to the mother of the child or has lived together with the child in a domestic community for a long period of time ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW as in force since DATE , the legal father , the mother and the child can request the examination of paternity by genetic testing . The outcome of these proceedings does not change the legal status of the persons involved . However , no such right is granted to a third person alleging that he is the biological father .", "CARDINAL . Research undertaken by ORG in respect of PERCENT ORG GPE shows that in CARDINAL of those GPE acknowledgment of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock requires the mother \u2019s consent . In GPE ( namely GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , the presumed biological father is entitled to challenge the legal paternity of a third party established by acknowledgment . This right may be subject to certain time - limits . In GPE this remains the position where the legal father has lived with the child in a social and family relationship . In GPE and GPE , the biological father may not challenge paternity if the child has lived in a social and family relationship with the legally acknowledged father for a period of CARDINAL or DATE , respectively ( la possession d\u2019\u00e9tat conforme au titre ) .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , in CARDINAL GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) the biological father does not have standing to challenge the paternity of the legal father established by acknowledgement . In those CARDINAL jurisdictions , the courts are not entitled to judicially consider ( on the grounds of the best interests of the child or otherwise ) whether the biological father should be allowed to challenge paternity .", "CARDINAL . None of the Member GPE examined provide a procedure to establish biological paternity without formally challenging the recognised father \u2019s paternity and without changing the child \u2019s legal status ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1", "8-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
