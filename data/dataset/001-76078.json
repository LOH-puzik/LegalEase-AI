NORP In DATE the applicant was employed at the refinery \u201c T. \u201d as director of a department . DATE the conditions of his contract of employment were changed several times . On DATE the refinery gave notice to terminate the applicant \u2019s contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG a compensation claim against the refinery , in the amount of ORG CARDINAL , for unlawful termination of his contract . He also claimed reinstatement . By a decision of DATE ORG considered that it was not competent to examine his case and transmitted it to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the refinery to pay the applicant compensation of ORG CARDINAL for unlawful termination of the employment contract . The compensation corresponded to CARDINAL months\u2019 remuneration . The court dismissed the remaining claims .", "CARDINAL . Both parties to the proceedings appealed against the first - instance judgment . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed their appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to grant legal aid for the purpose of instituting cassation proceedings . He referred to his difficult financial situation and to the fact that he had been unemployed from DATE to DATE due to the termination of his employment contract by the defendant company . He also submitted that from DATE he had been receiving a net salary of ORG CARDINAL and submitted documents to show the period of his unemployment and his earnings . In DATE the applicant , having received no response from ORG , lodged a cassation appeal himself .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed his request for legal aid for the purpose of instituting the cassation proceedings without giving written reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal on the ground that it had not been lodged by a lawyer , as required by the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against these decisions with ORG . He also requested the grant of retrospective leave to lodge a cassation appeal out of time . He further asked that court to appoint a lawyer for him in order to assist him in the preparation of his appeal . The applicant argued that ORG had failed to deal within the time - limit with his request for legal aid . This had forced the applicant to lodge the cassation appeal himself . The fact that the cassation appeal had been rejected , combined with the unmotivated refusal of legal aid , had made it impossible to have his interests protected and his arguments properly presented to the cassation court .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed his appeal against the decision rejecting the cassation appeal . The court observed that the applicable law clearly provided that a cassation appeal could only be lodged by a lawyer . ORG further refused to entertain the appeal in so far as it was related to the refusal of legal aid , observing that under the applicable legal provisions an appeal to ORG against an interlocutory decision of ORG was only available against a decision to reject a cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family \u2019s standard of living .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to ORG CARDINAL of the Code , persons exempted from the court fees may request that legal aid be granted to them . The court will then request the relevant ORG or ORG to assign an advocate or a legal adviser to the claimant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . LAW lays down the principle of mandatory assistance of an advocate in cassation proceedings . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , applicable at the relevant time , required that a cassation appeal be filed by an advocate or a legal adviser .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within DATE from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned . Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser would be rejected .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure guarantees to a party to the proceedings a right to appeal against a decision of the first - instance court which terminates the proceedings . Such an interlocutory appeal ( za\u017calenie ) is also available against certain interlocutory decisions , specified in this provision . An appeal is available against a refusal of exemption from court fee and , likewise , against a refusal of legal aid , when such decisions were given by a first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . ORG held in a number of its decisions that no appeal to ORG is available against an interlocutory decision on legal aid given by a second - instance court . It observed that a decision on legal aid was expressly mentioned in a list of interlocutory decisions against which an appeal was specifically provided for under LAW , but only when they were given by the first - instance court . Furthermore , under this provision an appeal was available against decisions which terminated the proceedings in the case . However , the court noted that a refusal of legal aid could not be regarded as \u201c terminating the proceedings in the case \u201d within the meaning of this provision because this notion had to be reserved for decisions containing a certain element of assessment of the merits of a given claim . The decisions on legal aid issues did not contain such elements . As they did not fall into either of the CARDINAL principal categories listed in Article CARDINAL , the only possible conclusion was that no appeal was available against them ( II CZ CARDINAL , DATE , unpublished ; I ORG CARDINAL , DATE , OSNC DATE , No .
