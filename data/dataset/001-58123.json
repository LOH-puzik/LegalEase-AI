The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and resides in GPE .", "In DATE he was called up for military service but his duty to report for service was suspended until DATE because of his studies . Prior to this date he declared in writing to the army that he objected to performing any kind of military or substitute civilian service .", "On DATE he presented himself at ORG ( p\u00e4\u00e4esikunta , huvudstaben ) and submitted a petition against military service . After having reiterated his petition DATE he was arrested on suspicion of having avoided service . He was eventually brought to the barracks of ORG ( PERSON barracks \u201d ) at PERSON , where he had been due to report on DATE . On his renewed objection to carrying out military duties his arrest was prolonged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kihlakunnanoikeus , h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand in FAC of GPE . On DATE ORG convicted and sentenced him to imprisonment ( suspended ) for having avoided military service from DATE to DATE and for having committed an offence in service on DATE ( Chapter DATE , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the DATE LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflag CARDINAL as amended by Act no .

On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL offences in service and sentenced him to further imprisonment . The sentence was to be served at DATE . ORG in addition revoked the order to release the applicant on parole .", "CARDINAL . After the court hearing on DATE , the applicant was , as had occurred on previous occasions , taken back to FAC before being released .", "In the ORG check - out room , a military police squad consisting of conscripts and headed by NORP , a corporal , waited for the applicant . In the prison courtyard he was handcuffed and informed of his arrest . He was subsequently taken to the military police vehicle outside the prison gate . Members of his support group , who had been waiting for him outside the gate , were photographing and videotaping the incident .", "He was then taken back to the PERSON barracks at LOC , situated QUANTITY from GPE , a journey which normally takes TIME by car .", "Following his arrival at the PERSON barracks , the applicant was taken to the military hospital at the compound . He was released from his handcuffs in the hospital \u2019s entry hall .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the measures taken by the military police had all been against his will . In the ORG \u2019s submission , he had consented to being transported to the military hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not undergo any medical examination at the military hospital but was subjected to further questioning by army personnel on DATE , during which he renewed his objection to military service . As a result he was re - arrested at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ordered his detention on remand in LOC . On DATE he started serving the aggregated prison sentence imposed by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of an offence committed in service on DATE and sentenced to further imprisonment . In its judgment ORG stated that he had been deprived of his liberty as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from prison on parole . As he continued to object to military service he was twice detained on remand , in DATE and DATE , and was convicted of further offences in service and sentenced to further imprisonment .", "On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was discharged from his military service for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a petition with ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ; \u201c the Ombudsman \u201d ) , complaining in particular about the deprivation of his liberty from DATE and the related handcuffing . He emphasised that at no moment had he attempted to escape from the military police or otherwise shown any intention of doing so . He had also been handcuffed on DATE and DATE while being transported to FAC after ORG hearings .", "In his petition the applicant also submitted that , on his arrival at the Brigade on DATE , NORP had asked him whether he would agree to go to the military hospital . The applicant had then restated his objection to performing any kind of service but he had not consented to going to the hospital , as was shown by the fact that he had been handcuffed until his arrival there . At any rate , he had not acted in a way which could lead anyone to believe that he had wished to receive hospital care .", "CARDINAL . Heard as a suspect at the ORG \u2019s request , PERSON stated that he had been instructed by ORG of the PERSON barracks to bring the applicant back to the compound . After the applicant had been released in the prison courtyard , NORP had ordered the military police to apprehend him . According to the training provided to members of military police squads , a person who was to be arrested was to be informed thereof and was also to be handcuffed . On the applicant \u2019s return to the PERSON barracks , NORP had been instructed by the Duty Officer to ask the applicant whether he would agree to take up his military service . As he objected he had , with his own consent , been brought to the military hospital . As far as NORP could remember , the applicant had been released from his manacles in the hospital yard .", "CARDINAL . NORP The army authority in ORG told the ORG that the purpose of the applicant \u2019s apprehension had been to ensure that he would remain in the hands of the military authorities , given that he had been ordered to take up his service at that compound . The military police had not been given any instructions concerning his transportation in handcuffs . Nor did the situation as a whole seem to have required such a measure , considering that his arrest had not been ordered and , as on previous occasions , he was only to be returned to the FAC barracks . In view of his repeated convictions for military offences , NORP had nevertheless considered that the applicant \u2019s handcuffing was necessary in order to ensure his return to the PERSON barracks .", "CARDINAL . ORG made the following observations to the ORG . The applicant \u2019s arrest had taken place immediately on his release by the prison authorities . There was no evidence at that time that he continued to object to performing military service or to returning to his military compound with the military police . The measures ordered by ORG appeared to have been based on the applicant \u2019s earlier repeated objections to performing any kind of service and the likelihood that this would continue . Moreover , his support group had been disturbing NORP during the incident .", "ORG nevertheless conceded that , on the basis of the evidence available , there had been no acceptable grounds for arresting the applicant , which measure had stemmed from the fact that NORP had made an incorrect assessment of the situation in combination with the surrounding circumstances . Nor had there been any justification for handcuffing the applicant . According to the relevant permanent instructions , manacles could be used temporarily in order to calm down a person behaving violently who was to remain in the hands of the authorities or if there was a specific reason for suspecting that he would escape . Although the applicant had , on several occasions , committed punishable acts and his support group had attended his release from FAC , it had not been likely that he would escape on that occasion .", "CARDINAL . In his decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG noted that the military authorities had had no reason to fear that the applicant would attempt to escape . On previous occasions the latter had in fact presented himself voluntarily to them . The ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE had lacked a legal basis since , prior to the measure , he had not been asked whether he would persist in his refusal to perform military or substitute service . The ORG furthermore stated :", "\u201c There were no objectively justifiable grounds for putting PERSON in handcuffs . Apparently NORP proceeded in this situation as he had been trained to do .", "When evaluating the actions of NORP , one must take into consideration his inexperience and the rather general nature of the directions which he had received from his brigade . NORP himself believed that he acted in accordance with orders . A more experienced military person should have been assigned to fetch PERSON from FAC . It is not even claimed that NORP \u2019s behaviour was inappropriate in any other respect . In my opinion , and taking into consideration the circumstances , this action does not call for measures to be taken against NORP by the ORG . \u201d", "In addition , he urged ORG and the PERSON Commander to see to it that in both the training and activities of the military police a clear distinction was made between situations arising in times of peace and of war .", "The ORG did not order that criminal charges be brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON convicted the applicant of refusal to carry out military service under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Military Service Act ( asevelvollisuuslaki , v\u00e4rnpliktslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended with effect from DATE ) . This provision authorised the punishment of a conscript who categorically objected to performing military service , who did not opt for substitute civilian service and whose behaviour would not change as a result of punishment imposed under LAW of LAW .
