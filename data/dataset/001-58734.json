The facts of the case , particularly concerning events on CARDINAL and DATE when PERSON , the applicant 's brother , was apprehended by gendarmes during an operation at the village of ORG and went to hospital for emergency medical treatment of a serious head injury , were disputed by the parties . The Commission , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "The Commission delegates heard witnesses in GPE from CARDINAL to DATE and on CARDINAL DATE . The witnesses included the applicant ; his brother PERSON ; PERSON , the villager who was apprehended during the same operation ; PERSON , the commander of the PERSON central gendarmerie , in charge of the operation at ORG ; PERSON , the commander of the local gendarmerie station at Konakl\u0131 ; ORG , a gendarme doing his military service at ORG ; PERSON , the doctor who examined PERSON at ORG ; PERSON , who treated PERSON at ORG ; Dr PERSON , from ORG ; PERSON , the GPE public prosecutor ; and PERSON , a soldier with paramedical training who had served at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE 's findings of fact , which are accepted by the applicant , are set out in its report of DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The relevant domestic proceedings and the ORG 's submissions concerning the facts are also summarised below ( Sections B and C ) .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan lived in the village of ORG , located in the south - east region of GPE , CARDINAL to QUANTITY from the town of GPE . It came under the jurisdiction of the gendarmerie command at GPE . The nearest gendarmerie station was at PERSON , several villages away . The central provincial gendarmerie commander , PERSON , knew the village . He had been informed that the PERSON family cooperated with the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) who were very active in the region at this time . He also suspected the villager PERSON of involvement with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Aytepe village was located on high ground in a hilly area . There was a garden area below the village to the south , described as containing fruit trees and bushes . The descriptions of this area given by witnesses before the ORG 's delegates varied . It was common ground that there were stone walls in the garden which were in places quite high . There were rivers or streams to the east and west of this area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , shortly before dawn , the GPE gendarmes , under PERSON command and assisted by men from PERSON station , started an operation at Aytepe village . The report by PERSON central provincial gendarmerie command stated that a villager , PERSON , was wanted for harbouring QUANTITY persons wanted for aiding and abetting the ORG . The weather was very cold , with snow on the ground .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan and PERSON saw the soldiers approaching the village from the surrounding hills . From past experience , they feared that they might be beaten . They ran to hide in the gardens south of the village . They did not hear anyone shouting after them to stop . PERSON , the PERSON station commander , saw the CARDINAL men running away through binoculars . He was ordered by the operation commander , PERSON , to apprehend them . He took a team of CARDINAL men and went to the gardens .", "CARDINAL . The gendarmes found both men hiding under the bushes and trees in the garden area . PERSON did not try to run away when he was found . He was beaten and kicked by the gendarmes . They found PERSON hiding nearby and gathered round him . PERSON saw the gendarmes kick him . He also saw them raise and lower their rifles as if striking PERSON with the butts . He did not , however , see any rifle butt hitting him . PERSON remembered that he was kicked many times and struck on the hip with the barrel of a GCARDINAL rifle which tore his skin all the way down . He was also struck on the right side of the head with a rifle butt . He lost consciousness and remembered little after that for DATE . The gendarmes doused him in the nearby river to revive him .", "CARDINAL . The Commission rejected as implausible and contradictory the testimony of the gendarmes concerning the apprehension of the CARDINAL men . Neither PERSON nor PERSON witnessed the apprehension of PERSON or ORG and their accounts lacked credibility . ORG claimed that he had found PERSON concealed in the bushes and that the latter had run away , falling twice near the river . The Commission , however , found that his testimony was inconsistent on a number of crucial points and that he gave his evidence in a clearly exculpatory manner . On being questioned in detail , he also admitted that he could not see exactly what had happened . The Commission therefore found that the Government had not produced a witness who could unequivocally state that he had witnessed PERSON sustain injuries as a result of a fall . It accepted the testimony of PERSON and PERSON , which it found to be credible and convincing .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and PERSON were brought before the operation commander , PERSON , who kept them outside the village until the end of the operation . A third man , PERSON , was also apprehended for aiding and abetting the ORG . ORG did not accept as credible testimony that a fire was lit to warm PERSON . Nor were any dry clothes brought for him from the village . At this point , PERSON had a visible injury to his head , with bruising around the left eye and a mark on the right - hand side of his head , which had bled . He was limping , showing an injury to the left leg . There were also noticeable irregularities in his manner of speaking when PERSON questioned him at this time .", "CARDINAL . An incident report was drawn up by the gendarmes , dated DATE . It stated that PERSON and ORG had failed to stop when ordered and that ORG had fallen down a slope , injuring his left eye and leg . The report was signed by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . It also bore the apparent signatures of PERSON and ORG . However , PERSON was illiterate and unable to sign his name . He generally placed his thumbprint on documents . Although the report purported to have been drawn up and signed at the scene by the persons present , the Commission noted that PERSON and ORG recollected signing it later . It also found that it was an unreliable and misleading document , which did not correspond to the events as described orally by the gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . After completing the operation at the village , the gendarmes returned to the PERSON station . PERSON was unable to walk . PERSON carried him to the next village , ORG , where a donkey was obtained . PERSON rode on the donkey to PERSON , with PERSON helping to keep him in the saddle . They arrived at CARDINAL to TIME", "CARDINAL . At the station , PERSON took the statements of both men . PERSON was otherwise kept in the canteen while PERSON was placed in the custody area . No custody record recording their detention was provided by the Government . At TIME , the PERSON gendarmes left in their vehicles to return to PERSON , taking PERSON and PERSON with them .", "CARDINAL . The gendarmes arrived in GPE during the night , passing ORG on the way . PERSON and PERSON were put in the cafeteria of the GPE central provincial gendarmerie station . PERSON recalled that CARDINAL men in civilian clothes had come to the cafeteria . CARDINAL of them , who was apparently a doctor , had looked at ORG without examining him and said that he was faking his condition . PERSON told the Commission delegates that he had called a doctor and a paramedic to examine PERSON and that , after the examination , the doctor had stated that PERSON was exaggerating his symptoms . The Commission asked for the doctor and the paramedic to be identified . The doctor identified by the Government failed to appear and give evidence . The paramedic appeared , but could not remember ever being called out to examine a detainee in the circumstances described . No infirmary or medical records were produced to substantiate that treatment was given . The Commission did not make any findings as to who had come to look at ORG . It did find that at most he had received only cursory first - aid treatment and that the purported doctor had discounted visible signs of distress , without taking any precautionary steps in respect of an evident trauma to the head .", "CARDINAL . PERSON took further statements from the CARDINAL men during DATE of DATE , probably DATE TIME Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan 's statement bore his thumbprint and the explanation that he did not have a signature . PERSON described PERSON condition as worsening as DATE progressed . He could not walk , needed to be supported and , before giving his statement , lost control of his bowels .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , TIME after their apprehension , PERSON and PERSON were admitted for treatment at ORG . A document dated DATE and signed by PERSON requested that both be treated as they had fallen and hurt themselves . According to the hospital record , PERSON was treated for trauma to the right ear . A report dated DATE and signed by ORG stated that ORG general condition was average , and that he was conscious and responsive . The report also stated that hemadermy was present in the left eye periorbital . It indicated that the life of the patient , who suffered from left hemiparesis , was threatened .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan was taken to ORG , where his condition was found to be fair , though risk to life remained , with symptoms of concussion and left hemiplegia . The applicant arrived at the hospital to see his brother on DATE . He took PERSON to a clinic , where he paid for scans to be taken . On the basis of these films , which disclosed , inter alia , cerebral oedema and left hemiparesis , PERSON decided that surgery was not necessary . PERSON was treated with drugs and discharged from hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan returned to the hospital for examination at CARDINAL monthly intervals . On DATE a report from PERSON and Dr PERSON stated that he was suffering from a PERCENT loss of function on the left side . The applicant submitted to the ORG recent scans of his brain showing an area of brain atrophy . The ORG 's delegates who saw PERSON on DATE noted that a loss of function on the left hand side was still visible . However , on the basis of the evidence of the doctors who testified before the delegates , the ORG found that the delay in treatment had not been shown to have appreciably worsened the long - term effects of the head injury .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his brother did not lodge any complaint with the LOC public prosecutor , PERSON . The public prosecutor had been informed , however , that ORG had been injured at the time of his apprehension by PERSON and he had received documents prepared by the gendarmes concerning the apprehension of PERSON and PERSON . In a written report dated DATE to the public prosecutor , PERSON had stated that both PERSON and PERSON had run away despite numerous warnings to stop . He described how both men had physically resisted the security forces and had fallen from the rocks while they were pushing the gendarmes . The public prosecutor had also spoken on the telephone with PERSON and received oral explanations , inter alia , that PERSON had in fact hidden without running away .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute which concluded that PERSON injury resulted from an accident for which no one was at fault , either intentionally or through negligence . He did not interview PERSON or PERSON or any gendarme who had witnessed the alleged accident before issuing his decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor drew up an indictment charging PERSON with the offence of resistance to officers contrary to LAW ( TCC ) . It stated that during an operation ORG had run away from the security forces , ignoring their orders to stop . He told the delegates that he did not charge PERSON with any offence due to the oral explanations given by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan appeared before ORG of ORG . The minutes recorded that he accepted that the charge was true . He was recorded as stating that , on DATE of the incident , he did not understand the security forces ' warning . Although he understood it afterwards , he ran away fearing that they would harm him . In its decision of that date , the court found that PERSON had admitted that he had failed to comply with an order to stop and had thus resisted an officer contrary to LAW ORG . He was sentenced to a fine of MONEY ( TRL ) , which was suspended . The applicant stated to the Commission that he had not been allowed to accompany his brother into the courtroom and that his brother , who spoke NORP , was not provided with an interpreter . The court minutes made no reference to an interpreter being provided .", "CARDINAL . The Government relied on the incident report drawn up by the gendarmes and the statements taken from ORG and PERSON by the gendarmes , as well as the oral testimony of the gendarmerie officers .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan was ordered to stop by the gendarmes conducting an operation at his village . He ran away and , due to the slippery terrain , fell and injured himself . PERSON evidence that PERSON was beaten by the soldiers was unreliable and inconsistent , inter alia , as his son had joined the ORG . Both men had signed the incident report and statements drawn up by the gendarmes . The fact that PERSON was illiterate did not mean that he was unable to sign documents if he wished .", "CARDINAL . After the accident , PERSON was neither in danger of losing his life nor in a coma . He did not lose consciousness as alleged . He was able to make statements to the gendarmes and so did not appear to PERSON to be seriously hurt . PERSON , who examined him at ORG , described him as responsive . In any event , PERSON was not neglected but received medical treatment for his injuries in hospital . Such treatment was not available in the rural area where the accident occurred .", "CARDINAL . Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan had admitted before ORG of ORG that he had resisted the security forces and had had no difficulty in giving evidence .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( ORG ) all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a ORG employee to subject anyone to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) . The authorities ' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW .

In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of national security prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by LAW on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor 's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect 's status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the council . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor 's authority .", "CARDINAL .

In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or with the offender 's superior .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of PERSON no . CARDINAL on administrative procedure , anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may , within DATE after the alleged act was committed , claim compensation from them .

Under these rules , the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL . DATE of Decree no .
