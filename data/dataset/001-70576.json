The reason for this reduction was the fact that the applicant had been living with PERSON on DATE , the date on which the ORG entered into force , and was expected to continue to do so beyond DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against this decision with ORG .

ORG also lodged an appeal , directed against aspects of ORG decision with which it disagreed .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal in a decision delivered in open court on DATE and notified to the applicant on DATE . It accepted that there had been a \u201c partial deprivation of possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c In this legal provision [ i.e. section CARDINAL of the ANW \u2013 see below ] CARDINAL of the basic assumptions of the ORG , namely that statutory insurance for surviving dependants should be based on actual need ( dat aan een wettelijke nabestaandenverzekering het behoefteprincipe QUANTITY grondslag moet liggen ) , has been elaborated in respect of former recipients of AWW pensions . As compared to the ordinary ORG regime DATE under which , in short , the pension is reduced by the entire amount of work - related benefits [ i.e. unemployment and disability benefits ] and by income from work excluding a sum equal to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage before tax , plus CARDINAL of any income in excess thereof \u2013 the deduction applicable to former AWW beneficiaries under LAW of DATE \u2013 see below ] is more advantageous : PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage before tax , in respect of both forms of income , together with CARDINAL of any income from work in excess thereof , is disregarded for the purposes of the reduction . It can also be said in such cases that , regardless of the level of income , an amount of benefit equal to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage before tax remains unaffected .", "As regards the transitional regime under LAW ANW it is also relevant that , in the case of persons maintaining a common household who are treated under the ORG as married persons ( with the exception of first - degree relatives ) , the former AWW beneficiary who is regarded as married on this ground retains , from DATE , an ORG pension equal to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage , that percentage in the case of persons maintaining a common household in order to take care of an invalid rising to PERCENT ( of the statutory minimum wage after tax ) , PERCENT of which is means - tested .", "ORG held that this result was consistent with the criteria embodied in LAW No . CARDINAL , which provides :", "...", "ORG agrees that the transitional arrangements under the ORG fulfil those criteria , and in particular that the legislature , in determining what can and must be considered necessary in the general interest , has not overstepped its margin of appreciation . In addition to ORG findings on this point , ORG considers the following important : according to current opinion the statutory insurance regime for surviving dependants acts as a basic provision ( bodemvoorziening ) in terms of supplementary arrangements for surviving dependants and as an income provision ( inkomensvoorziening ) at the level of the social minimum . This does not sit well with the idea of leaving the ( basic ) benefit intact where circumstances indicate that the surviving dependant concerned is , or has been , able to meet his or her own needs . The fact that there was no provision of this nature in the AWW may plausibly be attributed to the then insignificant proportion of married women in employment , as a consequence of which the concurrence of an AWW pension and a salary , or social benefit in lieu of salary ( loondervingsuitkeringen ) , was relatively rare . From the perspective of the aims of the new system , the social changes in this area required an arrangement that dealt with the concurrence of benefits for surviving dependants and other income . In addition , the legislature found it appropriate to extend the equal treatment of married couples and unmarried cohabitants ( in a general sense ) , as for other social arrangements , to the statutory insurance for surviving dependants .", "The fact that the adaptations in question also extend to existing cases ( persons in receipt of AWW pensions ) is considered acceptable by ORG within the scope of its present review , from the equality point of view , and also in the light of the potentially considerable duration of the benefit ; and what is also acceptable within the same scope of review is the position of the legislature that , in terms of legal security , a temporary and/or partial ( in the present case : an initially complete and subsequently partial ) respect for existing rights is required .", "The position that only \u2018 full compensation\u2019 would be consistent with LAW No . CARDINAL , as has been argued by the persons concerned by the cases dealt with in the present proceedings , is based on an incorrect understanding of that provision , which does not go so far as to make it utterly impossible for a ORG to make changes to existing ( social security ) rights . \u201d", "The AWW , which entered into force on DATE , insured against the risk of the death of the family breadwinner . Under the AWW scheme , all persons residing in the GPE and non - residents gainfully employed in the GPE were compulsorily insured . Contributions to this scheme were paid by all persons gainfully employed in the GPE .", "Entitlement to AWW benefit was not dependent on the level of contributions paid as , unlike a social - security scheme based on employment ( werknemersverzekering ) , it was a nationwide social - security scheme ( volksverzekering ) . The level of benefit was linked to the statutory minimum wage .", "The AWW conferred entitlement to a widow \u2019s pension on the widow of an insured person , provided she was under DATE and was caring for an unmarried child born or conceived no later than the date of her spouse \u2019s death . A widow without children was also entitled to claim benefit subject to certain conditions , for example if she was incapacitated for work or was aged DATE or over at the time of her husband \u2019s death . \u201c Widow \u201d meant the woman to whom the insured person was married on the date of his death .", "At the time when the AWW was replaced by the ORG , the amount of the pension was equal to the statutory minimum wage after tax in the case of a widow with dependent children below the age of DATE , and PERCENT of that wage in other cases . This amount was the same for all widows , regardless of any income which they might have been receiving from other sources .", "Entitlement to an AWW pension was lost upon remarriage .", "DATE , widowers enjoyed the same entitlement to benefit after the death of their wives pursuant to the case - law of the domestic tribunals under LAW .", "By DATE the Government of the day felt that the AWW , based as it was on the traditional division of labour between men and women , had become obsolete . It gave surviving dependants an entitlement to benefit even if they were not in need of it : increasingly , beneficiaries included widows and widowers in paid employment .", "For this reason the Government decided to introduce new legislation granting an entitlement to a pension only to certain categories of surviving dependants who could not be expected either to provide entirely for themselves or to take out private insurance .", "A first bill was introduced in DATE . It was rejected by ORG of ORG , which disapproved of , among other things , the proposed transitional provisions .", "A revised bill was introduced during ORG \u2019s DATE - CARDINAL session .", "According to figures quoted by the Government in support of their proposals , in DATE , the percentages of working women among widows and female divorcees in the age groups DATE and CARDINAL were PERCENT and PERCENT respectively ( see the Explanatory Memorandum \u2013 Memorie van Toelichting \u2013 , ORG of ORG , no .

The pension is reduced by an amount equal to the surviving dependant \u2019s other income , if any ; however , a proportion of income from paid employment ( inkomen uit arbeid ) equal to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage before tax plus , if the surviving dependant \u2019s income from work exceeds that sum , CARDINAL of the remainder , is disregarded for the purposes of the deduction ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL laid down a transitional regime for persons who , before the entry into force of the ORG , had been entitled to benefit under the AWW .", "In accordance with CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , persons , like the applicant who maintained a common household with another person on DATE on which the ORG entered into force ( i.e. DATE ) , and were still maintaining that common household on DATE , lost their entitlement to an ANW pension entirely with effect from DATE unless they were born before DATE , in which case they were entitled to an ANW pension amounting to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage ( after tax ) .", "As originally enacted in DATE , the ORG provided that persons previously entitled to an AWW pension who maintained a common household with another person on DATE on which the ORG entered into force lost their entitlement to an ANW pension entirely with effect from DATE unless they were born before DATE , in which case they were entitled to an ANW pension amounting to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage ( after tax ) .", "The Act of DATE amending the transitional regime and introducing certain technical adaptations ( PERSON tot wijziging PERSON nabestaandenwet ( wijziging overgangsrecht alsmede QUANTITY technische aanpassingen ) ) amended this arrangement , limiting it to those who were still maintaining a common household with someone else on DATE ( CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ANW \u2013 see above ) .", "As early as CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Minister for ORG and Employment ( Staatssecretaris van Sociale Zaken en GPE ) decided on a \u201c Temporary ORG of the ANW \u201d ( PERSON regeling reparaties overgangswet ANW ; Official Bulletin ( Staatscourant ) DATE , no .
