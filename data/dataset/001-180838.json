The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his classmate PERSON were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily injuries to a boy from their school . They confessed to their deeds . The applicant was initially released under parental supervision , whilst PERSON was remanded in custody . The following day they retracted their confessions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the investigator had reclassified their actions as a more serious offence , the Zavolzhskiy ORG in Tver ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in custody , citing the gravity of the charges and the fact that he had recanted . ORG interpreted the latter element as amounting to the risk of an obstruction of justice . On DATE ORG upheld the detention order on appeal , finding as follows :", "\u201c [ The fact that the defendant ] has a permanent place of residence , lives with his family , is studying in high school and does not have a criminal record does not provide a basis for rejecting unconditionally the investigator \u2019s application [ for a detention order ] in the light of the extreme gravity of the charges . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the authorised detention period , pointing out that the applicant \u201c had changed his attitude to the committed offence from an outright acknowledgement to a downright denial \u201d . In the court \u2019s opinion , that implied that the applicant might interfere with justice if released . ORG also added that the custodial measure was necessary \u201c to secure the enforcement of the conviction \u201d . On DATE ORG upheld ORG assessment on appeal , in particular its finding that a non - custodial measure would not be sufficient to secure the enforcement of the conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge of the applicant \u2019s case refused the GPE request for leave to visit their son , reasoning as follows :", "\u201c The investigation appointed PERSON , the father of PERSON , as the legal representative of the underage defendant . However , the investigation considers that PERSON is using all means to interfere with the criminal proceedings because of his vested interests ; he has not responded when summonsed by the investigator or court , and is causing all kinds of delays in the proceedings . The investigation considers that this kind of conduct on the part of PERSON may have a negative influence of the defendant PERSON , as well as interfering with the establishment of the truth in the criminal case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor rejected a complaint from the applicant \u2019s father about the investigator \u2019s decision , recalling that the granting of leave to visit a detainee was at the investigator \u2019s discretion rather than being a legal obligation and that the arguments for refusing leave were \u201c persuasive and well - justified \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a further extension order , holding that the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious offence and that the circumstances warranting the application of a custodial measure still obtained . On DATE ORG upheld the order on appeal .", "CARDINAL .
