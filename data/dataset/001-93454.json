On DATE the ORG settlement local council assigned a plot of land for the applicant \u2019s use and for construction of a private house . On DATE the applicant paid MONEY ( RUR ) for the use of that plot .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a meeting of ORG took place attended by the applicant , acting on behalf of the ORG , a representative of the pre - nationalisation owners who sought to restore their property rights to the land assigned to the territory of the new ORG settlement , and representatives of various municipal and ORG institutions . It was decided to organise another meeting to discuss the possibility of restoring property rights to the land in GPE settlement in kind and to propose to the Government that plots of QUANTITY be allocated to the former owners for the construction of private houses .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Government enacted several decrees allowing persons in the applicant \u2019s position to acquire ownership of the land they had been using .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the NORP municipality signed a land - purchase agreement which specified that on DATE the applicant had paid MONEY ( LTL ) for the plot of land . On DATE the plot of land was registered in ORG in the applicant \u2019s name and , in accordance with NORP law , the applicant became its owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , civil proceedings were brought by a group of CARDINAL private individuals for annulment of the land - purchase agreements , including that of the applicant . The plaintiffs claimed restitution of their property rights to the land in question , which the ORG had allocated for the building of private houses and which had been nationalised by the NORP occupying power in DATE . The dispute involved a total of CARDINAL co - defendants , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the seizure of the applicant \u2019s land .

On DATE the GPE Governor \u2019s Office informed the applicant that despite the courts\u2019 ban on pursuing any activities on the plot of land , \u201c at present there are perennial plants and there is also a pond \u201d .

On DATE ORG adopted a ruling , finding that the Government decrees in question violated the rights of the former owners of the land , who had the right to restitution of their property . The decrees were declared unconstitutional as contradicting LAW and , inter alia , LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on the procedure and conditions governing the restoration of rights of ownership to existing real property ( FAC d\u0117l pilie\u010di\u0173 nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 \u012f i\u0161likus\u012f nekilnojam\u0105j\u012f turt\u0105 atstatymo tvarkos ir s\u0105lyg\u0173 ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . The ruling read in part as follows :", "\u201c ... although the legislature enjoys a certain discretion in establishing the conditions and procedure for the restoration of rights of ownership , in doing so it must take account of the constitutional principle of protection of the right of ownership . This principle also presupposes that , unless it is necessary for the needs of society , land unlawfully nationalised by the occupying government must be returned to its owners in kind under the procedure and conditions established by law ...", "... given that Government Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and Government Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE established that the land allocated to the ORG also included an area designated for building private dwelling houses , and that it was established that the status of the land , subject to being bought out by the ORG , was granted because that land was on territory allocated to the scientific and educational establishment , and given also that Government Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE permitted natural persons to acquire private ownership of the plots of land on the territory attributed to the educational - production base of the ORG , the right of the owners to restore their ownership rights over the said land has been denied \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE ORG reversed the decision of ORG of DATE . It was noted that the Government decrees on the basis of which the applicant had signed the land - purchase agreement had been declared unconstitutional . Consequently , the administrative acts whereby the land had been sold to the applicant were declared null and void . The court also observed that \u201c the defendants [ CARDINAL of them being the applicant ] have for the most part not started the construction works . Not all the defendants have bought out the plots of land which were assigned to them for construction of private houses and not all the [ defendants ] who signed land - purchase agreements have had them registered \u201d . The court applied Article CARDINAL of LAW and ordered restitution , obliging the local authorities to return to the applicant the sum of LTL MONEY which he had previously paid for the plot of land at issue . As some of the defendants had paid for their plots of land in DATE with \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d ( vienkartin\u0117mis i\u0161mokomis ) , the court ordered that those sums be repaid to them .", "CARDINAL . The defendants , including the applicant , lodged an appeal on points of law . They alleged , inter alia , that ORG had examined the case in the absence of their lawyer . The defendants further argued that it would be impossible to execute the appellate court \u2019s decision since it ordered restitution in \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d , which no longer had any pecuniary value in GPE . Lastly , they contended that the annulment of the land - purchase contracts was contrary to the right to protection of private property and would amount to re - privatisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . It stated that the annulment of the impugned acts was necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the pre - nationalisation owners . The court acknowledged that the \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d had in the meantime ceased to exist as a means of payment . ORG noted , however , that the subject matter of the proceedings was the annulment of the land - purchase contracts and that the assessment of possible compensation for the investment vouchers had not been its subject matter . Finally , the court found that on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer had been duly notified of the appellate court hearing which was to take place on DATE , and that she had requested that the hearing be postponed , given that she had to attend another court hearing at the same time . ORG , however , noted that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had failed to provide any proof of that hearing . The court ruled that , taking into account the need to ensure the speediness of the proceedings and the high number of participants in the case , the appellate court had taken a reasonable decision to hear the case in the lawyer \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the Deputy Governor of GPE restored the former ORG title to the plot of land on the ORG settlement of which the applicant had acquired ownership under the annulled land - purchase agreement of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG examined the issue of compatibility with LAW of the domestic laws on the restitution of property rights . In its decision ORG held , inter alia , that possessions which had been nationalised by the NORP authorities since DATE should be considered as \u201c property under the de facto control of the ORG \u201d . ORG also stated that , if possible , the property rights should be restored in kind .
