On DATE , following an appeal on points of law by the municipality , ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG lietu departaments ) fully concurred with the regional court \u2019s reasoning . The municipality argued before ORG that the applicant had lost the right to reside in the apartment on the grounds of the judgment of DATE and , accordingly , the issuance of a lease offer would not be effective in the circumstances . ORG agreed that with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s family had lost the right to reside in the apartment . However , only the competent commission could have examined the situation and decided whether or not to strike the applicant \u2019s family off the register . Since on DATE such a decision had not been taken , the applicant had not lost the right to receive the municipality \u2019s assistance in resolving the issue of her apartment .
