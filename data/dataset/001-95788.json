RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national . She was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant sued PERSON and PERSON in LOC of GPE , contesting their property rights to a house in the village of NORP located in that district . PERSON brought a counter action , claiming her property rights on certain buildings and a plot of land in the same village .", "On DATE the court dismissed the applicant 's claim and partially granted that of PERSON", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . The judgment thus became binding and enforceable on that date .", "Subsequently , the applicant lodged consecutive applications for supervisory review with ORG , ORG of ORG and the President of ORG of GPE . These applications were dismissed on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "Under LAW , binding and enforceable judgments are amenable to supervisory review by higher judicial instances at various levels . The supervisory review procedure was repeatedly amended over DATE .", "The supervisory review procedure in force up to DATE is presented in the ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) .", "On DATE the new Code of Civil Procedure entered into force . The provisions governing the supervisory review procedure DATE and DATE are presented in the ORG 's previous judgments and decisions ( see LOC v. GPE , no . PERSON , DATE , and LAW v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , NORP , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , PERSON and PERSON , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . In particular , the new Code provided that supervisory review applications against binding and enforceable judgments could only be lodged by the parties to the proceedings and other persons whose rights and legal interests were affected by the judgments concerned . The LAW also set a DATE time - limit for lodging such applications .", "In the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( No . ORG ) ORG of GPE found that the supervisory review procedure governed by LAW gave rise to a number of issues with regard to the principle of legal certainty enshrined in the LAW , as interpreted by ORG . ORG found in particular that binding and enforceable judgments delivered by courts of general jurisdiction could be altered in supervisory review proceedings not only consecutively but also indefinitely . The court explicitly refrained from declaring these and other shortcomings of the supervisory review procedure unconstitutional , in order to avoid a procedural vacuum that would undermine the effective administration of justice . It upheld nonetheless the obligation of the legislator to reform the supervisory review procedure so as to make it compatible with the principle of legal certainty , taking account of the case - law of ORG ResDH ( CARDINAL)CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE of ORG .", "ORG also stated that the domestic remedies should not be considered exhausted within the meaning of LAW prior to the judgment delivered on supervisory review , as the latter may find a violation of any right and repeal the domestic decision at issue . ORG concluded that individuals should be able to complain to ORG upon completion of the supervisory review procedure , provided the latter is reformed so as to constitute an effective judicial remedy compatible with the constitutional requirements and the present judgment of ORG .", "On DATE the Law of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL-\u0424\u0417 ) entered into force , introducing a number of further amendments to the supervisory review procedure .", "Under the new provisions , judicial decisions may be challenged in supervisory review proceedings within DATE they become legally binding . Supervisory review proceedings may be entered into by parties to a case and by other persons whose rights or legal interests have been adversely affected by these decisions , and only if other available ways of appeal have been exhausted before the decision becomes legally binding ( Article CARDINAL ) . This time - limit may be waived ( restored ) only in exceptional circumstances which exclude any possibility of lodging a complaint in time ( severe illness or incapacity of the plaintiff and so on ) , if such circumstances occurred within DATE after the contested judgment became binding ( LAW ) .", "There are several levels of supervisory review of legally binding judgments and decisions . First , presidia of regional courts exercise supervisory review of judgments and decisions delivered by lower courts and by regional courts themselves acting as cassation instances ( LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Second , judgments and decisions are amenable to supervisory review by ORG of ORG of GPE ( LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Third , decisions taken by ORG on supervisory review may be challenged before the ORG of ORG of GPE if they disrupt the uniformity of the case - law ( LAW ) .", "Moreover , the President or Deputy President of ORG of GPE may initiate supervisory review of binding judgments by ORG on a limited number of grounds and upon an application by the persons concerned , lodged within DATE the judgment became binding ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "A supervisory review application to a regional court is considered by the president or deputy president of this court or by a judge delegated for this purpose ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Applications for supervisory review which are lodged with ORG of GPE are considered by a judge of this court ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "An application for supervisory review is considered by any court , except ORG of GPE , within DATE if the case file has not been requested , and within DATE if the case file has been requested from the lower instance , excluding the time elapsing between the request of the case file and its receipt . For supervisory review in ORG of GPE these time - limits are DATE respectively ; the latter may be extended by DATE by the President or Deputy President of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . Once it has been decided to transmit a case to the relevant instance for supervisory review , it must be examined within DATE by the court and within DATE by ORG ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The judge considers a supervisory review complaint on the basis of the material appended thereto and , where appropriate , on the basis of the case file requested from the lower instance ( LAW ) . The judge makes a decision to transmit the application for supervisory review by the relevant instance or to refuse to do so ( LAW ) . The President or Deputy President of ORG of GPE may overrule a decision of the judge of this court to refuse to transmit the application for supervisory review ( LAW ) . A similar power of the regional courts ' presidents in respect of supervisory review applications lodged with presidia of those courts was abolished ( former LAW ) .", "The grounds for quashing or varying of binding judgments on supervisory review were limited to significant violations of substantive or procedural law which influenced the outcome of the proceedings and must be corrected in order to restore and protect rights , freedoms and lawful interests and to safeguard public interests protected by law ( LAW ) .", "If the supervisory review instance decides to quash the judgment or decision in full or in part , it may take any of the following actions : send the case back to a lower court for a new consideration , discontinue the proceedings , restore CARDINAL of the lower court decisions , modify the decision or make its own decision without sending the case for new consideration ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The supervisory review is carried out on the basis of the arguments contained in the application . While the court may also invoke its own arguments , the supervisory review must not extend to those parts of the judgment that were not contested in the application ( LAW CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "Having noted questions arising in the courts ' application of the supervisory review procedure as amended by LAW DATE , ORG of GPE clarified various points in its ruling of DATE ( No . CARDINAL ) .", "ORG stated that the DATE time - limit applies to all supervisory review instances ; it is not to be renewed after every rejection of a supervisory review complaint and application to a higher instance . On the other hand , the time spent by courts in considering supervisory review complaints should not be taken into account in the calculation of this time - limit . The court reiterated the exceptional nature of circumstances allowing this time - limit to be waived ( restored ) upon application by a physical or legal person . Courts should not take account of any such circumstance occurring DATE after the judgment became binding . A decision waiving the time - limit should be duly motivated .", "ORG reiterated the obligation of exhaustion of ordinary ways of appeal prior to application for supervisory review . It also stated that the court examining an application for supervisory review should not take account of any document which has not been examined by the court of first instance and , in certain cases , by the court of second instance .", "ORG finally drew the courts ' attention to new limits on the grounds for supervisory review enshrined in LAW , which should be read in the light of the LAW provisions . Referring to the principle of legal certainty , it stated that courts are not entitled to review a legally binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a new judgment ; a different opinion of the supervisory review instance on the way the case should have been decided is not a sufficient reason for altering the lower court 's decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
