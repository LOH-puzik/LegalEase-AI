The applicant applied for asylum under the name of GPE on DATE , stating that he had entered GPE illegally DATE . He was questioned twice , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , by the NORP authorities responsible for asylum and migration ( until DATE the authority was called the ORG f\u00fcr Migration , but it was renamed with effect from DATE as the Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Migration , DATE hereafter \u201c the asylum authorities \u201d ) . An interpreter was present at both hearings and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it . A member of a non - governmental organisation was present at the second hearing as a neutral witness , in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing . He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing about any irregularities , but he made no such observations .", "CARDINAL . During the hearings the applicant stated that he had attended a number of demonstrations in connection with the presidential election in DATE . He had been arrested during one such demonstration on DATE in CARDINAL He was subsequently placed in prison , where he was severely tortured every day . After DATE in prison , he was scheduled to appear in court on DATE . He was placed in a bus with CARDINAL other people but managed to escape during a disturbance caused by CARDINAL of the other detainees when disembarking from the bus . He then managed to hide with his relatives . After his escape , the authorities had sent a court summons to his home and , when he had failed to appear , the court had sentenced him in absentia to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . He managed to leave the country on DATE with the help of a smuggler . In support of his account , the applicant submitted copies of his identity card , a court summons of CARDINAL DATE and a judgment of DATE . He explained that the judgment had been sent to his home and that a neighbour had given it to him prior to his departure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the asylum authorities rejected his asylum application and ordered him to leave GPE , finding that his account was not credible as it was contradictory and , in relation to key aspects , not sufficiently substantiated . Despite repeated questions , the applicant had been unable to describe what he had experienced during his imprisonment in a detailed and differentiated manner . He had also contradicted himself regarding his transportation from the prison to court and his escape . Neither his alleged arrest in connection with his participation in a demonstration nor his subsequent detention and escape therefrom had been credible . The documents submitted by the applicant could not lead to a different result as they could easily be bought in GPE and falsified . Moreover , the alleged conduct of the NORP authorities in sending a court summons to the applicant \u2019s home after his escape , rather than going there to arrest him on the spot , was not credible , nor was his submission that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been sent to his home and given to a neighbour prior to his departure .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not appeal , the decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through a lawyer , lodged an application for his asylum application to be reconsidered . He was by that time using the identity of A. and stated that he had entered GPE legally under that name in DATE based on a visa to visit his sister , who lived there . In substance , he stated that his relationship with his father had broken down entirely and that as a result he risked being arrested upon his return because his father had ties to the secret service . Moreover , he had been baptised as a NORP on DATE . Emphasising that GPE applied the death penalty for apostasy , he alleged that he was at risk of illtreatment on account of his conversion . He submitted a copy of his baptism certificate , issued by a NORP church , a NORP house church , to support his account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the asylum authorities , who treated the applicant \u2019s request as a second asylum application , questioned the applicant in person . An interpreter was present and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it . A member of a non - governmental organisation was present as a neutral witness in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing . He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing if he witnessed any irregularities , but did not make any such observations .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing , the applicant stated that he had first had contact with a NORP church in GPE in DATE and then with the NORP church from DATE . The members of the latter had gradually become his family . CARDINAL of them had invited him home once or DATE to familiarise him with the Bible . He had regularly attended church services and after DATE had been baptised in that church . For him , being a NORP meant believing in PERSON and spreading his message . He stated that he continued to study the Bible and recited parts of it . The principle of honesty enshrined in NORP was particularly important to him . Even if he were unable to manifest his belief in the future , he would always retain the truthfulness of his faith , which nobody could take away from him . He submitted statements that he had attended different churches to support his account . The applicant did not make any submissions regarding the risk allegedly caused by the broken relationship with his father and the latter \u2019s ties to the secret service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the asylum authorities rejected the applicant \u2019s application . They considered that his conversion to NORP did not in and of itself expose him to a real risk of ill - treatment . Such a risk could exist if he proselytised or attracted public attention in another way . Based on his statement , they considered that he did not intend to practise his faith in such a manner . There were no indications that the NORP authorities were even aware of his conversion . They also doubted that the applicant \u2019s conversion was genuine and lasting , noting , in particular , that it had occurred after the applicant \u2019s first asylum application had been rejected , that the baptism had taken place in a house church rather than a church recognised by the ORG , and that the applicant did not base his conversion on the key aspects of NORP , but on the personal relationships he had formed with members of his church community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by a lawyer , appealed against that decision . He pointed out that there had been an increased number of arrests of members of NORP house churches since DATE and argued that his conversion to NORP in and of itself exposed him to a real risk of ill - treatment . A NORP convert faced a much greater risk of ill - treatment than those born into the NORP religion . His conversion to NORP was genuine and lasting . He had first had contact with a NORP church in GPE in DATE and was serious in practising his faith , as evidenced by the documents he had submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It expressed doubts as to whether his conversion had been genuine or was lasting , but found that this did not have to be determined . It considered that a person could only face a real risk of ill - treatment upon return to GPE if that person \u2019s NORP faith had been manifested in GPE in such a way as to make it visible to the outside and if it could be assumed that his or her family and acquaintances in GPE would learn about that active manifestation of faith , even if it was short of proselytising . If close family members were \u201c fanatic \u201d NORP , they might denounce the conversion to the secret service . In addition , conversion to NORP might be seen as treason . Where a conversion had taken place abroad , there had to be both an assessment of whether it was genuine and the extent to which it had become publicly known . Even assuming that the applicant \u2019s conversion had been genuine and was lasting , the court considered that he did not manifest his NORP faith in the manner described . There were no indications that the NORP authorities had even become aware of his conversion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through a lawyer , lodged an application for temporary admission under section CARDINAL of LAW . He relied on the risks presented by the NORP authorities and non - state actors on account of his conversion and active membership of a NORP community in GPE , as well as his participation in a demonstration in GPE in DATE against human rights violations and the persecution of NORP by the NORP authorities . In that connection , he had signed a letter of protest addressed by the organisers to ORG , which were thus aware of his conversion . To support his account he submitted photographs , letters of support from various persons and several reports .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the asylum authorities rejected his application , which they had treated as a further asylum application . They noted that the applicant had previously been through CARDINAL sets of asylum proceedings and that the alleged risk of ill - treatment on account of his conversion to NORP had already been examined . It was not necessary to examine the matter again as the applicant had not put forward any arguments that could give rise to an assessment that was different from that of ORG in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It was true that the NORP authorities took an interest in the activities of their citizens abroad , but such monitoring was focused on people who stood out from the large number of NORP critical of the ORG and who were perceived as a serious threat by the authorities because of their political or religious activities . Whether a person \u201c stood out \u201d was not so much a question of visibility and the possibility of identifying the person concerned , but was rather CARDINAL of public exposure . The personality of the individuals concerned , the form of their appearances in public and the content of their public statements were relevant parameters in that regard . The asylum authorities considered that mere participation in a demonstration against ORG , without the applicant acting in a particular manner or holding a special function , was not sufficient for him to be perceived as a concrete threat by the NORP authorities . They also noted that there were no indications that the authorities had taken any measures against him .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities were aware that NORP citizens at times attempted to rely on conversion to NORP abroad in order to obtain refugee status in NORP countries . Such circumstances would be taken into account by the NORP authorities but would not , upon someone \u2019s return , lead to ill - treatment within the meaning of the refugee definition . Moreover , it was possible to practise religions other than NORP in GPE in a discreet and private manner . Citing the criteria contained in ORG judgment of DATE , ORG did not contest , per se , the fact that the applicant was part of a NORP circle in GPE . There were , however , no indications that he was involved in a leading function or was particularly exposed in other ways in connection with his NORP faith . His participation in a demonstration and the signing of a letter of protest to ORG did not lead to a different conclusion . He was only an ordinary member of a NORP organisation and there was , therefore , no concrete risk that the NORP authorities had become aware of his conversion . The asylum authorities concluded that the applicant did not meet the requirements of the refugee definition or those for temporary admission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision , in substance repeating his earlier submissions . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as manifestly illfounded , fully endorsing the asylum authorities\u2019 reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set a deadline for the applicant \u2019s voluntary departure , which passed on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
