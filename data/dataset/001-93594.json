The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) , in summary proceedings , ordered the applicant to pay CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) , MONEY ( ORG ) to PERSON for the cost of plumbing work carried out in her apartment ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted PERSON 's request for the enforcement of the payment of this order and the costs of the proceedings in the amount of approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL by judicial sale ( GPE ) of the applicant 's apartment situated at S .- street FAC , in the CARDINALth district of GPE . That address was used by the courts for serving this and subsequent decisions . A registered letter was sent to the applicant at the above address . As it could not be handed over to her personally , it was served on her on DATE by deposition ( PERSON ) in the post office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to CARDINAL further enforceable payment orders of DATE and DATE respectively ( amounting to approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and to the costs of the respective proceedings , granted another creditor , PERSON , leave to accede to the judicial sale .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was informed of the date of the judicial sale by registered letter , which was again sent to her address at S .- street CARDINAL , and was served by deposition in the post office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judicial sale took place . The applicant did not assist . ORG sold the applicant 's apartment ( Zuschlag ) for CARDINAL ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) to PERSON , a limited liability company . The decision of sale was served on the applicant on DATE by deposition in the post office .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG allocated shares of the proceeds to the creditors ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was evicted from the apartment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had a nervous breakdown and stayed in a psychiatric hospital DATE and DATE . It can not be established on the basis of the file where the applicant lived for the rest of DATE . It appears that in DATE she was housed in a community owned apartment , where she is still living .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the applicant 's stay in the psychiatric hospital , ORG instituted guardianship proceedings ( PERSON - walterschaftsverfahren ) and , on DATE , appointed a provisional guardian for the applicant . In these proceedings a medical expert submitted that the applicant had suffered from paranoid psychosis since DATE and had since then not been able to make rational decisions , in particular as far as housing matters were concerned . On CARDINAL DATE a permanent guardian was appointed for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG served the decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning the judicial sale of the applicant 's apartment on the applicant 's guardian . On DATE the applicant , represented by her guardian , appealed against this decision . Referring to the guardianship proceedings , she submitted that the enforcement proceedings were null and void as she had not been capable of participating in the proceedings ( proze\u00dff\u00e4hig ) either at the time of delivery of the respective payment orders or at the time of delivery of the decisions granting enforcement and summoning her to the judicial sale . She further requested that the enforcement proceedings be suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for the enforcement proceedings to be suspended . On DATE it granted a part of the surplus of the judicial sale to another creditor , A. The applicant , referring again to her argument that the enforcement proceedings should be considered null and void , appealed against both decisions . She further submitted that she had paid all outstanding debts to PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) suspended the proceedings concerning the appeal against the judicial sale of the applicant 's apartment and ordered ORG to decide on the applicant 's capacity to participate in the proceedings since DATE , when the decision granting enforcement by judicial sale of her apartment had been served on her .", "CARDINAL . On the applicant 's requests , ORG , on DATE , found that the payment orders of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) were not enforceable . Relying on section QUANTITY ( Exekutionsordnung ) , it found that the applicant had not been capable of participating in the proceedings at the time of the delivery of the decisions at issue . For the same reasons ORG , on DATE , referring to the expert opinion obtained in the guardianship proceedings and a further expert opinion , found that the payment order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was not enforceable .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the first decision , the applicant , in DATE , requested ORG to discontinue the enforcement proceedings . On DATE ORG dismissed this request and noted that discontinuation was no longer possible as the decision allocating the proceeds of the sale to the creditors had become final and the creditors had been paid .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG resumed the proceedings concerning the applicant 's appeal against the judicial sale . It dismissed the appeal , noting that under LAW and section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW only persons who had been present at the judicial sale or had erroneously not been summoned had a right to appeal within DATE from DATE of the auction . In contrast to the views expressed by legal writers , it was ORG established caselaw that this time - limit was absolute and , therefore , also binding in a case like the present one where the debtor had not been capable of participating in the proceedings and had not been represented . Consequently , the sale of the applicant 's apartment had become final and it was no longer possible to claim the nullity of the proceedings . The court therefore revised its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) finding that the question of the applicant 's capacity to participate in the enforcement proceedings was not relevant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , represented by her guardian , requested ORG to allow an ordinary appeal with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . She argued that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW setting an absolute time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of sale in a judicial auction was unconstitutional and amounted to discrimination against disabled persons not capable of participating in legal proceedings . Such individuals could not be treated like persons with legal capacity , who were able to defend their interests in underlying civil proceedings and could later appeal against a decision granting enforcement . In the present case , the interests of the applicant in declaring the sale of her apartment null and void had to prevail over the interests of the purchaser and the creditors . On the one hand , the applicant had become homeless , having lost her apartment , which had been sold far below its market price in order to satisfy relatively minor claims . On the other hand , annulling the judicial sale of the apartment would not have caused serious or irreparable damage to the creditors or the purchaser .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG entered the purchaser of the applicant 's apartment , the limited company ORG , as owner in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant an ordinary appeal . Qualifying the applicant 's submissions as an extraordinary appeal , it transferred them to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected the applicant 's extraordinary appeal . It noted that ORG decision was in line with its constant case - law . As to the question regarding the constitutionality of the absolute time - limit for the filing of appeals against a judicial sale , it referred to the necessary protection of the purchaser .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's further appeals against a number of decisions of ORG , including the decision entering the purchaser of the apartment as owner in the land register ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , a decision granting another part of the surplus of the judicial sale to creditor GPE , and decisions fixing further costs of the enforcement proceedings . It noted that the applicant 's arguments were restricted to the allegation that the judicial sale had not become final and that , therefore , all subsequent decisions were null and void . However , according to ORG decision , the judicial sale had become final .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( Zivilproze\u00dfordnung ) a decision in civil proceedings is null and void and may be annulled if a party who is required to be represented has not been represented in the proceedings and the legal representative does not approve the conduct of the proceedings ex post . The party concerned may request annulment under LAW . There is no specific time - limit for filing such a request .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that if there is any indication that a party is not capable of effectively participating in the proceedings , they have to be suspended and the case has to be transferred to the competent court to conduct guardianship proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Enforcement proceedings are instituted by a request by the creditor , who indicates the mode of enforcement ( section DATE ) . In enforcement proceedings a debtor can oppose enforcement , claiming deficiencies in the underlying claim ( PERSON , PERSON ; sections DATE and DATE ) or can request a stay of execution ( ORG , Impugnations - gesuch , section CARDINAL ) on account of deficiencies in the decision granting enforcement . Furthermore , the court may , of its own motion or at the request of a party concerned , declare that a judicial decision or payment order is not enforceable if enforcement would be erroneous or unlawful ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Upon such a decision enforcement proceedings are in principle discontinued ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) or suspended ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Enforcement by way of judicial sale ( GPE ) of a debtor 's real estate is granted by a decision ( Exekutionsbewilligung ) . Subsequently , the court orders the valuation of the property by an expert ( section CARDINAL ) . Both parties to the proceedings , debtor and creditor , are summoned to the respective inspection of the real estate . At the time of the events , the value of the real estate was determined by a decision of the enforcement court which was subject to appeal ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The date of the judicial sale is communicated by official notification ( PERSON ) which is served on the debtor and creditor ( section CARDINAL ) . The decision to sell ( Zuschlag ) real estate in a judicial sale constitutes an act of public law by which the purchaser obtains the property . Under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL such a decision can be appealed against within DATE from the date of the judicial sale , inter alia , by a person who has erroneously not been summoned to the judicial sale .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG constant case - law , after expiry of this time - limit the decision of judicial sale becomes final . It is then no longer possible to take the eventual nullity of underlying decisions into account , even if the debtor had not been capable of participating in the proceedings due to a lack of legal capacity at the time when enforcement had been granted . ORG holds that only this approach is compatible with the aims of the proceedings leading to a judicial sale and the protection of the bona fide purchaser . A debtor can remedy unlawful acts of the party having instituted enforcement proceedings by claiming compensation ( Schadenersatz ) and unlawful acts of the courts by instituting official liability proceedings ( PERSON ) ( see for example CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and also CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINALp ) .", "CARDINAL . After the judicial sale becomes final , the enforcement court allocates the proceeds of the sale to the creditors and any eventual surplus subsequently to the debtor . Once the purchaser has fulfilled all the conditions , the court transfers the real estate and enters him as the owner in the land register ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
