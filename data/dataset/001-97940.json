It appears that both biological parents had previously been deprived of custody .", "Before the adoption , PERSON had contacted the municipality for guidance on the benefits for which she would be eligible after the adoption , including whether she should try to obtain a copy of the death certificate of the applicant \u2019s biological father during her stay in GPE in order to fulfil formal criteria . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the municipality informed her that she would be entitled to child subsidy and extra child subsidy , but not to a so - called special child subsidy .", "Also before the adoption , PERSON had to substantiate that she was able to satisfy the financial conditions for adopting as a single adopter and she declared that she undertook full responsibility to provide for the applicant .", "In GPE , by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00f8rnetilskudsloven ) the applicant , via her adoptive mother , was granted socalled child subsidy and extra child subsidy , together amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) per month .", "PERSON request of DATE for the so - called special child subsidy , also amounting to approximately ORG DATE , was refused on DATE by the municipality because she failed to fulfil section CARDINAL , subsection MONEY ) DATE ( iii ) , of the LAW which required ( i ) that paternity of the child had not been established ; ( ii ) that the child only had CARDINAL surviving parent who provided for the child ; or ( iii ) that the child , after the death of the guardian , had been adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person . It stated that single adopters who adopt a foreign child via CARDINAL of the organisations approved by ORG were not entitled to the special child subsidy under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL(iii ) , of LAW , since the single adopter , when adopting , undertook full responsibility to provide for the child .", "On appeal , the decision was upheld on DATE by ORG ( Det Sociale N\u00e6vn i Statsamtet Vestsj\u00e6lland ) .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) was dismissed on DATE on the ground that it was not a matter of principle or of general importance as the state of law was sufficiently clear . In that connection it referred to the fact that it had previously determined CARDINAL cases concerning applications for special child subsidy in respect of children adopted by single adopters .", "The applicant brought ORG decision of DATE before ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) , ( \u201c the High Court \u201d ) , claiming that she was entitled to the special child subsidy by virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection PERSON ) , ( ii ) or ( iii ) . She also invoked LAW since in her view she was discriminated against , notably as compared to children of single women who refused to disclose the paternity of their children , or of single women having been artificially inseminated , who were entitled to the special child subsidy under no . ( i ) .", "Statistics were submitted showing , inter alia , that in DATE , CARDINAL single adopters were approved in GPE , and that in CARDINAL cases paternity had not been established . Moreover , for DATE no NORP children had been adopted by single adopters without there having been a family relationship or other connection between the adopted child and the adopter .", "By judgment of DATE the ORG found against the applicant . It noted that only section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) , of LAW concerned adoption . Moreover , it noted that before DATE , subsection CARDINAL(iii ) , read as follows \u201c when the child , after the death of the guardian , is adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person within the child \u2019s family \u201d and considered that the amendment had been made primarily to ensure that partners , as opposed to spouses , were also encouraged to adopt a child after the guardian had died . More specifically it stated :", "\u201c .... although the wording of LAW , subsection CARDINAL ) , of the Act on Child Subsidy may leave some doubt about the correct interpretation , the High Court finds no basis for assuming from the wording of the provision , in which the word \u2018 ORG has been maintained , and on the basis of the comments to the changed wording in DATE that it was intended that the provision was to include single adopters who , as in this case , have adopted a child without a certain kind of connection existing between the child and the adopter while the parental responsibility holder was alive . Hence , the amendment must be assumed mainly to reflect an updating of the current rules for the purpose of ensuring increased child subsidy also in the situations in which the adopter was not married to the parental responsibility holder , but cohabited with him or her outside marriage . This outcome is supported by the fact that it was presupposed in connection with the bills of DATE and DATE concerning a change in the legal position that , as a rule , children adopted by single adopters are not entitled to special child benefits . Accordingly , the provision of paragraph ( iii ) is deemed not to be applicable . \u201d", "The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG which , by a judgment of DATE and by a majority of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL judges , found against the applicant .", "The majority stated as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to the background and wording of and the reciprocal connection between section CARDINAL , subsection PERSON ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) , of LAW , [ those provisions ] must be understood in such a way that entitlement to the special child subsidy for a child adopted by a single adopter is regulated solely by no . ( iii ) . The provisions on sole providers under nos . ( i ) and ( ii ) do not affect single adopters .", "Until DATE a child adopted by a single adopter had no right to the special child subsidy just because the single adopter was sole provider . When section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL(iii ) , was inserted in DATE the right to the special child subsidy for children of sole providers was expanded to include certain single adopters . It was a condition that the child , after the death of the guardian , had been adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person within the child \u2019s family . The preparatory notes ( GPE DATE , ORG A , sp . DATE ) stated that the purpose was to give the stepfather or stepmother an incitement to adopt the child instead of placing him or her in foster care . The provision also included other orphans , provided they were adopted by a single family member , for example one of the parent \u2019s siblings or CARDINAL of the grandparents . At the same time it was emphasised that the new no . ( iii ) did not include unrelated single adopters .", "In DATE the wording \u201c within the child \u2019s family \u201d was omitted . Thus , in accordance within the wording , the special child subsidy is granted when the child , after the death of the guardian , is adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person . It is left unmentioned in the preparatory notes \u2013 ( GPE DATE , ORG A , sp . DATE ) \u2013 whether no ( iii ) hereafter includes all cases in which an orphan is adopted by an unrelated single person , or whether the incitement to single adoption entailed in the provision , continues to be aimed only at single persons with whom the child has a certain connection \u2013 a connection which is not necessary family related .", "In line with ORG , we find no reason to assume that the amendment in DATE intended to include single adopters , who are guardian to an orphan , without there having been some connection between the adopter and the child before the guardian \u2019s death .", "It is undisputed that [ the applicant \u2019s ] biological mother was alive at the time of adoption and that [ prior to that time ] there had been no connection between [ the applicant ] and her adoptive mother .", "In these circumstances we agree that [ the applicant ] does not fulfil the requirements set out in DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) , to be granted the special child subsidy .", "The question of the connection that the child and the parents must have to GPE in order to be entitled to child subsidy [ in general ] is regulated in section CARDINAL of LAW . The requirements set out in DATE , subsection CARDINAL(i ) - ( iii ) , do not distinguish between NORP and foreign children . Accordingly , foreign children who are adopted in [ GPE ] are entitled to the special child subsidy under the same conditions as NORP children who are adopted by a single person . The fact that , outside family relations and so on , on the whole , by and large , only foreign children are adopted by single persons in [ GPE ] can not in our view lead to the conclusion that ORG refusal to grant [ the applicant ] the special child subsidy is discriminatory in breach of LAW in conjunction with LAW , or of the other invoked conventional provisions . \u201d", "The minority stated as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL(iii ) , of LAW was inserted in the legislation by Act no . CARDINAL of DATE and Act no . CARDINAL of DATE gave it its current wording . In the original provision [ it was a condition for obtaining the subsidy ] that the child , after the death of the guardian , was adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person within the child \u2019s family . The wording \u201c within the child \u2019s family \u201d was omitted at the amendment in DATE . According to the wording , hereafter the criterion is fulfilled , despite the single adopter having had no previous connection with the child , and the preparatory notes give no reason to assume otherwise . In these circumstances , we consider that subsequent to the legal amendment in DATE , it is no longer justified to require a previous connection between the single adopter and the child in order to grant subsidy under no . ( iii ) . The course of events related to the discussion in ORG as to the proposal of CARDINAL DATE to amend LAW , and the proposal of DATE can not lead to another result .", "Thus , we find it unjustified that ORG in its decision of DATE refused the special child subsidy by referring to the fact that before the guardian \u2019s death there had [ been no connection ] between [ the applicant ] and her adoptive mother .", "Under LAW , subsection CARDINAL ) , of LAW it is furthermore a condition that the guardian has died before the adoption . In that way , the provision attaches weight to the guardian \u2019s death as opposed to no . ( ii ) , which [ refers ] to the GPE death . It must be considered a fact that [ the applicant \u2019s ] biological parents were deprived of custody before the adoption , that her father was dead and that her mother \u2019s whereabouts were unknown . In these circumstances , [ the applicant \u2019s ] situation before the adoption must be comparable with a situation where the guardian has died .", "In conclusion , therefore in our view [ the applicant ] is entitled to the special child subsidy by virtue of LAW , subsection CARDINAL(iii ) . \u201d", "NORP social law is based on a principle of self - support , which implies that everybody has a duty to support themselves , while any person unable to provide for him or herself is entitled to public assistance .", "Under LAW ( LAW No . CARDINAL of DATE with amendments ) all sole providers are granted ordinary child subsidy for children under DATE . For DATE , such child subsidy amounted to DKK MONEY ( equal to CARDINAL , ORG ) a DATE per child .", "Additionally , extra child subsidies are granted to sole providers , for DATE amounting to DKK CARDINAL . Extra child subsidies are granted for CARDINAL child only , regardless of the number of children .", "Pursuant to LAW ( lov om b\u00f8rnefamilieydelse ) , families with children , including sole providers , are granted benefits for families with children DATE . For DATE , those benefits amount to DKK CARDINAL per child DATE , DKK CARDINAL per child between DATE , and DKK QUANTITY per child DATE .", "These benefits are paid to all sole providers regardless of whether they became sole provider following divorce or termination of cohabitation , or the sole provider adopted a child . The benefits are not dependent on income .", "In addition , parents who adopt a foreign child through CARDINAL of the organisations approved by ORG are entitled to an adoption subsidy under section CARDINALb of the Act on Child Subsidy to cover expenses in connection with the adoption . For DATE , the subsidy amounts to DKK CARDINAL , equal to QUANTITY . Also single persons who adopt a foreign child are eligible for this subsidy . This subsidy is not income dependent either .", "Moreover , all sole providers can apply for a rent subsidy , which is a financial subsidy contributing to the rent for rented accommodation , and which depends on the household income , the amount of the rent and the size of the dwelling . A sibling subsidy is also granted to parents with CARDINAL child attending day - care institutions . Finally , like other sole providers , single adopters will be eligible for the special provider rates that apply to single parents under the rules on cash assistance and ORG education grants , if the provider needs assistance for his or her own support .", "The Act on Child Subsidy ( B\u00f8rnetilskudsloven , at the relevant time lovbekendtg\u00f8relse no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE with amendments , now lovbekendtg\u00f8relse no . CARDINAL of DATE ) read in so far as relevant :", "CARDINAL . In addition a special child subsidy may be granted by virtue of subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL . The special child subsidy amounts to CARDINAL PERSON ( ORG ) DATE ,", "( i ) when paternity of the child is not established ;", "( ii ) when the child only has CARDINAL surviving parent [ who provides for the child ] ;", "( iii ) when the child , after the death of the guardian , is adopted by the latter \u2019s spouse or by a single person .", "( iv ) DATE ( vi ) ...", "Until DATE , children adopted by single persons were not entitled to special child subsidy . When section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) , was inserted into LAW in DATE , the entitlement to special child subsidy for children of sole providers was extended to include children of certain single adopters . Accordingly , special child subsidy could then be granted \u2018 where , after the death of the parental responsibility holder , the child is adopted by the spouse of the deceased or by a person within the child \u2019s family\u2019 . In the explanatory notes to the PERSON to amend LAW and other ORG , which was adopted on DATE , the following was stated :", "\u201c Under the current rules , a spouse who adopts the child of the other spouse upon the latter \u2019s death will thereby cut off the child from receiving special child subsidy as , under the rules of LAW ( adoptionsloven ) , the adopter assumes full responsibility for supporting the child . This means that the stepfather or stepmother who wants to give the child special support through an adoption relationship is placed in a more difficult financial position than the person who merely takes the child into foster care .", "It appears reasonable to ensure that the financial position is not impaired , and it is therefore proposed to provide authority for the child to become entitled to special child subsidy as a child of a widow or widower , regardless of the fact that the legal relationship between the child and its original family is severed by the adoption . According to the proposal , the rule will also include other children adopted by a single relative , for example one of the GPE siblings or CARDINAL of the grandparents , but will not include unrelated single adopters . \u201d", "On DATE , a Act on Child Subsidies and ORG ( the \u2018 LAW Act\u2019 ) entered into force , and the words \u2018 within the child \u2019s family\u2019 were deleted from DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "The reason therefor was not explained in the preparatory notes .", "In guidelines of DATE on child benefits and advance payment of child support issued by ORG ( GPE ) it was stated in clause CARDINAL that the rules on child subsidies , including special child subsidy , substantially corresponded to the rules of the former LAW and Other Family Allowances . Clause CARDINAL mentioned that it was no longer required , as under the former Act , that the adopter be related to the child . Accordingly , there was no change in the situation entitling a person to special child subsidies , but the amendment meant that it became possible to grant special child benefits also in situations in which the adopter had not been married to the parental responsibility holder , but had cohabited with the latter outside marriage . Subsequent to the amendment it was still a condition that a connection had existed between the child and the adopter .", "In clause CARDINAL of the guidelines on child subsidies and advance payment of child support from DATE , issued by ORG , which applied when PERSON adopted the applicant , and in clause CARDINAL of the subsequent guidelines No . CARDINAL of DATE issued by ORG the following was set out :", "\u201c It is not a requirement that the adopter is related to the child . The provision is aimed at adoptions where , prior to the parental responsibility holder \u2019s death , there was some form of connection between the child and the adopter . \u201d", "\u201c Single adopters who adopt a foreign child through CARDINAL of the organisations approved by ORG under LAW do not fall within section GPE ) , as there has not been any connection between the child and the adopter prior to such adoptions . \u201d", "This interpretation was confirmed by the legislature in DATE , when a large parliamentary majority rejected an amending bill aiming to insert a new provision into section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) of LAW so that special child subsidy would also be granted where the child was adopted under the rules of single - parent adoption without any previous connection existing between the adopter and the child ( see ORG of Parliamentary Proceedings DATE , supplement B , column CARDINAL , and ORG of Parliamentary Proceedings DATE , Proceedings , column DATE ) .", "The legislature \u2019s unwillingness to insert such a provision into LAW was demonstrated again in connection with the reading of PERSON . B CARDINAL of DATE on special child subsidy for children adopted by a sole provider . In connection with the first reading of the PERSON , the Minister for ORG stated that such provision would depart from the principle that special child subsidy for sole providers was only paid to sole providers who had been exposed to a social event over which the sole provider had no influence ( see Official Report of Parliamentary Proceedings DATE , Proceedings , column CARDINAL ) . The PERSON never passed through the readings and lapsed .", "Subsequently , in DATE a parliamentary majority again rejected a bill concerning equality between single adopters and sole providers regarding entitlement to special child subsidy ( see PERSON . DATE , ORG on Parliamentary Proceedings CARDINAL - CARDINAL , supplement A , column CARDINAL ) and a corresponding bill lapsed in DATE ( see PERSON . DATE , ORG on Parliamentary Proceedings supplement A , column CARDINAL ) . On the contrary , in connection with an amendment in DATE , the legislature clarified the existing state of law by inserting the following provision into section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW :", "\u201c A child of a single adopter is not entitled to special child benefits unless the single adopter dies , see subsection CARDINAL , CARDINAL or more of the conditions of subsection CARDINAL ) to ( v ) are satisfied , or the child has been adopted as a stepchild and CARDINAL or more of the conditions of subsection CARDINAL ) to ( vi ) are satisfied . \u201d", "In DATE an act ( no .

The intention of the legislature was to relax a number of the requirements then applicable concerning the age of the candidate adopters , the length of the cohabitation , and so on . As concerns single adopters , the following was stated ( see ORG on Parliamentary Proceedings DATE , supplement A , column CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Under current practice , it has only been possible for single persons to be approved as adopters in a very few exceptional cases . From DATE , a wish has been put forward for extended access for single persons to become adopters . In view of the fact that there are no doubt single persons who will be just as suited to bring up a child as a married couple , it would be wrong to exclude such single persons from adopting . However , according to the information available , it is doubtful whether it will be possible to allocate foreign children for adoption by unmarried applicants , and hence it may prove meaningless to examine single candidates for the purpose of approval for adoption . It may also be difficult to establish clear criteria for the cases in which single persons should have access to pre - examination . It is the intention to take up these questions for further consideration for the purpose of examining the prospects of improving the access of single persons to become adopters . During those proceedings , particular attempts will be made to seek clarity concerning the attitude of foreign countries to allocating children for adoption by single adopters . \u201d", "Single - parent adoption was formally allowed in GPE on DATE by Executive Order no .

Pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection l ( iii ) , of ORG , one of the conditions for approval as a single adopter is that the candidate disposes of \u2018 adequate financial means\u2019 .
