On DATE he applied for political asylum . In support of his request he submitted that he had lived in ORG , an enclave separated from the rest of GPE by a strip of territory of GPE , where he had engaged in activities in favour of the organisation ORG do Enclave de Cabinda , ORG ( PERSON ) . He was charged with propaganda and mobilisation and with the co - ordination between the population and the various offices of the PERSON . During the presidential elections in DATE he organised a demonstration in GPE persuading people not to participate at the elections . He was arrested and taken into detention in LOC where he was held for DATE , during which time he was , he contended , beaten and tortured . On DATE he managed to escape through the assistance of his uncle . On DATE he arrived in GPE . On DATE he took a plane to GPE and subsequently arrived in GPE . He asserted that he could not return to his country without risking his life .", "On DATE ORG f\u00fcr die ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s request and invited him to leave the NORP territory within DATE . ORG did not consider that the evidence he adduced in support of fear of persecution to be reliable and doubted the credibility of his asylum claim .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action against the refusal of asylum and his envisaged expulsion with ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) . He claimed that if returned to GPE he had a well - founded fear of persecution , not only because of his political engagement in GPE , but also because of his political activities in GPE where he collaborated closely with the organisation of the PERSON and the For\u00e7as Armadas de Cabinda , ORG ) . In the proceedings before ORG he was represented by counsel .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action . The court pointed out that information provided in particular by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE could not confirm the applicant \u2019s submissions that a demonstration had taken place in GPE in DATE and that he had been detained in prison in ORG . The court further observed that the situation complained of was limited to ORG , but members of the PERSON were present in Cabinda and could move freely . There was no indication that NORP citizens who had requested political asylum abroad were subjected to political persecution upon their return to GPE . According to information of ORG , the known political activities of NORP citizens abroad , in particular in GPE , would be unlikely to attract the interest of NORP authorities unless they were to include acts of violence against GPE . The applicant had assured that he had not taken part in any military action against the NORP army . There was therefore no reasonable likelihood that the applicant would be persecuted if he were to return to GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal ( PERSON ) on the ground that the applicant \u2019s submissions were not sufficiently substantiated .", "On DATE the applicant renewed his request to be granted asylum ( PERSON ) . He referred to his previous statements and added that on DATE he had been elected president and co - ordinator of the NORP fraction of the FLEC- FAC which had CARDINAL members . According to him , it must be assumed that members of the NORP embassy knew of his political engagement and that , in the event of his return to GPE , he would be persecuted . Further , according to a report of ORG of DATE , the situation in ORG had deteriorated . Unarmed civilians were deliberately tortured or killed during army raids by NORP troops on their villages following PERSON attacks in the vicinity . There was no investigation into the reports of beating and other abuses or to prosecute those responsible .", "On DATE ORG refused to conduct new asylum proceedings . It took the view that the applicant \u2019s submissions gave no ground for a more favourable decision . There was no indication that the applicant would be exposed to political persecution for his political activities in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action with the ORG claiming to be to granted political asylum .", "On DATE the applicant applied for an interim injunction ( einstweilige Anordnung ) requesting to stay his expulsion pending the administrative court proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed this request . The court observed that pursuant to the relevant legal provisions , a further set of asylum proceedings was only admissible if there were reasons to reopen the proceedings and the refugee had been prevented , through no fault of his own , from submitting these reasons in the first set of proceedings . Moreover , the change of circumstances had to be presented in a conclusive manner . In the applicant 's case , his new submissions did not constitute relevant circumstances for a more favourable decision . It further confirmed the view that , in any event , the applicant \u2019s purely political activities in GPE were not likely to attract the interest of the NORP authorities and that there were no solid reasons to believe that on his return to GPE he might suffer political persecution .", "The applicant filed a constitutional complaint against this decision .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication .", "In DATE the applicant had requested to be transferred to GPE .
