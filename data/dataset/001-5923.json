THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J.J.M. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s wife died in DATE . At that time , the applicant was employed in GPE . He did not , at that time , apply for a widower \u2019s pension under the GPE Widows and LAW ( Algemene Weduwen- en Wezenwet ; \u201c AWW \u201d ) . On DATE , the applicant had a traffic accident resulting in his becoming incapacitated for work .", "In a decision taken on DATE , ORG ( Centrale PERSON ) determined that also widowers were entitled to benefits under the AWW .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for a pension under the AWW and , in its decision of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) awarded him an AWW pension . In accordance with LAW of the AWW , the starting date of the pension was fixed at DATE prior to the first date of DATE in which the applicant had filed his request for AWW benefits . Although LAW of the AWW provided for the possibility to grant a pension with retroactive effect on grounds of special circumstances , ORG held that no such circumstances existed in the applicant \u2019s case . Consequently , the applicant was entitled to AWW benefits as from DATE .", "On DATE , ORG informed the applicant that it was withdrawing his AWW pension and , on DATE , issued a decision terminating the applicant \u2019s AWW benefits as from DATE under the application of an arrangement according to which his pension would be gradually reduced to nil by reducing it DATE with CARDINAL Netherlands Guilders . In view of his personal circumstances he was further not required to repay any benefits already paid to him until that time . The reason given was that , as the law stood at the time of the death of the applicant \u2019s wife , no entitlement under the AWW could arise because the applicant was then employed outside the GPE and covered by NORP social insurance . That being so , his wife was ipso facto excluded from the insurance scheme set up under that Act .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) . In its judgment of DATE ORG held that the statutory provision at issue was discriminatory and , therefore , contrary to LAW and LAW . Although that statutory provision excluded the wife of a GPE resident who was employed abroad and covered by foreign social security from the insurance scheme set up under the AWW , it did not so exclude the husband of a GPE resident similarly employed and covered . ORG referred obiter dictum to a directive of ORG of DATE ) , which could not , however , apply directly since it did not cover social insurance payable upon the death of CARDINAL spouse to the survivor .", "On DATE , ORG appealed to ORG ( ORG ) , which overturned the judgment of ORG on DATE , holding that according to its case - law married men could not derive any entitlement from the AWW before DATE . Although admittedly this placed men whose wives had died before that date in a disadvantageous position , this was due to the fact that married women simply were not insured under the AWW before then . ORG declined to rule as to whether this \u201c [ could ] be seen as a form of unequal treatment of men and women , or otherwise \u201d .", "In the light of a judgment handed down on CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) in which it was held that employment abroad did not constitute a ground for excluding a married woman from insurance under the AWW , ORG reconsidered the applicant \u2019s case and decided on DATE to withdraw its decision of CARDINAL DATE and to award him a AWW pension as from DATE as well as interest for the period DATE and DATE . He was further informed that he could file an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision within DATE . The applicant did not avail himself of this possibility .", "The AWW , which has been replaced on DATE by LAW ( PERSON ) , provided for benefits for the widow and child(ren ) of a deceased person who was insured under LAW . Under the AWW scheme , all persons residing in the GPE and non - residents gainfully employed in the GPE were compulsory insured . Contributions to this scheme were paid by all persons gainfully employed in the GPE .", "AWW benefits were , in principle , granted to widows younger than DATE from whom it could not be expected that they would provide for themselves and , in case there were any , their child(ren ) by working . AWW benefits stopped when the widow attained DATE . Benefits for children were in principle stopped when they reached the age of DATE but could be prolonged until DATE where the child was studying .", "The AWW did not provide for any benefits for widowers . This situation changed on DATE , when ORG handed down a decision in which it held that also widowers were entitled to benefits under the AWW ( PERSON ) .", "Entitlement to an AWW pension was not dependent on the level of contributions paid as , contrary to a social security scheme based on employment ( werknemersverzekering ) , it was a general social security scheme ( volksverzekering ) . The level of benefits was linked to the statutory minimum wage .", "On DATE , ORG issued Directive LAW concerning the gradual implementation of equal treatment between men and women in the field of social security based on employment , allowing member states a period of DATE until DATE within which to make any amendments to legislation which might be necessary in order to bring it in conformity with the directive .", "LAW provides that provisions of international treaties and decisions of international ( intergovernmental ) organisations which , according to their content , may be binding on anyone shall have binding force after they have been published .", "With regard to the prohibition of discrimination , the GPE is a party to , inter alia , the LAW , which was ratified by LAW DATE , and the ORG of DATE which , as regards the GPE , entered into force on DATE . LAW ORG provides as follows :", "\" All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without discrimination to the equal protection of the law . In this respect , the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status . \"", "ORG recognised in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL [ corrected in GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ] ) , that LAW is a provision of an international treaty which , according to its content , may be binding on anyone , and must therefore in principle be applied directly by the GPE courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
