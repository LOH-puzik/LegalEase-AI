GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as put forward by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was originally from GPE ( FRG ) , where he had first worked as a chartered accountant and later managed an office for a firm of tax consultants . In DATE he set up his own business , specialising in advising and rescuing companies in difficulty . In DATE , before GPE \u2019s reunification , which came into effect on DATE , he moved to GPE in GPE ( GDR ) with the intention of setting up a tax consultancy there although he had not taken the examination required in the FRG for carrying on the occupation of a tax consultant ( PERSON ) . Also in DATE the applicant acquired NORP citizenship so as to be able to set up his tax consultancy in the GPE .", "In a decision taken on DATE ORG ( Finanzministerium ) of the GPE , acting through the Director of ORG ( PERSON Besitz- PERSON ) , granted the appointment ( PERSON ) of tax consultant to the applicant although he had not taken the examination likewise normally required in the GPE for the practice of that profession .", "The applicant then set up his tax consultancy , which was quite successful . In DATE he had CARDINAL employees and an DATE turnover of MONEY ( DEM ) .", "After reunification , the GPE tax authorities ( GPE f\u00fcr PERSON ) stated in a note ( NORP ) of CARDINAL DATE that the applicant \u2019s appointment had been lawful and that none of the grounds for revocation referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG \u2019s Tax Consultants Act DATE ( Steuerberatungsgesetz DATE see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) existed .", "In a decision of DATE the tax authorities of ORG ( PERSON ) revoked the appointment pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) as amended in LAW DATE ( Steuer- beratungsgesetz DATE see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) on the ground that the appointment had been made in breach of the statutory provisions then in force in the GPE . They said that conditions of appointment at the relevant time , DATE namely , the requirement of DATE previous experience as a tax consultant in the GPE \u2013 as set out in LAW ( PERSON \u2013 see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) had not been satisfied . According to the tax authorities , that Order did not take into account experience gained as a tax consultant in the ORG . The purpose of the Order was , in fact , to facilitate access to the occupation of tax consultant by citizens of the GPE who had the knowledge of the subject required in the GPE , not to allow citizens of the ORG to use it as a roundabout way of gaining appointment without taking the requisite examination .", "The applicant appealed against that decision . According to him , his appointment as a tax consultant by ORG of the GPE was permanent and lawful . By virtue of section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) , tax consultants appointed between DATE and DATE had been granted provisional appointments until DATE ; and the subsequent amendment of the Act in DATE was unconstitutional because in section CARDINAL a new ground for revocation had been added , CARDINAL not mentioned in the previous LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) . Moreover , he had acted in good faith since he had given all the requisite details to ORG , which in full knowledge of the facts had appointed him as a tax consultant . He had then , he said , made substantial investments in the running of his firm and he could not at the time foresee that his appointment would be revoked following subsequent legislative amendments .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the tax authorities on the same grounds . It stated , inter alia , that the provisions of LAW of the GPE \u2019s Tax Consultants Order were clear , as was apparent from the settled case - law of ORG ( ORG ) in similar cases , and that the provisions excluded any experience gained in the ORG . At the time of the applicant \u2019s appointment in DATE , there might have been isolated instances of NORP civil servants who , given the general \u201c end - of - an - era \u201d state of the regime , had made appointments based on their own interpretations of the relevant statutory provisions , but that had not in any way reflected a general practice .", "In a decision of DATE ORG refused to allow an appeal on points of law by the applicant , on the ground that it did not raise a new question of law .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , refused to stay execution of the decisions of the lower courts . It held that neither the interpretation nor the application of the relevant legislative provisions by ORG , which had relied on settled case - law of ORG , infringed the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . That applied both to ORG analysis of the initial conditions to be met for the applicant \u2019s appointment and to its belief that the applicant must , in view of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , have known why his appointment was illegal .", "In a decision of DATE ORG refused to consider the merits of the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "In DATE , as a result of those decisions and in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) , the applicant had to close his firm of tax consultants . He subsequently sold his firm and his good will .", "The GPE \u2019s Tax Consultants Order ( Steuerberatungsordnung ) was issued by the ORG ( ORG ) in GPE final DATE .
