The applicant was born in DATE . At the time the application was lodged he lived in GPE in GPE . He currently resides in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant immigrated to GPE in DATE . His request for asylum was rejected . His expulsion was , however , suspended under the agreement of the Home Secretaries of the ORG not to expel NORP nationals ( \u201c ORG \u201d der PERSON ) . In DATE the applicant obtained a provisional residence permit ( ORG ) . In DATE , following an amendment of LAW , he was issued with a limited residence title for exceptional purposes ( NORP ) .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request under LAW of LAW . It noted that the applicant only had a limited residence title for exceptional purposes , and no unlimited residence permit or provisional residence permit , as required under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE f\u00fcr GPE ) rejected his objection .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an action with ORG ( ORG ) , claiming that he had been residing in GPE since DATE and that he should , therefore , have the right to child benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action regarding child benefits DATE . It confirmed that only aliens with an unlimited residence permit or with a provisional residence permit were entitled to the payment of child benefits under LAW of LAW , as in force until DATE . According to ORG , the legislature had only intended to grant child benefits to aliens who were likely to stay in GPE on a permanent basis . Aliens with only a limited residence title for exceptional purposes were , however , not likely to stay . The court further pointed out that this distinction did not violate the NORP LAW . In the present case , the legislature had remained within its wide margin of appreciation in social law matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal to the extent that his claims under LAW until DATE were concerned . ORG confirmed the lower court \u2019s reasoning , noting that the applicant did not have a stable residence permit in DATE , as his limited residence title for exceptional purposes had had to be renewed DATE . Likewise , referring to the wide margin of appreciation of the legislature , it took the view that LAW of LAW was compatible with LAW . In this respect , it considered that until DATE families had benefited from child benefits and tax deductions ( ORG ) as a system of compensation ( dualer PERSON ) . The applicant and his wife had paid taxes in DATE but had not obtained child benefits . In the court \u2019s view , this taxation , not the refusal of child benefits , might have violated LAW ; however , it was not for the social courts to decide on that matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundessozialgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint combined with a request for an interim measure . He claimed that the relevant provision of LAW was discriminatory and racist , and violated his right to respect for his family life . In addition , he alleged that the refusal of his request for child benefits infringed the principle of social justice ( PERSON ) laid down in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain his complaint and rejected his request for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that it was not competent to deal with the applicant \u2019s claims regarding child benefits for the period after DATE and transferred the proceedings to ORG ( ORG ) . The proceedings before ORG are still pending .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( PERSON - gesetz , ORG - PERSON , S. CARDINAL ) , as in force until DATE , provided for the payment of child benefits which are financed by ORG Section CARDINAL , as far as relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Under the provisions of the present Act , anybody is entitled to child benefits for his or her children ... ,", "CARDINAL . NORP who has a place of residence ( PERSON ) or regular residence ( gew\u00f6hnlicher ORG ) within the scope of the present Act ,", "...", "( CARDINAL ) An alien is entitled to a benefit under LAW , if he has a residence permit or a provisional residence permit . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following a reform of the law on child benefits with effect from DATE , an equivalent provision on child benefits is to be found in LAW of LAW ( Einkommenssteuergesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ( CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL , PERCENT ) , ORG ruled that LAW in the above cited version was incompatible with the right to equal treatment under LAW . Accordingly , the legislator was ordered to amend the law by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found , in particular , that the different treatment of parents who were and who were not in possession of a stable residence permit lacked sufficient justification . As the granting of child benefits related to the protection of family life under LAW , very weighty reasons would have to be put forward to justify unequal treatment . Such reasons were not apparent . In so far as the provision was aimed at limiting the granting of child benefits to those aliens who where likely to stay permanently in GPE , the criteria applied were inappropriate to reach that aim . The fact that a person was in possession of a limited residence title did not form a sufficient basis to predict the duration of his or her stay in GPE . ORG did not discern any other reasons justifying the unequal treatment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
