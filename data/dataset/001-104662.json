The court acknowledged the fact that Mr GPE \u2019s private house and other belongings had been destroyed as a result of the hostilities in DATE . It held , however , that under LAW , the ORG was liable for damage caused only by unlawful actions on the part of its agents . It noted that the military operation in GPE had been launched by virtue of relevant presidential and governmental decrees , which had been found to be constitutional by ORG , except for CARDINAL provisions of the relevant governmental decree . In that connection the court noted that the CARDINAL provisions had never been applied to Mr GPE , and therefore no unlawful actions on the part of ORG bodies had ever taken place to warrant compensation for damage inflicted on his property . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal ( see GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . By a default judgment of DATE ORG dismissed a claim brought by PERSON against a number of federal ministries in so far as she alleged that the block of flats in which she had lived had been destroyed by a missile during an attack by the federal armed forces on ORG in DATE and sought compensation for the destroyed flat and belongings that had been in it . She also sought compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The court noted , inter alia , that under LAW , the ORG was liable for damage caused only by unlawful actions on the part of its agents . It further found that the actions of the NORP federal troops in GPE had been lawful , as the military operation in GPE had been launched under relevant presidential and governmental decrees , which had been found to be constitutional by ORG . The court concluded that there were no grounds to grant Ms ORG \u2019s claim for pecuniary damage and that her claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage could not be granted either , in the absence of any fault or unlawful actions on the part of the defendants . The judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE ( see GPE v. GPE , no .
