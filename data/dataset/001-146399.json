{"ITEMID": "001-146399", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2014, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF KARIN ANDERSSON AND OTHERS v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants own property close to ORG , in the vicinity of a FAC area , the NORP network of nature protection areas established under LAW of DATE ( see further below at paragraph CARDINAL ) . Most of them live there ( permanently or on a part - time basis ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( GPE ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) applied to the Government for permission , under LAW ( ORG ) , to construct a QUANTITY long railway section in a river area in the north of GPE ( constituting the final section of a railway called \u201c GPE , the total length of which is QUANTITY km ) . The ORG presented some alternative railway stretches , all located in a specified \u201c corridor \u201d , but recommended the CARDINAL named \u201c alternative east \u201d . The proposed railway construction concerned certain areas which were or were going to be part of Natura DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that CARDINAL of the present applicants own houses or land within the mentioned \u201c corridor \u201d : PERSON , PERSON , PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , and PERSON . Ownership of Mr PERSON \u2019s property was transferred to PERSON on DATE . The properties of the other CARDINAL applicants \u2013 houses and land in their ownership or owned houses located on non - freehold sites \u2013 are situated outside the \u201c corridor \u201d . The distance from their properties to the \u201c corridor \u201d or the specific stretch of the railway fixed in later proceedings vary ; the houses appear to be situated QUANTITY away whereas the closest piece of land is located QUANTITY from the \u201c corridor \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government , after having heard ORG , granted the application and allowed the construction of the railway in the proposed \u201c corridor \u201d under the condition , inter alia , that the ORG adopt a railway plan before DATE and also a specific plan for the realisation of the necessary environmental compensation measures in the Natura DATE areas . The plan on compensation measures had to be presented to the ORG before the railway plan was adopted . The ORG stated , inter alia , that the activity could be permitted , despite its harmful effect on the environment in a ORG DATE area , if there were no alternative solutions and the railway had to be constructed for reasons of public interest .", "CARDINAL . A number of individual property owners , including CARDINAL of the applicants in the present case \u2013 Ms Bring , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON DATE petitioned ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) for a judicial review of the case and requested that the ORG \u2019s decision be quashed . The property owners claimed that the decision contradicted NORP law as well as applicable ORG law , including the Habitats Directive . It was argued , firstly , that the decision contravened the general rule in LAW on the site to be chosen for activities and installations that may affect human health or the environment . This aspect allegedly had a direct and clear bearing on their civil rights . Secondly , they asserted that the ORG \u2019s decision violated NORP regulations on nature conservation by failing to consider relevant alternative sites for the railway .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the petitions for a judicial review because it was not possible to determine who should be considered an interested party at that stage of the railway planning . The exact route of the railway would not be established until the railway plan had been drawn up . Until then , it could not be assessed with any certainty who would be affected to the extent that they were entitled to bring an action or what account should be taken of their interests . Further stating that the parties affected to a sufficient extent by the future railway would be able to obtain a judicial review of the later decision to adopt the railway plan , the court refused the petitioners locus standi .", "CARDINAL . One judge dissented , finding that the issue of locus standi in respect of each petitioner should be further investigated by the court in order to ensure that the individual interests were taken into account , having regard to the binding character of the ORG \u2019s decision in the later railway planning proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the ORG applied to ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) in GPE for a permit to construct the railway in the specific ORG DATE area and to ORG ( milj\u00f6domstolen ) in ORG for permits to build CARDINAL bridges .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted a construction permit for the railway by a decision of DATE , which was subsequently appealed against to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided to examine the cases jointly . By judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , considering itself bound by the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE on the permissibility of the railway project , the court decided to grant all the permits requested by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Milj\u00f6\u00f6verdomstolen ) in GPE quashed ORG judgments and referred the cases back to the latter instance . The appellate court found that the ORG \u2019s decision had not contained a detailed examination of measures necessary to compensate for environmental harm caused by the railway project , and that these issues had to be settled as part of the determination of the construction permit requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided anew to grant the permits requested by the ORG . The court considered itself bound by the ORG \u2019s decision as to the permissibility of the railway project and thus limited its examination to the environmental compensation measures , as indicated by the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL applicants \u2013 PERSON and Mr PERSON DATE appealed against ORG judgment in so far as it concerned the permit for the railway construction . All applicants except PERSON appealed against the part which concerned the permit to construct the bridges .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG affirmed the binding nature of the ORG \u2019s permissibility decision and approved the construction of the railway and the bridges with certain added conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal and , thus , ORG judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG adopted a railway plan for the area in question .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL applicants \u2013 all but PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and Mr DATE appealed to the Government against the railway plan . They essentially complained of the specific stretch of the railway , invoking , inter alia , nuisance such as noise and vibrations affecting the enjoyment of their property .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG referred to its decision on permissibility of CARDINAL DATE . It found that the specific stretch chosen in the railway plan was situated within the permitted \u201c corridor \u201d and thus rejected the appeals .", "CARDINAL . All of the applicants and several other petitioners turned to ORG and requested that it , by way of a judicial review , order the quashing of the ORG \u2019s decision . They claimed , inter alia , that , although their civil rights were affected by the planned railway , they had not had these rights considered and determined by a court , in violation of the Convention . As to the chosen location of the railway , they also asserted that the ORG \u2019s decision was contrary to provisions of LAW and LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held a hearing in the case , rejected the petition , finding that the railway plan was in line with the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE on the permissibility of the railway project and that the proceedings for the adoption of the plan did not demonstrate any failings . The court considered that the question of permissibility of a railway project was within the power of the ORG , which had to take into account public interests such as environmental , industrial , economic and regional policy . The Government \u2019s permissibility decision was binding for the subsequent proceedings in that courts and other decision - making bodies could not examine issues that had been determined by that decision . Thus , in the proceedings concerning the construction permits requested by the ORG , the various instances could decide on conditions and other details but not on the general permissibility as defined in the ORG \u2019s decision . Similarly , in the third stage of the decision process \u2013 the adoption of the railway plan \u2013 it was for the authorities and courts to decide only on the precise location of the railway , within the area designated by the ORG \u2019s decision . The Government had not been obliged to review its decision of CARDINAL DATE on the permissibility of the railway project and the designation of the \u201c corridor \u201d in which the railway could be located . These issues could not be examined in the third stage of the decision process . ORG further stated that , if private interests were affected by the location of a railway project , judicial review could be obtained by petitioning the court in proceedings against the ORG \u2019s permissibility decision . The fact that the court , on DATE , had concluded that no individual petitioner could be considered to have locus standi in relation to the permissibility decision did not compel it to include in its current examination of the adoption of the railway plan the issues of permissibility of the project or its general location .", "CARDINAL . One judge dissented , considering that ORG judgment contravened its decision of DATE . She noted , inter alia , that the adoption of a railway plan \u2013 as opposed to the construction permits DATE had direct consequences for the individual as it entailed a right for the railway company , under certain conditions , to expropriate land . Consequently , the court , in the instant case , should have examined all the objections presented by the appellants , including the claim that there were better alternative locations for the railway . According to the dissenting judge , a full judicial review had also been foreseen by the court in its earlier decision .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the parties\u2019 observations in the case that CARDINAL of the applicants ( including CARDINAL with houses or land situated outside the \u201c corridor \u201d ) have received some form of compensation as a consequence of the railway construction , either for land requisitioned or for reduced residential value or market value . In CARDINAL case , the change to noise - reducing windows was partly paid by the ORG . It is not clear whether the other applicants requested compensation . In the vicinity of some properties , whose owners have not received compensation , noise barriers have been erected in order to keep the noise from the railway below the applicable target values ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
