The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She lives with her CARDINAL children in a house owned by the local housing association , ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG moved the applicant and her children to CARDINAL FAC in DATE following a report that she was suffering serious racial abuse at her then current address .", "CARDINAL . Concorde Drive is in the parliamentary constituency of ORG . On DATE , the member of ORG ( MP ) for the GPE LOC constituency , Mr PERSON , initiated a debate on the subject of municipal housing policy ( and the ORG in particular ) in ORG . During the course of his speech , the MP referred specifically to the applicant several times , giving her name and address and referring to members of her family . He commented as follows :", "\u201c The subject of anti - social behaviour by what newspapers frequently call ' neighbours from hell ' has been a staple of social housing throughout the country for some time , and the government are , of course , in the process of taking steps to provide local authorities with the power to do something about such behaviour . Whether authorities such as GPE will actually use the power is another matter .", "My reason for raising the subject of CARDINAL FAC in my constituency and the behaviour of its shifting population is not just to draw attention to another example of neighbours from hell ; it is also to note that housing practices by local authorities , which it appeared had been stamped out in DATE , are beginning to re - emerge in the voluntary housing movement . ...", "ORG purchased CARDINAL FAC in my constituency in DATE ... and in DATE it moved in as the new tenants [ the applicant ] and her CARDINAL children , who are now aged DATE . Her brother , currently in prison , also gives QUANTITY as his permanent address . ...", "The Government 's own ORG , ' ORG , published in DATE , noted :", "' Such behaviour manifests itself in many different ways and at varying levels of intensity . This can include vandalism , noise , verbal and physical abuse , threats of violence , racial harassment , damage to property , trespass , nuisance from dogs , car repairs on the street , joyriding , domestic violence , drugs and other criminal activities such as burglary . '", "Inevitably , the majority \u2013 if not all \u2013 of these activities have been forced on the neighbours of CARDINAL FAC during the tenancy of that property and the garage further up the street that goes with it , by [ the applicant ] , her children and their juvenile visitors , who seem strangely reluctant to attend school during TIME , and even more adult visitors who come to the house at all times of DATE and night , frequently gaining entry by unorthodox means such as the bathroom window . Indeed , it is fair to say that there have been times when occupation of the house by the visitors has been more frequent than that of [ the applicant ] .", "So far as the garages grouped further along Concorde Drive are concerned \u2013 CARDINAL of the garages automatically comes with the tenancy of No . DATE complaints consist of numerous youths hanging around , vandalising cars , climbing on and damaging the garage roofs , under the apparent leadership , or at least the spirited concurrence of the [ applicant 's ] family , adult and children , which makes improvement of those garages by other owners a complete waste of time . More seriously , arson inside the garage belonging to No . CARDINAL , and the regular destruction of its doors , have led other legitimate users of the garage to park their vehicles elsewhere for safety reasons .", "But it is the conduct of [ the applicant ] and her circle which gives most cause for concern . Its impact on their immediate neighbours extends to perhaps a QUANTITY houses on either side . Since the matter was first drawn to my attention in DATE , I have received reports of threats against other children ; of fighting in the house , the garden and the street outside ; of people coming and going TIME a day \u2013 in particular , a series of men late at night ; of rubbish and stolen cars dumped nearby ; of glass strewn in the road in the presence of [ the applicant ] and regular visitors ; of alleged drug activity ; and of all the other common regular annoyances to neighbours that are associated with a house of this type . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant denies the truth of the majority of the allegations . The MP has never tried to communicate with her regarding the complaints made about her by her neighbours and has never attempted to verify the accuracy of his comments made in his speech either before or after the debate . Shortly before the debate , the MP issued a press release to several newspapers , including the GPE - based ORG and the national ORG . The press release was subject to an embargo prohibiting disclosure until the precise time when the speech commenced . The contents of the press release were substantially the same as those of the MP 's speech . DATE , both newspapers carried articles consisting of purported extracts of the speech , although these were based upon the press release . Both articles included photographs of the applicant and mentioned her name and address . The main headline in ORG was :", "\u201c MP Attacks ' Neighbours From Hell ' \u201d", "In the Daily Express the headline was :", "\u201c MP names nightmare neighbour \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was approached by journalists and television reporters asking for her response to the ORG 's allegations and her comments were summarised in each newspaper DATE , although they were not given as much prominence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently received hate mail addressed to her at CARDINAL FAC . CARDINAL letter stated that she should \u201c be in houses with your own kind , not in amongst decent owners \u201d . Another letter stated :", "\u201c You silly black bitch , I am just writing to let you know that if you do not stop your black nigger wogs nuisance , I will personally sort you and your smelly jungle bunny kids out . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also stopped in the street , spat at and abused by strangers as \u201c the neighbour from hell \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a report was prepared for the ORG by a group which monitors racial harassment and attacks . The report found that \u201c it has now come to the point where [ the applicant ] has been put in considerable danger as a result of her name being released to the public \u201d . The report recommended that the applicant be re - housed as a matter of urgency . She was re - housed in DATE and her children were obliged to change schools .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote through her solicitors to the MP outlining her complaints and seeking his comments thereon . The letter was referred to ORG by the MP . The Speaker 's representative replied to the MP on CARDINAL DATE to the effect that the ORG 's remarks were protected by absolute parliamentary privilege :", "\u201c Subject to the rules of order in debate , Members may state whatever they think fit in debate , however offensive it may be to the feelings or injurious to the character of individuals , and they are protected by this privilege from any action for libel , as well as from any other molestation . \u201d", "This letter was copied and forwarded to the applicant 's solicitors in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the applicant 's solicitors wrote to the then Prime Minister , Mr PERSON , asking that , as leader of the political party to which Mr PERSON belonged , he investigate the applicant 's complaints and take appropriate action . ORG replied on DATE , stating that :", "\u201c It is a matter for individual Members of ORG to decide how they deal with their constituents and it is not for the Prime Minister to comment . There is a strict Parliamentary convention that Members of ORG do not intervene in the affairs of other Members ' constituencies and this applies equally to the Prime Minister . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Words spoken by MPs in the course of debates in ORG are protected by absolute privilege . This is provided by LAW , which states :", "\u201c ... the freedome of speech and debates or proceedings in ORG ought not to be impeached or questioned in a court or place out of Parlyament . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The effect of this privilege was described by Lord Chief Justice PERSON in Ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) Queen 's Bench Reports CARDINAL at CARDINAL :", "\u201c It is clear that statements made by Members of either ORG of ORG in their places in the ORG , though they might be untrue to their knowledge , could not be made the foundation of civil or criminal proceedings , however injurious they might be to the interest of a third party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Statements made by MPs outside ORG are subject to the ordinary laws of defamation and breach of confidence , save where they are protected by qualified privilege .", "CARDINAL . NORP The question whether or not qualified privilege applies to statements made in any given political context turns upon the public interest . In ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL , which concerned allegations made in the NORP press about an NORP political crisis in DATE , Lord PERSON of GPE stated in ORG , at page CARDINAL :", "Depending on the circumstances , the matters to be taken into account include the following .

The circumstances of the publication , including the timing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Press coverage , to the extent that it fairly and accurately reports parliamentary debates , is generally protected by a form of qualified privilege which is lost only if the publisher has acted \u201c maliciously \u201d . \u201c Malice \u201d , for this purpose , is established where the report concerned is published for improper motives or with \u201c reckless indifference \u201d to the truth . A failure to make proper enquiries is not sufficient in itself to establish malice , but it may be evidence from which malice ( in the sense of reckless indifference to the truth ) can reasonably be inferred .", "CARDINAL . MPs can waive the absolute immunity which they enjoy in ORG as a result of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where the conduct of a person in or in relation to proceedings in ORG is in issue in defamation proceedings , he may waive for the purposes of those proceedings , so far as concerns him , the protection of any enactment or rule of law which prevents proceedings in ORG being impeached or questioned in any court or place out of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Where a person waives that protection \u2013", "( a ) any such enactment or rule of law shall not apply to prevent evidence being given , questions being asked or statements , submissions , comments or findings being made about his conduct , and", "( b ) none of those things shall be regarded as infringing the privilege of either ORG of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The waiver by CARDINAL person of that protection does not affect its operation in relation to another person who has not waived it .", "( CARDINAL ) Nothing in this section affects any enactment or rule of law so far as it protects a person ( including a person who has waived the protection referred to above ) from legal liability for words spoken or things done in the course of , or for the purposes of or incidental to , any proceedings in ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . General control is exercised over debates by the Speaker of each ORG of ORG . Each ORG has its own mechanisms for disciplining members who deliberately make false statements in the course of debates . Deliberately misleading statements are punishable by ORG as a contempt . Alternatively , as ORG on Procedure ( DATE ) has observed :", "\u201c ... there already exists a wide range of avenues which can be pursued by an aggrieved person who wishes to correct or rebut remarks made about him in the ORG . He can approach his Member of ORG with a view to his tabling DATE , or an amendment where appropriate ; there may be cases which can be raised through Questions if some ministerial responsibility can be established ; he can petition the ORG , through a Member ; and he can approach directly the Member who made the allegations in the hope of persuading him that they are unfounded and that a retraction would be justified . We believe that in these circumstances , the ORG would not expect a rigid adherence to the convention that one Member does not take up a case brought by the constituent of another , particularly if the latter was the source of the statement complained of , and so long as the courtesies of proper notification were observed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under Schedule CARDINAL , Part II of LAW DATE , \u201c [ p]roceedings wholly or partly in respect of defamation \u201d are excepted from the scope of the civil legal aid scheme .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Green Form \u201d assistance is available to potential litigants with insufficient means in order to allow them to receive TIME free legal advice from a solicitor in cases of alleged defamation . The time can be extended upon application .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , solicitors may enter into conditional fee agreements in respect of any type of proceedings specified in an Order made by the Lord Chancellor . A conditional fee agreement is defined under that section as an agreement in writing between a solicitor and his client which provides that the solicitor 's fees and expenses , or any part of them , are to be payable only in specified circumstances . LAW DATE ( LAW of DATE ) permitted conditional fee agreements in relation to \u201c all proceedings \u201d . The Order entered into force on DATE . A conditional fee agreement can not prevent an unsuccessful litigant from being potentially liable to pay all or part of his opponent 's costs in connection with the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The limitation period applicable to defamation proceedings in respect of statements made in DATE was DATE pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , as inserted by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . A joint committee of both ORG was set up in DATE and tasked with reviewing the law of parliamentary privilege . The committee received written and oral evidence from a wide variety of sources from within GPE and abroad and held CARDINAL sessions of evidence in public . Its report was published in DATE . LAW sets out its conclusions on parliamentary immunity :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The immunity is wide . Statements made in ORG may not even be used to support a cause of action arising out of ORG , as where a plaintiff suing a member for an alleged libel on television was not permitted to rely on statements made by the member in ORG as proof of malice . The immunity is also absolute : it is not excluded by the presence of malice or fraudulent purpose . Article CARDINAL protects the member who knows what he is saying is untrue as much as the member who acts honestly and responsibly . ... In more precise legal language , it protects a person from legal liability for words spoken or things done in the course of , or for the purposes of or incidental to , any proceedings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . A comparable principle exists in court proceedings . Statements made by a judge or advocate or witness in the course of court proceedings enjoy absolute privilege at common law against claims for defamation . The rationale in the CARDINAL cases is the same . The public interest in the freedom of speech in the proceedings , whether parliamentary or judicial , is of a high order . It is not to be imperilled by the prospect of subsequent inquiry into the state of mind of those who participate in the proceedings even though the price is that a person may be defamed unjustly and left without a remedy .", "CARDINAL . It follows that we do not agree with those who have suggested that members of ORG do not need any greater protection against civil actions than the qualified privilege enjoyed by members of elected bodies in local government . Unlike members of ORG , local councillors are liable in defamation if they speak maliciously . We consider it of utmost importance that there should be a national public forum where all manner of persons , irrespective of their power or wealth , can be criticised . Members should not be exposed to the risk of being brought before the courts to defend what they said in ORG . Abuse of parliamentary freedom of speech is a matter for internal self - regulation by ORG , not a matter for investigation and regulation by the courts . The legal immunity principle is as important DATE as ever . The courts have a duty not to erode this essential constitutional principle . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE provides :", "\u201c ( a ) ORG , representatives of members and the ORG shall enjoy in the territories of its members such privileges and immunities as are reasonably necessary for the fulfilment of their functions . These immunities shall include immunity for all representatives to ORG from arrest and all legal proceedings in the territories of all members , in respect of words spoken and votes cast in the debates of the ORG or its committees or commissions .", "( b ) The members undertake as soon as possible to enter into agreement for the purpose of fulfilling the provisions of paragraph ( a ) above . For this purpose ORG shall recommend to the governments of members the acceptance of an agreement defining the privileges and immunities to be granted in the territories of all members . In addition , a special agreement shall be concluded with ORG of GPE defining the privileges and immunities which the ORG shall enjoy at its seat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In pursuance of paragraph ( b ) above , the member GPE , on DATE , entered into LAW . This provides , in its relevant parts , as follows :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL", "Representatives to ORG and their substitutes shall be immune from all official interrogation and from arrest and from all legal proceedings in respect of words spoken or votes cast by them in the exercise of their functions .", "Article CARDINAL", "During the sessions of ORG , ORG and their substitutes , whether they be members of ORG or not , shall enjoy :", "( a ) on their national territory , the immunities accorded in those countries to members of ORG ;", "( b ) on the territory of all other member GPE , exemption from arrest and prosecution . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE provides :", "\u201c Privileges , immunities and facilities are accorded to the representatives of members not for the personal benefit of the individuals concerned , but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with ORG . Consequently , a member has not only the right but the duty to waive the immunity of its representative in any case where , in the opinion of the member , the immunity would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG , adopted in accordance with LAW establishing a ORG and a ORG of ORG , provides :", "\u201c Members of ORG shall not be subject to any form of inquiry , detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW members of the PERSON ( the lower house of ORG ) may never be held liable for votes cast in the exercise of their functions or on the ground of oral or written statements made in the course of their functions \u2013 so - called \u201c professional immunity \u201d . In these matters , members enjoy immunity from criminal , civil and administrative proceedings . The President however may require a member to keep to the subject or call the member to order if he / she violates the decency and dignity of the ORG or makes defamatory statements ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , criminal or civil proceedings against an MP may be taken without the consent of the NORP only where they are \u201c manifestly not connected with the political activity of the member in question \u201d \u2013 so - called \u201c non - professional immunity \u201d . MPs may therefore be subject to civil proceedings , the issue of whether the matter has manifestly no connection with their duties being determined by the prosecuting authorities . Where the authority considers that that connection is manifest or unclear , it must seek the consent of the PERSON . Where the MP concerned or CARDINAL of the members of ORG require it , consent must also be asked of the PERSON . According to the prevailing view , this level of immunity merely prevents legal action for a limited period of time , proceedings becoming possible once the MP loses his / her immunity status .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government emphasised that these provisions had strong historical roots in the national legal system , serving to guarantee the protection of MPs in their political activity , in particular their freedom to vote and state their views .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the NORP Constitution prohibit proceedings against a member of either ORG concerning the expression of opinion or votes cast . Save in the case of flagrant d\u00e9lit , no member of a ORG may be summoned before a court or arrested during a parliamentary session unless the ORG has given consent . This immunity , even against acts infringing the rights of citizens , is regarded in domestic law and practice as an essential guarantee for the functioning of the legislature and its absolute nature as essential to the efficacy of that guarantee . Private rights have to be regarded as ceding to the overriding public interest .", "CARDINAL . ORG drew attention to LAW , which confers upon members of the ORG and ORG an immunity from every category of legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . They pointed out that the right to parliamentary immunity in the GPE is not absolute . LAW of both the ORG and ORG cover cases in which an MP abuses the protection afforded by LAW . The President in each ORG may admonish any member who violates LAW and then offer the member concerned a chance to retract the offending remark . If the member refuses to make a retraction , or persists in violating LAW , the President may forbid him or her from speaking further or from attending the rest of the sitting or further sittings DATE . Similar immunities and disciplinary procedures apply at the provincial and municipal level .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that parliamentary immunity is indispensable to the operation of democracy and that to give the judiciary authority over what MPs say in their deliberations would represent an unacceptable infringement of the separation of powers .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( DATE ) , an MP shall not be prevented from carrying out his or her duties as a representative . Section CARDINAL ) provides that an MP can not be charged in a court of law or be deprived of liberty owing to opinions expressed by the representative in ORG or owing to conduct in the consideration of a matter , unless ORG gives consent by a majority of CARDINAL of the votes cast . The provisions concerning parliamentary privilege and immunities have a long tradition in the work of ORG , dating back to DATE . The only restriction on the exercise of the freedom of expression of a representative is the requirement in section GPE ) that a representative conduct himself or herself with decorum and not act offensively towards another person . If a representative breaches this condition , the Speaker may issue a warning or prohibit the representative from continuing to talk . ORG may caution a representative who has repeatedly breached the order or suspend him or her for a maximum of DATE .", "CARDINAL . A waiver of immunity may be requested by any person having the right to prosecute or to request prosecution . The Speaker examines whether the party has such a right and whether the intended prosecution concerns the MP 's official actions . ORG decides on such a request in ordinary session and the decisive question is whether the intended prosecution is of such a nature that there is a public or private interest to refer the matter to a court of law . In most cases , ORG has deemed such requests manifestly ill - founded and rejected them . In no case based on alleged damage to another person 's reputation or allegedly incorrect information given by an MP has a prosecution been authorised .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that freedom of speech and the general freedom to act were essential for the performance of the duties of an MP .", "CARDINAL . The provisions in the NORP system which protect the representatives of the people in the performance of their duties date back to DATE , deriving from respect for the expression of the will of the people and the necessity in a democratic State for elected representatives to exercise their mandate freely without fear of legal action or interference from either the executive or the judiciary . The immunity bestowed is absolute in that it covers all acts carried out by MPs in the exercise of their functions regarding criminal and civil liability and permanent since it continues after expiry of their mandates . The immunity is not concerned with the private interests of the MP but with the function that he or she exercises . Thus , it can not be waived by an individual MP .", "CARDINAL . However , the immunity conferred is strictly interpreted and does not extend to acts outside the exercise of the ORG 's mandate , including speech in a private capacity within the ORG or statements in press articles even where these merely repeat statements made during an ORG debate . Parliamentary immunity carries with it a requirement of discretion ( devoir de r\u00e9serve ) and unacceptable forms of expression may be subject to internal admonition .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that parliamentary immunity has developed throughout the world not as a constraint upon the rights of the citizen , but as a fundamental liberty . They argued that a cursory consideration of the history of the principle , its widespread domestic and international constitutional entrenchment and the case - law of the ORG all suggest that parliamentary immunity is protected by the ORG . They supported this argument by reference to the preamble to the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed to , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which provide :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] ORG shall make its own rules and standing orders , with power to attach penalties for their infringement , and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate ...", "[ CARDINAL ] The Members of each ORG of the ORG [ ORG ] ... shall not , in respect of any utterance in either ORG , be amenable to any court or any authority other than the ORG itself . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the LAW expressly recognises , and imposes upon the ORG , an obligation to defend and vindicate the citizen 's right to his or her good name . However , ORG indicated that there is no absolute right to reputation or protection from defamatory utterances under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . They drew attention also to the privileges and immunities enjoyed by representatives to ORG of ORG and members of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . They submitted that it was difficult to see how such immunities could be consistent with the LAW if the conferring by individual GPE of similar immunities in respect of their own Parliaments itself violated the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG argued that the importance of the legitimate objectives pursued by parliamentary immunity was difficult to overstate and that it was for the national authorities to seek to balance the right of individual citizens to a good name with the right of free parliamentary expression . In reviewing the proportionality of the balance struck , they said that the ORG must have regard to the fact that GPE were in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that parliamentary privilege is recognised by a large number of democratic countries across LOC and the rest of the world , including GPE , together with international bodies such as ORG and ORG . They submitted that such a privilege is a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers and the rule of law , both of which are political traditions upon which ORG were founded .", "CARDINAL . They stated that , notwithstanding a recent revision in GPE of the rules of parliamentary privileges and immunities , the protection of free speech in ORG against interference by the courts has never been questioned there and continues to be considered essential to parliamentary government . In the event of any dispute between ORG and the judiciary as to the application of a privilege , it is a \u201c neutral \u201d authority , in the form of ORG , which has the final decision . That court is made up of CARDINAL judges , CARDINAL of whom are appointed by ORG , CARDINAL by the supreme courts and CARDINAL by the President of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that parliamentary privilege pursues its legitimate aim in a proportionate manner , particularly since its scope is limited to parliamentary activity . They argued that MPs would not be able to speak their mind freely in ORG in the absence of an absolute immunity .", "CARDINAL . There is no general provision granting members of ORG ( ORG ) immunity from judicial processes . However , LAW confers immunity in CARDINAL limited situations . Members can not be arrested on the way to or from ORG ( unless apprehended in \u201c public crimes \u201d ) and can not be called to account outside the meetings of ORG for opinions expressed there . This immunity comprises both criminal and civil liability , and extends even to speech where it is alleged that the member has intentionally expressed untruths or where the member has expressed himself or herself on a subject unconnected with the issue under debate . An individual member can not waive the immunity . The absolute nature of the immunity is regarded as necessary to prevent undermining the general purpose of the provision , which is to guarantee the unfettered exchange of information and ideas in ORG , being considered indispensable in the NORP democratic system .", "CARDINAL . However , a member may be held accountable within ORG , improper or insulting behaviour being prohibited and subject to the potential sanction of a warning from the President or exclusion by ORG from the right to speak or participate in the proceedings for the rest of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
