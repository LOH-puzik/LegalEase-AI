The applicant was employed by ORG ( ORG n\u00e1rodn\u00fd v\u00fdbor ) in ORG . In DATE he was dismissed for breach of discipline . Subsequently courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction declared the dismissal unlawful . Their decisions became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , while the above proceedings were pending , the national committees ceased to exist ex lege , and their liquidation formally ended on DATE . The national committees were replaced by district offices ( okresn\u00e9 \u00farady ) which were not formally their legal successors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave notice to the applicant pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW . The dismissal became effective on DATE . The applicant challenged this decision . He argued , in particular , that the dismissal was unlawful and claimed compensation for damage caused by the termination of his contract of employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) heard the parties and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He alleged that the governmental regulations relating to liquidation of the former national committees were unlawful , that he had become an employee of ORG after his dismissal in DATE had been declared unlawful on CARDINAL DATE , and that ORG had paid his salary until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) heard the parties . The case was adjourned and the representative of the defendant was requested to submit the ORG \u2019s regulation of CARDINAL DATE concerning the practical aspects of liquidation of the national committees . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that it should have decided on the case on DATE as it had had all relevant evidence before it . Another hearing before ORG was held on DATE . The parties were acquainted with documentary evidence submitted by the representatives of the defendant . The applicant requested the exclusion of ORG judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) quashed the first instance judgment and ordered ORG to take further evidence . The decision stated that the first instance court had not established with sufficient certainty whether or not the applicant had been employed by ORG DATE and his second dismissal . In particular , ORG considered it necessary to establish whether the applicant had received a salary , or compensation therefor , during the period in question , that is , whether the sums which he had received had been paid from the funds allocated to ORG or from a special fund of ORG . The appellate court further instructed ORG to establish whether or not ORG had authorised the head of ORG to settle the applicant \u2019s claims . The decision stated that witnesses should be heard with a view to establishing the above facts . The case was sent back to ORG for a new adjudication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the representative of the defendant failed to appear before ORG on DATE . The applicant did not appear at subsequent hearings scheduled for DATE and CARDINAL DATE . He excused his absence on the last mentioned date . In his letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant explained that he could not attend the hearing for personal reasons and that he had not been allowed to become properly acquainted with the case file . The applicant further requested that witnesses and representatives of the defendant should not be heard in his absence .", "CARDINAL . Another hearing was scheduled for DATE . ORG proceeded with the case in the applicant \u2019s absence as , according to the Government , the summons had been served on the applicant \u2019s daughter and the applicant had not excused himself . The applicant contends that he was not summoned . On DATE the ORG heard CARDINAL officials of ORG who confirmed that the applicant had not been employed by that authority and that he had not received any pay from the budget of ORG . The compensation for pay the applicant received between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , that is , until his dismissal became effective , were paid from a special fund of ORG . The witnesses further explained that the notice which ORG had sent to the applicant related to his contract of employment with ORG which , in the meantime , had ceased to exist . ORG had sent it in accordance with the relevant instructions issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the case as the applicant had excused himself in advance that he was ill .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was scheduled for DATE . The applicant received the summons on DATE . According to the applicant , he submitted , at TIME on DATE , a letter to ORG registry informing the court that he would not attend the hearing scheduled for TIME on DATE . In the letter the applicant explained that , DATE , he had not been allowed to consult the case file and that , therefore , he did not consider it necessary to excuse himself for his absence . The Government maintain that the letter was delivered to the court \u2019s registry at TIME This is contested by the applicant who alleges that the time of receipt of the letter was added to it later and that his copy of the letter , stamped by the court \u2019s registry , bears no indication of TIME when it was submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG proceeded with the case in the applicant \u2019s absence . It delivered a judgment by which it dismissed the action . In the judgment ORG found that ORG was not a legal successor to the applicant \u2019s former employer and that the applicant had no right to be employed by ORG . The court held that , by sending a notice to the applicant , ORG had acted in accordance with the relevant regulations of ORG and of ORG . Under these regulations , the district offices were charged with settling issues concerning labour relations which remained unresolved after the working groups established with a view to liquidating the national committees had ceased to exist by CARDINAL DATE . The court concluded that ORG had acted in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He alleged that ORG had had no power to send him a notice , and that it should have offered him a job after his dismissal by the previous employer had been declared unlawful . He alleged , with reference to the relevant pay slips , that he had been paid from the same account as the other employees of ORG after his first dismissal had been declared unlawful on DATE . The applicant considered irrelevant that ORG had put at ORG disposal a sum of money for the purpose of settling any outstanding issues relating to the existence of the former national committees as , in his view , that sum of money had been used for different purposes . In his appeal the applicant stated that he had been a supervisor and that he had an excellent knowledge of the relevant issues . The veracity of his allegations could be proved by an expert .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to the appellate court that ORG had not considered his arguments , that it had not established the relevant facts and that it had decided in his absence . Finally , the applicant stated that the appellate court should proceed with the case in his presence , that he had the intention to make further oral submissions to the court and that he wished to put questions to witnesses and to the representatives of the defendant with a view to having the relevant facts clarified .", "CARDINAL . Hearings before ORG scheduled for DATE and DATE were adjourned as the parties did not appear . The applicant excused his absence on both occasions . Prior to the latter hearing the applicant informed the court that he had encountered various difficulties including health problems and requested that the case be decided in his presence .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was scheduled for DATE . ORG invited the applicant to submit a medical certificate should he not be able to attend , failing which the case would be decided in his absence . On DATE the applicant sent a registered letter in an envelope addressed to the \u201c ORG \u201d in PERSON . In the letter the applicant informed ORG that he was ill and enclosed a medical certificate . The applicant further asked the court not to proceed with the case in his absence . The letter indicated the case number , the name of the presiding judge and also the date of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The letter was stamped by the registry of ORG . The stamp indicates that the letter was delivered on DATE . The letter bears a hand - written remark by the president of ORG dated DATE and indicating that it should be transmitted to the presiding judge . The letter bears another hand - written remark by the presiding judge indicating that the chamber by which the case fell to be examined had received it on DATE at TIME", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that the letter was considered to be a complaint and that the envelope was submitted , unopened , to the secretariat of the president of ORG on DATE . The president of ORG mistakenly dated his above instruction DATE . According to the ORG , the applicant \u2019s letter reached the presiding judge TIME after the delivery of the judgment on the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the case in the applicant \u2019s absence and upheld the first instance judgment . It stated that the applicant \u2019s letter posted on DATE had reached the judges on DATE at TIME , that is after the hearing was over . The judgment further stated that the letter had been addressed to the president of ORG and not directly to the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG pointed out that it had taken further evidence , in that it had requested ORG to submit a report concerning the delegation of its powers to ORG . It concluded , with reference to all the evidence before it , that the applicant \u2019s appeal was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s dismissal by ORG had been declared unlawful by a decision which became final on DATE . By that time the national committees had ceased to exist ex lege , and their liquidation had formally ended . In accordance with the relevant instructions issued by ORG and ORG , the newly established district offices were ordered to settle any labour issues relating to the former national committees which could not be resolved by DATE . ORG therefore upheld the view of the first instance court according to which ORG had acted in accordance with LAW . ORG had also regard to the supplementary evidence which ORG had taken on DATE and which indicated that the money which had been paid to the applicant had been derived from the budget of ORG . ORG concluded that the applicant had not become an employee of ORG . Accordingly , the notice in question was in conformity with LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He complained , inter alia , that he had not been able to act before the appellate court and invoked Article CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) rejected the appeal on points of law as being inadmissible without hearing the parties . In its decision ORG found that there had been no shortcomings within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW in the proceedings challenged by the applicant . ORG did not address the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) provides that a person may be dismissed from a job when the organisation employing him or her ceases to exist or when a part of that organisation is to be incorporated into another organisation and the latter has no possibility of offering the person concerned a job in accordance with his or her contract of employment .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Section CARDINAL , in cases when an organisation is being liquidated , the liquidator or the ORG has to satisfy the claims of the employees of such an organisation .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that the parties are obliged to assist the court in achieving the purpose of the proceedings , by inter alia , complying with the court \u2019s instructions . LAW CARDINAL entitles the court to proceed with a case even when the parties remain inactive . When a party to the proceedings fails to appear at a hearing despite the fact that he or she has been duly summoned and when such a party has not requested that the hearing be adjourned for a serious reason , the court may proceed with the case in the absence of that party . It shall thereby have regard to the contents of the file and the evidence which has been already taken .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW ( f ) , an appeal on points of law is available when a party has been prevented , by the appellate court \u2019s conduct , from acting before the court .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG case - law ( Collection of the Judicial Decisions and Opinions of ORG , No . R CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a party \u2019s illness which has been duly certified by a doctor represents a serious reason within the meaning of LAW . When a party to the proceedings has asked in time that the proceedings be adjourned in such a case , the court \u2019s proceeding with the case in that party \u2019s absence is considered as preventing him or her from acting before the court within the meaning of LAW ( f ) of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
