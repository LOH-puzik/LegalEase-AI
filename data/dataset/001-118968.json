NORP The applicant , Mr D.T. , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON J.F.M. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , and their Deputy Agent , PERSON , both of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the father of NORP , a girl born in DATE . The applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother have since split up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when NORP was DATE , her mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her daughter had been sexually abused by the applicant . She alleged that on DATE , upon her return from having spent DATE with her father , PERSON had told her that the applicant had performed sexual acts with her during DATE . The mother was invited to report the crime at another time to specialised police investigators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother reported the alleged sexual abuse of NORP to CARDINAL investigators specialised in the investigation of alleged sexual offences . The statement was recorded on tape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP was interviewed by a specialised police sergeant in a child - friendly studio during which she told about the sexual , non - penetrating , abuse . The interview was recorded on videotape , TIME were drawn up containing a summary of the interview , and a verbatim record was also produced .", "CARDINAL . R. \u2019s grandmother was interviewed by police on DATE . She confirmed that NORP had told her mother about the sexual abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned by police as a suspect . He denied the sexual abuse , but did confirm that on TIME DATE NORP had lain next to him in his bed . Subsequently the applicant was taken into police custody .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was brought before the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) on DATE . The investigating judge ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand on DATE , but suspended this detention immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge appointed C. , a professor of law and psychology , in order for him to assess the abovementioned studio interview of NORP On DATE C. issued a report . He had found nothing wrong in the way the studio interview had been conducted , but did note a number of peculiarities in NORP \u2019s statement . He further wrote that there was no suitable experience - based method to establish the truthfulness of witness statements , and added that the method of ORG ( \u201c CBCA \u201d ) used by some psychologists was not fit for this purpose . He advised not to bring the case before a court yet but first to have a developmental - psychological investigation carried out by a child psychologist into the possible causes of NORP \u2019s sexualised behaviour . On DATE the investigating judge appointed child psychologist PERSON and child psychiatrist PERSON in order for them to report on the reliability of the statements made by NORP during the studio interview . Their examination concluded that it was highly unlikely that NORP \u2019s statements had been made up or that words had been put into her mouth .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge subsequently asked the experts PERSON and PERSON whether they agreed with C. that a developmental - psychological investigation into the reasons for NORP \u2019s sexualised behaviour ought to take place . PERSON replied that the conclusions reached by her in her original report were not so much based on a CBCA analysis but on a wider developmental - psychological investigation as indicated by C.", "CARDINAL . The applicant was charged with having sexually abused NORP during the period of CARDINAL until DATE . Following a hearing held on DATE , the \u2018 s - ORG ( rechtbank ) convicted the applicant on DATE of an attempt to perform acts with a child under the age of CARDINAL , consisting of the sexual penetration of that child \u2019s body , and of having sexually abused his minor child several times . He was sentenced to a partially suspended prison term of DATE . After these proceedings , the applicant changed counsel .", "CARDINAL . At no point during the proceedings at first instance did the applicant request the hearing of NORP as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with the \u2018 sHertogenbosch ORG ( gerechtshof ) . On DATE counsel for the applicant requested that several witnesses , including NORP , be heard . By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) at ORG informed counsel of his decision not to summon NORP as a witness . He considered that the interest of the protection of NORP \u2019s private life should prevail over the applicant \u2019s interest in having her examined as a witness . The applicant nevertheless maintained his request for the hearing of NORP", "CARDINAL . At his request , counsel for the applicant was provided with a copy of the videotape of the studio interview of NORP and he requested PERSON , a professor of psychology , to give his opinion on the reliability of NORP \u2019s statements . In his report of CARDINAL DATE PERSON concluded that the recommendations of DATE with which PERSON concurred \u2013 had not been followed up , and that this failure impeded a proper assessment of the reliability of NORP \u2019s statements . Although it was true that the experts PERSON and PERSON had not based their reply to the question concerning the reliability of NORP \u2019s statements exclusively on a strict CBCA analysis , it could nevertheless not be said that a wider investigation into the possible reasons for NORP \u2019s sexualised behaviour had been conducted .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing before ORG was held on DATE . Counsel for the applicant once more requested that NORP be heard as a witness , preferably at a hearing in the presence of the applicant , but alternatively at a hearing where the applicant was not present , or by the investigating judge . This request was rejected by ORG , which noted that NORP , who was now DATE , had been subjected to an extensive studio interview when she was DATE . It found that NORP \u2019s interest in not being compelled to relive possible traumatic experiences outweighed the interest of the defence in questioning NORP or having NORP questioned . It took into account that the defence had had the opportunity to view the videotape of the studio interview and that CARDINAL experts had examined the interview and had reported on it . ORG considered that this constituted sufficient compensation for the lack of the opportunity for the defence to question NORP on appeal . The hearing was adjourned in order for a number of other witnesses and experts to be summoned .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE counsel for the applicant repeated the request for NORP to be called as a witness .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the second hearing , which took place on DATE , PERSON \u2019s mother and grandmother were heard , PERSON and PERSON were heard as expert witnesses , and part of the videotape of the studio interview with NORP was played back . Counsel for the applicant requested that a developmental - psychological examination of NORP as advised by the experts C. and PERSON be carried out , and he repeated the request for NORP to be heard , if need be by means of a studio interview in the course of which the defence would have the opportunity to put questions to her , or to have questions put to her . ORG adjourned the hearing in order to consider counsel \u2019s requests .", "CARDINAL . At the third hearing , held on DATE , ORG considered that a decision on counsel \u2019s requests first required an examination of the question whether the hearing or a developmental - psychological examination of NORP would be harmful to her health and well - being . It therefore appointed an expert . On DATE this expert , PERSON , submitted a report in which she concluded that it might be possible for NORP to be interviewed again , and especially if the treatment and/or therapy she was apparently receiving was related to the alleged sexual abuse , unless a new interview was considered prejudicial to the therapeutic process . It was for the therapist treating NORP to assess whether a second interview would be harmful to NORP \u2019s health and well - being . However , on the point of the usefulness of a second interview , PERSON considered that after DATE it would be extremely difficult , and perhaps even impossible , to determine which parts of NORP \u2019s new statement would be based on accurate recollections and which would be coloured by the different conversations NORP had had about the alleged abuse . In these circumstances , PERSON advised against NORP undergoing a second interview . As to the question whether a developmental - psychological examination would be harmful to NORP \u2019s health and well - being , L .- W. also referred to the therapist treating NORP", "CARDINAL . A fourth hearing was held before ORG on DATE in the course of which ORG requested ORG to contact the therapists treating NORP in order to be informed whether NORP undergoing a new interview or a developmental - psychological examination would be harmful to her health and well - being . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the CARDINAL therapists treating NORP informed the Advocate General that in their opinion a second studio interview would not be desirable in view of the developmental process NORP was currently going through . Such an interview would put her in a position of once more having to identify her father as perpetrator of sexual abuse entailing the possible consequence of him being prosecuted . This would place too much pressure on NORP and be harmful for her healing process . A second interview would disturb NORP \u2019s balance whereas peace and quiet and the building up of trust and stability in the family situation were of more importance for NORP \u2019s further general development . The therapists further informed the Advocate General that for the purpose of NORP \u2019s treatment a psychological examination was being conducted . They proposed that , if the mother agreed , the results of that examination could be submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the fifth hearing , held on DATE , ORG refused the request of the defence to hear NORP as a witness , considering that \u2013 in view of the letter of DATE from the therapists treating NORP \u2013 there were serious reasons to presume that hearing her once more would be harmful to her health and well - being and that the prevention of that harm outweighed the importance of a new interview . ORG did accede to counsel \u2019s request for a developmental - psychological examination of NORP to be carried out . This examination was to focus on the questions whether the sexualised behaviour displayed and comments made by NORP prior to the weekend of CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE were age - inappropriate and/or excessive , and whether indications of sexual abuse of NORP having been committed by someone other than NORP \u2019s father could be deduced from NORP \u2019s sexualised behaviour and comments and/or from the environment in which she was growing up and/or from her development until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the sixth hearing , on DATE , ORG appointed CARDINAL psychologists and a psychiatrist to carry out the developmental - psychological examination . They issued a report on DATE . This report has not been submitted to the ORG but it appears from other documents in the case file that it concluded that NORP was not suffering from psychiatric problems and did not appear traumatised in her psycho - sexual development . Due to the passage of time and subsequent events it had not been possible to reply to ORG questions relating to R. \u2019s behaviour and experiences prior to DATE of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the final hearing before ORG on DATE , counsel for the applicant repeated the request to call NORP as a witness , given that in view of the conclusions reached in the developmental - psychological examination it did not appear that a new interview would be harmful to NORP \u2019s health and well - being . Counsel further argued that not hearing NORP constituted a breach of LAW ( d ) of the LAW in that the defence had not been afforded the opportunity to put questions to NORP whereas a conviction of the applicant would solely or to a decisive degree be based on NORP \u2019s statement . Moreover , insufficient counterbalancing measures had been taken , having regard to the fact that the expert C. had advised back in DATE to conduct a developmental - psychological examination whereas such an examination had not been carried out until DATE , by which time it was no longer possible for certain questions to be answered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It maintained its decision as regards the hearing of NORP , considering that the fact that NORP was apparently not suffering from psychiatric problems and did not appear traumatised in her psycho - sexual development did not alter the conclusions reached by the therapists treating her who had advised against a second interview . It further considered that , on the whole , sufficient compensation had been provided for the fact that NORP had not been heard again and that the defence had not been given the opportunity of putting questions to her . This compensation consisted in particular of the studio interview conducted with NORP by a specialised police sergeant \u2013 which interview had been found to be of good quality by the experts L , PERSON , C. and PERSON and the video - tape of which had been put at the disposal of the defence as well as the experts and had been partially played back in court DATE ; the reports drawn up by the experts C. , L. and PERSON , PERSON and the CARDINAL therapists treating NORP ; and the appearance at hearings before ORG of the experts L , PERSON and PERSON According to ORG , the present case could be distinguished from those of P.S v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) and PERSON v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , because in those cases the interviews with witnesses whom the defence was not able to question had not been videotaped . Conversely , it appeared from ORG v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , in particular LAW , ORG PERSON ) that the existence and the viewing of a videotape of the interview of a minor might constitute important compensation enabling the defence to challenge the statements and the credibility of the witness . The developmental - psychological examination only having taken place in DATE and , as a result , the obtaining of ( uncoloured ) information having been rendered more difficult , did not detract from the fact that this examination had provided insight into NORP \u2019s development and thus information relevant for the assessment of the studio interview . ORG also took into account that the defence had only requested that NORP be heard again as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to NORP \u2019s statement , ORG considered that it was sufficiently clear from NORP \u2019s mother \u2019s and grandmother \u2019s statements that NORP had not been pressured to denounce her father ; that she had told her mother about the events on DATE they took place ; and that it was unlikely that NORP had been mistaken about the events and the person in issue so few hours after they had taken place . It further considered that , even though an assessment of the statement based on the method of ORG could not give a decisive answer about the reliability of NORP \u2019s statement , it was , at least , likely that the statement had not been a deliberate lie ( bewust gelogen ) . In this regard , the court also attached weight to the clinical assessment by the experts PERSON and PERSON that it was highly unlikely that NORP \u2019s statements had been made up or that words had been put into her mouth . Consequently , and having itself viewed the videotape , ORG found PERSON \u2019s statement to be reliable .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of ORG , convicted the applicant of an attempt to perform acts with a child under DATE twelve , consisting of the sexual penetration of that child \u2019s body , and of sexual abuse of his minor child , and sentenced him to a partially suspended term of imprisonment of DATE . It based this conviction on NORP \u2019s statement made during the studio interview , the statement of the applicant that during DATE in question he had been alone with NORP and had lain next to her in bed , and the statement of NORP \u2019s mother and grandmother about what NORP had told them after DATE and the way in which NORP had told it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) alleging a breach of LAW in that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to NORP He also complained that his conviction had wrongly been based on the statement of NORP , while sufficient supporting evidence was lacking .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal on points of law . As regards the complaint that the applicant \u2019s request to examine NORP as a witness had been refused , ORG noted that pursuant to article FAC \u00a7 CARDINAL sub ( b ) of MONEY Procedure ( PERSON ) , a court may decide not to proceed to the hearing of a witness if there are serious reasons for presuming that the making of a statement at a hearing of the court would be harmful to the health and well - being of the witness and if the prevention of that harm outweighed the importance of the possibility to have the witness examined at the hearing . ORG continued as follows :", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . ORG has not negated the above ... In its considerations about the evidence it has set out the reasons why it found that compensation enabling an effective defence was provided for the inability to examine the victim as a witness . Seen also against the background of that finding ... the rejection of the request [ to examine the victim as a witness ] has been sufficiently reasoned .", "CARDINAL . ORG has based that rejection on its opinion that there were serious reasons for assuming that another interview could be harmful to the health and well - being of the victim . In reaching that opinion ORG based itself on the views of the experts treating the victim . ORG further considered that the contents of the subsequent report of the [ developmental - psychological examination ] did not lead to a different conclusion , but that , on the contrary , it supported the views of the abovementioned experts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the complaint about the use of R. \u2019s statement in evidence , considering that that complaint overlooked the finding of ORG \u2013 which finding had not been disputed in the appeal on points of law and had been confirmed by ORG \u2013 that sufficient compensation had been provided for the lack of opportunity to examine the witness .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG found ex proprio motu that the proceedings before it had exceeded the reasonable time requirement and for that reason it quashed the judgment of ORG in so far as the imposed sentence was concerned . It sentenced the applicant to a partially suspended prison term of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
