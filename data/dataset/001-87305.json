The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . J. was the youngest son of a renowned banking family in GPE am Main . He got to know the applicant , a law student , as an acquaintance of his sister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lured PERSON , aged eleven , into his flat in GPE am GPE by pretending that the child \u2019s sister had left a jacket there . He then suffocated J.", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant deposited a letter at ORG GPE place of residence , stating that J. had been kidnapped by several persons . Only if the kidnappers received MONEY and managed to leave the country would the child \u2019s parents see their son again . The applicant then drove to a pond at a private property near GPE , TIME drive from GPE , and hid J. \u2019s corpse under a jetty at the pond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME the applicant picked up the ransom at a tram station . From then on he was secretly observed by the police . He paid part of the ransom into his accounts and hid the remainder of the money in his flat . TIME , the police arrested him at GPE am GPE airport .", "CARDINAL . After having seen a doctor at the airport \u2019s hospital on account of circulation trouble and skin lesions , the applicant was taken to the GPE am ORG . He was informed by detective officer PERSON that he was suspected of having kidnapped PERSON and was instructed about his rights as a defendant , notably the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer . He was then questioned by PERSON with a view to finding J. In reply , he suggested that the child was being held by another kidnapper . He was allowed to consult a lawyer , PERSON , for TIME at his request . He subsequently stated that GPE and GPE had kidnapped the boy and had hidden him in a hut by a lake . PERSON and the applicant thereupon agreed to resume the questioning the following morning .", "CARDINAL . Early in the morning of DATE , before PERSON came to work , detective officer PERSON , acting on the orders of the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , told the applicant that he would suffer considerable pain at the hands of a person specially trained for such purposes if he did not disclose the child \u2019s whereabouts . According to the applicant , the officer further threatened to lock him into a cell with CARDINAL huge black people who would sexually abuse him . The officer also hit him once on the chest with his hand and shook him so that his head hit the wall on CARDINAL occasion . The Government disputed that the applicant had been threatened with sexual abuse .", "CARDINAL . For fear of being exposed to the measures he was threatened with , the applicant disclosed the precise whereabouts of the child after TIME of questioning .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had declared that he would only agree to go to the place where he had hidden J. in the presence of detective officer PERSON , he was then driven with PERSON and numerous other police officers to PERSON , without detective officer PERSON being present any longer . The police found PERSON \u2019s corpse under the jetty at the pond near PERSON as indicated by the applicant . They recorded the discovery of the corpse on videotape .", "CARDINAL . The police detected tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car at the pond near PERSON . When questioned by detective officer PERSON on the way back from PERSON to the police station the applicant confessed to having kidnapped and killed PERSON The police further secured ORG school exercise books , a backpack , clothes worn by PERSON when he was kidnapped and the typewriter used for the blackmail letter in containers indicated by the applicant on the way back to GPE am GPE . They further found almost all the ransom money and a note concerning the planning of the crime in the applicant \u2019s flat . According to the autopsy carried out on PERSON \u2019s corpse on DATE , the boy had died of suffocation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant consulted his lawyer En . , who had been instructed by his mother and had tried in vain to contact and advise the applicant in TIME at the police station , on DATE on his return from PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a note for the police file dated DATE , the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , stated that that morning J. \u2019s life had been in great danger , if he was still alive at all , given his lack of food and the temperature outside . In order to save the child \u2019s life , he had therefore ordered the applicant to be questioned by police officer PERSON under the threat of pain which would not cause any injuries . The treatment itself was to be carried out under medical supervision . NORP further stated that he had ordered another police officer to obtain a \u201c truth serum \u201d to be administered to the applicant . According to the note , the applicant \u2019s questioning was exclusively aimed at saving the child \u2019s life rather than furthering the criminal proceedings concerning the kidnapping . As the applicant had already made a confession after having been threatened with pain by detective officer PERSON , no measures had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained his confession when questioned by the police on DATE , by a public prosecutor on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , and by a district court judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE of the hearing , the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an application for the proceedings to be discontinued . He claimed that he had been threatened by detective officer PERSON on instructions from the deputy chief of the GPE am GPE police , NORP , with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse . He argued that his treatment had been in breach of Article CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article CARDINAL of the Convention and warranted the discontinuation of the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further lodged an application for a declaration that owing to the continuous effect ( GPE ) of the threat of violence against him on DATE , all further statements which he had made to the investigation authorities until the beginning of the hearing could not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings . Moreover , the applicant sought a declaration that on account of the violation of LAW , the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements extracted from the applicant \u2013 the so - called \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d \u2013 was prohibited ( \u201c LOC ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for the criminal proceedings against him to be discontinued . It found that the applicant had been threatened with considerable pain if he refused to disclose the victim \u2019s whereabouts . However , the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced . The mere threat to cause the applicant pain had been illegal pursuant to LAW , and also pursuant to LAW , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and LAW , which underlay that provision .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , this breach of constitutional rights did not bar criminal proceedings as such . In accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , statements obtained through the use of prohibited methods of interrogation could not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings against the defendant . Likewise , the use of the investigation methods in question had not restricted the rights of the defence to such an extent that the criminal proceedings could no longer be conducted . Having regard to the seriousness of the charges against the applicant on the one hand , and to the severity of the unlawful conduct in the investigation proceedings on the other hand , there had not been such an exceptional and intolerable violation of the rule of law in the investigation proceedings as to bar the continuation of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a separate decision also delivered on DATE the GPE am ORG , granting the applicant \u2019s application to that effect , decided that in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW , all confessions and statements hitherto made by the applicant before the police , a public prosecutor and a district court judge could not be used as evidence in the criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . The court found that on DATE detective officer PERSON had used prohibited methods of interrogation within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW by threatening that the applicant would suffer pain if he did not disclose the child \u2019s whereabouts . Therefore , it was prohibited to use as evidence statements which the applicant had made as a consequence of the use of this forbidden investigative measure . This exclusion of evidence ( Beweisverwertungsverbot ) did not only comprise the statements made immediately after the threat on DATE . Owing to the continuous effect ( GPE ) of the violation of LAW , all further statements which the applicant had made to the investigation authorities since that date could not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The procedural irregularity caused by the use of a prohibited method of investigation could only have been remedied if the applicant had been informed before his subsequent questioning that the earlier statements he had made as a consequence of the use of forbidden investigation methods could not be used as evidence against him . However , the applicant had merely been instructed about his right as an accused not to testify , without having additionally been informed about the exclusion of the evidence that had been improperly obtained . He had therefore not been given the necessary \u201c qualified instruction \u201d ( qualifizierte GPE ) in the course of any of his hearings until then .", "CARDINAL . On the contrary , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for a declaration that on account of the violation of LAW , the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities as a result of the statements extracted from the applicant \u2013 the so - called \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d \u2013 was prohibited ( \u201c LOC ) . That court found :", "\u201c On the contrary , there is no long - range effect of the breach of LAW meaning that the items of evidence which have become known as a result of the statement may likewise not be used [ as evidence ] . The ORG agrees in this respect with the conciliatory view ( GPE ) taken by scholars and in court rulings ... \u2019s fundamental rights \u2013 in the present case the threat of physical violence \u2013 and the seriousness of the offence he was charged with and which had to be investigated \u2013 the completed murder of a child \u2013 makes the exclusion of evidence which has become known as a result of the defendant \u2019s statement \u2013 in particular the discovery of the dead child and the results of the autopsy \u2013 appear disproportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his statement on the charges , made on DATE of the trial , the applicant admitted having killed J. , but stated that he had not initially planned to do so . On the contrary , in his final statement at the close of the trial , after evidence had been taken DATE and DATE , he admitted that he had also planned from the outset to kill the child and had acted with that intent . He then described his confession as \u201c the only way to accept his deep guilt \u201d and as the \u201c greatest possible apology for the murder of the child \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant , inter alia , of murder and kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim . It sentenced him to life imprisonment and declared that his guilt was of particular gravity ( besondere PERSON der PERSON ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found that at the hearing the applicant had been instructed anew about his right as a defendant to remain silent and about the fact that all his earlier statements could not be used as evidence against him , and had thereby been given the necessary qualified instruction . The applicant had nevertheless again confessed that he had kidnapped and killed PERSON His statements at the trial concerning the planning of his offence formed the essential , if not the only , basis for the court \u2019s findings of fact . They were supported by the testimony of ORG sister , the blackmail letter and the note concerning the planning of the crime found in the applicant \u2019s flat . The findings of fact concerning the execution of the crime were exclusively based on the applicant \u2019s confession at the trial . Further items of evidence showed that he had also told the truth in this respect . These included the findings of the autopsy as to the cause of the child \u2019s death , the tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car near the pond where the child \u2019s corpse had been found , and the discovery of money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the gravity of the applicant \u2019s guilt , the court observed that he had killed his DATE victim in order to be able to live in luxury with his wealthy friends and his girlfriend and to preserve his self - created image of a rich and successful young lawyer . It found that , contrary to the views expressed by ORG and the private accessory prosecutors , the fact that the applicant had volunteered a full confession at the trial , even though all his earlier confessions could not be used as evidence pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , was a mitigating factor . However , even without his confession , the applicant would have been found guilty of kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim . The applicant had been kept under police surveillance after he had collected the ransom , which had later been found in his flat or paid into his accounts . Furthermore , it was proved by the autopsy on ORG \u2019s corpse that the boy had been suffocated , and tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car had been detected at the place where ORG body had been found .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that in questioning the applicant , methods of interrogation prohibited under LAW had been employed inasmuch as the applicant had been threatened with pain in order to make him disclose the child \u2019s whereabouts . Whether and to what extent detective officer PERSON and the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , were guilty of an offence because of these threats had to be determined in the pending criminal investigations against them . However , their possibly illegal acts did not mitigate the applicant \u2019s own guilt . The misconduct of police officers , belonging to the executive power , could not prevent the judiciary from assessing findings of fact in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG , submitting his grounds of appeal on DATE in particular . He complained that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had refused to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him . He argued that on DATE , he had lodged an application for the proceedings to be discontinued . At the same time , he had applied for a declaration that owing to the continuous effect ( GPE ) of the threat of violence on DATE , all further statements which he had made to the investigation authorities could not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings . He had also requested the court to declare that since the confession had been obtained from him by threats , the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements extracted from him was prohibited ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) . The applicant included a full copy of these applications of DATE , including the grounds given for them , in his submissions giving reasons for his appeal on points of law . He further included a copy of ORG decision of DATE dismissing his application for the proceedings to be discontinued and argued in respect of the police \u2019s threats against him that , developing the case - law of ORG , such conduct \u201c leapt beyond \u201d the exclusion of evidence and led to an impediment to the proceedings ( \u201c dass ein derartiges PERSON \u2018 GPE PERSON begr\u00fcndet \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In his observations dated DATE ORG argued that the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law should be dismissed as manifestly ill - founded . He argued that the use of prohibited methods of interrogation , such as a threat of torture , did not lead to an impediment to the criminal proceedings . LAW expressly provided that the use of any of the prohibited methods enumerated entailed only the exclusion of evidence . The applicant had not complained of a breach of LAW of LAW . In any event , there would be no grounds for such a complaint as ORG had only used the applicant \u2019s full confession at the trial , which he had made after having been informed that his previous statements had not been admitted as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . PERSON the facts underlying the case and the content of the impugned decisions , he complained under LAW and LAW , second sentence , of LAW about the way in which he had been questioned by the police on TIME . He argued that he had been threatened with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse if he did not disclose the child\u2019e within the meaning of LAW and infringed LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . It also violated his absolute right to human dignity under LAW , which lay at the heart of the provisions in question . Because of these unjustifiable human - rights violations , there was both a bar to the criminal proceedings against him and a prohibition on using the items of evidence obtained as a consequence of the confession extracted from him in the course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination as it was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , in so far as the applicant complained of the failure of the criminal courts to discontinue the proceedings against him , the court found that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint . It observed that ORG had already stated that the police \u2019s threat to inflict pain on the applicant had violated LAW . Because of this threat , the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and LAW , second sentence , of LAW had been disregarded in the investigation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . However , the violation of fundamental rights outside the trial did not necessarily warrant the conclusion that the judgment delivered by a criminal court , which was based on the findings made during the trial , breached constitutional law . In the present case , the criminal courts had found that the methods of investigation used by the police had been prohibited , but had differed from the applicant as to the legal conclusions to be drawn from that finding . They had taken the view that the use as evidence of the statements obtained as a result of the measures in question had been prohibited but that there had been no bar to the criminal proceedings altogether .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , there would not have been a violation of fundamental rights if the procedural flaw of having applied prohibited methods of investigation could be regarded as having been remedied by the criminal courts , because they had prohibited the use as evidence of the statements obtained thereby . Such a prohibition was prescribed by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in order to compensate for a prior infringement of the rights of the person concerned . On the contrary , the circumstances in which substantial procedural irregularities might entail a bar to criminal proceedings were not laid down in law . In these circumstances , the applicant had failed to explain why the contested methods of investigation had not only entailed a prohibition on using the statements obtained thereby as evidence , but had led to a bar to criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , ORG found that , in so far as the applicant complained that ORG had refused to exclude the use in the proceedings of all items of evidence obtained as a result of the confession extorted from him by threats ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) , his constitutional complaint was likewise inadmissible . The applicant had failed to raise this issue in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted detective officer PERSON of coercion committed by an official in the course of his duties . It cautioned the defendant and imposed a suspended fine amounting to CARDINAL DATE payments of MONEY ( ORG ) , which the defendant would be required to pay if he committed another offence during the probation period . Furthermore , the court convicted the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , of having incited PERSON , a subordinate , to commit coercion in the course of his duties . It also cautioned NORP and imposed on him a suspended fine amounting to CARDINAL DATE payments of ORG CARDINAL . The applicant had given evidence as a witness in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that on TIME DATE NORP had ordered that the applicant was to be questioned while being subjected to pain in the manner set out in his subsequent note for the police file . By doing so , he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into ORG kidnapping . The heads of department had disapproved of the measure he had ordered and had proposed an approach entailing further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with third persons instead . NORP had personally ordered detective officer PERSON to threaten the applicant with physical violence , which was to be carried out by another specially trained police officer . The measure had been aimed at finding out immediately where the applicant had hidden PERSON , whose life he had considered to be at great risk . In order to save PERSON \u2019s life , PERSON had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by NORP", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the method of investigation had not been justified as an act of necessity , because it violated human dignity as codified in LAW . Respect for human dignity also lay at the heart of LAW , second sentence , of LAW . The protection of human dignity was absolute . Allowing exceptions or a balancing of interests would breach a taboo .", "CARDINAL . In determining the sentences , ORG notably took into consideration that the GPE sole concern had been to save PERSON \u2019s life and that they had been under extreme pressure because of their respective responsibilities vis - \u00e0 - vis the superior authority and the public . They had been completely exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation . Moreover , NORP had openly taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on DATE . The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention . Both defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career : NORP had been transferred to ORG of the Interior , and PERSON had been prohibited from carrying out measures relevant to the prosecution of criminal offences . Furthermore , it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the GPE case had been assessed by a NORP criminal court .", "CARDINAL . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . D. was subsequently transferred to ORG and was appointed its chief .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant applied to the GPE am ORG for legal aid with a view to bringing official liability proceedings against ORG for the payment of compensation . He claimed that he had been traumatised by the methods of police investigation applied against him , inter alia the threat of being subjected to pain if he did not disclose ORG whereabouts , further threats of sexual abuse and slaps , and was in need of psychological treatment .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions dated DATE the GPE am ORG contested that PERSON \u2019s conduct when questioning the applicant in TIME of DATE was to be legally qualified as coercion and amounted to a breach of official duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the refusal to grant him legal aid . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it confirmed in particular that the police officers NORP and PERSON , when threatening the applicant , had infringed human dignity , which was inviolable , and had thus breached their official duties . However , the applicant would not be able to prove that the threats of torture uttered against him had caused mental damage necessitating psychological treatment . It was obvious that the ORG threat for a short period of time was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact that he had killed a child . Moreover , even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that police officer PERSON had shaken him , as a result of which his head had hit a wall on CARDINAL occasion , and had once hit him on the chest , allegedly causing a haematoma near his collarbone , the physical damage caused thereby would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The violation of the applicant \u2019s human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation either as the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers responsible for the threats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing a constitutional complaint by the applicant , quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to that court . It found that in refusing to grant the applicant legal aid , ORG had violated the principle of equal access to court . In particular , that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage and had thus refused to take the necessary evidence ( in the main proceedings ) . In addition to that , it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation could be considered to be of secondary importance in view of the threats uttered against him . Moreover , the question whether the violation of the applicant \u2019s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had obtained as a result of the criminal conviction of the police officers involved was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance , and which should therefore not be determined in legal - aid proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings are currently pending before the GPE am ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , on the protection of human dignity , reads as follows :", "\u201c Human dignity shall be inviolable . To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all ORG authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
