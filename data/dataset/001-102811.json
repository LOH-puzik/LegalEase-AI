The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been practising as a lawyer since DATE . In DATE the applicant applied for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL posts of advocate notary ( Anwaltsnotar ) officially advertised by FAC ( hereafter : \u201c ORG \u201d ) enabling qualified lawyers to practise simultaneously as a solicitor and as a notary in the GPE court circuit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it intended to appoint CARDINAL other lawyers as advocate notaries . The applicant 's subsequent request to compel ORG to review its decision was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG that he intended to lodge a constitutional complaint with and apply for interim legal protection to ORG . He requested ORG to await the outcome of the proceedings before ORG before appointing the advocate notaries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant it would no longer wait to make the appointments .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint and requested ORG to grant him interim legal protection , arguing that there was a danger that ORG would appoint the advocate notaries and thus create irreparable damage to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant interim legal protection and ordered ORG to keep CARDINAL post of advocate notary free until the statutory time - limit for the submission of the grounds for the applicant 's constitutional complaint had elapsed . On DATE ORG sent its decision by fax to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , on DATE ORG appointed CARDINAL notaries . On DATE it appointed the sixth notary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that it had received the court 's interim injunction on ORG DATE , but that this had been submitted to the competent head of division in the ORG only on DATE . However , it also announced that it would advertise a further post as advocate notary as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the reasons for his constitutional complaint to ORG , which extended its interim injunction on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL May CARDINAL , until such time as it had issued its final decision on the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found for the applicant . First , it held that the applicant 's constitutional complaint had not become inadmissible following the appointment of the CARDINAL notaries by ORG . In particular , the applicant had an interest in a declaration that the application procedure had been unconstitutional and in a fresh examination of his application or , if that was impossible , in being granted compensation . The right to an effective remedy under LAW of LAW Basic PERSON permitted the continuation of the proceedings before ORG , since ORG had failed to abide by its interim injunction .", "CARDINAL . On the merits , ORG found that the recruitment procedure as practised by ORG had violated the applicant 's freedom of profession as guaranteed by LAW and the principle of equal access to public office as provided for by LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , mainly because it had not taken sufficient account of the relevant professional experience of the candidates . ORG remitted the case to ORG for fresh consideration , as \u201c it was not excluded that [ the applicant ] , who had obtained better results in the second state exam and had more relevant professional experience than the candidate who , on account of his seniority , was appointed as sixth advocate notary in the recruitment procedure , could succeed in the initial proceedings if his application was reassessed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE and compelled it to reassess the application , taking into account the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision . It found that the applicant had lacked an interest in a decision compelling ORG to appoint him as an advocate notary or to reassess his application , as ORG had already allocated the CARDINAL notary posts to other applicants . Thus the principle of stability of office ( GPE der DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) prohibited the annulment of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL appointments . Furthermore , it was impossible to allocate the applicant the next available notary post or to create a new post for him as this would infringe the rights of other potential candidates and be in violation of section CARDINAL of LAW ( Bundesnotarordnung - see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The court held that its findings complied with ORG decision of DATE , which had not specified the manner in which the applicant should obtain redress . It was thus possible that the applicant could be granted redress in official liability proceedings rather than having his application re - examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint . It found that the applicant could not attain more with the second constitutional complaint than he had already obtained in its decision of DATE . In that decision ORG had not specified the manner in which the lower courts were to grant the applicant legal protection . It had referred to CARDINAL options , namely the reassessment of the applicant 's application by ORG or compensation for damage . It was thus still open to the applicant to request damages in official liability proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request to annul the appointment of the sixth advocate notary . It found that even if this appointment had been unlawful , it could not be annulled . In particular , the applicant had not submitted any reason allowing for the revocation of an appointment of a notary under the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal as the principle of stability of office did not allow for revoking the appointment of notaries . Equally , it was not possible to create a special post as an advocate notary for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's constitutional complaint inadmissible , as its decision of CARDINAL DATE had already given him the possibility to have the lawfulness of the recruitment procedure reviewed by the lower courts . He therefore lacked standing for this constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted official liability proceedings against the Land Baden - PERSON before ORG , on the ground that ORG had appointed the sixth advocate notary in spite of ORG interim injunction in his favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's action . It found that , irrespective of the possibility that ORG could have breached its official duty when disregarding ORG interim injunction , there had been no causal connection between the applicant 's damage and the alleged breach of duty . Had ORG complied with the interim injunction , it would have halted the recruitment procedure , refrained from appointing the advocate notaries and started a fresh recruitment procedure for the CARDINAL posts . During such a procedure it would have assessed the new applications in accordance with ORG decision of ORG CARDINAL DATE . However , it remained totally unclear whether the applicant could have succeeded in such a fresh procedure with a new field of candidates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed that decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested PERSON to submit a written statement on whether a fresh recruitment procedure would have led to the applicant being selected for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL notary posts . On DATE the Land submitted its written opinion , alleging that the applicant under no conceivable circumstances would have ranked among the CARDINAL top candidates . In DATE , the proceedings were still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . By e - mail dated DATE the presiding judge of ORG informed the applicant 's counsel that he was obliged to postpone the hearing originally scheduled for CARDINAL DATE to DATE . This was due to the fact that the senate had to hear other , more urgent cases , which had to be prepared by the same rapporteur judge . Even taking into account the length of the instant proceedings , the presiding judge considered the applicant 's case to be less urgent for the following reasons : If the applicant should obtain compensation , he would be awarded interests at a rate which exceeded the interest rates which could be obtained elsewhere . If he should lose his action , DATE would not matter .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that all NORP have the right to freely choose their profession , their place of work , and their place of training .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW every NORP is equally eligible for any public office according to his or her aptitude , qualifications and professional achievements .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that the law governing public service is to be regulated with due regard to the traditional principles of the professional civil service . CARDINAL of the latter is the principle of stability of office , according to which appointments to public office are not to be revoked or annulled following legal remedies instituted by unsuccessful candidates .", "CARDINAL . Some L\u00e4nder , like GPE , provide for the possibility for qualified lawyers to be appointed as so - called \u201c advocate notaries \u201d ( PERSON ) enabling them to exercise the profession as notary alongside their activity as solicitors . Advocate notaries ( like single profession notaries ) are \u201c independent holders of a public office \u201d who are appointed by the competent judicial authority . Once officially appointed , notaries do not receive a salary from the state , but charge fees ( fixed by law ) to the parties . As a rule , notaries do not enjoy the status of civil servants .", "CARDINAL . LAW lays down the access requirements , the rights and obligations of notaries and their organisation and functions . It is complemented by respective orders of the L\u00e4nder .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides that the number of appointments of notaries is to be restricted to what is necessary to ensure the sound administration of justice . In particular , the number of notaries must correspond to the need of individuals to be provided with notarial services , and a balanced age structure must be ensured in the profession of notary . In GPE the Ministry of Justice has responsibility for and discretion in deciding on this need ( PERSON ) and therefore in fixing the number of advocate notaries . In so doing it takes account of the average number of notarisations taking place within the areas of the various district courts . Once the Ministry of Justice has decided to create a new notary post , it publishes \u2013 in compliance with section CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW \u2013 a vacancy notice for ORG district ( PERSON ) in which such a need has been identified .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , disputes surrounding the appointment and selection of notaries are adjudicated by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) and in the second instance by ORG . Since DATE , the proceedings are governed by LAW ( Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung , see section CARDINALb of the Federal Notaries Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW , the ORG or a public body is liable to pay compensation to an individual for any damage arising from an intentional or negligent breach of official duties committed by its officials . No such obligation to afford redress arises where the injured party has wilfully or negligently omitted to avoid the damage by means of another legal remedy ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
