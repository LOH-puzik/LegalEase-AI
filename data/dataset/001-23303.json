{"ITEMID": "001-23303", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "LYONS AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON are GPE nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in GPE . The second and third applicants live in GPE . The applicants are represented before the ORG by PERSON , Solicitors , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "In its judgment ( Merits ) of DATE in the case of ORG , GMR and ORG v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and ORG ) , the ORG found that the respondent Government had breached the applicants\u2019 right to a fair hearing since a significant part of the prosecution case against them consisted of the transcripts of the interviews they gave to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) under statutory compulsion . These interviews were conducted during an investigation into the applicants\u2019 alleged dishonest conduct in the context of a share support operation in the course of a take - over bid in DATE . The statutory basis for requiring the applicants to reply to the Inspectors\u2019 questions was contained in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "The ORG noted in its judgment that the transcripts of the applicants\u2019 interviews were read out to the jury by the prosecution over a DATE period and were used in a manner intended to incriminate the applicants . The ORG concluded that , in the circumstances , there had been an infringement of the right not to incriminate oneself and thus a breach of LAW ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of the judgment and point CARDINAL of the operative provisions ) .", "The ORG rejected the ORG claim for pecuniary loss on the ground that it could not speculate as to the question whether the outcome of their trial would have been any different had use not been made of the transcripts ( \u00a7 CARDINAL and point CARDINAL of the operative provisions ) .", "On DATE an amendment was made to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE via the enactment of ORG and Criminal Evidence Act DATE . The amended provisions came into force pursuant to SI No . CARDINAL . As a result of that amendment , the prosecution can no longer use in evidence as part of its case or in cross - examination answers obtained under compulsory powers .", "Following the ORG \u2019s judgment the applicants succeeded in having their cases referred back to ORG by ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The PERSON reasoned its reference decision as follows :", "\u201c If [ the applicants\u2019 ] replies to the compulsory interviews had been excluded from evidence , the jury would have been presented with a substantially different case to consider . The use of those interviews by the ORG had been identified by ORG as having given rise to unfairness in the trial . The developments which have taken place since [ the applicants\u2019 ] previous appeal suggest to the Commission that there is a real possibility that the ORG might now regard the unfairness identified by the ORG as a shortcoming of such gravity that doubt is cast on the safety of the conviction . \u201d", "In the proceedings before ORG the applicants contended that retrospective effect should be given to LAW DATE ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) so as to allow them to base a challenge to the fairness of their trial on Convention grounds , notwithstanding that their trial took place DATE before its coming into force ( DATE ) . ORG considered that the ORG argument was excluded in the light of ORG decision in PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) . In that decision , which was later criticised but confirmed by ORG in the case of NORP v. GPE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) , ORG ruled that the ORG did not enable an applicant to rely , during the course of a hearing held after the date on which the LAW came into force , on a breach of a LAW right which had occurred during a trial that had concluded before that date .", "The applicants also contended that ORG was required to recognise and give effect to the judgment of DATE as a consequence of GPE obligations under LAW to abide by that judgment and to afford restitutio in integrum for the breach identified by ORG . In concrete terms , that meant conducting a reconsideration of the safety of the ORG conviction without reliance on the evidence which ORG found to have been admitted in breach of LAW . The applicants relied on , among other materials , Recommendation No . DATE of ORG on the re - examination or re - opening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of ORG .", "In giving the judgment of the ORG , the Vice - President , Lord Justice Rose , observed that during the course of argument , the court had indicated that :", "\u201c ... we concluded that the compelled answers should not have been admitted in evidence , or if we concluded that we were bound to give effect to ORG decision that the trial was unfair by examining anew the safety of the convictions , we would not uphold the convictions on the basis that they are unsafe in any event . \u201d", "Lord Justice Rose further stated :", "\u201c In our judgment , the ORG \u2019s obligation under LAW to abide by the judgments of the ECtHR does not confer any right on these appellants . In any event , we doubt whether LAW requires the re - opening of convictions . This is not expressly or implicitly required by LAW and there is nothing in the GPE jurisprudence to suggest that there is any such obligation . It is to be noted that the ECtHR made a declaration of violation in relation to each of these appellants . That declaration can be , and is regarded by the ECtHR as amounting to , sufficient just satisfaction . That court could have awarded damages but did not do so . It made an award of costs which GPE has paid in fulfilment of the judgment of the court . There is no suggestion in the ECtHR \u2019s judgments that that court regarded the remedy of declaration and costs as insufficient , irrespective of what might or might not occur domestically . This is so even though the LANGUAGE courts ( whatever may have been the position in other countries ) have not , before the ORG , re - opened convictions solely because of a GPE finding of unfairness . Assuming , at the highest from the NORP point of view , that the GPE findings entitle them to have their convictions re - opened by this court , that would simply mean , in view of the other evidence against them , that their convictions would be quashed and a retrial ordered . This is not a case in which , in relation to any appellant , the prosecution case was dependent solely on the compelled answers : there was and is substantial other evidence against each of them . It may be , given the lapse of time in this case and other considerations , that a retrial would not , as a matter of discretion , be ordered \u2013 indeed we so indicated during the hearing . That does not detract from the point that in principle in a case such as the present where what is complained of is the use of compelled evidence but there exists other evidence on the basis of which a jury might equally have convicted , restitutio in integrum would be achieved by the ordering of a retrial . Merely to quash a conviction would in such a situation put an appellant , at any rate so far as concerns jeopardy of a conviction , in a superior position to that in which he had been before his trial . Perhaps what this discussion demonstrates is that , in relation to convictions properly secured DATE , the concept of restoring as far as possible the situation existing before the breach is somewhat elusive , the more so when the challenge is to the use of some but not all of the material deployed at trial .", "However , and determinatively , even if the failure to re - open the appellants\u2019 convictions might give rise to violation of LAW , domestic law precludes reliance on any such violation in the circumstances of this case . The fact of violation could not have led to the exclusion of the answers at the trial , applying the approach available under domestic law at the time , because this would have amounted to partial repeal of legislation enacted by ORG which authorised the use of the evidence ( ... ) . The same conclusion results from sCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG which preserves the lawfulness of the conduct of the prosecution and trial judge in relation to the admission of the ORG answers . Put another way , the will of ORG as expressed in sCARDINAL trumps any international obligation . \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals . The applicants sought leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG certified that the applicants\u2019 appeal raised a point of law of general importance , namely :", "\" Where ORG ) is called upon to determine the safety of a criminal conviction following a finding by ORG that the use made at trial before DATE of evidence obtained under powers of statutory compulsion in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE rendered the appellant \u2019s trial unfair and in breach of LAW", "( a ) is the ORG entitled to rely after DATE upon the evidence the use of which was held to have rendered the trial unfair in order to support the safety of the conviction ; and", "( b ) is the ORG entitled to hold the conviction safe in reliance on such evidence ;", "notwithstanding GPE obligation under LAW to abide by the judgment of ORG , and the principle of judicial comity governing the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of an international tribunal which is final and binding as between the parties to the appeal ? \"", "On DATE , ORG granted leave to appeal .", "In addition to the arguments deployed before ORG , the applicants also relied on the relevant principles of international law in the matter of reparation for internationally wrongful acts .", "The ORG appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "ORG held that ORG was entitled to hold the applicants\u2019 convictions as safe since ORG was obliged to examine the question of safety according to the law as it stood at the time of the ORG trial , and at that time section CARDINAL of LAW DATE permitted the admission in evidence of statements which the applicants were obliged to give to the ORG . ORG had since amended that LAW to bring it into line with ORG judgment . However that amendment did not apply with retrospective effect . Accordingly , ORG considered itself bound by the principle of parliamentary sovereignty to respect the legislative intention of ORG as it stood at the date of the ORG trial . The applicants had not had an unfair trial and there was no lack of safety in their conviction .", "As to the effect of LAW , and the obligation of GPE to make reparation for the breach of LAW in the form of restitutio in integrum , Lord PERSON stated :", "In the circumstances , I think it neither necessary nor desirable , despite the wealth of interesting material to which we were referred , to consider what full reparation or just satisfaction might require in a case such as the present in which ( if the compelled evidence were excluded ) the existing convictions could not be upheld as safe , in which there is material ( irrespective of the compelled evidence ) to support a case against the appellants , but in which ORG has indicated ( no doubt rightly , in view of the lapse of time , the serving or partial serving of prison sentences and the age and health of some of the appellants ) that the interests of justice would not appear to require a retrial even if the appeals were allowed ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) . These are no doubt questions which ORG or ORG , or both , may be called upon to address and I forbear to comment .", "Recommendation No .
