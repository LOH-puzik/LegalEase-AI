The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a party to civil proceedings concerning division of co - ownership of a certain plot of land . The proceedings were instituted in DATE . On DATE the ORG awarded the plot to a certain PERSON and ordered that a certain amount should be paid to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly amended the firstinstance decision increasing the amount awarded to the applicant and dismissed the remainder of his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested to be served with written grounds to that judgment . On DATE the court served him with them and the thirtyday timelimit for lodging of a cassation appeal started to run .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , served on the court on DATE , the applicant requested that a legalaid lawyer be assigned to the case to prepare a cassation complaint .

On DATE the ORG granted the applicant 's request for legal aid . On DATE ORG assigned a legalaid lawyer to the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant and the lawyer had a telephone conversation . In a letter to the lawyer dated DATE the applicant explained in a detailed manner the legal context of the case and the reasons for which he was of the view that a cassation complaint offered prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the court dated DATE the lawyer explained in detail why she saw no grounds on which to prepare a cassation complaint in the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the legal - aid lawyer sent a copy of his opinion to the applicant . It was served on the applicant on DATE .

NORP In particular , ORG has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination ( DATE , II CZ CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a further series of decisions ORG considered that it would be unfair for the legally - aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within DATE counted from DATE of service of the judgment on the party . The parties waiting for legal - aid services can not be held at fault for shortcomings in the system . A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it . A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within DATE from the date on which the legal - aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal ( DATE , II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by ORG DATE , PERSON ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ DATE ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ;", "CARDINAL . In a resolution adopted by a bench of CARDINAL judges of ORG on DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that court acknowledged that there had been discrepancies in the manner in which the beginning of the DATE time limit for submitting an application for leave to appeal out of time by legally - assisted parties had been determined . The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to ORG for legally - aided parties genuine and effective . Hence , the beginning of the time - limit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases . The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
