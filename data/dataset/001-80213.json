On DATE a mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her children , a girl born in DATE and a boy born in DATE , had been sexually abused by a neighbour , the applicant . On DATE and DATE the siblings were interviewed by a police officer experienced in investigating sexual abuse of children . The applicant was also suspected of having abused CARDINAL other girls , both friends of the siblings and born in DATE . The girls were interviewed by the police on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively and again on DATE . All the interviews were recorded on videotape .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the first interviews , i.e. on TIME of DATE , the applicant had not been informed of the suspicions against him and no defence counsel had yet been appointed for him . Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present during the later interviews . The siblings and CARDINAL of the other girls underwent a psychological examination in ORG with a view to assessing whether their testimonies during the pre - trial investigation were reliable .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant was questioned by the police . Before the questioning he was notified of the suspicions against him and it appears that he did not exercise his right to have his counsel present . The applicant was in detention from DATE until DATE when travel restrictions were imposed on him . He was accompanied by counsel when questioned again on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE DATE and DATE . He was questioned alone on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the close of the pre - trial investigation , in his closing statement the applicant requested , on DATE , having watched the above - mentioned video recordings , that the siblings be questioned again and that his questions be put to them about how and where they had learnt about the sexual things they had mentioned to him and , in particular , if they had been subjected to sexual acts at a place other than the applicant 's home . His request was however refused on DATE . According to the Government , this was because their mother had refused to allow any further questioning of the children , now aged DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was charged before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) with having sexually abused the CARDINAL children during DATE . He denied the charges . He however admitted having tapped CARDINAL of the girls on their buttocks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG held an oral hearing during which the applicant , the parents of the siblings and the mothers of the other CARDINAL girls gave evidence . The children were not heard in person . The videotaped interviews with the children were shown during the hearing . The court also heard evidence from a psychologist on the reliability of the statements of the siblings and of one of the other girls . The applicant did not request that the children give evidence at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The mother of the siblings testified that they had told her about the improper touching in the same manner as they had done on the videotape . When the touching had become known , on DATE , her son had reacted intensely by crying and slamming doors . He had also suffered from sleeping problems and her daughter had suffered from headaches . Neither of these ailments had occurred before . According to CARDINAL written opinions of ORG , the siblings ' accounts of the events were considered credible given their detailed and precise nature . There was nothing to suggest that they were the siblings ' own inventions . The mothers of the CARDINAL other girls testified that they had told them about the improper touching in the same manner as they had done on the videotape .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG observed that the evidence was mainly of an indirect nature and that the sole direct evidence was the testimony of a psychologist , who had testified as to the children 's credibility .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant had argued that the main evidence in the case was flawed due to the fact that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to the children and that the authorities had put leading questions to them . He had also argued that there were shortcomings insofar as the psychological examinations carried out by ORG were concerned . The court however found no such flaws as would significantly have reduced the evidentiary value of the examinations .", "CARDINAL . The court then stated that the case turned on an assessment of the credibility of the children 's statements . While it was true that the pre - trial statements ' probative value was weakened by the fact that the applicant had not been able to put questions to the children , these statements were nonetheless reliable as the children had provided details about the events and as their young age gave no reason to believe that they would have sought to lie about the events . Although some leading questions may have been put to the children , there was nothing to suggest that they would have sought to please the interviewer and adapted their replies accordingly . This being so , the court found that questioning the children in court would not have added anything significant to the case . Having regard to their best interests , the questioning of children of such a young age before a court could not be considered justifiable . The court found that the testimonies of the psychologist and the parents supported the credibility of the children 's accounts .", "CARDINAL . It convicted the applicant of having sexually abused the CARDINAL children and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , alleging inter alia a breach of LAW ( d ) of the LAW in that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to the children .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) held an oral hearing and was presented with the same evidence as had been before ORG . The parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the children that they should not be heard before the court . The applicant however rejected the admission of the children 's pre - trial statements as evidence since he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to them .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG noted that the children had been interviewed twice during the pre - trial investigation and all but CARDINAL of the girls had been examined in ORG using tests and interviews . As the questioning of the children , now aged DATE , before the court would probably have caused them suffering , it was possible to use in evidence their pre - trial statements , although the applicant 's minimum rights under , inter alia , LAW ( d ) of the LAW would thereby be violated . In evaluating the weight to be attached to the children 's statements , the court found that it had to take into account the discrepancies pointed out by the applicant and the fact that the police had not put to the children the questions proposed by him in his pre - trial closing statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its assessment of the evidence the appellate court reached the same conclusions as the lower court and upheld the conviction . It however reduced the sentence to one year and DATE imprisonment , which it considered fair , having regard to the fact that the applicant had not forced the children into doing anything , the relevant sentencing practice and the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested leave to appeal , maintaining , inter alia , that there had been a breach of LAW ( d ) of the Convention . He did not submit any request for the children to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .

DATE ) provides that when questioned during a pre - trial investigation the child must be treated with due respect having regard to his or her age and level of development . Where possible , the interview should be carried out by a police officer acquainted with that task . If need be , a doctor or an expert must be consulted before the interview ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen ; Act no .

The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre - trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A pre - trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience . Nor must the rights of those concerned be infringed more than is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the investigation ( section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator may permit a party and his counsel to be present during the questioning of another party or witness , provided this does not hinder the investigation of the offence ( section CARDINAL ) , Act no .

The investigator may decide that the questions are to be put through him or her . Also , the prosecutor may put questions to the person being questioned . A party and his or her counsel have the right to request the investigator to ask the person being questioned about matters necessary for the clearing up of the case at other times also ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Before the closing of the criminal investigation , the parties must be afforded the opportunity to present to the criminal investigation authority their statement on the material gathered during the investigation , if this is conducive to hastening or facilitating the hearing of the case in court . The statement is to be appended to the investigation record ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) lays down the applicable rules on receiving testimony .", "CARDINAL . A statement in a pre - trial investigation record or another document may as a rule not be admitted as evidence in court . The court may exceptionally admit such a statement as evidence , if the witness in question can not be questioned before the court ( chapter DATE , LAW ; Act no . CARDINAL ) . A witness must give testimony orally before the court and must not refer to a written testimony . Oral evidence given during a pre - trial investigation may be read out when the witness in question is heard by the court only if he or she retracts in court an earlier statement or states that he or she is unable or unwilling to testify before the court ( chapter DATE , Article CARDINAL ; Act no .

If a person called as a witness is DATE , is mentally ill or mentally retarded , or his or her mental capacities have otherwise been impaired , the court shall , taking into consideration the circumstances , assess whether or not he or she may be heard as a witness ( LAW , LAW ) . Although the hearing of evidence from children falls within the court 's discretion , there has been a long - standing practice not to hear evidence in court from children under the age of ten .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the proceedings in question , there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of a statement given by a child during the pre - trial investigation . There was however a practice to admit such recordings as evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure was amended with effect from CARDINAL DATE to the effect that the testimony of a person DATE , or a mentally disturbed person , recorded on audio or videotape during a pre - trial investigation may be used as evidence if the accused has been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to the person giving the testimony ( LAW , Article CARDINAL ) ; Act no . CARDINAL ) . According to the explanatory report to the relevant Government PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , this new provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to inter alia a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL .
