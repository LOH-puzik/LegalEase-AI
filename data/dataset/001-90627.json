As a single mother she was granted a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in LOC . In DATE the applicant was transferred to an elementary school in Po\u017eega , a town in the same region . The school provided her with a flat , which it had temporarily leased from its then owner , ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The lease expired in DATE . In DATE the ORG took over all property of the ORG , thereby becoming the owner of the flat . The school then asked on several occasions for the lease to be extended but these requests were ignored by the competent authorities . However , since no request for her eviction was made and no other flat was provided for her by her employer , the applicant remained living in the flat and continued paying a DATE rent to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG brought a civil action against the school and the applicant in ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking the applicant \u2019s eviction .

Thus , irrespective of the time [ the second respondent ] has occupied the flat and irrespective of the fact that the respondents continued to be in possession of the flat even after all contracts [ concerning the flat ] had expired , there is no legal basis for the second respondent to have acquired any rights on the flat in question ...", "Although this court is aware of the respondent \u2019s unenviable position , it has to adopt its decisions exclusively on the basis of the laws and therefore , relying on the facts of the case , it has decided as in the operative part of this judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
