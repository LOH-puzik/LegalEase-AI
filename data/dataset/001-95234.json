GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "Together with Mr W. , the applicant held shares in a limited liability company which in DATE took out several loans from the PERSON ORG eG for which both the applicant and Mr PERSON provided directly enforceable guarantees ( selbstschuldnerische B\u00fcrgschaft ) . In DATE the bank terminated the loans on account of arrears and claimed the outstanding debts from the applicant .", "After the applicant had refused to pay , the bank invoked the guarantees and in DATE brought an action claiming partial payment of MONEY ( ORG ) . Together with its statement of claim the bank submitted , inter alia , a deed signed by the applicant on DATE guaranteeing an overdraft of the company \u2019s account in anticipation of a current account advance ( GPE ) of LAW . On DATE , following an oral hearing , ORG found the bank \u2019s claim to be justified in view of the guarantee . The applicant brought an appeal against the judgment .", "On DATE ORG advised the parties that it had doubts as to the action \u2019s conclusiveness ( GPE ) . In the opinion of ORG , the guarantee of DATE did not cover the bank \u2019s claim since it was in anticipation of a current account advance and had therefore expired once the advance had been authorised .", "On DATE the bank \u2019s lawyer submitted a deed guaranteeing the actual current account advance signed by the applicant on DATE . The applicant did not dispute the newly submitted guarantee ; however , she alleged that its submission constituted an inadmissible amendment of claim ( Klag\u00e4nderung ) and that a claim based on the new guarantee was moreover time - barred .", "In DATE the presiding judge of the competent chamber , Mr W. , fell ill . He has been unfit for service because of illness ( dienstunf\u00e4hig krank ) since then . By decision of ORG presidium of CARDINAL DATE PERSON was appointed regular deputy presiding judge ( regelm\u00e4\u03b2iger PERSON ) .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON informed the parties that in view of the new submission of the bank the chamber intended to dismiss the applicant \u2019s appeal in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see Relevant domestic law and practice , below ) without an oral hearing for lack of prospects of success . The court considered that from the beginning the bank had based its claim on an undisputed guarantee for the current account advance and had simply submitted the wrong deed . For this reason the claim could not be time - barred either . In reply , the applicant submitted that , because of the amendment of claim , a decision under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure was no longer admissible and an oral hearing was necessary . On DATE ORG , by unanimous decision , dismissed the appeal under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , referring to the reasons set out in the letter of CARDINAL October DATE .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint that she had not been heard ( FAC ) , arguing , inter alia , that ORG had neither dealt with her arguments regarding a modification of the matter in dispute ( ORG ) nor the question whether a decision under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure was still admissible .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The court held that it did not view the bank \u2019s submission on appeal as new or as an amendment of claim . However , even if it had considered it as such an oral hearing would not have been necessary . The new submission had been undisputed and was therefore admissible in any event on appeal . An amendment of claim would have been relevant ( sachdienlich ) and therefore also admissible , irrespective of the applicant \u2019s objection . Finally , the bank \u2019s claim was not time - barred as argued by the applicant : the current account advance had not been terminated until DATE so the statute of limitations ran until DATE and the correct guarantee had been submitted in time .", "In a constitutional complaint of DATE the applicant alleged a violation of her right to be heard and a violation of her right to the legally competent judge . In connection with the latter argument , she submitted that because of the long - term illness of Mr W. a new presiding judge should have been appointed . Furthermore , the decision of the presidium of CARDINAL DATE was unlawful because there had been no material cause ( sachlicher ORG ) for the appointment of PERSON as deputy presiding judge and thus a change in the distribution of business ( PERSON ) in the course of the business year .", "On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The relevant domestic law is described in the ORG \u2019s decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) , no .
