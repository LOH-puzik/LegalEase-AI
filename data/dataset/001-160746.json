The CARDINAL appeals were heard together by ORG , which gave judgment on DATE . The court explained that it would consider whether and , if so , how far to modify its case - law in light of this ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , ORG . ORG and CARDINAL , DATE , concerning access to rehabilitative courses .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON delivered jointly the opinion of the court on the general issues of principle and in respect of Mr PERSON and PERSON ORG . Separate opinions were given in respect of the appeal by PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that this Court \u2019s reasoning in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON opened the possibility that post - tariff detention could fluctuate between the lawful and unlawful , depending on whether a prisoner serving an ORG sentence was being offered an appropriate opportunity to progress in his sentence . The court pointed out that , according to the wording of LAW and DATE , any detention not authorised by LAW ought to lead release . Thus in a case where detention was found to be arbitrary under LAW , in application of the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON approach , the prisoner should \u2013 according to ORG \u2013 be entitled to an immediate order for release . There was , ORG said , a real difficulty about accepting the proposition that the LAW required the release of an ORG prisoner before ORG was satisfied that his detention was no longer required for the protection of the public .", "CARDINAL . As to this ORG \u2019s conclusion in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that detention following the expiry of the applicants\u2019 tariff periods and until steps were taken to progress them through the prison system was unlawful , the court explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... That exposes a problem . Particularly where a tariff is of a relatively long period , a prisoner \u2019s progression towards release through courses and experience in open conditions should , where and to the extent feasible , be facilitated not merely after but also in advance of the tariff period , so as to keep open the possibility of release on or shortly after its expiry ... Yet , on the ECtHR \u2019s approach , treating the present issue as falling within the text of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , no complaint can apparently arise until the expiry of the tariff period , and any complaint can then only arise if the failure to provide courses , etc continues after the expiry of the tariff period .", "CARDINAL . The second , much more substantial problem ... is that logically it would , if followed in GPE , mean , as we have stated , that any prisoner not being progressed through the system should be released , and that ORG DATE section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) should be declared incompatible with the Convention rights insofar as it precludes this ... Many of the failings revealed by the cases which have come before the courts to date are simply incapable of being redressed at the drop of a hat or wig . Systems failed , due to lack of resources and facilities , and it takes time to mend such failures , whatever order a court might make . Moreover , in a case where the failure was repaired , as it might be by the time a court came to consider the case , by the provision of adequate opportunity to the prisoner , then the court would be left , on this view of the ECtHR decision , with detention which had been unlawful for a time but was no longer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that it was not possible to follow the reasoning of the ORG in GPE , PERSON and PERSON . However , this did not mean that ORG prior decision in that case should be followed . ORG had underlined the link which should be recognised between preventive detention and rehabilitation , and had also concluded that there should be an individual remedy in damages for failure to provide prisoners serving indeterminate sentences with proper means of progression towards release . ORG explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We consider that ORG should now accept the Fourth Section \u2019s conclusion , that the purpose of the sentence includes rehabilitation , in relation to prisoners subject to life and ORG sentences in respect of whom shorter tariff periods have been set . We also consider that ORG can and should accept as implicit in the scheme of article CARDINAL that the state is under a duty to provide an opportunity reasonable in all the circumstances for such a prisoner to rehabilitate himself and to demonstrate that he no longer presents an unacceptable danger to the public . But we do not consider that this duty can be found in the express language of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Treating it as an aspect of the duty to avoid \u2018 ORG under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) has unacceptable and implausible consequences which we have already identified . The ORG decision in PERSON also remains important authority that arbitrariness has a confined meaning , when used as a test of lawfulness in the context of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ) would be a more satisfactory home for any duty of the nature identified in the previous paragraph , if its language covered it ( which it does not ) . Article CARDINAL ) gives rise to an ancillary duty on the state , breach of which does not directly impact on the lawfulness of detention . The duty is to make available access to judicial review by a court or here ORG , which will consider whether the information put before it justifies continued detention or release . PERSON access to ORG like reasonable access to proper courses and facilities represents an important aspect of a prisoner \u2019s progression towards release . But the language of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is in terms confined to access to judicial review by ORG on the basis of the information available from time to time . It does not cover the prior stage of provision of courses and facilities in prison , which gives rise to the information necessary on any ORG review .", "CARDINAL . The duty to facilitate the progress of such prisoners towards release by appropriate courses and facilities can not therefore be brought , in our opinion , within the express language of either article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) or article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . But it is on any view closely analogous , at an earlier stage , to the duty involved under LAW , and it is far more satisfactory to treat it as an analogous duty arising by implication at an earlier stage than that covered by LAW , rather than to treat LAW ) as incorporating it . We consider that a duty to facilitate release can and should therefore be implied as an ancillary duty - a duty not affecting the lawfulness of the detention , but sounding in damages if breached . Such a duty can readily be implied as part of the overall scheme of LAW , read as a whole ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appropriate remedy for a breach of such a duty was not release of the prisoner but an award of damages for legitimate frustration and anxiety . Damages would be recoverable in respect of any period of extended detention which could be shown to have resulted after the expiry of the tariff period , whether the failure occurred before or after the expiry of the tariff period . A prisoner could also seek mandatory orders .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the prison service manager who reviewed Mr PERSON \u2019s case accepted that there had been \u201c regrettable delays \u201d at some points . However , to say that more extensive coursework could have been made available to him was a very long way from saying that he had not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to rehabilitate himself and demonstrate that he no longer presented an unacceptable risk of serious harm to the public . According to the court , LAW did not create an obligation to maximise the coursework or other provision made to the prisoner , nor did it entitle the court to substitute , with hindsight , its own view of the quality of the management of a single prisoner and to characterise as arbitrary detention any case which it concluded might have been better managed . It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It requires that an opportunity must be afforded to the prisoner which is reasonable in all the circumstances , taking into account , among all those circumstances , his history and prognosis , the risks he presents , the competing needs of other prisoners , the resources available and the use which has been made of such rehabilitative opportunity as there has been . It is plain that ORG was not denied a fair or reasonable opportunity to rehabilitate himself or to demonstrate that his risk is acceptable . In DATE of his minimum term he was provided with courses in enhanced thinking , drug awareness and victim awareness . Sadly , his response was poor , there was doubt about his honesty , and his behaviour in prison attracted the many disciplinary adjudications mentioned above , all of which demonstrated that the risk he presented was far from removed . The transfer to ORG somewhat reduced the availability of rehabilitative courses , but there will inevitably be differences between prisons which can give emphasis to rehabilitation and those where the priority is security . It was his own misbehaviour which led to his transfer there , over DATE after the expiry of his minimum term . The consequence was that PERSON , which was the course judged , plainly bona fide , as that most suitable for him , was not available . Even without PERSON , there was sustained CARDINAL to CARDINAL anger management work for DATE after transfer to ORG . Even if , with the benefit of hindsight , consideration of CALM and FOCUS courses involved some misjudgement , it was perfectly understandable . He very plainly had anger problems , whether or not his index offences were the result of loss of temper , and he very plainly had a drug - use and drug - supply background . The advice to take an ORG course was plainly a sensible expedient , given that transfer to a place where the first choice PERSON was available had proved unavailable despite considerable efforts . Once it was identified , ORG was begun within DATE . The attempts to find a transfer were clearly persisted in ; they were complicated by ORG \u2019s wish to be in a prison near to his family , by the pending adjudication in DATE and by a \u2018 parole window\u2019 in DATE , quite apart from the competing needs of other prisoners in a large prison population . His case does not begin to approach the kind of failure of provision considered and chronicled in R ( PERSON ) . He was afforded reasonable opportunity to rehabilitate himself and to demonstrate that he was no longer a risk to the public , but did not do either . There was no breach in his case of the ancillary obligation under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to ORG finding that there had been a breach of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s public - law duty because of an under - provision of the ORG . This did not , however , mean that the Secretary of ORG was under an obligation to provide the ORG to every prisoner for whom it might be suggested . The question was whether the Secretary of ORG had afforded Mr PERSON a reasonable opportunity to reform himself and to demonstrate to ORG , by the time of tariff expiry or within a reasonable time thereafter , that he no longer presented an unacceptable risk to the public . As there were differences of opinion on this question among the members of ORG , CARDINAL opinions were issued .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , delivering the opinion for the majority , emphasised that the breach of the ancillary obligation under LAW which this GPE court identified in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON involved a wholesale failure to address rehabilitation . He continued :", "\u201c DATE . ... It was of a quite different order from the complaint made by PERSON . Whereas the prisoners PERSON , PERSON and PERSON in PERSON were left for a long time to languish in local prisons with no sentence planning and no rehabilitative work at all , no little effort was made with PERSON , who was provided with successive courses and had ample opportunity to change himself and to demonstrate that he was no longer a predatory sexual offender . The ORG and ORG courses with which he was provided supplied ample reasonable opportunity to do so . The latter in particular lasted DATE or more and involved CARDINAL sessions per week . Unfortunately , what was demonstrated was that PERSON remained a serious risk , since the initial scores for child abuse supportive beliefs proved false positives , and he remained manipulative , mistrustful and denying his principal offences , seeing himself as the real victim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered the strongest part of Mr PERSON \u2019s claim to be the passage of time after the psychologist \u2019s report of DATE , before the ORG was begun in DATE . However , in his view , since DATE was not due to expire until DATE , there could have been very little complaint before at least the Secretary of ORG recognised the course as an objective in DATE , and perhaps not until well after that . He further noted that in DATE , still well before the expiry of the minimum period , there had been further detailed psychopathy assessment sessions . Although these were principally assessments rather than therapy , they provided ample opportunity to demonstrate change , or at least encouraging understanding of the true nature of what he had done . Instead , what those sessions revealed was that PERSON still saw himself as the victim , denied his principal offences , believed that he had not harmed any of the children and remained manipulative . Lord PERSON continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... There could be no clearer demonstration of the risk he continued to present . There has certainly been considerably greater delay in putting him onto the even more intensive ORG than one would choose to see in an ideal prison management system , but that is not the same as saying that he has not had a fair opportunity to reform himself or to demonstrate that he is no longer a danger . Despite the delay he was able to begin the ORG quite shortly after the expiry of his tariff .", "CARDINAL . There is a great danger , in considering PERSON \u2019s case , of classifying the ORG as the acid test by which alone he could demonstrate his safety for release . Even if it were , it would not mean that he had not had reasonable opportunity to demonstrate this already . But it was not . The fact that the psychological recommendation that PERSON should take part in this programme did not have spoken conditions attached to it , does not mean that it was the only way in which he could demonstrate his safety . It was in fact neither a necessary nor a sufficient means of doing so . It was not sufficient since it is not designed to address the offenders\u2019 sexual interest in pre - pubescent girls ; even if made available , it would have been only part of the possible programmes which PERSON might have needed in the absence of his accepting that his behaviour , which he continued to characterise as innocent victimhood , was in fact a considerable danger to children , and in the absence of his recognition that it needed to alter . It was not necessary , because by this time he had had ample confrontation with his failings , and if he had recognised them and shown real willingness to change , for example in the course of TIME of interviews for the ORG - R assessment , then there may well have been no occasion for DATE of ORG work . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON emphasised that the responsibility for deciding what form of rehabilitative assistance was to be afforded to a prisoner had to rest with the individual ORG , providing that the minimum standard was met of a reasonable opportunity to him to demonstrate safety . The availability of limited resources , particularly at a time of national financial stringency , was an unavoidable factor . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... ORG ( \u201c CSOTP \u201d ) administered in the prisons of GPE and GPE is of considerable intensity and makes extensive psychological demands on those offenders who take part in it . It is very likely that if it stood by itself it would meet the duty contemplated by PERSON and even more likely that it would do so if coupled , as it is , with the EST , ORG , ORG and other programmes , which are available . There is no legal obligation to provide an ORG course in the first place . It is simply CARDINAL possible way of tackling recalcitrant attitudes in some prisoners and a welcome arrow in the quiver for the case of those who prove very difficult to change . To hold that a delay ( including an unacceptable delay ) in providing it constitutes a breach of article CARDINAL , via the ancillary duty recognised , would be likely to have the perverse effect of discouraging the prison service from providing it at all , and/or of discouraging recommendations for courses unless and until they are known to be shortly available , and/or of discouraging the prison service from devising and suggesting new forms of programme , especially if they are extremely expensive , as clearly the ORG is . All these effects would be an impediment to individualised prisoner assessment and management , and to eventual rehabilitation of those for whom it is possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON dissented , explaining that in his view a legislative scheme for IPP prisoners had to allow a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate safety and had to be accompanied by reasonable systems and resources to enable offenders to change and develop so as to be able to demonstrate that they were safe and to achieve release by tariff expiry or reasonably soon thereafter . As an element of this duty , he considered that there should be a reasonable degree of access for IPP prisoners to the ORG which many prisoners would need before they could hope to show that they were safe . That was the consequence of the scheme itself , under which it was otherwise inevitable that prisoners would languish in prison long after the tariffs set by reference to the seriousness of their actual offending . In his view , this was a consequence of the rehabilitative purpose of the ORG sentence . A finding that there was no breach of the ancillary duty in the present case could not , ORG said , stand with the finding of ORG that the Secretary of ORG was in breach of his public law duty to make reasonable provision of systems and resources for the purpose of allowing PERSON PERSON a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate to ORG , by the time of tariff expiry on DATE or reasonably soon thereafter , that he was safe to be released . He would therefore have upheld Mr PERSON \u2019s appeal and awarded modest damages .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld Mr PERSON \u2019s appeal . It said :", "\u201c DATE . ... It is apparent that the CARDINAL and a half years of his tariff ( somewhat shortened , properly , by time spent on remand awaiting trial and sentence ) was as well furnished with offender - behaviour work as one could reasonably expect . He first completed the ORG course , which is a frequent if not conventional first step , and he was placed on the ORG within his comparatively short tariff period . He completed the ORG in DATE , and since it is a DATE course it would appear that he must have been placed on it almost immediately after completing the ORG in DATE . The ORG report which first mooted the ORG was in DATE , so that there could never have been any prospect of his being both assessed for , and completing , the ORG by the time of his tariff expiry in DATE . The chronology illustrates the fact that if standard , intensive , course work such as the ORG does not succeed and if lack of risk is not demonstrated at the end of it , it will be inevitable that a prisoner with this kind of tariff period will pass the end of the tariff without being able to be offered every course which the system has .", "CARDINAL . However , it is important to note that , no doubt mindful of the comparative brevity of his tariff , the Secretary of ORG by the formal letter of DATE effectively defined what was regarded as a reasonable opportunity for PERSON to build on the partial progress which he had made and to demonstrate ( if he could ) that he was safe to release , namely over a DATE period . Neither this timetable nor anything approximating to it was honoured . Instead , it was not until after that period had come and gone that he was able to begin the ORG , and the letter shows that even if this produced a successful outcome , DATE or thereabouts was contemplated . We conclude that in ORG \u2019s case there was a failure to provide him with the opportunity to try to demonstrate that he was safe for release which the Secretary of ORG regarded as reasonable . The assessment for ORG was in DATE . If there had been a plentiful supply of places he might have been on it by about Autumn of that year , but no real complaint could have been made merely because this kind of course was not immediately available ; if it had been provided in or about Spring DATE , there would we conclude have been no breach . There is thus an unacceptable delay of DATE , and all post tariff . The inference of legitimate frustration is justified and that period calls for an award of damages . Given that it was post tariff we assess it at \u00a3 MONEY . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
