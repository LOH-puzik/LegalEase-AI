The applicant was born in CARDINAL and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had stolen CARDINAL \u201c PERSON \u201d cutting tools worth ORG MONEY from his neighbours , damaged their door frame and a letter box and uttered threats against his neighbour , Mrs. PERSON The court also referred to the fact that the offences with which the applicant had been charged had been committed within DATE of his previous conviction . The applicant was also charged with having robbed an individual of ORG CARDINAL . However , this charge was subsequently dropped by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's request to change the preventive measure against him was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention . The court relied on the reasonable suspicion against the applicant , on the fact that he had been previously convicted and on the risk that the applicant might try to influence witnesses given the violent nature of the offences with which he had been charged and the fact that the witnesses were known to the applicant and lived in his neighbourhood . The court also considered that there was a risk that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant even though the charge of robbery had been dropped . The ORG noted that the applicant was a habitual offender and that there was a risk that he would abscond . The court concluded that only the detention of the applicant would secure the proper conduct of the proceedings and that the conditions for applying police supervision had not been met .", "CARDINAL . A hearing scheduled for DATE was cancelled apparently due to the fact that the applicant went on a hunger strike and had to be transferred to a prison hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's detention was further prolonged . The court essentially repeated the reasons given on DATE and further found that the applicant 's mental and physical health was not incompatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against this decision , contending that the court 's assessment that he would interfere with the course of the proceedings was unfounded . He pointed out that , for DATE after the proceedings against him had been initiated , he had been living next to the main witness , PERSON , seeing her several times a day , and he had not attempted to influence her to withdraw the charges . He further raised complaints about his health and the inadequate medical care in the detention centre .", "CARDINAL . A hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned as some of the witnesses had failed to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court considered that the applicant 's argument that since he had not tried to influence witnesses previously he would not do so in the future could not constitute a ground for release . It further dismissed the applicant 's complaints about his state of health as unfounded . The court finally observed that the trial had not yet started because of the applicant 's decision to go on hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court held the first hearing in the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further request of the applicant to be released from detention on the grounds of , inter alia , his poor health was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention relying solely on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the violent nature of the offences , which made it probable that he would use force against witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the appeal , quashed the impugned decision and ordered the applicant 's release . It appears that the applicant was released on DATE . The court gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c We can agree with the first - instance court that the main ground for maintaining preventive measures with respect to [ the applicant ] , that is the high probability that the accused had committed the offences with which he had been charged , is still relevant . However , in the opinion of ORG , at the present stage of the proceedings the particular grounds justifying imposition of the most severe preventive measure are no longer relevant . In this case there is no real and justified risk that [ the applicant ] would attempt to illegally disrupt the proper course of the trial . As it appears from the case file the court had practically finished the taking of evidence and had heard all witnesses called . What remains to be established is the state of health of [ the witness , PERSON ] . In those circumstances it is difficult to argue that there is a continuing risk that the applicant would try to influence the witnesses to make false testimonies .", "On the other hand , what should be underlined is that the accused PERSON has been in pre - trial detention since DATE , which is over DATE . The act of indictment was lodged with the court on DATE . In spite of the fact that the accused is still in detention , the trial only started on DATE , that is after DATE . It would be a truism to reiterate that detention on remand should not be transformed into the serving of a sentence of imprisonment . Such a situation can not be accepted because of the guarantees of the accused 's rights and the nature of detention on remand , which is a lawful but controversial trespassing on the constitutional rights of an individual .", "In the light of the above , the appeal court finds that the appeal should be allowed ...", "Incidentally , ORG would observe ex officio that the first - instance courts instead of upholding detention on remand in cases where it is not absolutely necessary , should more often make use of the regulations contained in LAW [ listing other preventive measures ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a judgment . The court convicted the applicant of the theft of CARDINAL \u201c PERSON \u201d tool worth ORG CARDINAL , destruction of property resulting in damage of ORG CARDINAL and uttering treats . He was sentenced to DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal and on DATE ORG dismissed it . The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal and ORG judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . The first page of the applicant 's first letter addressed to ORG bears the following stamp : Censored , ORG ( ORG , PERSON ) , a handwritten date : CARDINAL and an illegible signature . CARDINAL side of the envelope in which the letter was delivered to the ORG had been opened and subsequently sealed with adhesive tape .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand ( aresztowanie tymczasowe ) , the grounds for its prolongation , release from detention and rules governing other , socalled \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) are stated in the ORG 's judgments in the cases of ORG v.
