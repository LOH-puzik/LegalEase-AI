NORP The applicant company is a limited liability company and is the owner of the NORP television channel ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG broadcast a television show named \u201c Jungle \u201d ( ORG ) in which CARDINAL videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera were broadcast . In the first video , GPE , then a member of ORG and chairman of the inter - party committee on electronic gambling , was shown entering a gambling arcade and playing on CARDINAL machines . The second video showed a meeting between ORG and associates of the television host of \u201c LOC \u201d , PERSON , during which the first video was shown to GPE The third video showed a meeting between GPE and PERSON in the latter \u2019s office . On DATE the videos were shown again during a television show named \u201c ORG \u201d ( PERSON ) presented by the same television host .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03a1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 ) , following an invitation to the applicant company , held a hearing in which the applicant company was represented by its attorneys . As can be seen from TIME of the meeting , the applicant company \u2019s attorneys acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the above - mentioned incidents . They argued that such use had been justified owing to GPE being a public figure and that it had served the public interest , as proven by the fact that the report had resulted in ORG being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy . In their view , that had been the result not only of ORG \u2019s gambling activities , but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company \u2019s reporters to present the incident differently . The applicant company \u2019s attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise , as nobody would have believed the ORG allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images . It can also be seen from TIME that the members of ORG expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera , arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so , then all citizens \u2013 especially if they were public figures \u2013 would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion . They furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue ; however the means used raised an issue , as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations . They also noted that there were CARDINAL separate issues in the instant case ; on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of GPE", "CARDINAL . By its decision PERSON , ORG ordered the applicant company to pay CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) euros ( ORG ) for each of the CARDINAL television shows during which the above - mentioned videos were shown , as well as to broadcast on DATE on its main news show the content of that decision . The decision included a short description of the CARDINAL videos , a citation of the relevant legislation , and the conclusion that the use of hidden camera in that case had not been in accordance with the relevant law . It further stated that the sanctions had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence , of the number of viewers of the CARDINAL television shows , of the size of the investment that had been made by the applicant company and the fact that the television channel had been repeatedly fined in the past for the same offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of ORG was communicated to the Minister of Press and ORG , who , after examining its legality , issued decision no CARDINAL/E/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL confirming its content .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an application for annulment ( \u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 ) against the decisions of ORG and the Minister of Press and ORG with ORG ( PERSON \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 PERSON ) on the grounds that the above - mentioned decision had violated Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , as well as LAW .

On DATE the President of ORG referred the case to ORG owing to its high importance .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG took place on DATE . By its judgment no .

NORP In its legal assessment , the majority of ORG TIME referred to the constitutional provisions providing the right to impart and receive information , and then emphasised that this right is subject to limitations whose legitimate aim is the protection of the rights of others and the observance of the rule of law on condition that those limitations are proportionate . It additionally referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law in respect of LAW CARDINAL , with specific reference to case - law concerning the protection of a person \u2019s image ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ; ORG v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) . It continued by noting that under LAW has the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human values and that sanctions imposed by ORG served that purpose .", "CARDINAL . ORG laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera , by making a distinction between reporting on specific news , whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means , and the broadcasting of the relevant , secretly recorded image . According to that reasoning , recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person \u2019s right to his own image , which is protected by Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , as a specific aspect of the right to respect for one \u2019s private life . Consequently , the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means can not , in principle , be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information , given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individual \u2019s right to his own image . Nevertheless , in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news , on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person \u2019s position or standing . However , even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information , this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant , secretly recorded images , as that constitutes a much more intense [ \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news . In the domestic court \u2019s view , broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate ( for the reasons mentioned above ) broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning ORG in view of ORG \u2019s capacity as a public figure . The domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from TIME of the meeting of ORG it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news , whose source had been the secretly recorded images . As far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned , the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images . Therefore , the applicant company \u2019s allegation that it had broadcast the impugned images for reasons of journalistic interest and of public interest was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above - mentioned reasoning , ORG ruled that the decision of ORG had been fully reasoned and dismissed the applicant company \u2019s application for annulment .", "CARDINAL . A concurring , more specific ( \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 ) opinion was joined to the majority opinion ; the CARDINAL judges considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that person \u2019s right to dignity as it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goals that are irrelevant to him . Given that , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , the protection of human dignity is absolute , the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden , irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question . For those reasons , the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In addition , there were CARDINAL dissenting opinions . According to the first one , in view of the fact that ORG had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information , the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image . The reason for this was the special nature of television , in comparison with the other media , owing to which the broadcasting of the image went hand - in - hand with broadcasting the news itself . Therefore , the application for annulment should have been allowed , given that ORG decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of ORG had been recorded by hidden means , without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , according to the other dissenting opinion , no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image ( as was held by the majority ) . A person \u2019s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person \u2019s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place . For individuals , protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute , irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space , unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space . For public figures , however , protection was less absolute . In particular , public figures , such as politicians , were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it . As a result , there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities . For these persons , there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments . When , however , public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above , or acted in a way that was of interest to the public ( such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public ) , then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media . In this regard , the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television , as they did not operate on the same way ; therefore , it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images , as would be the case on the radio . In respect of legitimately recorded images , when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person \u2019s image on the other hand , the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent . In view of the above , the CARDINAL judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed , taking into account especially the fact that ORG was a public figure , that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space ( that is to say in a gambling arcade ) , and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of ORG that did not meet the requirements of his position . Therefore , the television channel \u2019s decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows , which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory , had not breached the proportionality principle ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
