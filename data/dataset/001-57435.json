{"ITEMID": "001-57435", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "BEL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1975, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF NATIONAL UNION OF BELGIAN POLICE v. BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 14+11", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . The applicant , ORG , has its headquarters at GPE - Schaerbeek . The union descends from ORG founded in DATE and changed its name in DATE ; in DATE it was constituted in the form of a non - profit - making association within the meaning of the Act of DATE . Associations of this kind have capacity in civil law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant union is open to all members of the municipal police , including rural policemen , regardless of rank , but members of the CARDINAL State police forces , the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities ( police judiciaire pr\u00e8s les parquets ) and the gendarmerie , may not at present belong to it . It numbers police superintendents and deputy superintendents amongst its members .", "The list of the applicant union \u2019s members deposited on DATE , in accordance with law , contained the names of CARDINAL persons ; this was not the whole of its membership but only the \" active members \" , that is to say , those \" who are delegated by the sections to represent them at the general meeting \" and are alone entitled to vote ( LAW applicant union \u2019s articles of association annexed to the ORG belge of DATE ) . The applicant union claims to have had CARDINAL paid - up members in DATE and that their numbers fell to CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . It is alleged by the applicant union that this steep decline of PERCENT was due specially to the trade union consultation policy contested in the present case . The Government does not dispute the fact of the decline but does not attribute it to the cause put forward by the applicant .", "There being CARDINAL men serving in the municipal police \u2013 whose establishment provides for CARDINAL - , at DATE the applicant union represented CARDINAL of the members of the force .", "CARDINAL . The municipal police , whose members are classified as municipal officials , is entrusted both with functions of an administrative and crime - deterrent character , as well as with criminal - police functions . In carrying out its administrative and crime - deterrent duties , the municipal police is directly subject to the municipal authorities and placed under the orders of the burgomasters ; on the other hand , in the exercise of its criminal - police functions , it is subject solely to the authority of the ORG and more especially the judicial authorities ( autorit\u00e9s judiciaires ) .", "The CARDINAL State police forces are distinct from the municipal police . The gendarmerie , itself also vested with both administrative police duties ( maintenance of order ) and criminal - police duties , can in addition discharge military duties in certain circumstances and is organised on military lines . The criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities ( la police judiciaire pr\u00e8s les parquets ) has , for its part , exclusively criminal - police ( de police judiciaire ) duties .", "The municipal police force amounts to PERCENT of municipal staff and PERCENT of all municipal and provincial staff . At DATE , municipal staff totalled CARDINAL officials to which number were added the staff of municipal social welfare boards ( CARDINAL ) , inter - communal associations ( CARDINAL ) and provinces ( CARDINAL ) . The gendarmerie and criminal police numbered respectively CARDINAL and CARDINAL members as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of its articles of association , the aim of the applicant union is \" any activity directly or indirectly relating to the study , protection , development , improvement and progress of any matter concerning the rights and occupational interests of the NORP police , particularly by means of trade union action . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG is recognised in GPE by LAW and is guaranteed in all fields by LAW DATE . Furthermore , GPE is a party to ORG no . CARDINAL concerning ORG of DATE ) and no . CARDINAL concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively ( Act of DATE ) . These various provisions safeguard , inter alia , the right freely to form trade unions , the right to join or not to join them , the right of trade union members freely to elect trade union representatives and the right of trade unions freely to organise their administration .", "While therefore in NORP law freedom is the rule for trade unions in matters of founding , organising , recruitment and propaganda , the same is not true of consultation of trade unions by public authorities acting as employers . In order to avoid having to negotiate with an ever increasing number of parties , the public authorities have in fact fixed certain criteria for selection based on the idea of representativeness of trade unions . They have also introduced this principle in several Acts dealing with relations between employees and employers in the private sector , for example the LAW DATE on ORG and ORG , LAW of CARDINAL DATE setting up ORG and the Act of DATE on ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Apart from a Decree of DATE referred to below ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the first regulation on trade union consultation in the public sector dates back to LAW of DATE applicable to ORG officials exclusively . The Royal Decree confines consultation to organisations having a seat on a \" trade union advisory committee \" set up within each ministerial department and a seat in a \" general trade union advisory committee \" operating under the aegis of the Prime Minister . These committees are consulted on all proposals concerning the status of ORG officials , organisation of services and work , safety , health and improvement of places of work .", "The representative character of these trade unions is assessed at CARDINAL levels , first at the level of the different ministerial departments and secondly at the level of the ORG administration as a whole . The sole criterion for representativeness is the number of members , determined by elections held in principle DATE . In fact , the last trade union elections were held in DATE . The elections due to be held in DATE were postponed sine die at the request of the large trade union federations , which had obtained a low percentage of votes in DATE .", "In the case of the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities , the ORG has reserved the benefit of consultation for the organisations which are confined to members of this force ( Royal Decree of DATE ) ; the Government states that in fact these organisations are in turn affiliated to the CARDINAL large NORP trade union federations . As regards the gendarmerie , LAW para . CARDINAL of the Act of DATE provides that members of the gendarmerie may join only occupational associations composed solely of gendarmes . ORG of the gendarmerie has been recognised as the sole organisation representing members of the corps .", "CARDINAL . There are no general regulations governing relations of municipal and provincial authorities with trade unions . The municipal authorities are free to set up trade union consultation if they so wish . Some of them , such as the towns of GPE , GPE , ORG , have done so and set up commitees - generally organised like those which operate at national level - on which sit delegates of certain representative trade union organisations . Otherwise there is no organised consultation but trade unions may , as everywhere else in the country , lodge claims or make representations on behalf of a member without any condition of representativeness .", "CARDINAL . The position proves to be very different as regards relations between ORG , which is the supervisory authority , and the staff of municipalities and provinces .", "After a first attempt ( a Bill of DATE ) had failed , trade union consultation was introduced at this level by LAW of DATE . Prior to that there had been no statutory provisions . A Decree issued by the Regent on DATE had set up a trade union consultative committee at ORG . On this committee there were , amongst others , delegates of ORG , including the secretary general of the applicant union ; but the Government states that the commitee was of little importance and soon ceased to meet .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE reads as follows : \" The general arrangements to be made by the King ... shall be decreed after consulting representatives of those organisations that best represent the staff of the provinces and municipalities ... The forms of such consultation shall be determined by the King . \"", "Under the same section the representative organisations are to be consulted on the following subjects : staffing , recruitment and promotion conditions for municipal staff , pecuniary status and salary scales for the staff of provinces and municipalities , general rules governing certain allowances and bonuses , rules governing the adjustment of pay scales and pecuniary status in line with the changes which have occurred since DATE in the pecuniary status of staff of the ministries , conditions for appointment to the posts of police superintendent and deputy superintendent and criteria for up - grading .", "CARDINAL . Consultation is important on CARDINAL counts . First , the ORG is bound to ask for the opinion of the representative organisations and , secondly , in the course of consultation it informs the representative organisations of its proposals in order that they may make known their opinions before any decision is reached .", "The consultation machinery is set in motion for the preparation of every rule - making instrument - Bill , Royal Decree , ministerial decree or circular - which relates to the matters listed above . ORG and ministerial circulars have been formulated in this way , usually concerning the entire staff of provinces and municipalities , but several of them containing measures peculiar to the municipal police and some valid only for that force .", "CARDINAL . If an organisation is not recognised as representative , it is barred from the consultation procedure but may nonetheless , inter alia , submit claims to the supervisory authority , ask to be heard by it , refer cases to it and make representations on behalf of its members .", "CARDINAL . The modalities of consultation of trade unions recognised as representative were first fixed by LAW of DATE . This Decree set up a trade union consultation committee attached to ORG , on which the only trade union delegates were the representatives of the CARDINAL large trade union federations listed in the following paragraph ( DATE ) .", "The applicant union applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat for a declaration of annulment of the Decree . However , on DATE of the hearing , DATE , the ORG belge published LAW of DATE withdrawing the provision which was being challenged . The case was then removed from the list of the ORG d\u2019Etat .", "CARDINAL . A Royal Decree of DATE re - organised the trade union consultation in question . While the consultation committee remained , its membership was radically changed in respect of both the number and appointment of representatives . The representatives were no longer to be appointed by specified trade unions but by \" the organisations most representative of the staff of the provinces and municipalities \" . Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL specified what was to be understood by \" most representative \" :", "\" Those organisations which are open to all staff of the provinces and municipalities and which protect such staff \u2019s occupational interests shall be deemed to be the organisations most representative thereof . Each such organisation shall make itself known by sending to the Minister of the ORG by registered post , within DATE of publication of this Decree in the ORG belge , a copy of its articles of association and a list of its officers . The Minister of the ORG shall verify whether it complies with the conditions required and shall notify it of his decision . \"", "CARDINAL trade unions , of which the first CARDINAL have since merged , were recognised as meeting these criteria : ORG ; ORG ( a member of ORG ) ; ORG , ORG ( a member of ORG ) ; and ORG , ORG ( a member of ORG ) .", "It is difficult to specify the number of persons affiliated in these various organisations . Some of the applicant union \u2019s members are also affiliated to CARDINAL or other of the large federations . The Government says that CARDINAL of these federations have CARDINAL policemen as members .", "CARDINAL of the trade union organisations recognised as representative have technical committees for the municipal police , which , as occasion arises , deal with problems particular to this force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant union asked the Minister of the ORG to consider it as CARDINAL of the most representative organisations of staff of provinces and municipalities for the purposes of the implementation of the above - mentioned LAW . By letter of DATE the Minister replied as follows : \" From the documents you have submitted it does not appear that your organisation fulfils the required conditions , namely that it should be open to all the staff of the provinces and municipalities and protect such staff \u2019s occupational interests \" .", "CARDINAL . Prior to that , on DATE , the applicant union had applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat for a declaration of annulment of LAW of DATE , alleging that LAW of DATE had been contravened . The applicant contended that LAW , which was drafted in very wide terms , implied that the organisations grouping officials by category and without regard for their opinions should , subject to their being the most representative organisations , be consulted on an equal footing with the organisations in which officials joined together according to their political feelings and without distinction as to their occupations . In the applicant \u2019s view , the preparatory work to LAW showed that consultation should extend to every representative organisation which protected the occupational interests of staff governed by particular staff regulations . Claiming that CARDINAL of the men in the municipal police belonged to it and that the force had its own regulations and constituted a corps within the personnel of the municipalities ; the applicant thus maintained that it was representative in a twofold way , the number of its members as compared with the number of municipal policemen and the special character of their functions . In the submission of the applicant , the King had acted ultra vires in stipulating that the condition \" representative \" must be confined to organisations open to the whole of provincial and municipal staff .", "The applicant union did not refer to LAW and DATE ( LAW , article DATE ) of the Convention nor to LAW . It submitted , however , albeit in a subsidiary way , that LAW . CARDINAL of LAW violated the principle of trade union freedom in that it made it \" obligatory \" for police officers to join \" political \" trade unions .", "CARDINAL . The Minister of the ORG submitted in reply that Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Act of DATE provided explicitly for consultation of the organisations most representative of the staff of the provinces and municipalities . The Minister added that the ORG d\u2019Etat , in its opinion no . L CARDINAL , had taken the view that there was no objection to considering as the most representative organisations those which \" included staff members of all categories \" . The Minister inferred from this that the application was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the application on DATE . It held that \" while the criterion of number advanced by the applicant was acceptable when applied to workers in the private sector or even to civil servants and officials in large government departments belonging to the same hierarchical structure and subject to the same regulations , it can not be accepted in the present case since the officers concerned belong to widely different categories which have no link between them , some being governed by separate regulations \" . It further considered \" that this diversity of categories and regulations has the effect of making the consultation of organisations representing staff much more difficult ; that , in each category , the persons concerned will tend to claim as many advantages as possible for themselves without paying any heed to the implications of measures on which they are consulted for the position of the other staff members , whereas the authority has to take such implications into account ; that the consultation of the organisations by the ORG can not in most cases serve any useful purpose unless it concerns organisations which comprise staff belonging to all categories and which therefore have to strike some balance in their claims in order to protect the interests of all their members \" . It found \" that in considering the organisations representing the occupational interests of all staff of the provinces and municipalities to be the organisations most representative of such staff , the Decree being challenged is not contrary to the intention of the statute \" ; \" that the applicant is in error in still maintaining that the contested provision is contrary to the principle of trade union freedom by making it obligatory for police officers to join political trade unions ; that in fact the contested provision does not oblige police officers to join any trade union nor any particular trade union . \"", "The judgment ended with the conclusion \" that in the organisation of public services the King may confine the consultation of occupational organisations to whichever organisations are the most representative of the staff as a whole , which procedure has repeatedly been given statutory confirmation \" ( translated from Recueil des arr\u00eats et avis du Conseil d\u2019Etat , DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime a Royal Decree of DATE had abolished the committee provided for in the Decree of CARDINAL DATE , but preserved consultation of the most representative organisations as provided in LAW . CARDINAL of the DATE Decree ; since then , such consultation takes place in writing .", "CARDINAL . An Act of DATE re - organised the relations between public authorities and trade unions of officials in the service of those authorities . Section I of this LAW provides that the system which the LAW establishes may be made applicable by the King \u2013 with certain exceptions one of which concerns the \" members of the armed forces \" - not only to the staff \" of the administration and other government departments \" , particularly of the \" services which assist the judicial authorities ( pouvoir judiciaire ) \" , but also to the staff of the provinces and municipalities including the municipal police .", "The LAW establishes a procedure of negotiation ( Chapter II ) and a procedure of consultation LAW ) .", "For negotiation , the LAW provides that the King shall establish three \" general committees \" namely , \" ORG \" , \" ORG \" , and \" ORG for all Public Services \" ( Section CARDINAL ) , as well as \" special committees \" among which will be committees competent for \" questions relating to the staff \" of provincial or municipal services ( Section CARDINAL ) . The King shall determine \" the composition and operation \" of these committees ( Section CARDINAL ) on which only \" representative ... organisations \" shall sit from the trade union side ( Section CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL defines in detail the criteria of representativeness for each of the CARDINAL general committees , LAW for the special committees .", "Consultation shall take place within \" consultation committees \" set up by the King for \" services and groups of services comprising not CARDINAL officials \" ( Section CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL provides that \" the trade union organisations represented on a special negotiating committee shall be entitled to appoint delegates to sit on the consultation committees set up within the competence of that committee \" .", "There will be negotiations on \" the basic regulations \" concerning \" staff administration matters \" , \" pecuniary status \" , \" pension schemes \" , \" relations with trade union organisations \" , and \" the organisation of the social services \" ; on \" regulations , internal measures , or directives , of a general nature relating to the subsequent fixing of staff structures , to working TIME or to the organisation of work \" ; lastly , on Bills concerning any of these various matters ( Section CARDINAL ) . There will be consultation for \" decisions determining the staff structure of the services covered by the consultation committee in question \" , \" regulations which the King has not specified as basic regulations \" , etc . ( LAW ) .", "In its observations of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant union expressed the opinion that the present case would \" probably become pointless \" \" if LAW of DATE became applicable to municipal officials \" .", "At hearings of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , the Government stressed that the application of LAW to provincial and municipal staff would not be an easy matter and would require more time . The Government consider that it may in any case be inferred from the text and the preparatory work of the LAW that even when it becomes applicable to such staff it will not change the trade union status in a way favourable to category - based ORG . In its view , the applicant union will not be entitled to sit on a general or special negotiating committee .", "The applicant accordingly now feels that \" it is doubtful wether the new law will give just satisfaction to the union \" and has so informed ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its application lodged with ORG on DATE , ORG alleged violation of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW in conjunction with LAW , article PERCENT CARDINAL ) , in that the NORP authorities refused to recognise it as a representative organisation , thus debarring it from the consultation provided for by LAW of DATE . The union also claimed damages which it provisionally assessed at MONEY .", "The Commission declared the application admissible by a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , after having rejected on CARDINAL DATE certain of the preliminary objections made by the respondent Government .", "During the examination of the merits the applicant union confined itself to relying on LAW ( LAW ) , both on its own and in conjunction with LAW article DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
