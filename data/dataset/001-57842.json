In its opinion ,", "\" A claim to compensation under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the [ DATE ] PERSON ... is conditional on the applicant \u2019s being cleared of the suspicion of which he was the object in the criminal proceedings . A person who has been detained is so cleared only if all the suspicious circumstances telling against him have been satisfactorily explained , so that they cease to constitute an argument for the suspect \u2019s guilt .", "Regard having been had to the prosecution evidence considered as a whole , however , it was not possible to dispel all the suspicions concerning the commission of the offence . Serious grounds for suspecting Mr Sekanina still subsist , in particular his numerous and repeated threats , the acts of violence and aggressive behaviour which have come to light , his evident satisfaction at his wife \u2019s death , the description of events given to a cell - mate , the different versions of how the accident happened , the fact that he was under severe financial pressure , his unsuccessful efforts to obtain care and custody of his CARDINAL children and the consequent build - up of aggressiveness , and his hopes of receiving payment under a life - insurance policy taken out on his wife . In addition , the ORG voting shows that they decided to acquit him only by giving him the benefit of the doubt . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this decision . It rejected the argument that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was unconstitutional and in breach of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW in that it required , in addition to an acquittal , the absence of all suspicion . The court held that the presumption of innocence had to be respected in the proceedings prior to the verdict , but did not confer on every detainee the right to compensation in the event of an acquittal . The impugned provision did not refer to guilt but to continuing suspicion . The finding by a court that suspicions subsisted did not conflict with the presumption of innocence . ORG added :", "\" The appeal also fails on its merits . Contrary to what is argued by the appellant , it can not be inferred merely from the voting of the jury ... that such a clear verdict meant that suspicion had been removed . In order to establish whether or not such suspicion subsists , it might be more useful to refer to the record of the jury \u2019s deliberations . The content of this record ... suggests rather that in the jury \u2019s opinion all suspicion had not been removed . However , as the court called upon to rule under the [ DATE ] PERSON ... is not bound , in its assessment of the position as regards suspicion , by the verdict ( of acquittal ) at the trial , not even the record of the jury \u2019s deliberations is of decisive importance .", "It can hardly be denied that following the police inquiries and also after the judicial preliminary investigation there were strong grounds for suspecting the appellant . Indeed , ORG decided on DATE ... that PERSON could be kept in detention on remand for DATE , thereby confirming the strength of the suspicion . In the appealed decision , the finding by the court below that suspicion subsisted was properly founded in particular on the numerous repeated threats made by PERSON , his acts of violence , his evident satisfaction at his wife \u2019s death , the description of the events given to a cell - mate , the different versions of how the accident happened , the severe financial pressure , his unsuccessful attempts to obtain care and custody of his CARDINAL children , and his hopes of receiving payment under a life - insurance policy taken out on his wife . With respect to the different versions of the accident related by the appellant to third parties , ORG refers in particular to the evidence given at the trial of DATE by the witnesses PERSON ( pp . DATE , CARDINAL DATE of the transcript of the trial ) and PERSON and PERSON ( pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transcript ) . The appellant told his fellow employee PERSON that he had been in another room at the time of the fall ( PERSON , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , whereas PERSON noticed during the fall that the claimant - wearing a light - coloured vest - was already at the window , the entire upper part of his body being visible . He had been holding a bucket out of the window with outstretched arms and pouring water ; in addition when he came down to his wife he had , she thought , been wearing a blue vest ( PERSON , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transcript ) . During his interrogation ( which was taken down in writing ) by ORG DATE ( p. CARDINAL , volume CARDINAL ) , the appellant placed on record that shortly before the fall his wife had quarrelled with him . According to the evidence of the witness PERSON , the appellant had told him that \u2018 during the quarrel he\u2019 - Sekanina - \u2018 [ had run ] towards his wife in a GPE ( pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transcript ) . The appellant was described by several witnesses as quick - tempered and violent ( pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the transcript ) .
