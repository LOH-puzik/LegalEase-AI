ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant brought proceedings in DATE against a hospital before ORG for alleged medical malpractice which had caused complete and irreversible paraplegia ( PERSON ) at the age of thirteen , claiming damages of around MONEY ( ORG ) . On DATE , the parties entered into a revocable friendly settlement ( widerruflicher PERSON ) before ORG , according to which the hospital agreed to pay MONEY ( ORG ) to the applicant . The applicant , who was represented by his lawyer , was not present during the conclusion of the settlement and did not revoke the settlement within the provided period of DATE , i.e. until DATE . Neither did the applicant \u2019s lawyer , although the applicant claimed that he instructed him to revoke the settlement .", "In DATE , the applicant brought proceedings against his former lawyer for damages . The major legal issue during the proceedings was whether the applicant had instructed the defendant to revoke the settlement . It was undisputed between the parties that the applicant had handed over a written statement to the defendant on DATE in which he asked him to revoke the settlement . The defendant had read the statement and subsequently returned it to the applicant . In the following conversation , the defendant had asked the applicant and his mother to reconsider their decision and inform him by CARDINAL DATE whether or not he should revoke the settlement . The applicant \u2019s mother then called on DATE the defendant \u2019s legal office and talked to his secretary . The content of the conversation was disputed between the parties .", "On DATE , ORG , in a judgment on the basis of the cause of action ( ORG ) , allowed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that the applicant had instructed the defendant to revoke the settlement on DATE . Therefore , the time - limit set by the defendant to inform him whether or not to revoke the settlement had no legal basis . In any event , the applicant had called the defendant \u2019s legal office on CARDINAL DATE in order to explain that he did not agree with the settlement . This was also supported by a letter which the defendant had sent to the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE , ORG set aside the judgment of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that the applicant had failed to prove that he instructed the defendant to revoke the settlement . ORG reasoned that the applicant had given such an instruction on DATE , but that he had subsequently agreed to reconsider his decision . After having heard the applicant \u2019s mother and the defendant \u2019s secretary as witnesses regarding the telephone conversation on CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s mother had not given an instruction to revoke the settlement when calling the defendant \u2019s legal office on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed his appeal on points of law with ORG . After the applicant had asked for an extension of the time - limit on CARDINAL occasions , he submitted his statement of grounds for appeal ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
