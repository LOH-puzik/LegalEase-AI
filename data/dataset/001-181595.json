Even before he was elected to ORG he had already established himself as a political commentator in the media and regularly authored opinions related to national politics which were published in national newspapers . Upon his retirement from ORG the applicant began writing DATE opinion columns in the newspaper DATE and another DATE paper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr PERSON ( referred to hereinafter as PERSON , for ease of reference \u2013 as he has the exact same name as the applicant ) , the deputy leader of ORG ( ORG ) , delivered a speech in public , which was reported on the national media . During the speech he informed the public that he had received an anonymous email and threatening letters , in respect of which he had complained directly to the Commissioner of Police ( CoP ) . He furthermore referred to the discussion he had had with the latter during which he had asked him to investigate the issue .", "CARDINAL . The most relevant parts of the speech read as follows ( translation done by ORG ) :", "\u201c ... But the fact that DATE , CARDINAL opens the newspaper ORG , front page , and reads the editorial by ORG , who chose to speak about a pending police investigation , about an anonymous email that I received and about a threatening letter that I received ... this is a level which should not be acceptable in our country . And whoever is behind these stories \u2013 wherever he might be \u2013 and let me be clear \u2013 wherever he might be \u2013 he should be ashamed ... ashamed !", "...", "Yes I received an anonymous email ... and I received threatening letters DATE . I did not disclose this to my family . DATE they were told by GPE ... I can tell them myself ... But when something illegal occurs , I go to the police . And that \u2019s what I did . And I went to the CoP , since people who put forward such stories can disclose them I can also do so now for everyone to know . So I went to the ORG I will tell you what I told him ... and he will confirm it . He told me : \u2018 What will we do , PERSON , if it were to [ turn out to ] be X or PERSON I told him : \u2018 I am telling you as of now , PERSON it whosoever in this country , I am authorising you as from now , in advance , even before you start the investigation , to proceed . Because what is illegal , I condemn it , and we as a party always condemned illegality .", "And we come to [ the subject of ] the anonymous email [ U wasalna fuq email anonima ] .", "And DATE ... ORG [ a journalist ] , this person phoned me DATE as well , told me \u2018 But you know , this is an innocuous email , it contains nothing.\u2019 And I tell ORG and [ other purveyors of ] this type of journalism , that when they saw [ that ] there is a police investigation , is it you , you decide what is illegal and what is not [ ? ]", "Because [ he was ] an admirer . And [ the sender ] of this email , true . I will speak to him , of course . But note , that he sent it anonymously ! Generally admirers tell you , \u2018 Hi , PERSON , is everything alright?\u2019 They do not write anonymously . And ORG said other things as well , and so did PERSON [ the editor of GPE ] . Among other things he said because he knows a lot he also phoned me DATE , and I told him . I told him : \u2018 You are breaking the law . It is now up to the police\u2019 . He also said that apparently apparently from the investigation into the email conducted by the police , nothing had emerged , and that it will stop there . And I will tell him now in public : \u2018 Mr ORG and PERSON , you have not discovered America!\u2019 PERSON to that effect have been said by an employee of our party for DATE ... at FAC for DATE . And he told me that I will make a fool of myself . I will not interfere . I will not interfere with the police investigation . That is for them to see .", "But DATE I told the CoP , and Inspector C. , that such discourse had long been doing the rounds at FAC . I gave [ them ] the names , and it is now up to the police to decide whether to find out where this information originated from , and who is deciding matters in this country . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , a journalist , published an article in the newspaper ORG , entitled \u201c Email sent to PERSON brings admirer before the Police \u201d . The article started off by stating that an innocent email sent to the deputy leader of the ORG had been passed on to the police , who in turn had identified the sender and subsequently questioned him . It concluded with the statement that when PERSON was asked about him reporting the matter to the police , the deputy leader of the ORG ( that is to say PERSON ) replied that \u201c he would not confirm nor deny \u201d that he was aware of the case .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG published an opinion by the applicant entitled \u201c Policing one \u2019s enemies \u201d , prompted by the above - mentioned speech , in which the applicant queried the manner in which the CARDINAL main political parties perceived the police force . The article \u2019s opening paragraphs read as follows :", "\u201c During a recent short visit to GPE , I had the opportunity to watch the film \u2018 The Lives of Others\u2019 ( original title : PERSON [ sic ] ) an ORG NORP movie , set in the DATE cultural scene of GPE , monitored by secret agents of the PERSON : the secret police of the former GPE ( GPE ) . The film puts the methods of the PERSON at the centre of the plot and as a result clearly exposes their repulsive behaviour .", "The police force , I believe , is simply responsible for making sure that people obey the law , for protecting people and property and for arresting criminals . Using the police in a different context and for the purpose of controlling people \u2019s freedoms is the basic notion of the typical police state , even if you insert the word \u2018 democratic\u2019 in your country \u2019s official title .", "For me , the biggest unease was caused by the realisation that the film was set in a period that is only DATE , which in GPE corresponds to the PERSON [ former ORG leader and Prime Minister ] years when I was already active in politics . Little did I think that events that were to unfold when I was back in my country would make me wonder whether the ORG [ ORG ] and the ORG look at the duties of the police in somewhat different manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Other relevant parts of the article , read as follows :", "\u201c I say this with deep regret , but I can only be seriously perturbed by the ease with which ORG Deputy Leader PERSON [ ORG ] persuaded the Commissioner of Police to investigate the source of a trivial and unimportant anonymous e - mail that he had received . More so , when this e - mail could only have been misguidedly considered \u2018 suspicious\u2019 , and even then in an absolutely far - fetched way , in the context of the infighting and internal feuds within the ORG .", "According to what Dr. PERSON [ M.F. ] said , the Police Commissioner who apparently is on familiar first name speaking terms with Dr. PERSON [ M.F. ] asked whether he would proceed in the same fashion whether the culprit eventually proved to be X or Y ; implying that the Commissioner was offering to act in a discriminatory way according who the \u2018 guilty\u2019 person was .", "Matters are even more worrying because when the police successfully traced the original writer and dispatcher of the e - mail , they impounded his computer and obliged him to go and sign DATE at ORG even though he was not accused of any crime .", "Has not ORG Deputy Leader PERSON [ M.F. ] successfully used ORG to control the freedom of an innocent , law - abiding private citizen whom he suspected could be a political enemy ? And has not somebody in the police force abused of his powers by condescending to do this for the advantage of the faction led by PERSON [ M.F. ] in the ORG \u2019s internal squabbles ? Why should the police force interfere in ORG \u2019s internal politics where , it is obvious , there are too many cooks spoiling the broth ? \u201d", "...", "\u201c Yet the ease with which the ORG Deputy Leader phones him up to complain , and even worse the ease with which this leading politician is provided with a service that can not be linked in any way with the pursuit of \u2018 criminality\u2019 as we know it makes CARDINAL wonder . \u201d", "...", "\u201c These events seem to indicate that within Labour there are people who can influence and interfere in decisions taken by ORG . This is happening when they are still in Opposition . Asking what would happen in this area , once they are in government is , therefore , a legitimate question . \u201d", "...", "\u201c So what is the ORG doing about this ? Does the ORG Deputy Leader who happens to be my namesake , carry more weight and influence with the Commissioner of Police than the Deputy Prime Minister who is politically responsible for ORG ? \u201d", "...", "\u201c I firmly believe that PERSON [ then Minister of Interior ] should set up a high powered inquiry with the specific task of getting to the bottom of this sordid soap opera . He owes it to those who dedicated DATE of their life to ensure the personal freedom of each and every citizen of GPE . He owes it to all present and future NORP citizens who did not live the past so that they will live in a future where no one controls their freedom and hence their lives . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the deputy leader of the ORG , instituted libel proceedings against the applicant ( and against the editor of the newspaper ) LAW ( see the \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d section below ) , and sought damages , claiming that the abovementioned extracts of the article had been defamatory .", "CARDINAL . By way of defence the applicant claimed that ( a ) the published article had contained his opinion and had consequently constituted a fair comment and the expression of a value judgment , ( b ) any facts had been substantially correct and based on what had been declared publicly by PERSON himself DATE prior to the impugned publication , and ( c ) the claimant was a person occupying a public office and was consequently bound to accept a wider level of criticism .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings ORG heard the testimony of the plaintiff ( PERSON ) , the CoP , the applicant , the editor ( PERSON ) , and CARDINAL other journalists ( A.B.D. and ORG ) . It saw documentation submitted consisting of an email exchange between the ORG deputy leader and a third person ( PERSON ) , as well as the transcript of the deputy leader \u2019s speech and copies of CARDINAL articles , both entitled \u201c Email sent to deputy leader brings an admirer before the Police \u201d ( CARDINAL having been published online and CARDINAL in print ) .", "CARDINAL . The CoP testified as follows ( as summarised by the firstinstance court ) :", "- He denied that PERSON had persuaded him or influenced him in respect of his doing his job in connection with the case at issue ;", "- PERSON had requested and obtained a normal appointment with the CoP ; when they met PERSON had showed him a letter which the CoP considered to be \u201c injurious and full of threats \u201d towards PERSON ; the latter requested the CoP to investigate the contents of the letter ;", "- PERSON also informed the CoP that he had received an email , which was later passed on to the CoP , following an invitation to do so by the same CoP ;", "- The CoP asked PERSON whether he intended to initiate proceedings against the person who should result to be responsible , given that the prosecution of such a crime would require the injured party to lodge a complaint ;", "- The documents which had been passed on to the CoP had in turn been passed on to ORG ( C.I.D. ) for further investigation , and the CoP had had no further contact with PERSON concerning the case , which had not been given any particular priority on his part .", "CARDINAL . The applicant failed to make written submissions within the stipulated timeframe , and his late submissions were not accepted by the court that proceeded to judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of having defamed the deputy leader of the ORG and was ordered to pay him MONEY ( ORG ) in damages . Costs were also to be paid jointly by the applicant and the editor ( who was also ordered to pay LAW in damages ) .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the CoP \u2019s witness testimony to explain the factual situation . In its view , while noting that public figures such as politicians were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism , they were nevertheless protected under LAW their protection having to be weighed in relation to the interests of the open discussion of political issues . The court considered the article defamatory as it had tarnished and impinged on the claimant \u2019s reputation . It rejected the applicant \u2019s defence , noting that it had not been proved that : i ) PERSON had manipulated the CoP due to the political office that he held in the party in which he militates ; ii ) that with his actions PERSON had offended ORG since he used ORG for his personal aims ; iii ) that PERSON was some deus ex machina who pulls the strings of ORG , from behind the scene , to reach his goals .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( in its inferior jurisdiction ) rejected the appeal and confirmed the firstinstance judgment . It considered it appropriate to analyse and mention all the relevant evidence that had not been referred to by the firstinstance court :", "- M.F. , as plaintiff and now respondent , submitted that the reader had been induced to believe that he had persuaded the police to harm someone , when all he had done was to file a report requesting that the anonymous letters and emails he had received be investigated .", "- The court also referred to the statements made by the CoP ( see above ) .", "- The applicant ( appellant before ORG ) explained that in his view the email received by PERSON had been innocuous and that PERSON had thus reacted disproportionality . According to the applicant , from the speech delivered by PERSON publicly ( at FAC in GPE ) , it transpired that there was a certain familiarity between him and the CoP ; indeed if that had not been so PERSON would have reported the incident at a police station like an ordinary citizen , and not with the CoP. In his view it was natural to question whether PERSON had used the CoP in connection with the internal affairs of the party . Even when cross - examined , he reiterated that influence had been exerted by PERSON on the ORG", "- The editor testified that in his opinion the speech delivered by the deputy leader of the ORG indicated that the latter had put pressure on the CoP to investigate the matter when he had met up with him to discuss the emails and the anonymous letters .", "- In reply to a question , while being cross - examined , as to whether PERSON had put pressure on the CoP , ORG replied that he was aware that a report had been filed concerning the email and that on DATE of publication , PERSON had declared that he was authorising the CoP to institute proceedings against whomever turned out to be the culprit .", "CARDINAL . ORG was of the view that , having examined all the relevant evidence and thus gaining an understanding of the circumstances preceding and surrounding the article , the applicant \u2019s assumption could not be considered as constituting fair comment . In the eyes of the ordinary reader , the comments and criticism made by the applicant could not be considered as objectively reasonable , made in good faith and balanced , given that they were based on a certain assumption \u2013 that PERSON had exercised influence over the CoP with the aim of controlling people \u2019s freedom ; the attack on PERSON had thus exceeded the limits of just criticism . PERSON had had every right to file a report , and the fact that he was politically active had not justified such an attack , which had not been corroborated by factual evidence . It considered that even though the manifestation of free expression was an established principle , that freedom was to be exercised within those just limits of the canon of objective veracity of facts and restraint ( entro l - limiti \u0121usti ta\u2019 dak ilkanoni tal - verita\u2019 o\u0121\u0121ettiva tal - fatti u tal - kontinenza ) , as elaborated by the most progressive doctrine and jurisprudence on topical issues and the exercise of criticism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that he had suffered , inter alia , a breach of LAW as a result of the judgments in the libel proceedings . He argued , in substance , that his opinion piece had consisted of criticism , which was a legitimate manner of expressing an opinion about the work of a public figure and was allowed in a NORP society noting that the extensive protection given to such a public figure served to silence free expression . He further claimed that the ordinary courts had referred to insinuations and allegations which had not been made or implied by the applicant in his article , such as the statement by ORG to the effect that PERSON had \u201c manipulated \u201d the CoP or that the latter had been subjected to pressure which had \u201c impeded the exercise of his function \u201d as well that PERSON \u201c was a deus ex macchina pulling the strings of the Police Force \u201d . The applicant emphasised that these were gratuitous inventions by the ordinary court which had not been mentioned in the article .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional competence dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . It considered that the applicant was attempting to obtain a revision of the ordinary proceedings and noted that it was not quite true that the applicant had never implied that PERSON had \u201c manipulated \u201d the CoP indeed his article had precisely questioned \u201c has not the ORG deputy leader ORG successfully used ORG to control the freedom of an innocent lawabiding private citizen whom he suspected could be a political enemy ? \u201d . In any event , even if the applicant considered the statements made by ORG in its reasoning to be invented , this had not constituted a breach of his LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court noted the reference to the ORG with which the applicant had started his article and his narrative of PERSON \u2019s actions , which had resulted in an individual being investigated and subsequently having his computer seized . In that context he had asked whether PERSON had \u201c used \u201d the police against a political opponent . The applicant criticised the CoP for following up on the indications given by PERSON , to the extent that the applicant had called on the Minister of the Interior to look into the matter . Indeed , the CoP was also an object of the applicant \u2019s criticism .", "CARDINAL . According to the court , the word \u201c uses \u201d did not mean \u201c manipulate \u201d , as implied by ORG , but within the context of the article at issue , it nevertheless implied an element of abuse . The criticism against PERSON was that he had taken advantage of his political position to put pressure on the police in order that the latter would take action in persecuting an innocent citizen . The court considered that it was legitimate for a victim of a crime to complain to the police , and then it was for the police to act on the matter . Further , the initial reference to the \u201c NORP \u201d in the opening of the article had been regrettable ; even if it was not intended to do so , it had given the impression of a comparison being made .", "CARDINAL . In its view , even accepting that a public person was subject to greater limits of acceptable criticism , given the article at issue , the ordinary courts had not failed to strike a fair balance between the competing rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed his appeal .", "CARDINAL . It noted that the ordinary court judgments and the penalty inflicted constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW , which had been prescribed by law ( LAW ) . It emphasised the importance of free expression for the press ; nevertheless , it noted that the press could not exceed certain limits and had to exercise its function in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others . Acknowledging that politicians were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism , it nevertheless noted that they remained holders of their right to the protection of their reputation . The quest for reasonableness and proportionality in such circumstances had to be seen against the background of the importance of public debate .", "CARDINAL . Noting the difference between facts and value judgments ( the latter not being subject to the need for proof ) , it considered that a person could not hide behind an opinion or value judgment to impute untrue facts in respect of other persons . It considered that ORG had reached a legitimate conclusion in finding that the applicant \u2019s opinion piece had contained declarations which assumed as a fact that the ORG deputy leader had illegitimately and abusively influenced the police and also that the exercise of illegitimate and abusive pressure on the CoP had not been proved as a fact .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that while the article had contained a series of questions ( in respect of which the applicant argued that it was for the reader to answer ) , it had also contained assertions , some of which had not reflected the real facts , according to ORG . Further , ORG considered that just because an alleged fact was given the form of a question , this did not entail that it was no longer a factual assertion but rather became a value judgment . Even the way in which the question was posed , namely \u201c Has not PERSON ... \u201d clearly included a factual affirmation and clearly invited a positive reply . Similarly , the quest \u201c Does the ORG Deputy Leader , who happens to be my namesake , carry more weight and influence with the Commissioner of Police than the Deputy Prime Minister , who is politically responsible for ORG ? \u201d was nothing but an allegation of fact in the form of a question .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted that the amount of the fine had not been particularly severe , so much so that the quantum had not been appealed . There was therefore no violation of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
