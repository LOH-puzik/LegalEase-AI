He was firmly of the view that the applicant \u2019s nudity in a public place would cause alarm to anyone . During cross - examination by the applicant , Police Officer A agreed that the human body was in itself decent and was not harmful or alarming . He accepted that nothing in the applicant \u2019s behaviour at the time of his arrest , other than his nakedness , gave the police any cause for concern . Police Officer B gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she was \u201c quite shocked \u201d by it . She explained that at the time , FAC had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic . She had previously seen elderly people and children in the area , and there were schools and housing nearby .

He did not believe that he was causing harm by not wearing clothes . He said that he did not wear clothes in order to provoke a reaction : although he had not always been like that , as he had grown older he had thought more about his beliefs . When asked what he hoped to achieve by making his stand , the applicant replied that he did it because he felt that it was right and that the world changed in its own way .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found the applicant guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court . He considered that being naked in a public place and refusing to wear clothes in a public place was conduct that would be alarming and disturbing , in its context , to any reasonable person . In his stated case prepared in the context of the applicant \u2019s later appeal , the ORG explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... There was no dispute on the facts of the case ... I accepted that the police officers were concerned that if the appellant did not put clothes on there was a very real likelihood of him causing fear and alarm to other members of the public ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The position of the appellant is somewhat difficult to understand . He made it clear to the QUANTITY police officers that he had no intention whatsoever of putting clothes on . He insisted on being naked in a public place . He believed that he was doing no wrong by being naked in a public place . He did not accept that he had committed an offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He noted that in questioning the police officers , the applicant had chosen not to differentiate between private and public places when it came to nakedness . He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I was entirely satisfied that the conduct of the appellant with the aggravation of his refusal to wear clothing in a public place amounted to a breach of the peace . The criteria for a breach of the peace as discussed in the case of ORG had been met ... The evidence of the appellant did not raise a doubt in my mind . Accordingly I convicted the appellant as libelled . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At sentencing , the Sheriff had before him the applicant \u2019s previous convictions . According to the stated case , the applicant confirmed to the ORG that all previous convictions were for breach of the peace . The Sheriff \u2019s stated case continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... He acknowledged that he had spent DATE or thereby in prison for the same offence . A pattern has emerged namely that on his release from prison when he \u2018 stepped out\u2019 of the prison gate , always naked , he was immediately arrested .", "CARDINAL . I asked the appellant what he was hoping to achieve by insisting on being naked in public . He talked about \u2018 his beliefs\u2019 . I simply could not understand what he had to say in this regard . He did not appear to be waging any campaign or making a protest . He informed me that he would rather not be in prison . If he was not in prison , he would go back to live with his mother in a village in GPE . He had previously worked as a driver of large goods vehicles ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Sheriff discussed sentencing options with the applicant . In his stated case he explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I enquired of him if I was minded to defer sentence for whatever reason and admit him to a bail order would he then wear clothes . After some thought the appellant stated that he would not be prepared to wear clothes ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Sheriff \u2019s stated case concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Taking all these matters into account I could see no alternative to a custodial sentence . In view of the content of LAW I deemed it appropriate to impose the maximum of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment which I backdated to the date that he had been taken into custody . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A further CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , to run concurrently , was imposed for contempt of court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought to appeal his conviction and sentence by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case was prepared by the Sheriff in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was provided with a copy of the stated case and was asked for details of any proposed changes . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant proposed a number of changes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held to consider the proposed adjustments to the case stated . The applicant was brought from GPE to attend the hearing and blankets were provided to facilitate his attendance . He was told that if he refused to wear clothes or make use of the blankets he would not be admitted into the court . He refused to wear clothes or to make use of the blankets and was accordingly not permitted to attend the adjustment hearing . The hearing proceeded in his absence and his requested adjustments were considered by the FAC . CARDINAL adjustments were allowed and the remaining adjustments rejected .", "CARDINAL . Concerned that the stated case was biased , the applicant did not lodge it with ORG . On DATE , the expiry of the applicable time - limit for lodging , his appeal was deemed abandoned .", "CARDINAL .

Minutes after his release on DATE at TIME , the applicant was approached by CARDINAL police officers on FAC , a public road leading from GPE to FAC . The officers suggested that he put on some clothes but he refused to do so . He was arrested him for breach of the peace and detained on remand . He appeared in court on DATE and pleaded not guilty .", "DATE . The trial commenced on DATE . The applicant appeared in court naked and was warned by the Sheriff that if he refused to dress or to cover himself he might be held in contempt of court . He refused to put on clothes .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution led evidence of CARDINAL police officer witnesses at trial . Their evidence was similar to that given at the DATE trial and the applicant \u2019s cross - examination was also in similar terms and elicited similar responses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not give evidence in his defence . He argued that his arrest and trial violated the Convention . He relied , inter alia , on LAW , arguing that there was no reasonable suspicion which would satisfy an objective observer that he had committed an offence ; Article CARDINAL , arguing that his arrest was arbitrary as it was based on the subjective belief that his nakedness was offensive ; Article CARDINAL , arguing that he had a strong view that there was nothing indecent about his body and that view was not being respected ; Article CARDINAL , arguing that he ought to have been given the right to express his views that nakedness was not indecent in the way that he had chosen to do ; and Article CARDINAL , arguing that he was being discriminated against because he had different views from the majority of people .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that the applicant \u2019s conduct on DATE was severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people ; threatened serious disturbance to the community ; and presented as genuinely alarming , in its context , to any reasonable person . He therefore convicted the applicant . In his stated case prepared in the context of the later appeal proceedings , the Sheriff referred to the applicant \u2019s Convention arguments and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I should say that none of these arguments were developed to any extent and it was not always easy to see what [ the applicant \u2019s ] full argument was . I came to the conclusion that none of the articles suggested by the appellant had been contravened in the procedure ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the conviction handed down , he explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In my view there was no doubt about the facts in this case ... The question was whether the conduct amounted to a breach of the peace . I was of the view that the first part of the test was easily met by the conduct . The appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show . Such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street . It might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private , even in a public place which was remote or where fewer people would be congregated , but in or near one of the main streets of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming .", "CARDINAL . The question which was more troubling was whether the second part of the test was met . Would the conduct cause serious disturbance to the community ? I came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct was taking place \u2013 being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct \u2013 would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place . That would be particularly so if the community could see that children or vulnerable old people might be present . I considered that the test was met and that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt . I therefore found the appellant guilty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE for the breach of the peace and DATE for the contempt charge , together with DATE unspent from his previous sentence , a total of DATE . The sentences were not backdated and they were to run consecutively . The total length of the sentence was therefore DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL .
