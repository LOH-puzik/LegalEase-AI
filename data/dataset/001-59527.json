In DATE the applicant , together with CARDINAL associates , started a business involving lactic cultures , purportedly for use in the cosmetic industry . It consisted of CARDINAL limited liability companies , founded respectively in DATE and DATE and named GPE PERSON ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) and GPE A / S ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) . According to the NORP ORG findings in the proceedings referred to below , the business was a fraudulent pyramid scheme by which GPE purchased from a producer in GPE freeze - dried concentrates of lactic acid bacteria at MONEY ( ORG ) per bag ( containing CARDINAL grams ) , resold them to ORG at ORG CARDINAL per bag , which again sold them at the price of ORG CARDINAL per bag to cultivators whom it had recruited , and after DATE bought the cultivated products back at the price of ORG CARDINAL . The number of producers increased from CARDINAL at DATE to CARDINAL at DATE . Payments were made to a company in GPE . No goods containing the cultivated substances were ever marketed or produced . As of DATE , the companies stopped bookkeeping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Consumer Ombudsman ( Forbrukerombudet ) filed a complaint with the Director ORG ( Riksadvokaten ) against GPE and GPE for defrauding CARDINAL persons who had invested in products from GPE . The companies went into bankruptcy in DATE . DATE the police received CARDINAL complaints from cultivators in various parts of GPE . Further complaints were made in DATE and DATE respectively by a major bank and the tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police interviewed the applicant as a witness , because of his role in the companies . On DATE the police carried out searches of premises and confiscations . Such measures , including interviews of the persons involved , continued in DATE . On DATE the applicant was arrested but then released on certain conditions . He then moved to GPE and , by a letter of DATE , his lawyer informed the police of his NORP address and his preparedness to go to GPE to meet police investigators if necessary .", "Throughout DATE investigations were conducted in GPE , GPE and GPE concerning the ORG business connections and investments . In DATE the police held meetings with NORP and NORP police authorities . In DATE and DATE the police interviewed CARDINAL cultivators .", "On DATE ORG ( skifteretten ) received the final report from the administrators of the estates of GPE and GPE . On CARDINAL DATE , the police received the tax authorities\u2019 report on the tax and value - added tax ( \u201c VAT \u201d ) offences .", "CARDINAL .

Following the issuing of indictments in DATE , the case was submitted to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed DATE for opening the trial hearing , rather than the earlier date of CARDINAL DATE , to which objection had been made by defence counsel , whilst accepted by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . In the final indictments issued on DATE , the applicant was charged with the offences of serious fraud in relation to amounts totalling approximately NOK CARDINAL ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) , unlawfully drawing up cheques \u2013 in amounts totalling almost ORG DATE on behalf of an insolvent company ( Articles CARDINAL and FAC of LAW ) , and having disregarded statutory obligations relating to bookkeeping and the provision of information to the authorities relevant to GPE payments , with the resultant evasion of approximately ORG CARDINAL ( Article CARDINAL of LAW and LAW of LAW DATE merverdiavgiftsloven ) .", "After holding a hearing over DATE in DATE and DATE , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of all but the NORP charges , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "As regards sentencing , ORG noted from the outset that the offences for which the applicant was convicted were punishable by DATE imprisonment . It further stated that general considerations of crime prevention suggested that economic offences of the kind at issue warranted a severe penalty . As it appears from its reasoning , ORG found the GPE conduct particularly reprehensible and emphasised that the suffering which they had caused to innocent cultivators must be viewed as an aggravating factor in sentencing . ORG then went on to consider the question of mitigation , having regard to the following CARDINAL factors :", "\u201c With the exception of GPE , the accused were of a young age at the time of the commission of the proscribed conduct . ... There were thus important DATE for settling down which elapsed between the criminal acts and judgment in the case .", "Furthermore , the ORG attaches some weight , albeit not a great deal , to the fact that the offences were committed at a time when banks were somewhat uncritical about giving loans . ... In the court \u2019s view , had greater caution been displayed , the pyramid scheme would have been revealed earlier .", "Finally the court attaches weight , to a not insignificant degree , to the fact that a long time has elapsed since the acts were committed . The prosecution transmitted the case to ORG in DATE and final investigations concerning CARDINAL aspect of the case as important as the value of the cultivators and their possible use went on DATE . Although it is correct that PERSON stayed abroad over long periods , the court could not see how this could justify the delays in the investigations . It is understood that the delays in the investigation were caused by a change of investigators in the case .", "Notwithstanding that weight must be given to the long time that has elapsed since the acts were committed , the court finds that the sentencing must be severe . \u201d", "CARDINAL other co - defendants , including Mr D.R. , who were considered to have played a more prominent role in the proscribed activity , were sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought to appeal to ORG , alleging a procedural error in the first instance proceedings and requesting a new trial . On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) admitted the appeal in as far as it concerned the procedural matter .", "In the proceedings before ORG the applicant in addition asked for a reduction in sentence . After taking evidence on DATE and holding a hearing on DATE , ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . As regards sentencing , it recalled that ORG had taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance the long time which had elapsed since the incriminated conduct . ORG held that , although more time had elapsed since ORG judgment , it saw no reason for reducing the sentence .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure ( Act of CARDINAL DATE No . CARDINAL ) , LAW , contains the following provisions :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The purpose of the investigation is to obtain the necessary information for deciding whether an indictment should be preferred , and to serve as preparation for the trial of the case . ...", "If a specific person is under suspicion , the investigation shall seek to clarify both the evidence against him and the evidence in his favour .", "The investigation shall be carried out as rapidly as possible and in such a way that no one is unnecessarily exposed to suspicion or inconvenience . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The question of preferring an indictment shall be decided as soon as the case is sufficiently prepared for this purpose . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
