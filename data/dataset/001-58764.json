In DATE the applicant was assigned by his employer to work as a bus driver for a school in GPE that numbered disabled children among its pupils ; his job consisted of picking the disabled children up from home in the morning to take them to school and driving them home in the afternoon . He was always accompanied by a social worker .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother of NORP , a mentally disabled girl born in DATE who attended the school , requested the help of a social worker , PERSON , as she suspected that NORP had been raped or sodomised at school by a person named \u201c PERSON \u201d . Since DATE NORP had refused to go back to school . On DATE her mother , accompanied by PERSON , took NORP to see a gynaecologist . The gynaecologist did not examine NORP but , on learning from her mother what had happened , advised that she be examined by a doctor from ORG . On DATE , therefore , NORP underwent a medical examination ; however , the doctor found no traces , recent or old , of rape or sodomy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE R. 's mother also requested the headteacher of the school to ask an employee called \u201c PERSON \u201d for an explanation , but the headteacher refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother lodged a criminal complaint against \u201c a person named PERSON \u201d . She informed the GPE police that DATE earlier she had noticed that her daughter seemed to be in pain and kept going to the toilet . PERSON 's explanation had been : \u201c PERSON did it \u201d ( \u201c \u00c8 stato PERSON \u201d ) . DATE , the mother had learned from a friend of hers , GPE , that DATE she had been told by NORP that a certain PERSON had forced her to have anal intercourse in the school lavatory .", "CARDINAL . The police interrogated NORP in her mother 's presence . The girl said that DATE , while she was in the school lavatory on the second floor , \u201c PERSON \u201d had told her to lie down on a small bed and had had anal intercourse with her .", "CARDINAL . The police then interrogated GPE , who declared that DATE she had been in the mother 's flat and had noticed that NORP was very quiet . After some initial hesitation , NORP had confessed to her in the presence of her sister , PERSON , and of another friend , GPE , that \u201c PERSON \u201d had indecently assaulted her , causing her pain ; he had also threatened her .", "CARDINAL . The police then questioned the manager of the company in charge of organising the school bus service . He identified the applicant as the relevant driver .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant with the GPE public prosecutor . A preliminary investigation was started .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor summonsed PERSON , her mother , GPE and PERSON , to appear before her on CARDINAL DATE to give witness statements . PERSON 's mother stated that the reason she had not reported the rape to the authorities until DATE was that her daughter had spoken to a friend of hers and not to her directly , and her own father had died during that period . She said , however , that she had noted that her daughter was in pain and had given her some painkillers . She said that her daughter had refused to return to school after the rape and that she had not sent her back to school . She added , however , that for DATE after the rape , her daughter \u201c would return home and , without saying a word or having anything to eat , go straight to bed \u201d . She said that she had not seen \u201c PERSON \u201d after DATE because he had immediately asked to be replaced by another driver . She added that she herself had seen a bed in the school lavatory on the second floor .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant received judicial notification ( comunicazione giudiziaria ) of the allegation that he had committed an \u201c offence under LAW in that he forced NORP , who [ was ] mentally disabled , to have sexual intercourse with him in GPE , in DATE \u201d ( \u201c del reato di cui all'articolo CARDINAL c.p . per aver costretto PERSON di mente a congiungersi carnalmente con lui . In GPE , nel DATE \u201d ) . On DATE the applicant appointed his defence lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor summonsed the headteacher to appear on DATE for questioning as a witness . The headteacher acknowledged that the victim 's mother had reported the rape to her , but argued that she did not believe the allegation to be plausible , as there were no beds in the lavatory and all children were accompanied when they went to the toilet or to the therapy rooms on the third floor ( where there were beds ) . She added that the applicant did not normally enter the school and would have had no reason for being on the third floor . He had been assigned to a new post in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed by the Latina public prosecutor in his counsel 's presence . He claimed that he was innocent . He underlined that there had always been CARDINAL people on the bus , and that he had always met NORP in the social worker 's presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was committed for trial before ORG .

On DATE the applicant 's counsel requested access to the prosecution file .", "CARDINAL . Following a request made by the applicant on DATE , ORG fixed the first hearing in the case for DATE . At the hearing the applicant protested his innocence , and repeated that he had never been alone with NORP because there had always been CARDINAL people on the bus , including the social worker . He explained that , as the bus driver , his duties ended when he arrived at the school . He would then return to the school at TIME to pick the children up and drive them home . He said he was aware of what had been said in the criminal complaint but argued that he never entered the school as it was prohibited . He added that after taking the children to school in the morning he did other work for his employer , which would usually be to drive tourists around .", "CARDINAL . R. was unable to give evidence at first , as she appeared very disturbed and said she could not remember anything . However , she identified the applicant as the bus driver .", "CARDINAL . R. 's mother was questioned . She said that she did not know the exact date of the events , and added that she had not reported the rape immediately because of her father 's death during that same period . She said that she knew that the rape had taken place on the third floor , in the therapy room where there were beds . Replying to a question from the applicant 's lawyer , she said that , so far as she was aware , the children were accompanied when they went to the therapy rooms on the third floor .", "CARDINAL . C.T. , the social worker , was also questioned . She said that in TIME of CARDINAL DATE NORP 's mother had come to see her and had told her that NORP had returned from school upset and bleeding . GPE . had told her to come back the following day with NORP The DATE , she had taken NORP to the gynaecologist , who had not examined her but , on learning from NORP 's mother what had happened , had advised that NORP should be examined by a doctor from ORG . On DATE , therefore , PERSON had accompanied NORP to another doctor , who had examined her and issued a certificate ; the doctor had advised her to inform the police . PERSON said that NORP had referred to the rapist as \u201c LOC \u201d or \u201c the school bus driver \u201d . She said that NORP had told her that she had left her classroom to go to another classroom and had been grabbed by \u201c LOC \u201d in the corridor . He had pushed her into a room where there was a bed or table and had attempted to have anal intercourse . NORP had felt severe pain and had cried out for help but nobody had heard her . \u201c GPE had threatened to kill her if she said anything about what had happened .", "CARDINAL . The next witness was GPE She repeated what she had told the police , and explained that PERSON had told her that the rape had been committed on the third floor , on DATE , but had not said at what time .", "CARDINAL . N.D. , the headteacher of the school , said in evidence that NORP 's classroom was on the first floor . The bus drivers did not enter the school as they were forbidden to do so by school regulations , although the applicant had sometimes gone to her office to use the telephone . CARDINAL caretakers supervised access to the classroom area . She added that children were accompanied to the therapy rooms on the third floor by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL assistants . The applicant had worked for the school until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , NORP gave her evidence with the help of the social worker . She said that she had gone to the bathroom to wash her hands and on her way back to her classroom had been caught by the applicant . This had happened on the same floor as her classroom ; she had not gone to the upper floors . It had been in TIME . NORP added that she could not remember whether she had returned to her classroom and could not recall which teacher was present DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE , in order to hear the evidence of CARDINAL school caretakers to whom the headteacher had referred and of the teacher who had been at the school on DATE . It also ordered production of the school register .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the caretakers were heard . ORG , the caretaker in the girls ' section of the school , said that she remained in the corridors during lessons , as teachers would call her if a child had to leave the classroom for any reason , for example to go to the toilet . She said that children were accompanied to and from the therapy rooms by an assistant . She remembered seeing the bus drivers go to the headteacher 's office on occasions , but they never entered the corridors , where there was a sign warning that access was prohibited . The caretakers stood by a table in front of the headteacher 's office at the entrance to the corridors that led to the classrooms , so that they could control access . NORP added that there was a separate entrance to the third floor from the school clinic , but it was locked and was only opened at the request of the school administrators ; she excluded any possibility of complicity between the bus drivers and the administrators . She said that she had never seen the bus drivers go to the upper floors by the internal stairs , which were in front of the caretakers ' table , and that she did not recall having seen NORP return to her classroom crying or looking upset .", "CARDINAL . V.C. , the other caretaker , said that he had never seen the bus drivers enter the corridors , as they had no right of access ; they would wait outside the school until TIME , when they would drive the children home . There had been occasions when he had been sent by the headteacher to fetch CARDINAL or other of the drivers to answer phone calls from their employer .", "CARDINAL . The court noted from the school register that NORP had been absent from the school since CARDINAL DATE ; on DATE she had left the school .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , PERSON 's teacher , informed the court in evidence that she vaguely remembered NORP She said that she had never been told officially why she had stopped attending the school , but had heard rumours . She stated that she had never seen the bus drivers in the corridors . When a pupil needed to leave the classroom to go to the toilet , she would call the caretaker who would accompany the pupil there and back . When disabled pupils had to attend therapy , they would be accompanied by the assistants .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of rape and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It also barred him from employment in public service for DATE . On DATE the applicant gave notice of appeal against the judgment . The judgment was filed with the registry on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment the court underlined that , although NORP was mentally disabled and therefore seemed not fully to comprehend her own evidence , she had been precise and detailed enough to be credible and felt no hatred towards the applicant or rancour against him . As to the lack of medical evidence of the rape , the court considered that , since NORP had not been examined until DATE after the rape , the lesions had already healed and MONEY remained . The court held that the witnesses who had testified against the applicant , particularly GPE and PERSON , were fully credible and felt no resentment against him . As for the time of the rape , the court held that it had been committed on DATE NORP had spoken to GPE , namely DATE before DATE and immediately before DATE , the date NORP had stopped attending school , presumably as a consequence of the rape itself .", "CARDINAL . Having established that there had been a rape , the court considered it proved that the guilty party was the applicant . NORP had identified him , and it was common for persons named \u201c LOC \u201d to be referred to as \u201c PERSON \u201d . The court found that the applicant had had access to the school , despite the headteacher 's and the caretakers ' statements to the contrary : they had contradicted themselves on a number of issues and their evidence was not credible in that they appeared to have an interest in protecting the school 's reputation . It was reasonable to assume that the employer had contacts through its drivers with the school administrators , who worked in an office on the third floor . It was plausible that the applicant had in fact committed the crime , and the exact place the rape had been committed \u2013 that is to say the precise floor \u2013 was immaterial , once it had been established that ( a ) it had been committed inside the building and ( b ) the applicant had access to the building . As to the fact that the applicant had stated that he used to leave the school after taking the pupils in TIME and returned in TIME , CARDINAL of the caretakers had on the contrary stated that the bus drivers remained outside the school . The court further found that , while it was true that certain severely disabled pupils were accompanied by either a caretaker or an assistant when they left the school , there must have been frequent occasions when NORP was allowed to go unaccompanied , as she was able to walk and could move around unassisted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed the grounds for the appeal with ORG . He argued that the particulars of the offence charged had been too vague to allow him to defend himself , there being no exact indication of the place and time of the rape , and those issues had not been elucidated during the trial . He therefore claimed that the proceedings were null and void , on the ground that his defence rights had been violated . The applicant also emphasised that the witnesses had admitted that NORP was in love with him , and the fact that that love was unreciprocated could in his opinion explain a feeling of rancour on her part . He also requested that the evidence of a witness on his behalf , namely his employer at the time of the rape , be heard so that further details about his duties as the school bus driver could be obtained .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , filed with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . After re - examining the evidence gathered at the trial and considering it unnecessary to examine the applicant 's employer , ORG came to the conclusion that the applicant was guilty . As to the alleged vagueness of the charge , the court considered that the fact that it was impossible to specify the exact time and place of the rape did not render the charge itself null and void , as the particulars ( it alleged that the rape had taken place in the school in DATE ) it contained were sufficient to allow the defence to prepare its case .", "ORG found , in particular , that the assertion \u2013 favourable to the applicant \u2013 that disabled children were always accompanied to the toilet and the therapy rooms was general and could not counter the precise description of the facts by NORP As to the absence of beds in the lavatories , it considered that , given that there were beds on other floors in the school , the possibility that NORP , who trusted the applicant , had followed him to other rooms on the school premises could not be excluded . It further held , like the court of first instance , that it was unnecessary to establish where exactly on the school premises the rape had been committed . As to the absence of rancour towards the applicant , it considered that the fact that NORP was probably in love with the applicant was irrelevant . Indeed , that circumstance could explain why PERSON had followed the applicant to an isolated part of the building . As to the date of the rape , ORG considered that the evidence proved that it had been committed on or DATE , before NORP stopped attending the school . PERSON , who said that the rape had been committed on DATE , had probably got the date of the rape confused with the date of the medical examination . The fact that there had been no trace of any lesions was due , in its opinion , to the time that had elapsed between the rape and the medical examination and was not sufficient to exclude the possibility that there had been a rape \u201c given that NORP had cried out \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was notified that the text of the judgment had been deposited on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He reiterated , in particular , that the charge was too vague to allow him to defend himself and claimed that ORG had not given any grounds for considering that there was sufficient evidence against him to convict . On the contrary , the evidence was hearsay , weak and uncorroborated . The courts below had assumed that the witnesses who had given evidence in his favour were biased , but there was no concrete ground for that assumption and indeed they had confirmed the applicant 's statements . ORG had not believed the evidence that all the children were accompanied to the toilets , but there was nothing to indicate that that evidence , confirmed by all the witnesses whose testimony was favourable to the applicant and even by NORP , was untrue . Nor was it irrelevant to know where the rape had been committed : in the second - floor lavatories , as stated by the victim and the witnesses , on the ground floor where there were no beds , or in the therapy rooms on the third floor . The applicant considered that the courts below had not examined the contradictions in NORP 's statements carefully . As to the date of the rape , the applicant argued that the witnesses had consistently indicated that it had been committed on DATE and not , as held by the courts below , on DATE . Indeed , the rape had been committed , if at all , on DATE by which time NORP had already stopped attending the school and the applicant could not be a legitimate suspect . NORP had probably accused him because she was in love with him and had been rejected ; the courts below had unjustly refused to take that factor into consideration . The applicant finally complained that no reasons had been given for refusing to examine another witness on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was filed with the registry on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal as it was manifestly ill - founded and had been lodged by a lawyer who had no rights of audience before ORG . ORG , stressing that its role was not to review the merits of the decision taken by the courts below , held , in particular , that the charge brought against the applicant was not vague , as it contained all the details that were necessary for the applicant to defend himself . It considered that the lack of details regarding exactly when and where the rape had been committed was a consequence of the initial imprecision of the charge ( originaria imprecisione dell'accusa ) that had been caused by NORP 's mental disability . ORG found , however , that that initial imprecision had been remedied in the course of the trial through further evidence in the form of the statements of the CARDINAL main prosecution witnesses . As to the date of the rape , it was logical to deduce that it was immediately prior to NORP 's refusal to go to school . PERSON had made a justifiable mistake , and NORP 's mother was credible and ought to be believed .", "CARDINAL . As to the refusal to hear the evidence of a witness on appeal , ORG found that ORG had implicitly given reasons therefor , namely that the evidence already gathered before ORG was sufficient .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his sentence in Latina Prison . On DATE he was released and remained on probation ( affidamento in prova al servizio sociale ) until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the former Code of Criminal Procedure provided :", "\u201c Upon taking the first step in an investigation , the investigating judge shall give everyone who might have an interest as a private party judicial notification [ comunicazione giudiziaria ] stating the legal provisions alleged to have been breached and DATE of the offence of which they are accused , and informing them that they may appoint defence counsel . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL bis provided that the defence lawyer was entitled to be present when the accused was interrogated by the public prosecutor or by the judge , and also during appointments with expert witnesses and searches of residential LOC and at identification parades .", "CARDINAL .
