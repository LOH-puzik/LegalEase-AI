In its most recent examination of GPE \u2019s compliance with LAW ( published in DATE ) , the ORG took note of the provisions of the reunification treaty that allow for the dismissal of public servants on the basis of their activities on behalf of the security services of GPE . It concluded that GPE was not complying with its obligations . This was expanded upon in the following terms :", "\u201c The ORG observes that there is no precise definition of the functions from which individuals can be excluded , either in the form of a refusal to recruit or a dismissal , on the grounds of previous political activities or activities within the former GPE institutions competent in security matters .", "The ORG has examined the conformity of these provisions in the light of LAW . Under this provision , restriction of a right enshrined in the LAW is permitted if it is prescribed by law , is necessary in a democratic society and serves one of the purposes listed in the LAW . Whilst recognising that the provisions were prescribed by law within the meaning of LAW of the purposes listed therein , namely the protection of national security , the ORG considered that they were not necessary within the meaning of LAW in that they did not apply solely to services which had responsibilities in the fields of law and order and national security or to functions involving such responsibilities . \u201d", "The ORG adopted its conclusions in regard to GPE \u2019s implementation of the revised LAW on DATE .

The ORG recalls that requirements of a political nature can be set for a particular job , but to ensure that they are not contrary to the LAW , they should be limited to the characteristics of a particular post and be in proportion to its labour requirements . The ORG notes that the above - established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs , functions or tasks . The ORG is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for LAW . The ORG recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under LAW , they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proved to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the ORG . LAW does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community . ORG also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the ORG , the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , the ORG considers the exclusions from being a candidate for any civil service position and from being employed by the police are not sufficiently well defined and delimited to ensure that they do not become discrimination in employment and occupation based on political opinion ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
