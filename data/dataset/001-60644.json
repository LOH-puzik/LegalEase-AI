The applicants are fishermen operating in the coastal region of LOC on the basis of leases contracted with the ORG in DATE and renewed in DATE ( for a further period ending in DATE ) as well as in DATE ( for the period DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW ( kalastuslaki , lag om fiske CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG may restrict fishing , inter alia , if this is deemed necessary in order to safeguard future fish stocks . Since DATE the ORG has imposed such restrictions by issuing decrees . The restrictions have varied to some degree as regards their timing , territorial scope , the fish species in question and the prohibited fishing gear . The restrictions may also extend to private waters .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON and others challenged the lawfulness of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE Decree \u201d ) , whereby fishing with certain gear had been prohibited , inter alia , in waters leased by him . In its judgment of DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) declined to examine the merits of the appeal , considering that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appellants ' demands that the decree be revoked and the implementation thereof stayed .", "CARDINAL . By Decree no . DATE , which entered into force on DATE ( \u201c the DATE Decree \u201d ) , the Ministry prohibited salmon fishing with certain gear during certain periods in the main basin of LOC , in LOC and in LOC . The restrictions concerned the fishing of salmon between certain latitudes in the open sea and in coastal waters as well as in certain rivers and their estuaries , and extended to the fishing waters which the applicants were leasing from the ORG . The decree was later repealed and replaced by Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE Decree \u201d ) . The date of entry into force of the last - mentioned decree ( DATE ) was specified by Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In so far as the restriction concerned the applicants , it was maintained on substantially similar terms by Decree no . DATE , which entered into force on DATE ( \u201c the DATE Decree \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a petition lodged by the applicants and others , ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) found no indication that ORG had , in restricting the salmon fishing in certain waters , acted contrary to , inter alia , ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or otherwise incorrectly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and the ORG extended their respective leases up to DATE . In so far as relevant to the present case , the leases referred back to the terms of the DATE leases .", "CARDINAL . In a further decision of CARDINAL DATE , in response to a petition by others , the ORG considered that , in issuing LAW , the Ministry had not exceeded the powers which LAW had conferred upon it . After hearing submissions from the Ministry he concluded that the restrictions set forth in the decree had been justified in order to safeguard the fish stocks . In so far as the petitioners had complained of discriminatory treatment , the ORG noted that the restrictions had differed from area to area in order to take into account the spawning routes of the salmon . He therefore accepted that there had been sufficient justification for the different timing of the prohibition in the respective water areas and for prohibiting different fishing gear in different areas .", "CARDINAL . Having reviewed the territorial scope of the restrictions , the ORG considered , however , that the ORG had not sufficiently taken into account the need for equal treatment of fishermen in different areas . He noted that the decree had been based on a report of ORG on salmon fishing in the open sea which ORG had appointed in DATE ( avomerilohity\u00f6ryhm\u00e4 , havslaxarbetsgruppen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . ORG had found certain fishing restrictions necessary so as to enable the salmon to reach the northernmost rivers and thereby to safeguard the fish stocks . It had been of the further opinion that in order to be non - discriminatory in character the restrictions should apply equally to fishing in the open sea and to coastal fishing ( within village boundaries ) within the whole of the areas located between certain latitudes . The ORG noted that the terms of the decree had differed from the opinion of ORG , without any convincing reasons having been given therefor . The resultant differential treatment , without any generally acceptable grounds , of certain water owners and fishermen who had contracted leases , was therefore in violation of section CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE District for ORG ( maaseutuelinkeinopiiri , landsbygds - n\u00e4ringsdistrikt ) granted PERSON CARDINAL NORP markkas ( FIM ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and Mr PERSON FIM CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation for losses suffered as a result of the fishing prohibition imposed by LAW . Their average salmon catch per year during the periods in DATE when a fishing prohibition had been in force was estimated at QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively , at the price of FIM QUANTITY . The applicants ' average catch of whitefish was estimated at QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively , at the price of FIM CARDINAL per kg . The overall compensation amounts were reduced by PERCENT in order to accommodate the awards within the funds foreseen in the ORG budget . An appeal lay to ORG but the applicants did not avail themselves of that possibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' respective leases were further prolonged until DATE . The leases stipulated , inter alia , that salmon fishing was allowed within the leased areas \u201c in so far as prescribed in the ... decree on salmon fishing or other provisions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ( NORP hallitusmuoto , NORP f\u00f6r GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force up to DATE , everyone was to be equal before the law and his or her property was to be protected ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . A judge or other officer was under an obligation not to apply a provision in a decree which conflicted with constitutional or other laws of ORG ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . The LAW has been incorporated into NORP law by an ORG with the status of ordinary law ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of DATE , anyone who had suffered an infringement of his rights , or damage , through an illegal act or negligence on the part of a civil servant was entitled to demand that the civil servant be convicted and held liable for damages , or to report him for the purpose of having charges brought ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . A similar provision appears in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . LAW ( \u201c Basic rights and liberties \u201d ) of LAW of DATE was amended by PERSON no . PERSON , which entered into force on DATE . The new LAW includes , inter alia , the right to property ( section CARDINAL ; as from DATE section CARDINAL ) and has been incorporated as such into LAW . Under LAW a court of law must give precedence to a provision therein if the application of a provision of ordinary law would be in evident conflict with LAW . If a provision in a decree or any other statute of lower rank than an Act of Parliament is in conflict with the LAW or ordinary law , that provision shall not be applied by a court of law or any other public authority ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( vahingonkorvauslaki , skadest\u00e5ndslag CARDINAL ) proceedings for damages may be initiated against the ORG on the basis of its vicarious liability for mistakes or omissions in the exercise of public authority . The ORG 's vicarious liability comes into play only if the responsible official fails in his or her duty to take a measure or perform a task that could reasonably be required in the light of the nature and purpose of the activity in question ( Chapters CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The claim for damages must be made within DATE from the date when the damage occurred , unless a shorter limitation period applies ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ( vesilaki , vattenlag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the holder of a building permit relating to a water area may , if the construction would clearly damage the fish stocks , be ordered to restock the area and take other necessary measures in order to safeguard the fish stocks in the affected waters ( LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An application concerning a measure alleged to be in violation of LAW whereby it is sought to have such a measure prohibited , the previous conditions re - established or damage compensated may be lodged with the competent water court ( LAW , section DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The general right to fish in public water areas and within the NORP fishing zone does not include the right to fish for salmon and sea trout ( see , for example , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL of LAW ) . According to LAW , provisions restricting fishing with certain gear may be introduced by decree . Restrictions on fishing within or outside the territorial waters of GPE may likewise be imposed by decree for the purpose of fulfilling obligations set in an international agreement binding on GPE , for safeguarding fish stocks or for any other comparable special reason ( section CARDINAL ) . The decrees of DATE which are of relevance to the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were issued on the basis of section CARDINAL . Non - compliance with a fishing restriction may be subject to prosecution ( sections CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The provisions concerning the ORG 's fishing waters and fishing rights can now be found in LAW ( no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Pohjois - Suomen vesioikeus , PERSON vattendomstol ) ordered that certain companies permitted to construct hydroelectric power stations in LOC should DATE restock its estuary with an average of CARDINAL young salmon . This compensation order aimed at safeguarding the future salmon stocks in the waters affected by the construction . ( The LOC flows into LOC at Kemi , not far from ORG . ) ORG decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ( vesiylioikeus , vatten\u00f6verdomstolen ) found that since time immemorial the owners of fishing waters in LOC and its estuary had been engaged in fishing for salmon and sea trout without any ORG interference and with its de facto consent . Compensation for the loss of fishing benefits resulting from permitted construction should therefore be awarded to all individuals who had been engaged in such fishing in the area , provided they had been using legal fishing gear . ORG further found that the ORG too was entitled to compensation for the permanent loss of the use of its limited right in rem in respect of the fishing waters . In addition , compensation was awarded to the ORG for its loss of income from leasing out those waters .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) found in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( no . DATE ) that the damage which a company had caused by setting up timber floating routes in LOC had caused the private owners of water areas to suffer losses which were to be compensated under LAW . The State , which traditionally had the right to fish for salmon in the river , had not used that right for DATE , either by leasing out its waters or in any other way .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) ORG upheld a decision of ORG of DATE which had dismissed various fishery associations ' claim for compensation for the alleged failure to restock the estuary of LOC as ordered on DATE . ORG had found that the defendants had complied with the obligations imposed on them in DATE for the purpose of safeguarding the relevant fish stocks . In such circumstances the defendants could not be held responsible for the reduction in catches for which compensation had been sought .", "CARDINAL . In its precedent CARDINAL:CARDINAL ORG examined an action for damages which a hydroelectric power company had brought against the ORG on the grounds that a contract between the CARDINAL with a view to establishing CARDINAL power plants along LOC could not be implemented in full , as ORG had enacted legislation for the protection of the river ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The company had sought compensation for wasted planning costs in so far as those had exceeded the amount paid out following the assessment procedure provided for in the LAW on ORG and Special Rights ( PERSON ) . ORG declined to examine this part of the claim , as the costs to be compensated had already been finally determined in the procedure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the company had claimed compensation for projected profit and related losses , ORG dismissed the action after having examined its merits . ORG reasoned , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... The contract did not bind the legislative arm . Possible legislative changes and the possibility that no building permit would be granted were specifically taken into account in the contract . The government is therefore under no obligation to compensate the company for the economic losses it suffered on account of the fact that the contract for the construction of the power plant was never implemented . The company is therefore not entitled to any compensation ... other than that stipulated in [ Law no .
