PERSON claimed damages for breach of confidence and compensation under LAW DATE . A claim for aggravated damages was made mainly as regards the article of DATE . On DATE the High Court ( Morland J. ) upheld PERSON claim , following a hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . He described PERSON as an \u201c internationally renowned fashion model and celebrity \u201d . The first issue was whether there had been a breach of confidence and , in that respect , PERSON was required to prove CARDINAL elements .", "The first was that the details divulged by the article about her attendance at ORG meetings had the necessary quality of confidence about them . Information to the effect that her treatment was regular attendance at ORG meetings was clearly confidential : the details were obtained surreptitiously , assisted by covert photography when she was engaged ( deliberately \u201c low key and drably dressed \u201d ) in the private activity of therapy to advance her recovery from drug addiction . Giving details of her therapy , including her regular attendance at ORG , was easily identifiable as private and disclosure of that information would be highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities . There existed a private interest worthy of protection .", "Secondly , it was found that those details were imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence given the sources of the information ( either a fellow sufferer of drug addiction or one of her staff ) .", "Thirdly , and having heard evidence on the subject , she had demonstrated that the publication was to her detriment and , notably , the publication of her treatment with ORG specifically had caused her significant distress and was likely adversely to affect her attendance / participation in therapy meetings .", "CARDINAL . The High Court considered these findings to be in conformity with the judgment of ORG in PERSON ( [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) which had held that there was no watertight division between the concepts of privacy and confidentiality and that the approach to the tort had to be informed by the jurisprudence of LAW . Citing PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) it noted that LAW jurisprudence acknowledged different degrees of privacy : the more intimate the aspect of private life which was being interfered with , the more serious the justification required .", "CARDINAL . ORG adopted the approach of Lord PERSON in A v B plc ( [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as regards , inter alia , the qualification of the right to freedom of expression by the right to respect for private life guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The High Court considered at some length the extent to which PERSON had exposed herself and her private life to the media and , in light of this , how to reconcile the demands of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant had been fully entitled to publish in the public interest the facts of her drug addiction and treatment as PERSON had previously misled the public by denying drug use . \u201c She might have been thought of and indeed she herself seemed to be a self - appointed role model to young black women \u201d . However , ORG had to protect a celebrity from publication of information about her private life which had \u201c the mark and badge of confidentiality \u201d and which she had chosen not to put in the public domain unless , despite that breach of confidentiality and the private nature of the information , publication was justifiable . The balance of LAW rights involved in the present case clearly called for a remedy for PERSON as regards the publication of the private material .", "CARDINAL . The High Court heard evidence from , inter alia , PERSON as to the impact on her of the publication . It concluded :", "\u201c Although I am satisfied that Miss PERSON has established that she has suffered a significant amount of distress and injury to feelings caused specifically by the unjustified revelation of the details of her therapy with GPE , apart from that distress and injury to feelings she also suffered a significant degree of distress and injury to feelings caused by the entirely legitimate publication by the defendants of her drug addiction and the fact of therapy about which she can not complain . In determining the extent of distress and injury to feelings for which she is entitled to compensation , I must consider her evidence with caution . She has shown herself to be over DATE lacking in frankness and veracity with the media and manipulative and selective in what she has chosen to reveal about herself . I am satisfied that she lied on oath [ about certain facts ] . Nevertheless I am satisfied that she genuinely suffered distress and injury to feelings caused by the unjustified publication and disclosure of details of her therapy in the CARDINAL articles of DATE and CARDINALth DATE complained of . I assess damages or compensation in the sum of \u00a3 CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to her claim for aggravated damages ( mainly the article of DATE ) , ORG found that a newspaper faced with litigation was entitled to argue that a claim against it should never have been made and that any complaint should have been made to ORG . Such assertions could even be written in strong and colourful language and it was not for the courts to censor bad taste . However , since the article also \u201c trashed her as a person \u201d in a highly offensive and hurtful manner , this entitled her to aggravated damages in the sum of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Lord PERSON of Worth Matravers MR , PERSON and PERSON ) unanimously allowed the newspaper 's appeal . The hearing had lasted DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that PERSON was an \u201c internationally famous fashion model \u201d who had courted , rather than shunned , publicity in part to promote other ventures in which she was involved . In interviews with the media she had volunteered information about some aspects of her private life and behaviour including limited details about her relationships . She had gone out of her way to aver that , in contrast to many models , she did not take drugs , stimulants or tranquillisers , but this was untrue .", "CARDINAL . As to the impact of LAW DATE ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) on the law of confidentiality , the court observed that it had to balance the rights guaranteed by LAW , noting that freedom of the media was a bastion of any NORP society .", "CARDINAL . As to whether the information disclosed was confidential , ORG did not consider that the information that PERSON was receiving therapy from ORG was to be equated with disclosure of clinical details of medical treatment . Since it was legitimate to publish the fact that she was a drug addict receiving treatment , it was not particularly significant to add that the treatment consisted of ORG meetings which disclosure would not be offensive to a reasonable reader of ordinary sensibilities . While a reader might have found it offensive that obviously covert photographs had been taken of her , that , of itself , had not been relied upon as a ground of complaint . In addition , it was not easy to separate the distress PERSON must have felt at being identified as a drug addict in treatment accompanied by covert photographs from any additional distress resulting from disclosure of her attendance at ORG meetings . In short , it was not obvious that the peripheral disclosure of PERSON attendance at ORG meetings was of sufficient significance as to justify the intervention of the court .", "CARDINAL . Relying on PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALI ) , ORG considered that the photographs were a legitimate , if not an essential , part of the journalistic package designed to demonstrate that PERSON had been deceiving the public when she said that she did not take drugs and , provided that publication of particular confidential information was justifiable in the public interest , the journalist had to be given reasonable latitude as to the manner in which that information was conveyed to the public or his LAW right to freedom of expression would be unnecessarily inhibited . The publication of the photographs added little to PERSON case : they illustrated and drew attention to the information that she was receiving therapy from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing of DATE , on CARDINAL May CARDINAL ORG allowed PERSON appeal ( Lord Hope of PERSON , ORG of GPE and Lord PERSON formed the majority , Lords PERSON of GPE and PERSON dissenting ) and restored the orders made by ORG . They delivered separate and extensive judgments .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope began by noting the powerful international reputation of PERSON in the business of fashion modelling , which business was conducted under the constant gaze of the media . He also noted her \u201c status as a celebrity \u201d . He considered that the issues were essentially questions of \u201c fact and degree \u201d which did not raise any \u201c new issues of principle \u201d . In the present case , where the publication concerned a drug addict requiring treatment and , given the fact that disclosure of details concerning that treatment together with publication of a covertly taken photograph could endanger that treatment , the disclosure was of private information .", "CARDINAL . The case gave rise to a competition between the rights of free speech and privacy which were of equal value in a democratic society . In balancing these rights , Lord Hope noted that the right to privacy , which lay at the heart of an action for breach of confidence , had to be balanced against the right of the media to impart information to the public and that the latter right had , in turn , to be balanced against the respect that must be given to private life . There was nothing new about this in domestic law .", "CARDINAL . He examined in detail the latitude to be accorded to journalists in deciding whether or not to publish information to ensure credibility . He noted the principles set out in this respect in this ORG 's case law ( Observer and ORG v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALI ) .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the balancing exercise in the NORP and PERSON cases , Lord PERSON reiterated there was no doubt that the choices made about the presentation of material that was legitimate to convey to the public was pre - eminently an editorial matter with which the court would not interfere . However , choices to publish private material raised issues that were not simply about presentation and editing . Accordingly , the public interest in disclosure had to be balanced against the right of the individual to respect for their private life : those decisions were open to review by the court . The tests to be applied were familiar and were set down in Convention jurisprudence . The rights guaranteed by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL had to be balanced against each other , any restriction of those rights had to be subjected to very close scrutiny and neither LAW had any pre - eminence over each other ( as confirmed by LAW of ORG of ORG ( \u201c PACE \u201d ) , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the LAW involved , the essential question was whether the means chosen to limit LAW rights were \u201c rational , fair and not arbitrary and impair the right as minimally as is reasonably possible \u201d . In this respect , the relevant factors were , on the one hand , the duty on the press to impart information and ideas of public interest which the public has a right to receive ( NORP v. GPE , cited above ) and the need to leave it to journalists to decide what material had to be reproduced to ensure credibility ( PERSON and PERSON v. GPE cited above ) and , on the other hand , the degree of privacy to which PERSON was entitled as regards the details of her therapy under the law of confidence . However , the right of the public to receive information about the details of her treatment was of a much lower order than its undoubted right to know that she was misleading the public when she said that she did not take drugs since the former concerned an intimate aspect of her private life ( PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . While he acknowledged the great importance of political expression and , indeed , of freedom of expression ( constituting one of the essential foundations of a NORP society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and the self - fulfilment of each individual , Tammer v. GPE , no . PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) , he considered that no political or democratic values were at stake and no pressing social had been identified ( a contrario , PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports DATE II ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the competing LAW , the potential for harm by the disclosure was an important factor in the assessment of the extent of the restriction that was needed to protect PERSON right to privacy . From the point of DATE , publication of details of her treatment ( that she was attending ORG , for how long , how frequently and at what times of DATE , the nature of her therapy , the extent of her commitment to the process and the publication of covertly taken photographs ) had the potential to cause harm to her and Lord Hope attached a good deal of weight to this factor . The fact that she was a \u201c celebrity \u201d was not enough to deprive her of her right to privacy . A margin of appreciation had be accorded to a journalist but viewing details of treatment for drug addiction merely \u201c as background was to undervalue the importance that was to be attached to the need , if PERSON was to be protected , to keep these details private \u201d . It was hard to see any compelling need for the public to know the name of the organisation that she was attending for therapy or the details of that therapy . The decision to publish these details suggested that greater weight was given to the wish to publish a story that would attract interest rather than any wish to maintain its credibility .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope then considered the covert photographs . It was true that , had he to consider the text of the articles only , he would have been \u201c inclined to regard the balance between these rights as about even \u201d , such was the effect of the margin of appreciation that had to be , in a doubtful case , given to a journalist . However , the text could not be separated from the photographs as the captions clearly linked what might otherwise have been anonymous and uninformative pictures to the main text . In addition , the reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities would regard publication of the covertly taken photographs , linked in that way to the text , as adding greatly to the overall intrusion into PERSON private life .", "While photographs taken in a public place had to be considered , in normal circumstances , one of the \u201c ordinary incidents of living in a free community \u201d , the real issue was whether publicising the photographs was offensive in the present circumstances . He reviewed the case - law of the ORG ( including ORG and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ORG and PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG DATE I ) and applied the reasoning in the PERSON case . PERSON could not have complained if the photographs had been taken to show a scene in a street by a passer - by and later published simply as street scenes . However , the photographs invaded PERSON privacy because they were taken deliberately , in secret , with a view to their publication in conjunction with the article and they focussed on the doorway of the building of her ORG meeting and they revealed clearly her face . The argument that the publication of the photograph added credibility to the story had little weight , since the reader only had the editor 's word as to the truth of PERSON attendance at a ORG meeting . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Any person in Miss PERSON 's position , assuming her to be of ordinary sensibilities but assuming also that she had been photographed surreptitiously outside the place where she been receiving therapy for drug addiction , would have known what they were and would have been distressed on seeing the photographs . She would have seen their publication , in conjunction with the article which revealed what she had been doing when she was photographed and other details about her engagement in the therapy , as a gross interference with her right to respect for her private life . In my opinion this additional element in the publication is more than enough to outweigh the right to freedom of expression which the defendants are asserting in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope therefore concluded that , despite the weight that had to be given to the right to freedom of expression that the press needs if it is to play its role effectively , there was an infringement of PERSON privacy which could not be justified .", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON observed that the examination of an action for breach of confidence began from the \u201c reasonable expectation of privacy \u201d test inquiring whether the person publishing the information knew or ought to have known that there was a reasonable expectation that the relevant information would be kept confidential . This was a threshold test which brought the balancing exercise between the rights guaranteed by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention into play . Relying also on the PACE Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) , she noted that neither right took precedence over the other . The application of the proportionality test , included in the structure of ORG CARDINAL , was much less straightforward when CARDINAL Convention rights were in play and , in this respect , she relied on the above - cited cases of GPE v GPE , PERSON and PERSON v GPE and ORG .", "CARDINAL . In striking the balance in this case , she noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Put crudely , it is a prima donna celebrity against a celebrity - exploiting tabloid newspaper . Each in their time has profited from the other . Both are assumed to be grown - ups who know the score . On the one hand is the interest of a woman who wants to give up her dependence on illegal and harmful drugs and wants the peace and space in which to pursue the help which she finds useful . On the other hand is a newspaper which wants to keep its readers informed of the activities of celebrity figures , and to expose their weaknesses , lies , evasions and hypocrisies . This sort of story , especially if it has photographs attached , is just the sort of thing that fills , sells and enhances the reputation of the newspaper which gets it first . CARDINAL reason why press freedom is so important is that we need newspapers to sell in order to ensure that we still have newspapers at all . It may be said that newspapers should be allowed considerable latitude in their intrusions into private grief so that they can maintain circulation and the rest of us can then continue to enjoy the variety of newspapers and other mass media which are available in this country . It may also be said that newspaper editors often have to make their decisions at great speed and in difficult circumstances , so that to expect too minute an analysis of the position is in itself a restriction on their freedom of expression . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , ORG considered it not to be a trivial case and defined the particularly private nature of the information the publication of which PERSON contested . It concerned the important issue of drug abuse and , consequently , her physical and mental health . She underlined the importance of , as well as the sensitivities and difficulties surrounding , treatment for addiction and , notably , of the vital therapy to address an underlying dependence on drugs . Moreover , the ORG 's jurisprudence had always accepted that information about a person 's health and treatment for ill - health was both private and confidential ( Z v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports CARDINALI ) . While the disclosed information may not have been in the same category as clinical medical records , it amounted to the same information which would be recorded by a doctor in such records namely , the presenting problem of addiction to illegal drugs , the diagnosis and the prescription of therapy . ORG therefore began her analysis from the fact - which was common ground - that all information about PERSON addiction and attendance at ORG disclosed in the article was both private and confidential because it related to an important aspect of her physical and mental health and the treatment she was receiving for it . It had also been received from an insider in breach of confidence .", "CARDINAL . As to the nature of the freedom of expression being asserted on the other side , ORG recalled the main forms of expression which she recorded in descending order of importance : political speech ( which included revealing information about public figures , especially those in elective office , which would otherwise be private but was relevant to their participation in public life ) , intellectual and educational expression as well as artistic expression . However , ORG found it difficult to see the contribution made by \u201c pouring over the intimate details of a fashion model 's private life \u201d . It was true that the editor had chosen to run a sympathetic piece , listing PERSON faults and follies and setting them in the context of her addiction and her even more important efforts to overcome addiction and such publications might well have a beneficial educational effect . However , such pieces were normally run with the co - operation of those involved and PERSON had refused to be involved with the story . The editor , nevertheless , considered that he was entitled to reveal this private information without her consent because PERSON had presented herself to the public as someone who was not involved in drugs . ORG questioned why , if a role model presented a stance on drugs beneficial to society , it was so necessary to reveal that she had \u201c feet of clay \u201d . However , she accepted that the possession and use of illegal drugs was a criminal offence and was a matter of serious public concern so that the press had to be free to expose the truth and put the record straight .", "CARDINAL . However , while PERSON previous public denial of drug use might have justified publication of the fact of her drug use and of her treatment for drug addiction , it was not necessary to publish any further information , especially if it might jeopardise her continued treatment . That further information amounted to the disclosure of details of her treatment with ORG and ORG considered that the articles thereby \u201c contributed to the sense of betrayal by someone close to her of which she spoke and which destroyed the value of [ ORG ] as a safe haven for her \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , publishing the photographs contributed both to the revelation and to the harm that it might do . By themselves , the photographs were not objectionable . If the case concerned a photograph of PERSON going about her business in a public street , there could have been no complaint . However , the accompanying text made it plain that these photographs were different in that they showed PERSON outside a ORG meeting in the company of some persons undoubtedly part of the ORG group and they showed the place where the meeting took place , which would have been entirely recognisable to anyone who knew the locality . Photographs by their very nature added to the impact of the words in the articles as well as to the information disclosed . The photographs also added to the potential harm \u201c by making her think that she was being followed or betrayed , and deterring her from going back to the same place again \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , there was no need for the photographs to be included in the articles for the editor to achieve his objective . The editor had accepted that , even without the photographs , it would have been a front page story . He had his basic information and he had his quotes . He could have used other photographs of PERSON to illustrate the articles . While the photographs would have been useful in proving the truth of the story had this been challenged , there was no need to publish them for this purpose as the credibility of the story with the public would stand or fall with the credibility of stories of ORG generally . ORG added , in this context , that whether the articles were sympathetic or not was not relevant since the way an editor \u201c chose to present the information he was entitled to reveal was entirely a matter for him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it was true that the weight to attach to these various considerations was \u201c a matter of fact and degree \u201d . Not every statement about a person 's health would carry the badge of confidentiality : that a public figure had a cold would not cause any harm and private health information could be relevant to the capacity of a public figure to do the job . However , in the present case the health information was not harmless and , indeed , as the trial judge had found , there was a risk that publication would do harm :", "\u201c ... People trying to recover from drug addiction need considerable dedication and commitment , along with constant reinforcement from those around them . That is why organisations like [ ORG ] were set up and why they can do so much good . Blundering in when matters are acknowledged to be at a ' fragile ' stage may do great harm .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge was well placed to assess these matters . ... he was best placed to judge whether the additional information and the photographs had added significantly both to the distress and the potential harm . He accepted her evidence that it had done so . He could also tell how serious an interference with press freedom it would have been to publish the essential parts of the story without the additional material and how difficult a decision this would have been for an editor who had been told that it was a medical matter and that it would be morally wrong to publish it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON agreed with Lord Hope and ORG . It was not in dispute that the information was of a private nature and imparted in confidence to the applicant and that the applicant was justified in publishing the facts of PERSON drug addiction and that she was receiving treatment given her prior public lies about her drug use . He also agreed with Lord Hope as to the balancing of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL rights and , further , that in order to justify limiting the Article CARDINAL right to freedom of expression , the restrictions imposed had to be rational , fair and not arbitrary , and they must impair the right no more than necessary .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the weight to be attributed to different relevant factors , he concluded that the publication of the details of PERSON attendance at therapy by ORG , highlighted by the photographs printed which revealed where the treatment had taken place , constituted a considerable intrusion into her private affairs which was capable of causing and , on her evidence , did in fact cause her , substantial distress . In her evidence , she said that she had not gone back to the particular ORG centre and that she had only attended a few other ORG meetings in the GPE . It was thus clear , that the publication created a risk of causing a significant setback to her recovery .", "CARDINAL . He did not minimise the \u201c the importance of allowing a proper degree of journalistic margin to the press to deal with a legitimate story in its own way , without imposing unnecessary shackles on its freedom to publish detail and photographs which add colour and conviction \u201d , which factors were \u201c part of the legitimate function of a free press \u201d and had to be given proper weight . However , the balance came down in favour of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON began by noting that PERSON was \u201c a celebrated fashion model \u201d , that she was a \u201c household name , nationally and internationally \u201d and that her face was \u201c instantly recognisable \u201d . He noted that the development of the common law ( tort of breach of confidence ) had been in harmony with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention so that the time had come to recognise that the values enshrined in DATE were now part of the cause of action for breach of confidence ( Lord PERSON , A v B plc [ DATE ] CARDINAL , CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . He found that the reference to treatment at ORG meetings was not private information as it did no more than spell out and apply to Ms ORG common knowledge of how ORG meetings were conducted .", "CARDINAL . However , even if PERSON attendance at meetings was considered private , her appeal was still ill - founded since :", "\u201c On the one hand , publication of this information in the unusual circumstances of this case represents , at most , an intrusion into Miss PERSON 's private life to a comparatively minor degree . On the other hand , non - publication of this information would have robbed a legitimate and sympathetic newspaper story of attendant detail which added colour and conviction . This information was published in order to demonstrate Miss PERSON 's commitment to tackling her drug problem . The balance ought not to be held at a point which would preclude , in this case , a degree of journalistic latitude in respect of information published for this purpose .", "It is at this point I respectfully consider [ that ORG ] fell into error . Having held that the details of Miss PERSON 's attendance at [ ORG ] had the necessary quality of confidentiality , the judge seems to have put nothing into the scales under article CARDINAL when striking the balance between articles CARDINAL and DATE . This was a misdirection . The need to be free to disseminate information regarding Miss PERSON 's drug addiction is of a lower order than the need for freedom to disseminate information on some other subjects such as political information . The degree of latitude reasonably to be accorded to journalists is correspondingly reduced , but it is not excluded altogether . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He observed that PERSON repeated public assertions denying her drug addiction rendered legitimate the publication of the facts that she was a drug addict and in treatment had been legitimate . The additional impugned element that she was attending ORG meetings as a form of therapy was of such an unremarkable and consequential nature that its disclosure had also been legitimate . The same applied to information concerning how long PERSON was receiving such treatment given that the frequency and nature of ORG meetings was common knowledge . Hence , the intrusion into PERSON private life was comparatively minor .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , and as to the photographs , Lord PERSON observed that she did not complain about the taking of the photographs nor assert that the taking of the photographs was itself an invasion of privacy , rather that the information conveyed by the photographs was private . However , the particular photographs added nothing of an essentially private nature : they conveyed no private information beyond that discussed in the article and there was nothing undignified about her appearance in them .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON began his judgment by describing PERSON as \u201c a public figure \u201d and , further , a famous fashion model who had lived by publicity . He noted that the judges of ORG were \u201c divided as to the outcome of this appeal \u201d but the difference of opinion related to \u201c a very narrow point \u201d concerning the unusual facts of the case . While it was accepted that the publication of the facts of her addiction and of her treatment was justified as there was sufficient public interest given her previous public denials of drug use , the division of opinion concerned \u201c whether in doing so the newspaper went too far in publishing associated facts about her private life \u201d . He continued :", "\u201c But the importance of this case lies in the statements of general principle on the way in which the law should strike a balance between the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression , on which the ORG is unanimous . The principles are expressed in varying language but speaking for myself I can see no significant differences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . There being no automatic priority between ORG CARDINAL , the question to be addressed was the extent to which it was necessary to qualify one right in order to protect the underlying value protected by the other and the extent of the qualification should be proportionate to the need . The only point of principle arising was , where the essential part of the publication was justified , should the newspaper be held liable whenever the judge considered that it was not necessary to have published some of the personal information or should the newspaper be allowed some margin of choice in the way it chose to present the story ( referring to PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) .", "CARDINAL . In this respect , Lord PERSON considered that it would be :", "\u201c inconsistent with the approach which has been taken by the courts in a number of recent landmark cases for a newspaper to be held strictly liable for exceeding what a judge considers to have been necessary . The practical exigencies of journalism demand that some latitude must be given . Editorial decisions have to be made quickly and with less information than is available to a court which afterwards reviews the matter at leisure . And if any margin is to be allowed , it seems to me strange to hold the ORG liable in damages for a decision which CARDINAL experienced judges in ORG have held to be perfectly justified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Given the relatively anodyne nature of the additional details , the ORG was entitled to a degree of latitude in respect of the way it chose to present its legitimate story .", "CARDINAL . As to the publication of photographs in particular , Lord PERSON observed that the fact that the pictures were taken without PERSON consent did not amount to a wrongful invasion of privacy . Moreover , the pictures did not reveal a situation of humiliation or severe embarrassment ( as in PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) and had not been taken by intrusion into a private place . There was nothing demeaning or embarrassing about the photographs . They added nothing to what was said in the text and carried the message that the ORG 's story was true . Accordingly , the decision to publish the pictures was within the margin of editorial judgment to which the ORG was entitled . Although the trial judge found that the publication was likely to affect her therapy , this had neither been pleaded before nor fully explored by the trial judge .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was allowed , ORG award was restored . PERSON costs ( of the appeals to ORG and to ORG ) were awarded against the applicant , the amount to \u201c be certified by ORG , if not agreed between the parties ... \u201d .", "C. The proceedings concerning legal costs", "CARDINAL . Ms ORG 's solicitors served CARDINAL bills of costs on the applicant in the total sum of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL : GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for ORG ; GBP ORG ; and GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for ORG . The latter figure comprised \u201c base costs \u201d of GBP CARDINAL , success fees of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL as well as GBP CARDINAL disbursements . In the High Court and ORG , PERSON solicitors and counsel had acted under an ordinary retainer . But the appeal to ORG was conducted pursuant to LAW ( \u201c CFA \u201d ) which provided that , if the appeal succeeded , solicitors and counsel should be entitled to base costs as well as success fees amounting to PERCENT and PERCENT of their base costs , respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG seeking a ruling that it should not be liable to pay the success fees as , in the circumstances , such a liability was so disproportionate as to infringe their right to freedom of expression under LAW . The applicant did not seek thereby a declaration of incompatibility but argued that domestic law regulating the recoverability of success fees should be read so as to safeguard its rights under LAW . On DATE this appeal was heard by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON solicitors accepted the applicant 's offers to pay GBP CARDINAL ( ORG costs ) and ORG ( ORG costs ) , both amounts being exclusive of interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was unanimously dismissed . ORG found that the existing ORG regime with recoverable success fees was compatible with the Convention , but they expressed some reservations about the impact of disproportionate costs .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON observed that the deliberate policy of ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was to impose the cost of all ORG litigation upon unsuccessful defendants as a class . Losing defendants were to be required to contribute to the funds which would enable lawyers to take on other cases , which might not be successful , but which would provide access to justice for people who could not otherwise have afforded to sue . Therefore , the policy shifted the burden of funding from the ORG to unsuccessful defendants , which was a rational social and economic policy .", "CARDINAL . While he was concerned about the indirect effect of the threat of a heavy costs liability on the newspapers ' decisions to publish information which ought to be published but which carried a risk of legal action , he considered that a newspaper 's right could be restricted to protect the right of litigants under LAW to access to a court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that recoverable success fees were disproportionate on the basis of CARDINAL flawed arguments . The first was that the success fee was necessarily disproportionate as it was more than ( and up to twice as much as ) the amount which , under the ordinary assessment rules , would be considered reasonable and proportionate . This was a flawed point as it confused CARDINAL different concepts of proportionality . The ORG on costs were concerned with whether expenditure on litigation was proportionate to the amount at stake , the interests of the parties , complexity of the issues and so forth . However , LAW was concerned with whether a rule , which required unsuccessful defendants , not only to pay the reasonable and proportionate costs of their adversary in the litigation , but also to contribute to the funding of other litigation through the payment of success fees , was a proportionate measure , having regard to the effect on LAW . The applicant did not \u201c really deny that in principle it is open to the legislature to choose to fund access to justice in this way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second argument of the applicant was to the effect that it was unnecessary to give PERSON access to a court because she could have afforded to fund her own costs . However , it was desirable to have a general rule to enable the scheme to work in a practical and effective way and that concentration on the individual case and the particularities of PERSON circumstances would undermine that scheme . It was for this reason that the ORG in GPE and Others v GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) considered that ORG was entitled to pursue a social policy of allowing long leaseholders of low - rated houses to acquire their freeholds at concessionary rates , notwithstanding that the scheme also applied to some rich tenants who needed no such assistance . The success fee should not be disallowed simply on the ground that the applicant 's liability would be inconsistent with its rights under LAW . Thus , notwithstanding the need to examine the balance on the facts of the individual case , Lord PERSON considered that the impracticality of requiring a means test and the small number of individuals who could be said to have sufficient resources to provide them with access to legal services entitled ORG to lay down a general rule that CFAs were open to everyone . ORG fees , as such , could not be disallowed simply on the ground that the present applicant 's liability would be inconsistent with its rights under LAW : the scheme was a choice open to the legislature and there was no need for any exclusion of cases such as the present one from the scope of CFAs or to disallow success fees because the existing scheme was compatible .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , Lord PERSON did not wish to leave the case without commenting on other problems which defamation litigation under CFAs was currently causing and which had given rise to concern that freedom of expression might be seriously inhibited . The judgment of PERSON in ORG ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ) highlighted the significant temptation for media defendants to settle cases early for purely commercial reasons , and without regard to the true merits of any pleaded defence . This ' chilling effect ' or ' ransom factor ' inherent in the CFA system was a situation which could not have arisen in the past and was very much a modern development .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered that the \u201c blackmailing effect \u201d of such litigation arose from CARDINAL factors : ( a ) the use of CFAs by impecunious claimants who did not take out insurance to protect themselves from having to pay the winning party 's costs if they lost ; and ( b ) the conduct of the case by the claimant 's solicitors in a way which not only ran up substantial costs but required the defendants to do so as well . Referring to a recent case where this was particularly evident ( ORG [ Practice Note ] [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , he continued :", "\u201c Faced with a free - spending claimant 's solicitor and being at risk not only as to liability but also as to twice the claimant 's costs , the defendant is faced with an arms race which makes it particularly unfair for the claimant afterwards to justify his conduct of the litigation on the ground that the defendant 's own costs were equally high \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON endorsed the solution offered by ORG in the King case ( a \u201c cost - capping \u201d order at an early stage of the action ) . However , that was only a palliative as it did not deal with the problem of a newspaper risking substantial and irrecoverable costs . Smaller publishers might not be able to afford to take a stand and neither capping costs at an early stage nor assessing them later dealt with the threat of having to pay the claimant 's costs at a level which was , by definition , up to twice the amount which would be reasonable and proportionate . While the DCA Consultation Paper ( paragraph CARDINAL below ) discussed the problem , no legislative intervention had been proposed .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON distinguished between personal injury litigation and defamation proceedings . Personal injury litigation comprised a large number of small claims and the liability insurers were able to pass these costs on to their road user customers with their own solvency not being threatened and the liability insurers had considerable negotiating strength to dispute assessments of costs and to hold up the cash flow of the claimants ' solicitors so that both sides therefore had good reasons for seeking a compromise . On the other hand , in defamation cases the reasons for seeking a compromise were much weaker : there was a small number of claims and payment of relatively large sums of costs ; some publishers might be strong enough to absorb or insure against this but it had a serious effect upon their financial position ; and publishers did not have the same negotiating strength as the liability insurers because there were few assessments to be contested and disputing them involved considerable additional costs .", "DATE . While the objective of enabling people of modest means to protect their reputations and privacy from powerful publishers was a good one , Lord PERSON considered that it might be that a legislative solution would be needed for the scheme to comply with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope agreed with Lord PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He underlined the protection to the losing party contained in the ORG and ORG . Reasonableness and proportionality tests were applied separately to base costs and to the percentage uplift for success fees . However , the most relevant question for a court in assessing the reasonableness of the percentage uplift was \u201c the risk that the client might or might not be successful \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL(l)(a ) of ORG ) and that \u201c in evenly balanced cases a success fee of MONEY might well be thought not to be unreasonable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . There remained the question of proportionality . Other than providing that the proportionality of base costs and success fees were to be separately assessed , ORG did not identify any factors that might be relevant . However , it would be wrong to conclude that this was an empty exercise as it was the \u201c ultimate controlling factor \u201d to ensure access to the court by a claimant to argue that her right to privacy under LAW was properly balanced against the losing party 's rights to freedom of speech under LAW . While the losing party would pay the success fee , any reduction in the percentage increase would have to borne by the successful party under the CFA : the interests of both sides had to be weighed up in deciding whether the amount was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON agreed with the opinions of Lord PERSON and Lord Hope . While \u201c there are many who regard the imbalance in the system adopted in GPE and GPE as most unjust \u201d , the regimen of CFAs and recoverable success fees was \u201c legislative policy which the courts must accept \u201d . As to whether recoverable success fees , which undoubtedly constituted a \u201c chill factor \u201d , were compatible with LAW and a proportionate way of dealing with the issue of the funding of such litigation , it was not really in dispute that the legislature could in principle adopt this method of funding access to justice .", "CARDINAL . The present case turned on whether it was still proportionate when the claimant was wealthy and not in need of the support of a ORG . While it was rough justice , the requirement on solicitors to means test clients before concluding a ORG was unworkable . With some regret , the conclusion was clear . While Lord PERSON was \u201c far from convinced about the wisdom or justice of the CFA system \u201d as it was then constituted , \u201c it had to be accepted as legislative policy \u201d . It had not been shown to be incompatible with the LAW and the objections advanced by the applicant could not be sustained .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON agreed with the preceding opinions . ORG also agreed with Lord PERSON . It was , for her , a separate question whether a legislative solution might be needed to comply with LAW this was a complex issue involving a delicate balance between competing rights upon which she preferred to express no opinion .", "CARDINAL . From the date of rejection of this second appeal , the applicant was liable to pay PERCENT interest on the costs payable .", "DATE . On DATE an order for the costs of the second appeal to ORG was made against the applicant . PERSON therefore served an additional bill of costs of ORG . The bill included a success fee of PERCENT ( GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in respect of the solicitors ' base costs , her counsel having not entered into a ORG for this appeal .", "ORG Review by the Judicial Taxing Officers of the costs of the second appeal to ORG", "CARDINAL . The applicant then sought to challenge the proportionality of the costs and success fees claimed in respect of both appeals to ORG . An assessment hearing was fixed for DATE before the Judicial Taxing Officers of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant agreed with PERSON solicitors to pay the sum of GBP CARDINAL in respect of the costs claimed in relation to the first appeal , excluding interest and including the success fee applicable to the first appeal . The applicant considered it was unlikely to do better before ORG , it wished to avoid accruing interest ( PERCENT per day ) and further litigation on costs would lead to further costs and success fees .", "CARDINAL . The hearing on DATE ( before CARDINAL ORG ) therefore concerned the costs of the second appeal only , the Taxing Officers noting that the applicant had settled the costs of the first appeal , it \u201c no doubt recognising the inevitability of the position \u201d . A number of preliminary issues were decided by ORG including the validity of the ORG , the applicable success fee rate and the proportionality of the base costs billed by PERSON representatives ( and on which that success fee would be calculated ) .", "CARDINAL . By judgment dated DATE the ORG found that , in these hard fought proceedings ultimately decided by a split decision of ORG , there was \u201c no doubt \u201d that the success fees ( PERCENT and PERCENT ) claimed in respect of the first appeal to ORG were appropriate having regard to the first and second instance proceedings . Since the second appeal to ORG was part and parcel of the first and was clearly contemplated by the parties when they entered into the ORG , the second appeal was covered by the ORG and thus the same success fee . The effect of this was , of course , that the applicant faced a greatly increased bill of costs : however , the applicant lost this issue in the second appeal to ORG . A success fee of PERCENT for the second appeal to ORG was therefore approved . Relying on Rules CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG as well as paragraph CARDINAL of ORG as well as a necessity test , ORG reduced the TIME rates chargeable by PERSON solicitors and counsel , thereby reducing the base costs and , consequently , the success fee payable by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG arguing that the Taxing Officers judgment was incorrect in so far as those Officers considered that the success fee for the second appeal could not be varied .

Originally the tort of breach of confidence was characterised by reference to an obligation of confidence which arose whenever a person received information he knew or ought to have known was fairly and reasonably confidential . More recently , the tort developed through the case - law so as to extend to situations where information , properly to be regarded as private information , has been misused . In principle , such a claim arises where private information has been wrongfully published and it is now well - recognised that this form of the tort of breach of confidence encapsulates the values enshrined in both ORG CARDINAL of the Convention .

The manner in which the CARDINAL articles operate is entirely different . DATE as to extend the areas in which an action for breach of confidence can provide protection for privacy . It requires a generous approach to the situations in which privacy is to be protected . LAW operates in the opposite direction .

There is a tension between the CARDINAL articles which requires the court to hold the balance between the conflicting interests they are designed to protect . This is not an easy task but it can be achieved by the courts if , when holding the balance , they attach proper weight to the important rights both articles are designed to protect . Each article is qualified expressly in a way which allows the interests under the other article to be taken into account . ...", "CARDINAL ) ... Any interference with the press has to be justified because it inevitably has some effect on the ability of the press to perform its role in society .

The individual , however , should recognise that because of his public position he must expect and accept that his or her actions will be more closely scrutinised by the media . Even trivial facts relating to a public figure can be of great interest to readers and other observers of the media . Conduct which in the case of a private individual would not be the appropriate subject of comment can be the proper subject of comment in the case of a public figure . The public figure may hold a position where higher standards of conduct can be rightly expected by the public . The public figure may be a role model whose conduct could well be emulated by others .

Whether you have courted publicity or not you may be a legitimate subject of public attention .

It can not be just to submit defendants in these cases , where their right to freedom of expression is at stake , to a costs regime where the costs they will have to pay if they lose are neither reasonable nor proportionate and they have no reasonable prospect of recovering their reasonable and proportionate costs if they win .", "If this means , ... , that it will not be open to a ORG - assisted claimant to receive the benefit of an advocate instructed at anything more than a modest fee or to receive the help of a litigation partner in a very expensive firm who is not willing to curtail his fees , then his / her fate will be no different from that of a conventional legally aided litigant in modern times . It is rare DATE for such a litigant to be able to secure the services of leading counsel unless the size of the likely award of compensation justifies such an outlay , and defamation litigation does not open the door to awards on that scale DATE . Similarly , if the introduction of this novel cost - capping regime means that a claimant 's lawyers may be reluctant to accept instructions on a ORG basis unless they assess the chances of success as significantly greater than evens ( so that the size of the success fee will be to that extent reduced ) , this in my judgment will be a small price to pay in contrast to the price that is potentially to be paid if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE a Consultation Paper entitled \u201c Simplifying CFAs \u201d was completed by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d , whose powers were transferred to ORG in DATE ) . The use of CFAs in defamation proceedings emerged as a controversial issue during this consultation . Several national and regional media organisations took the opportunity to raise a number of concerns about the impact of the use of CFAs in defamation proceedings . Media organisations claimed that CFAs inhibited the right to freedom of expression and encouraged unmeritorious claims . Claimants ' lawyers felt that the use of CFAs in defamation proceedings had greatly widened access to justice and placed claimants on an equal footing with their opponents .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the DATE Consultation Paper \u201c Making Simple CFAs a reality \u201d of the ORG , media organisations reiterated the view that CFAs needed to be controlled in defamation proceedings . They stressed that funding these cases by CFAs ( particularly where the claimant had significant personal wealth ) impinged on the media 's right to freedom of expression because the success fee could effectively double a claimant lawyer 's cost . This resulted in the \u201c ransom \u201d or \u201c chilling effect \u201d that forced the media to settle claims they might otherwise fight due to excessive costs . The media also expressed concerns there was no true ATE insurance market ( because the very small number of cases did not ensure a competitive market ) , and about the failure of the costs judges to effectively control CFA costs in defamation proceedings . While the focus of the Consultation Paper had been defamation proceedings , the same problems applied in other publication cases .", "The DATE Paper also noted that claimants ' lawyers , on the other hand , believed that CFAs provided access to justice for all in an area of law where many would otherwise not be able to afford to seek redress . They also made the point that CFAs played an important role in discouraging irresponsible journalism . The sharp decline in the number of claims issued in this area , after the introduction of CFAs in defamation proceedings , indicated that lawyers were being more cautious when advising clients who were considering litigation . They believed that CFAs should not be banned or restricted in this area of law , but that success fees should be PERCENT for cases going to trial and less for cases that settled early .", "The ORG concluded that legislation to restrict the use of success fees in this area ( publication proceedings ) was not planned . The ORG supported the initiative launched by ORG ( \u201c CJC \u201d ) to mediate a general agreement on success fees in this area of law and considered that the existing powers of the courts were sufficient to control costs .", "CARDINAL . The above - cited judgment in King and the DATE consultation prompted media organisations and claimants ' lawyer groups to try to reach an agreement on the way forward . Following the ORG round table hosted by the ORG in DATE , both sides approached the ORG to mediate .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a previous Lord Chancellor spoke about CFAs and costs at a media society event . He called for proper control and proportionality in the costs - risks attached to publication litigation and urged claimant and media lawyers to try to find a solution through discussion .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG considered the role of CFAs in defamation and privacy proceedings as part of its inquiry on the \u201c Compensation Culture \u201d . It felt that courts could address disproportionate costs through appropriate cost control measures such as cost - capping and that it might be appropriate for lawyers to re - assess risk ( and therefore the amount of uplift ) as the case progressed ( staged success fees ) . No concrete action was taken .", "CARDINAL . DATE the ORG hosted a number of forums including representatives from the media , legal profession and insurance . This mediation , having been suspended pending the second appeal in the present case to ORG , concluded with the production of a model agreement ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) which set out a range of solutions including a range of staged success fees .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of ORG agreed with the ORG 's recommendations that LOC model agreement was workable and could help ensure that costs of litigation were proportionate and reasonable . ORG decided to consult on the issue . Through its Consultation Paper of DATE entitled \u201c Conditional fee agreements in defamation proceedings : ORG and After the Event Insurance \u201d , ORG sought views on the implementation of the ORG 's recommendations in publication proceedings and , notably , on a range of fixed staged recoverable success fees and on the recoverability of ATE insurance premiums . A slightly revised scheme was published with responses to the consultation in DATE . Some responses to the consultation supported in principle the introduction of fixed recoverable staged success fees and ATE insurance premiums ; however , there was no consensus on the details of the scheme . The media in particular did not support the scheme and strongly opposed its implementation and called for additional measures to address disproportionate and unreasonable costs in ORG cases . The scheme was not implemented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG published further a ORG on \u201c Controlling costs in defamation proceedings \u201d . The high levels of legal costs in defamation and some other publication related proceedings had been the subject of criticism and debate in the courts and ORG . \u201c Excessive costs may force defendants to settle unmeritorious claims , which in turn threatens a more risk averse approach to reporting and some argue is a risk to freedom of expression \u201d . While the ORG had previously consulted on proposals for a scheme of staged recoverable success fees and after the event insurance ( ATE ) premiums in publication proceedings to reduce unreasonable and disproportionate costs , a number of media organisations suggested additional measures that they considered necessary if costs in this area were to be maintained at reasonable levels . The Consultation Paper therefore sought views on measures to better control costs notably through limiting recoverable TIME rates ; costs - capping ; and requiring the proportionality of total costs to be considered on costs assessments conducted by the court .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question ( no CARDINAL ) of whether the courts should apply the proportionality test to total costs not just base costs , the Consultation Paper noted that the Government considered that \u201c a requirement to consider the proportionality of total costs would be a helpful tool in controlling costs in defamation proceedings \u201d . They would request ORG to consider amendments to the ORG and to the related practice direction .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of the proposals , the Consultation Paper assumed that as a minimum the provisions would be introduced for defamation disputes ( libel and slander ) because it was principally in these cases that the key problems were seen to arise . However , the Paper added that there were other causes of action ( such as breach of privacy ) where \u201c it may be considered they should also apply \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper with the responses and proposals received was published on DATE . ORG , requested to consider a number of measures to control costs in publication proceedings , proposed draft rules concerning , inter alia , additional information and control of ATE insurance . ORG DATE came into force on DATE . The ORG preferred to leave other matters open pending ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON was appointed to conduct a fundamental review of the rules and principles governing the costs of civil litigation and to make recommendations in order to promote access to justice at proportionate cost .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG was published , running to CARDINAL pages plus appendices . In relation to CFAs , it noted that GPE and GPE differed from all other jurisdictions in having success fees payable not by the lawyer 's own client but by the losing party . The benefits of CFAs had been achieved at massive cost especially in cases which were fully contested . That cost was borne by tax payers , insurance premium payers and by those defendants who had the misfortune of being neither insured nor a large , well - resourced organisation .", "CARDINAL . While PERSON concluded that CFAs were not objectionable in themselves , he considered that there were CARDINAL flaws in allowing success fees to be recovered from the losing party :", "\u201c CARDINAL The recoverability regime does not possess either of the CARDINAL crucial features of the legal aid regime which it replaces . In my view these omissions are CARDINAL of its flaws . The third flaw is that the burden placed upon opposing parties is simply too great . The fourth flaw is that it presents an opportunity for some lawyers to make excessive profits . The consequence of these CARDINAL flaws is to generate disproportionate costs .", "( a ) First flaw", "CARDINAL Any person , whether rich or poor and whether human or corporate , is entitled to enter into a ORG and take out ATE insurance . All that such a person needs to do is to find willing solicitors and willing insurers . This gives rise to anomalies and unintended consequences on a grand scale . I will give CARDINAL examples in DATE paragraphs .", "CARDINAL The tree root claims . It is , in my view , absurd that insurance companies can bring claims against local authorities using CFAs ... thereby doubling the costs burden upon council tax payers . The insurance companies can well afford to fund such litigation themselves and should do so .", "CARDINAL Commercial claims . It is also , in my view , absurd that CARDINAL party to commercial litigation can become a \u201c super - claimant \u201d ... and thereby transfer most of the costs burden to the other party . CARDINAL arguments have been pressed upon me by defenders of recoverability in such cases : first , that recoverability enables [ small and medium enterprises ( \u201c SMEs \u201d ) ] to take on larger companies ; secondly that the opposing party can avoid the crushing costs burden by settling early . As to the first argument , the recoverability provisions are of universal application . They are just as likely to be used by a large company against an SME as vice versa . As to the second argument ... some business disputes are evenly balanced . It is perfectly reasonable for the companies on both sides to decide to fight . It is quite wrong for CARDINAL or other party to be pressurised into settling by a gross imbalance in the costs liabilities of the parties . If party A has a CFA ... and party B does not , party A may be litigating at virtually no costs risk , whereas party B may face liability for quadruple costs if it loses .", "CARDINAL Consumer dispute . County court litigation sometimes involves disputes between suppliers of goods and customers or consumers . Where such litigation is above the level of the small claims track , it is not unknown for the supplier to have a ORG and for the individual on the other side not to have a ORG . It all depends upon the terms which each party manages to agree with its own solicitors . In some cases the recoverability regime will give the consumer a \u201c free ride \u201d against the supplier . In other cases it will have precisely the opposite effect . It is perfectly possible for the recoverability regime to give the supplier a free ride and to expose the consumer to a massively increased costs liability .", "CARDINAL first flaw in the recoverability regime is that it is unfocused . There is no eligibility test for entering into a ORG , provided that a willing solicitor can be found .", "( b ) Second flaw", "CARDINAL The second flaw is that the party with a ORG generally has no interest in the level of costs being incurred in his or her name . Whether the case is won or lost , the client will usually pay nothing . If the case is lost , the solicitors waive their costs and pay the disbursements , in so far as not covered by ATE insurance . If the case is won , the lawyers will recover whatever they can from the other side either ( a ) by detailed or summary assessment or ( b ) by negotiation based upon the likely outcome of such an assessment .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL This circumstance means that the client exerts no control ( or , in the case of a no win , low fee agreement , little control ) over costs when they are being incurred . The entire burden falls upon the judge who assesses costs retrospectively at the end of the case , when it is too late to \u201c control \u201d what is spent .", "( c ) Third flaw", "CARDINAL third flaw in the recoverability regime is that the costs burden placed upon opposing parties is excessive and sometimes amounts to a denial of justice . If CARDINAL takes any large block of cases conducted on CFAs , the opposing parties will end up paying more than the total costs of both parties in every case , regardless of the outcome of any particular case .", "CARDINAL If the opposing party contests a case to trial ( possibly quite reasonably ) and then loses , its costs liability becomes grossly disproportionate . Indeed the costs consequences of the recoverability rules can be so extreme as to drive opposing parties to settle at an early stage , despite having good prospects of a successful defence . This effect is sometimes described as \u201c blackmail \u201d , even though the claimant is using the recoverability rules in a perfectly lawful way .", "( d ) Fourth flaw", "CARDINAL If claimant solicitors and counsel are successful in only picking \u201c winners \u201d , they will substantially enlarge their earnings ... As the Senior Costs Judge explained ... it is not possible for costs judges effectively to control success fees retrospectively .", "CARDINAL Of course , not all lawyers are good at picking winners and some suffer losses on that account . Nevertheless , CARDINAL repeated criticism of the recoverability regime which I have heard throughout ORG , is that some claimant lawyers \u201c cherry pick \u201d . In other words they generally conduct winning cases on CFAs , they reject or drop at an early stage less promising cases and thus generate extremely healthy profits . Obviously the financial records of individual solicitors firms and barristers are confidential . Moreover , even if CARDINAL such set of accounts were made public , that would tell us nothing about all the others . Nevertheless , the CARDINAL point that can be made about the ORG regime is that it presents the opportunity to cherry pick . If lawyers succumb to that temptation , they will greatly increase their own earnings and they will do so in a manner which is entirely lawful .", "CARDINAL Having worked in the legal profession for DATE , I have a high regard for my fellow lawyers , both solicitors and counsel . The fact remains , however , that lawyers are human . As Professor PERSON has forcefully pointed out both during ORG and during the present Costs Review , work tends to follow the most remunerative path . In my view , it is a flaw of the recoverability regime that it presents an opportunity to lawyers substantially to increase their earnings by cherry picking . This is a feature which tends to demean the profession in the eyes of the public . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Specifically in relation to defamation and related claims , ORG considered that the present system was \u201c the most bizarre and expensive system that it is possible to devise \u201d for the following CARDINAL reasons :", "\u201c ( i ) Defendants pay a heavy price in order to ensure ( a ) that claimants within the ORG regime are protected against adverse costs liability and ( b ) that defendants can still recover costs if they win .", "( ii ) Despite paying out large ATE insurance premiums in cases which they lose , the defendants ' costs recovery in cases which they win may be only partial . This is because the defendants ' costs recovery will be subject to the policy limits agreed by claimants in those cases .", "( iii ) The present regime of recoverable ATE insurance premiums is indiscriminating . A wealthy celebrity suing a hard pressed regional newspaper publisher is fully entitled to take out ATE insurance , effectively at the expense of the defendant . The present regime provides protection against adverse costs , but it is in no way targeted upon those claimants who need such protection . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to defamation and related proceedings , ORG noted that a principal concern that had been expressed in relation to the costs of defamation proceedings and privacy cases was the widespread use of CFAs with ATE insurance , which could impose a disproportionate costs burden on defendants . He had recommended , for all civil litigation , a return to CFAs whose success fees and ATE premiums were not recoverable from the losing party ( the CARDINAL Act position ) : those arrangements had not suffered from the above flaws but opened up access to justice for many individuals who formerly had no such access .", "If that recommendation were to be adopted , ORG considered that it should go a substantial distance to ensuring that unsuccessful defendants in such proceedings were not faced with a disproportionate costs liability . However , such a measure could also reduce access to justice for claimants of slender means . To overcome this latter potential problem , he recommended complementary measures for defamation and related proceedings including increasing the general level of damages in defamation and breach of privacy proceedings by PERCENT and introducing a regime of qualified CARDINAL way costs shifting , under which the amount of costs that an unsuccessful claimant may be ordered to pay was a reasonable amount , reflective of the means of the parties and their conduct in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its introduction , the ORG noted :", "\u201c Throughout our inquiry we have been mindful of the over - arching concerns about the costs of mounting and defending libel actions , and the ' chilling effect ' this may have on press freedom . The evidence we have heard leaves us in no doubt that there are problems which urgently need to be addressed in order to enable defamation litigation costs to be controlled more effectively . We find the suggestion that the problem confronting defendants , including media defendants , who wish to control their costs can be solved by settling cases more promptly to be an extraordinary one . If a defendant is in the right , he should not be forced into a settlement which entails him sacrificing justice on the grounds of cost .", "All the evidence which we have received points to the fact that the vast majority of cases brought under LAW ( CFA ) are won . We therefore see no justification for lawyers to continue to demand PERCENT success fees which are chargeable to the losing party . We recommend that the recovery of success fees from the losing party should be limited to PERCENT , leaving the balance to be agreed between solicitor and client . We further recommend that the ORG should make After the Event Insurance premiums irrecoverable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards , in particular , costs in defamation litigation , it commented :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We are aware that machinery exists for defendants to protect their position as to costs by making a payment into court . It does not appear to us that this machinery effectively protects a defendant , who genuinely attempts to settle a claim at an early stage , against a determined and deep - pocketed litigant . This is another issue which needs to be addressed by ORG . ...", "CARDINAL . Although some have suggested that CFAs should be means - tested , in practice , given the high costs involved , this would be likely to result in access to justice being limited to the extremely poor and the super rich . The complexities involved also do not lend themselves to a simple or proportionate solution . We therefore do not support the introduction of means - testing CFAs . ...", "CARDINAL . In the matter of success fees , the argument is made that they need to be high to compensate for the risks run by lawyers .... This view is not , however , supported by the data available on the outcomes of cases of this kind . This data suggests that ORG - funded parties win the vast majority of their cases . ...", "CARDINAL . This high success rate is no doubt in part the fruit of careful selection . Indeed common sense and the economic incentives would point to the inevitability of cherry - picking . ...", "CARDINAL . All the evidence we have heard leads us to conclude that costs in ORG cases are too high . We also believe that ORG cases are rarely lost , thereby undermining the reasons for the introduction of the present scheme . However it is vital to the maintenance of press standards that access to justice for those who have been defamed is preserved . We do not agree with ORG that the maximum level of success fees should be capped at PERCENT , nor do we believe that success fees should become wholly irrecoverable from the losing party . However we would support the recoverability of such fees from the losing party being limited to PERCENT of costs leaving the balance to be agreed between solicitor and client . This would address the key issue and seems to us to provide a reasonable balance , protecting access to justice , adequately compensating solicitors for the risks taken , giving claimants and their lawyers , in particular , a strong incentive to control costs and ensuring that costs to a losing party are proportionate . ...", "CARDINAL . ... Just as the press must be accountable for what it writes , lawyers must be accountable for the way in which cases are run , and that includes costs . The current costs system , especially the operation of CFAs , offers little incentive for either lawyers or their clients to control costs , rather the contrary . It also leads to claims being settled where they lack merit . We hope that the combined effect of our recommendations , ORG consultations and the conclusions of Lord Justice PERSON , will provide the impetus for a fairer and more balanced approach to costs in publication proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG launched a further public consultation with the above - noted Paper . It considered only the option of reducing the maximum uplift in defamation cases to PERCENT pending consideration of the other recommendations of ORG ( the reference here to defamation including other publication cases ) . The executive summary of the Consultation Paper reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG has for some time been concerned about the impact of high legal costs in defamation proceedings , particularly the impact of PERCENT success fees , which can double the costs to unsuccessful defendants in cases funded under conditional fee agreements ( CFAs ) .", "CFAs have increased access to justice for claimants in making it more possible to bring cases . However , the experience over DATE suggests that - in defamation proceedings in particular - the balance has swung too far in favour of the interests of claimants , and against the interests of defendants . The current arrangements appear to permit lawyers acting under a ORG to charge a success fee that is out of proportion to the risks involved . Aside from the cost burden this places on the opposing side , this could encourage weaker and more speculative claims to be pursued .", "The Government does not believe that the present maximum success fee in defamation proceedings is justifiable in the public interest . This is particularly the case because the evidence shows that many more defamation claims win than would substantiate such a generous success fee . This view is supported by Sir PERSON 's report ...", "This consultation paper seeks views on a proposal to reduce the maximum success fee which lawyers can currently charge from PERCENT of the base costs . This is an interim measure for dealing with disproportionate costs while the Government considers Sir PERSON 's wider proposals which seek to radically change the existing arrangements for all cases where CFAs are used . The proposal in this consultation paper would help reduce the costs for media defendants further and limit the potential harmful effect very high legal costs appear to have on the publication decisions of the media and others .", "This proposed change is intended to complement changes already introduced on DATE in respect of defamation proceedings which were designed to control the costs of individual cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG Paper of DATE included the responses and its conclusions . It concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG has had particular concerns about the high costs in defamation cases .

Lord Justice PERSON in his report ... recommends the abolition of recoverability of success fees and after the event ( ATE ) insurance premiums across civil litigation . Sir PERSON 's report is substantial with recommendations that are far reaching with potentially widespread impact on many areas . However , it sets out a clear case for CFA reform . Even those respondents who did not support our proposal of reducing defamation success fees to PERCENT agree that the status quo can not be permitted to continue . The main flaw identified by Sir PERSON of the current regime is the costs burden placed upon the opposing side . He also points out that the ORG regime was working satisfactorily before recoverability of success fees and ATE was introduced DATE an assertion that is made by a large number of respondents to the consultation .", "CARDINAL . Previous attempts to control the success fees have proved unfruitful . For example during DATE the ORG published a consultation paper , ORG fee agreements in defamation proceedings : ORG and After ORG , on a scheme of fixed recoverable staged success fees and ATE insurance premiums .
