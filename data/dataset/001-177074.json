The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a classmate of the applicant , Mr T.T. ( hereinafter \u201c T.T. \u201d ) , was stabbed several times in a secondary school playground . The applicant , aged DATE at the material time , was present at the scene . There were no eyewitnesses to the incident .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s version of the events , on the above date and at the material time , she met with ORG in the school playground . They were discussing ORG \u2019s need for a certain sum of money when CARDINAL young men \u2013 strangers to the applicant \u2013 appeared and CARDINAL of them immediately attacked PERSON of the CARDINAL attackers held LOC down on the ground and both men stabbed him several times with CARDINAL different knives . The applicant claimed that ORG had owed them money . CARDINAL witness ( \u201c the witness \u201d ) stated that at the material time she had seen CARDINAL young men fitting the description given by the applicant climb into the school playground swearing and leave after a while .", "CARDINAL . According to the official version of the events based on ORG \u2019s statements , the applicant and ORG met in the school playground following the former \u2019s promise to lend ORG a certain sum of money . In the course of the conversation , ORG kneeled with his back to the applicant . At that moment , the applicant hit him on the head . ORG fell to the ground and the applicant stabbed him with a knife from behind . While ORG remained conscious , the applicant held him down with one hand and continued stabbing him with the other . ORG was facing the ground during the entire incident and could not see whether the applicant was using a knife . ORG managed to escape from the applicant and ran QUANTITY before falling unconscious on the school \u2019s basketball court , where he was eventually found . Later he was transported to a hospital where , after emergency surgery , his life was saved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in view of ORG \u2019s statement given to the investigating authorities . She was subsequently remanded in custody on charges of attempted aggravated murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic expert report of ORG ( \u201c the first ORG report \u201d ) confirmed that multiple wounds had been inflicted upon the victim with \u201c a sharp object , possibly a knife \u201d . A forensic chemical examination report no . PERSON produced by ORG ( \u201c the second ORG report \u201d ) found particles of grey cotton fibre on the applicant \u2019s jacket that by their colour , structure , and type were similar to the grey cotton fibre contained in the textile of the victim \u2019s jacket .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date an initial forensic medical expert report no . DATE by ORG ( \u201c the first ORG report \u201d ) concluded that ORG \u2019s wounds had been inflicted with a sharp object and that taken together , they had been life - threatening . The expert attached particular importance to CARDINAL wounds to the chest which had perforated ORG \u2019s lungs . CARDINAL DATE the same forensic expert carried out an additional examination and issued report no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the second ORG report \u201d ) at the applicant \u2019s request . The second report specified that CARDINAL wounds had perforated ORG \u2019s lungs and re - confirmed that \u201c all the wounds had been inflicted with some sharp object / objects and , taken together , were life - threatening . \u201d Concerning the question of whether the injuries were inflicted on the victim with CARDINAL or several weapons , the ORG expert stated :", "\u201c In order to answer that question it is necessary to convene a panel of forensicmedical experts , and additionally to have the clothes as well as the object / objects possibly used to inflict the injuries presented , if available . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The expert testified during the proceedings before the first - instance court that the discrepancy between the first and the second ORG reports concerning the number of wounds inflicted on the victim had been caused by the poor quality of the photocopied material relied on during the first ORG expert examination . The expert confirmed that the second ORG report was therefore more accurate and CARDINAL , rather than CARDINAL , wounds had perforated ORG \u2019s lungs . The exact figure depicting the total number of wounds was not explicitly specified either by the experts or by the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced her to DATE imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended on probation . Dismissing altogether the applicant \u2019s version of the events and relying on ORG \u2019s statements , the first and second ORG reports , the first and the second ORG reports and other evidence in the case , the court found that the applicant had stabbed T.T. \u201c with a knife . \u201d The knife was never recovered . Amongst certain other items of evidence , ORG also referred , in its judgment , to statements of several witnesses , schoolmates of the applicant , according to which the latter was known for having been carrying a knife with her at school on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating that the victim had been stabbed by CARDINAL young men with CARDINAL knives and that she could not possibly have inflicted the wounds alone . She argued that the witness statement supporting her version of the events had been rejected arbitrarily . During the trial at ORG , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the defence adduced in evidence CARDINAL alternative forensic reports , both issued on DATE , and argued that their results supported the applicant \u2019s version of the events , including the use of CARDINAL knives , and conclusively excluded the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The first report , of a comprehensive alternative forensic expert examination , was prepared by a panel of experts at a private forensic science centre . The descriptive part of the report no . CARDINAL/k , which reflected results of an examination carried out between DATE and DATE ( \u201c the first alternative forensic report \u201d ) , was based on the following material : the judgment of the first - instance court , ORG \u2019s statements , the applicant \u2019s statements , the first ORG report and ORG \u2019s medical file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer presented the panel of experts with the following questions :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

In view of the [ victim \u2019s ] statements and considering the mechanism used to inflict the injuries described in the [ forensic reports ] , how plausible is it that PERSON GPE inflicted them on the [ victim ] by holding his shoulder with one hand while the latter was initially kneeling and then crawling on the ground face - down ?", "CARDINAL . In view of the convicted PERSON statement , how possible is it that the [ victim \u2019s ] injuries described in the [ forensic reports ] , given the mechanism used to inflict them , were inflicted by CARDINAL different persons if CARDINAL of them had been holding [ the victim ] ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . excerpts from the applicant \u2019s criminal case file with the following concluding paragraph :", "\u201c Given that the [ first - instance ] court accepted the [ victim \u2019s ] statements and dismissed the statements given by the convicted PERSON and [ the witness ] , that the statements given by the [ victim ] and the convicted PERSON essentially contradict each other , that there is no eyewitness in the case except for [ the witness ] , as well as the fact that the weapon of the crime is missing , the lawyer commissioned the alternative expert examination to determine the truth regarding the case and in order to receive answers to his questions . \u201d", "This was followed by a more detailed account and an assessment of the matter .", "CARDINAL . After examining all the material at hand , the experts came to the following conclusions in response to the questions posed by the applicant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Before losing consciousness , ORG was able to carry out various active measures ( self - defence , punching , running , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . ... [ considering the nature of the injuries ] ORG would have experienced a sharp , strong pain at the moment of their infliction which would have triggered adequate self - defensive or other movements .", "CARDINAL . Considering the statement given by ORG ... the location of the wounds ... and the anatomical - physiological differences between the sexes ... it is hard to imagine how PERSON GPE could have inflicted the wounds on ORG in the conditions described by the latter .", "CARDINAL . Considering the nature and location of ORG \u2019s wounds , it is entirely possible that they were inflicted in the conditions described by PERSON ( by CARDINAL individuals , CARDINAL holding ORG and both stabbing him with knives ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer commissioned a second forensic expert report from ORG concerning the instrument of the crime and other technical aspects of the incident . The report no . CARDINAL-e-CARDINAL , which reflected results of an examination carried out between DATE and DATE ( \u201c the second alternative forensic report \u201d ) , was based on the following material : the statements of ORG , the statements of the applicant , the first ORG report , the second ORG report , ORG \u2019s medical file and the first - instance court judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyer presented the panel of experts with the following questions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In view of the [ forensic ] expert reports presented , were the injuries to [ the victim \u2019s ] body and [ through his ] clothes inflicted with CARDINAL or several objects ( knives ) ?", "CARDINAL . How possible is it that PERSON inflicted the wounds as described in ORG statement , by holding his shoulder with one hand while he was initially kneeling and then crawling on the ground face - down , in view of the mechanism used to inflict the wounds [ described in the forensic and forensic medical reports ] ?", "CARDINAL . How possible is it that the ... wounds were inflicted by CARDINAL different individuals and accordingly with CARDINAL different knives , in accordance with the statement given by PERSON ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having provided a reconstruction of the incident by means of sketches and having analysed the case materials , the experts reached the following conclusions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The wounds were inflicted on ORG \u2019s body and [ through his ] clothes not with CARDINAL but with CARDINAL sharp objects , possibly knives , of different sizes , CARDINAL and QUANTITY wide [ respectively ] .", "CARDINAL . PERSON could not have inflicted the wounds as described in ORG \u2019s statement , by holding his shoulder with one hand while he was initially kneeling and then crawling on the ground face - down , in view of the mechanism used to inflict the wounds [ described in the forensic and forensic medical reports ] and bearing in mind the limited access to the areas of impact .", "CARDINAL . ... it is possible ... that the ... wounds were inflicted by CARDINAL different individuals ( and accordingly with CARDINAL different knives ) , as described in PERSON statement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction . Concerning the applicant \u2019s argument that the witness statement confirmed her version of the events , the court reasoned that although the witness had stated that she had seen CARDINAL men climb in and out of the school playground , she had also said that that was a common sight at that school . Accordingly , the court found it impossible to establish that those persons had been implicated in ORG \u2019s stabbing .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the CARDINAL alternative forensic reports commissioned by the defence . Regarding the first alternative forensic report , the court stated the following :", "\u201c The court can not accept the findings of the [ first alternative forensic report ] given that it is drafted in violation of a number of procedural norms . In particular , information as to which specific materials were presented [ to the experts ] and relied on when reaching the conclusions is missing ; the research part of the forensic report contains a legal assessment of the [ first - instance court ] judgment and of a number of pieces of evidence , whereas under LAW an expert examination is not to be carried out to determine legal matters . Furthermore , the concluding part of the expert examination [ report ] is presumptive , speculative and based on probability which , in the first place , is beyond the expert \u2019s competence as provided for in Articles CARDINAL [ and ] CARDINAL of LAW , [ and ] no evidentiary value may be attributed to speculative findings , in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) [ of the LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the second alternative forensic report , the court noted the following :", "\u201c The court can not accept the findings of the [ second alternative forensic report ] as they are also speculative . Furthermore , the report relies on the conclusions of the medical and forensic expert examinations [ medical documentation , the PERSON report and the second ORG report ] which themselves do not categorically determine the nature of the object used to inflict the injuries on the victim , and even more so the number [ of such injuries ] . Without referring to a concrete scientific study , the [ report ] analyses and rejects the victim \u2019s statement and relies on the statement of the accused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court also reasoned that the applicant \u2019s argument that CARDINAL unidentified men had beaten the victim while stabbing him was not confirmed in view of the absence of any physical signs of beating in the relevant forensic medical report . In the subsequent part of the judgment ORG referred to the first and the second ORG reports and the second ORG report , among other evidence , while upholding the judgment of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant as inadmissible . Without responding to the applicant \u2019s arguments that the lower ORG dismissal of the alternative forensic reports had been erroneous and arbitrary , and that the main argument of the defence had been left without an appropriate answer , the court reproduced the relevant provision of LAW , holding that \u201c the case [ was ] not important for the development of the law and coherent judicial practice , the [ contested ] decision [ did ] not differ from ORG existing practice in such matters , and the appellate court [ had ] not committed any major procedural flaws during its examination which could have significantly affected its outcome . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , aged DATE at the time , was remanded in custody and placed in a cell together with adult female inmates in FAC no . CARDINAL for Women and Juveniles ( \u201c prison no . CARDINAL \u201d ) . According to the case file , the applicant did not complain about the material conditions of her detention in that cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG issued an order for the creation of a separate section for juvenile female offenders within prison no . CARDINAL , and instructed the relevant authority to separate the inmates accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was moved to the newly created juvenile section of prison no . CARDINAL . She was alone in a cell for DATE and subsequently shared the cell with CARDINAL other juveniles . The applicant complained about the material conditions of detention in that cell during the proceedings concerning the deferral of her sentence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Public Defender of GPE visited the applicant in prison . In letters dated DATE and DATE addressed to the Minister of Corrections and ORG , ORG expressed his concerns about the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention in prison no . CARDINAL . According to him , the cell in which the applicant was detained with CARDINAL other juveniles measured CARDINAL , the water tap was out of order , causing humidity in the cell , and the ventilation did not function properly , which led to an unpleasant odour . According to a press release issued by ORG on DATE , the tap in the applicant \u2019s cell was fixed shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings requesting the deferral of her sentence pending the construction of a separate detention facility for juvenile female offenders . She argued that , in the absence of a separate facility , her detention in the adult prison , even if in a separate section for juveniles , as such amounted to a breach of LAW . She further complained that the cell where she was serving her sentence was too small , the water tap was out of order causing humidity , the ventilation did not function properly , and that she was deprived of the opportunity to have DATE walks , contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the deferral request as manifestly ill - founded . It reasoned that domestic legislation did not provide for deferral of a sentence pending the construction of a separate detention facility for juveniles and that the complaints concerning the alleged violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW had not been substantiated . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as manifestly ill - founded in a final decision . It reasoned that such a deferral was not guaranteed by the domestic legislation . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegation that her rights under LAW had been violated , the court found the complaint unsubstantiated and contrary to the material available before it . It based its finding on the applicant \u2019s own admission before the court that she had been afforded the possibility of unlimited daily walks but sometimes chose not to use her exercise time , as she preferred not to share the space with other inmates , that she was free to take showers even if taking turns with other juvenile inmates , and that she was able to see the psychologist present in the prison without any problems .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she completed her secondary education while in detention , and was admitted to a university after passing the requisite admission exam .", "CARDINAL .
