The LAW of GPE ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the LAW \u201d or \u201c LAW \u201d when it is necessary to distinguish it from ORG ) is an annex to the DATE LAW in GPE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , initialled at GPE on DATE and signed in GPE on DATE . Since it was part of a peace treaty , the LAW was drafted and adopted without the application of procedures which could have provided democratic legitimacy . It constitutes the unique case of a constitution which was never officially published in the official languages of the country concerned but was agreed and published in a foreign language , LANGUAGE . LAW confirmed the continuation of the legal existence of GPE as a ORG , while modifying its internal structure . In accordance with the LAW , GPE consists of CARDINAL Entities : ORG and PERSON . LAW failed to resolve ORG in the GPE area , but the parties agreed to a binding arbitration in this regard ( Article V of FAC to LAW ) . Pursuant to an arbitral award of DATE , PERSON has been created under the exclusive sovereignty of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the Preamble to the LAW , ORG , NORP and NORP are described as \u201c constituent peoples \u201d . At the ORG level , power - sharing arrangements were introduced , making it impossible to adopt decisions against the will of the representatives of any \u201c constituent people \u201d , including a vital interest veto , an Entity veto , a bicameral system ( with ORG composed of CARDINAL Bosniacs and the same number of NORP from ORG and CARDINAL NORP from ORG ) as well as a collective Presidency of CARDINAL members with a PERSON and a NORP from ORG and a NORP from PERSON ( for more details , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

In the former GPE , a person \u2019s ethnic affiliation was decided solely by that person , through a system of self - classification . Thus , no objective criteria , such as knowledge of a certain language or belonging to a specific religion were required . There was also no requirement of acceptance by other members of the ethnic group in question . The LAW contains no provisions regarding the determination of one \u2019s ethnicity : it appears that it was assumed that the traditional self - classification would suffice .", "CARDINAL .

The constitutional arrangements contested in the present case were not included in the Agreed Basic Principles which constituted the basic outline for what the future ORG would contain ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Further Agreed Basic Principles of CARDINAL DATE ) . Reportedly , the international mediators reluctantly accepted these arrangements at a later stage because of strong demands to this effect from some of the parties to the conflict ( see PERSON , Achieving Peace or Protecting Human Rights ? Conflicts between Norms Regarding Ethnic Discrimination in ORG , PERSON , DATE , p. CARDINAL , and O\u2019Brien , ORG in GPE : Durable Cease - Fire , Permanent Negotiation , in NORP and ORG ( eds ) , Peace versus ORG : Negotiating Forward- and ORG , ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Fully aware that these arrangements were most probably conflicting with human rights , the international mediators considered it to be especially important to make the LAW a dynamic instrument and provide for their possible phasing out . LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW was therefore inserted ( see PERSON , cited above , p. CARDINAL ) . It reads as follows :", "\u201c The rights and freedoms set forth in LAW and its Protocols shall apply directly in GPE . These shall have priority over all other law . \u201d", "While ORG , in decisions ORG .

In the latter decision , it examined a discrimination complaint concerning the appellant \u2019s ineligibility to stand for election to the Presidency on the ground of his ethnic origin ( a PERSON from ORG ) and rejected it on the merits . The relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows ( the translation has been provided by ORG ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The appellants argue that their rights have been violated , taking into account the fact that LAW stipulates that the rights and freedoms set forth in LAW and its Protocols shall apply directly in GPE and that they shall have priority over all other law . Therefore , the appellants are of the opinion that the candidacy of ORG for a member of the Presidency of GPE was rejected exclusively based on his national / ethnic origin in which they see a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG which guarantees that the enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination and that no one shall be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground including the national / ethnic origin .", "...", "CARDINAL . There is no dispute that the provision of LAW , as well as the provision of LAW have a restrictive character in a way that they restrict the rights of citizens with respect to the candidacy of ORG and NORP from the territory of ORG and the NORP from the territory of ORG to stand for election as members of the Presidency of GPE . However , the purpose of those provisions is strengthening of the position of constituent peoples in order to secure that the Presidency is composed of the representatives from amongst these CARDINAL constituent peoples . Taking into account the current situation in GPE , the restriction imposed by LAW , which exist with respect to the appellants\u2019 rights in terms of differential treatment of the appellant \u2019s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are NORP and are directly elected from the territory of ORG , is justified at this moment , since there is a reasonable justification for such treatment . Therefore , given the current situation in GPE and GPE and specific nature of its constitutional order as well as bearing in mind the current constitutional and law arrangements , the challenged decisions of ORG and ORG did not violate the appellants\u2019 rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW and Article CARDINAL of LAW since the mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on the law . It means that they serve a legitimate aim , that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants\u2019 rights are proportional to the objectives of general community in terms of preservation of the established peace , continuation of dialogue , and consequently creation of conditions for amending the mentioned provisions of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It is well known that ORG powers are extensive ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL and others , DATE ) . On numerous occasions , he has imposed ordinary legislation and has amended ORG ( the Entity Constitutions , as opposed to LAW , are not part of LAW ) . Whether the High Representative \u2019s powers also cover LAW is , however , less clear . LAW is silent on this matter , but an episode concerning a typing error in LAW would suggest a negative answer . DATE after the entry into force of ORG , some of the international lawyers who had been present during the GPE negotiations realised that a reference in LAW ) was wrong ( the reference to LAW ( a)-(e ) was meant to have been a reference to LAW . In DATE the High Representative , PERSON , wrote a letter to the Secretary of ORG of GPE , Mr PERSON , and proposed to correct the error by invoking PERSON CARDINAL to LAW . Mr PERSON considered that Mr PERSON \u2019s authority under PERSON CARDINAL did not extend to LAW ( see the text of their correspondence in PERSON , cited above , pp . DATE ) . Shortly thereafter , the error was corrected without any formal decision : the High Representative simply informed the Presidency of GPE and published a corrected version of LAW . What is relevant to the present case is that the official position of ORG has ever since been that LAW is beyond their reach . The speech by PERSON , in his capacity as High Representative , to ORG confirms this ( see the ORG from the CARDINALth Plenary Session of ORG , ORG - PV(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of CARDINAL November CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . The relevant part of his speech reads as follows :", "\u201c If GPE wishes to join the [ ORG ] and ORG it will need a fully functioning ORG and nothing less .

On DATE ORG of ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL on \u2018 Strengthening of democratic institutions in GPE and GPE . LAW of the ORG asks ORG to examine several constitutional issues in GPE and GPE .", "...", "CARDINAL . GPE is a country in transition facing severe economic problems and desiring to take part in NORP integration . The country will only be able to cope with the numerous challenges resulting from this situation if there is a strong and effective government . The constitutional rules on the functioning of the State organs are however not designed to produce strong government but to prevent the majority from taking decisions adversely affecting other groups . It is understandable that in a post - conflict situation there was ( and is ) insufficient trust between ethnic groups to allow government on the basis of the majoritarian principle alone . In such a situation specific safeguards have to be found which ensure that all major groups , in GPE the constituent peoples , can accept the constitutional rules and feel protected by them . As a consequence the GPE LAW ensures the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples not only through territorial arrangements reflecting their interests but also through the composition of the State organs and the rules on their functioning . In such a situation , a balance has indeed to be struck between the need to protect the interests of all constituent peoples on the one hand and the need for effective government on the other . However , in the GPE , there are many provisions ensuring the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples , inter alia : the vital interest veto in ORG , the CARDINAL - chamber system and the collective Presidency on an ethnic basis . The combined effect of these provisions makes effective government extremely difficult , if not impossible . Hitherto the system has more or less functioned due to the paramount role of ORG . This role is however not sustainable .", "The vital interest veto", "CARDINAL . The most important mechanism ensuring that no decisions are taken against the interest of any constituent people is the vital interest veto . If the majority of the PERSON , NORP or NORP delegates in ORG declare that a proposed decision of ORG is destructive to a vital interest of their people , the majority of PERSON , NORP and NORP delegates have to vote for the decision for it to be adopted . The majority of delegates from another people may object to the invocation of the clause . In this case a conciliation procedure is foreseen and ultimately a decision is taken by ORG as to the procedural regularity of the invocation . It is noteworthy that the LAW does not define the notion of vital interest veto , contrary to ORG which provide a ( excessively broad ) definition .", "CARDINAL . It is obvious , and was confirmed by many interlocutors , that this procedure entails a serious risk of blocking decision - making . Others argued that this risk should not be overestimated since the procedure has rarely been used and ORG in a decision of DATE started to interpret the notion [ see decision U-CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the vital interest veto against LAW on Higher Education ] . The decision indeed indicates that the ORG does not consider that the vital interest is a purely subjective notion within the discretion of each member of parliament and which would not be subject to review by the ORG . On the contrary , the ORG examined the arguments put forward to justify the use of the vital interest veto , upheld CARDINAL argument and rejected another .", "CARDINAL . The Commission is nevertheless of the opinion that a precise and strict definition of vital interest in the LAW is necessary . The main problem with veto powers is not their use but their preventive effect . Since all politicians involved are fully conscious of the existence of the possibility of a veto , an issue with respect to which a veto can be expected will not even be put to the vote . Due to the existence of the veto , a delegation taking a particularly intransigent position and refusing to compromise is in a strong position . It is true that further case - law from ORG may provide a definition of the vital interest and reduce the risks inherent in the mechanism . This may however take a long time and it also seems inappropriate to leave such a task with major political implications to the ORG alone without providing it with guidance in the text of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under present conditions within GPE , it seems unrealistic to ask for a complete abolition of the vital interest veto . The Commission nevertheless considers that it would be important and urgent to provide a clear definition of the vital interest in the text of the LAW . This definition will have to be agreed by the representatives of the CARDINAL constituent peoples but should not correspond to the present definition in the Entity Constitutions which allows practically anything being defined as vital interest . It should not be excessively broad but focus on rights of particular importance to the respective peoples , mainly in areas such as language , education and culture .", "Entity veto", "CARDINAL . In addition to the vital interest veto , LAW ( d ) of the LAW provides for a veto by CARDINAL of the delegation from either Entity . This veto , which in practice seems potentially relevant only for ORG , appears redundant having regard to the existence of the vital interest veto .", "Bicameral system", "CARDINAL . Article IV of the LAW provides for a bicameral system with ORG and a ORG both having the same powers . Bicameral systems are typical for federal ORG and it is therefore not surprising that the GPE LAW opts for CARDINAL chambers . However , the usual purpose of the second chamber in federal GPE is to ensure a stronger representation of the smaller entities . CARDINAL chamber is composed on the basis of population figures while in the other either all entities have the same number of seats ( GPE , GPE ) or at least smaller entities are overrepresented ( GPE ) . In GPE this is quite different : in both chambers CARDINAL of the members come from GPE , the difference being that in ORG only the Bosniacs and NORP from the Federation and the NORP from ORG are represented . ORG is therefore not a reflection of the federal character of the ORG but an additional mechanism favouring the interests of the constituent peoples . The main function of ORG under the LAW is indeed as the chamber where the vital interest veto is exercised .", "CARDINAL . The drawback of this arrangement is that ORG becomes the chamber where legislative work is done and necessary compromises are made in order to achieve a majority . The role of ORG is only negative as a veto chamber , where members see as their task to exclusively defend the interests of their people without having a stake in the success of the legislative process . It would therefore seem preferable to move the exercise of the vital interest veto to ORG and abolish ORG . This would streamline procedures and facilitate the adoption of legislation without endangering the legitimate interests of any people . It would also solve the problem of the discriminatory composition of ORG .", "The collective Presidency", "CARDINAL . Article V of the LAW provides for a collective Presidency with one PERSON , CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP member and a rotating chair . The Presidency endeavours to take its decisions by consensus ( Article V \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) ) . In case of a decision by a majority , a vital interest veto can be exercised by the member in the minority .", "CARDINAL . A collective Presidency is a highly unusual arrangement . As regards the representational functions of Head of ORG , these are more easily carried out by CARDINAL person . At the top of the executive there is already CARDINAL collegiate body , ORG , and adding a second collegiate body does not seem conducive to effective decision - making . This creates a risk of duplication of decision - making processes and it becomes difficult to distinguish the powers of ORG and of the Presidency . Moreover , the Presidency will either not have the required technical knowledge available within ministries or need substantial staff , creating an additional layer of bureaucracy .", "CARDINAL . A collective Presidency therefore does not appear functional or efficient . Within the context of GPE , its existence seems again motivated by the need to ensure participation by representatives from all constituent peoples in all important decisions . A single President with important powers seems indeed difficult to envisage for GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The best solution therefore would be to concentrate executive power within ORG as a collegiate body in which all constituent peoples are represented . Then a single President as Head of ORG should be acceptable . Having regard to the multi - ethnic character of the country , an indirect election of the President by ORG with a majority ensuring that the President enjoys wide confidence within all peoples would seem preferable to direct elections . Rules on rotation providing that a newly elected President may not belong to the same constituent people as his predecessor may be added .", "...", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the distribution of posts in the State organs between the constituent peoples was a central element of ORG making peace in GPE and GPE possible . In such a context , it is difficult to deny legitimacy to norms that may be problematic from the point of view of non - discrimination but necessary to achieve peace and stability and to avoid further loss of human lives . The inclusion of such rules in the text of the LAW [ of GPE ] at that time therefore does not deserve criticism , even though they run counter to the general thrust of the LAW aiming at preventing discrimination .", "CARDINAL . This justification has to be considered , however , in the light of developments in GPE since the entry into force of the LAW . GPE has become a member of ORG and the country has therefore to be assessed according to the yardstick of common NORP standards . It has now ratified the [ NORP Convention on Human Rights ] and LAW No . CARDINAL [ thereto ] . As set forth above , the situation in GPE has evolved in a positive sense but there remain circumstances requiring a political system that is not a simple reflection of majority rule but which guarantees a distribution of power and positions among ethnic groups . It therefore remains legitimate to try to design electoral rules ensuring appropriate representation for various groups .", "DATE . This can , however , be achieved without entering into conflict with international standards . It is not the system of consensual democracy as such which raises problems but the mixing of territorial and ethnic criteria and the apparent exclusion from certain political rights of those who appear particularly vulnerable . It seems possible to redesign the rules on the Presidency to make them compatible with international standards while maintaining the political balance in the country .", "CARDINAL . A multi - ethnic composition can be ensured in a non - discriminatory way , for example by providing that not CARDINAL member of the Presidency may belong to the same people or the Others and combining this with an electoral system ensuring representation of both Entities . Or , as suggested above , as a more radical solution which would be preferable in the view of the Commission , the collective Presidency could be abolished and replaced by an indirectly elected President with very limited powers .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG is a chamber with full legislative powers . LAW CARDINAL to the [ ORG ] is thereby applicable and any discrimination on ethnic grounds is thereby prohibited by LAW ] . As to a possible justification , the same considerations as with respect to the Presidency apply . While it is a legitimate aim to try to ensure an ethnic balance within ORG in the interest of peace and stability , this can justify ethnic discrimination only if there are no other means to achieve this goal and if the rights of minorities are adequately respected . For ORG it would for example be possible to fix a maximum number of seats to be occupied by representatives from each constituent people . Or , as argued above , a more radical solution which would have the preference of the Commission , could be chosen and ORG simply be abolished and the vital national interest mechanism be exercised within ORG . \u201d", "The Opinion on different proposals for the election of the Presidency of GPE ( LAW of DATE ) , in the relevant part , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the Chairman of the Presidency of GPE , Mr ORG , asked ORG to provide an ORG on CARDINAL different proposals for the election of the Presidency of this country . This request was made in the framework of negotiations on constitutional reform between the main political parties in GPE . The issue of the election of the Presidency remains to be resolved in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive reform package .", "...", "Comments on Proposal I", "CARDINAL . Proposal I would consist of maintaining the present rules on the election and composition of the Presidency , with CARDINAL PERSON and CARDINAL NORP elected from the territory of the GPE and CARDINAL NORP elected from the territory of PERSON . In its [ Opinion on the constitutional situation in GPE and the powers of the High Representative ] the Commission raised serious concerns as to the compatibility with LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG such a rule , which formally excludes Others as well as ORG and NORP from PERSON and NORP from the GPE from being elected to the Presidency . Maintaining this rule as it stands should therefore be excluded and Proposal I be rejected .", "Comments on Proposal II", "CARDINAL . Proposal II , which is not drafted as text to be included in the LAW but as a summary of possible constitutional content , maintains the system of directly electing CARDINAL members of the Presidency from the Federation and CARDINAL from PERSON , however without mentioning any ethnic criteria for the candidates . The de jure discrimination pointed out in ORG would therefore be removed and adoption of this proposal would constitute a step forward . The Proposal also includes a rotation of the President of the Presidency DATE . Within the logic of a collective Presidency , this appears as a rational solution .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , the Proposal lacks clarity as to the pluri - ethnic composition of the Presidency . The collective Presidency was introduced , and supposedly will now be maintained , in order to ensure that no single ORG organ is dominated by a representative of a single constituent people . As it stands , under the proposal it would be possible to , for example , elect CARDINAL FAC from the Federation to the Presidency . Legally , this drawback could be remedied in the framework of the Proposal by providing that not CARDINAL member of the Presidency may belong at the same time to the same constituent people or the group of Others . It is the understanding of the Commission that the intention is indeed to include such a provision in the LAW in case this proposal is adopted .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the problem would result of having to possibly exclude from the Presidency candidates who have received a higher number of votes . In the GPE it is quite possible that QUANTITY Bosniacs would attain the highest number of votes . In this case , a candidate who obtained more votes would have to be barred from the Presidency in favour of a candidate who obtained fewer votes . These issues should be regulated clearly at the level of the LAW and not be left to ordinary law .", "CARDINAL . As a further drawback , de facto Bosniacs and NORP from ORG and NORP from the GPE would also continue to have no realistic possibility to elect a candidate of their preference .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the election of the Head of ORG would continue to take place on an Entity basis while it would be desirable to move it to the ORG level as part of the overall approach of strengthening the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As a minor issue , the proposal would also allow members of the Presidency to hold a leadership position in a political party . This does not seem in line with the overall aim of constitutional reform of transforming the Presidency from an executive body into a ( collective ) Head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , PERSON is a clear improvement with respect to the present constitutional situation . However , it has a number of drawbacks , including the risk that candidates with less votes than others are elected and it does not contribute to the overall aims of the constitutional reform of moving power to ORG and strengthening the ORG level .", "Proposal III", "CARDINAL . Proposal III differs more markedly from the present constitutional situation by introducing a complicated procedure of indirect elections for the Presidency . As set forth above , the main preference of the ORG is for the indirect election of a single President with reduced powers . But also in the case of a collective Presidency , the ORG maintains its preference for indirect elections .", "CARDINAL . The reason is , first of all , that CARDINAL of the main aims of the constitutional reform would be to reduce the powers of the Presidency and to concentrate executive power in ORG . This change will be more difficult to bring about if the Presidency does have the legitimacy of a direct popular vote .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , in an indirect election it is easier to devise mechanisms ensuring the desired pluri - ethnic composition of the Presidency . It offers more possibilities for inter - ethnic cooperation and compromise while direct elections for de facto separate ethnic slots provide an incentive to vote for the person considered as the strongest advocate of the respective constituent people and not for the candidate best suited to defend the interests of the country as a whole .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the Proposal moves the election to ORG . It is indeed desirable and in line with the overall aim of strengthening the ORG to have the election of the Head of ORG at this level .", "CARDINAL . From the point of view of the overall approach , Proposal III therefore seems preferable . There are nevertheless some drawbacks .", "CARDINAL . First of all , the proposal seems complicated with too many steps and possibilities for stalemate . Nominations can be put forward by members of ORG or ORG , the selection of the candidates takes place by the CARDINAL separate ethnic caucuses in ORG and thereafter the slate of candidates has to be confirmed both by the CARDINAL caucuses in ORG and by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Within the parameters of the proposal , it would seem preferable to have a simpler procedure with more focus on ORG as the body having direct democratic legitimacy derived from the people as a whole . The possibility to nominate candidates should be reserved to members of ORG , selection among these candidates could take place in the CARDINAL separate ethnic caucuses of ORG to ensure that the interests of all CARDINAL constituent peoples are respected and the slate of candidates would have to be confirmed by the majority of the composition of ORG , ensuring that all CARDINAL members have legitimacy as representatives of the people of GPE as a whole .", "CARDINAL . In addition , it should be clarified how the positions of the President and Vice - Presidents are to be distributed . As it stands , Proposal III leaves this important decision implicitly to backroom dealing between the CARDINAL ethnic caucuses since a slate identifying President and Vice - Presidents has to be submitted to ORG , while no indication is provided on how this choice has to be made . This seems the worst possible solution and likely to lead to stalemate . The rotation envisaged by PERSON seems more feasible .", "CARDINAL . There are also other aspects of Proposal III which are not in accordance with the preferences of ORG . In its above - mentioned ORG , the ORG argued in favour of abolishing ORG . Giving it a strong role in the selection of the Presidency can not therefore be considered a positive step . The role of ethnic caucuses makes the election of candidates not belonging to a constituent people extremely unlikely . This is however not peculiar to this Proposal but reflects the political situation . The proposal at least ensures that the representatives of ORG in ORG will take part in the vote and that NORP from ORG and NORP from PERSON are no longer disadvantaged since their representatives in ORG will be able to vote for the candidates of their choice .", "CARDINAL . Even in the framework of a collective Presidency , solutions for indirect elections could be devised , which would appear preferable . For example , within ORG , slates of CARDINAL candidates not coming from the same constituent people or the group of Others could be nominated and the vote could take place between such slates . This would nevertheless be a different proposal and not an amendment to Proposal III .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , Proposal III is also a clear improvement with respect to the present situation . If it were to be adjusted as suggested in DATE , it would appear suitable as a solution ( although not an ideal one ) for the first stage of constitutional reform .", "Conclusions", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG strongly welcomes that the political parties in GPE have found the courage to try adopting a comprehensive constitutional reform before the forthcoming elections in DATE . It acknowledges that a reform adopted at this stage can have an interim character only , as a step towards the comprehensive reform the country clearly needs .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the CARDINAL proposals submitted to the ORG , adoption of the first proposal could only be regarded as a failure of constitutional reform on this issue and should be excluded . By contrast , both PERSON and Proposal III deserve , subject to some additions and amendments , to be considered at the present stage as important steps forward , but by no means as ideal solutions .", "CARDINAL . Between Proposal II and PERSON , the Commission would \u2013 though not without hesitation DATE give preference to Proposal III , subject to some adjustments as indicated above . An indirect election in line with the aim of the constitutional reform of reducing the powers of the Presidency makes it easier to ensure a balanced composition of the Presidency and thereby corresponds better to the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of DATE unusual \u2013 institution . The Proposal also moves the election to the ORG level , in accordance with the overall aim to strengthen ORG . However , sight should not be lost of the ultimate aim of constitutional reform in this area : having in future a single President elected in a manner ensuring that he or she enjoys trust beyond the ethnic group to which he or she belongs . \u201d", "The relevant part of the ORG on the draft amendments to LAW ( ORG - AD(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of DATE ) provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
