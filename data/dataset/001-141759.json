LAW ( CARDINAL ) provides that an institution may issue a written or public authority , as independent or supplementary redress [ for damage ] , in circumstances where interference is not severe .", "It follows from the above - mentioned legal provisions that the ground for compensation for distress is not [ interference ] but rather significant [ and ] unlawful interference with rights or legal interests . In turn , if such [ interference ] has been established , compensation is determined in proportion to the severity of the harm engendered . Harm may be redressed by restoring the situation , issuing an apology or granting monetary compensation . Therefore , compensation for distress , its type and amount are determined by the significance of the interference and the severity of the harm engendered . Accordingly , if significant interference has occurred but no severe harm has been done , all types of the above - mentioned redress may generally [ be afforded ] . Hence also in such circumstances in determining appropriate compensation it is necessary [ that ] harm and compensation be proportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then went on to consider that the \u201c unlawful action of a public authority \u201d ( the PERSON decision ) did not constitute significant interference with the claimant \u2019s rights and legal interests that would have had any influence on his right to receive medical care in prison and would have called for monetary compensation , in addition to any harm to life or serious harm to health .

Therefore , the fact in itself that the PERSON has not found any shortcomings in the medical care provided in a prison can not stand in the way of a decision on a question , for example , relating to the scope of medical care in prison or its availability .", "The court can not establish , either from the case material or from the claimant \u2019s statements ( answers to the court \u2019s questions during the hearing ) ... that the claimant contested an action of a public authority ( the particular prison ) of not providing him with medical care as required by law ...", "[ CARDINAL ] ... In determining the type and amount of compensation for distress , the court finds that the institution \u2019s action of issuing the DATE report and giving its assessment about treatment in prison could not harm the claimant \u2019s life or seriously harm his health ...", "The PERSON report \u2013 the assessment of the quality of medical care DATE did not directly harm the claimant \u2019s health to the extent that the court should have set monetary compensation up to ORG pursuant to section DATE ) of the Law on Compensation for Damages ...", "However , in determining whether distress has been caused to the claimant by [ the fact ] that the institution in its report did not provide a full assessment of the quality of medical care , as it has been found ... in DATE judgment , and taking into account the legal characteristics of the report , the court considers that pursuant to section DATE ) of the Law on Compensation for Damages written apology may be considered independent redress . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
