GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The application concerns a real estate in GPE which is located in GPE . The estate had been owned DATE by PERSON , an NORP citizen who , after having married a NORP national , temporarily lost her NORP citizenship until DATE . PERSON was succeeded in DATE by Mr PERSON , an NORP bishop who died in DATE and who was succeeded on his part by PERSON , who was also an NORP citizen . The applicant inherited upon PERSON death in DATE .", "After the foundation of GPE ( GDR ) , foreign assets were in general put under public administration , and the ORG powers of disposal were considerably restricted . As a consequence , the GPE went into bilateral negotiations with GPE ( among them GPE ) over financial and property issues . In DATE , the GPE concluded several Lump Sum Agreements ( Globalentsch\u00e4digungsabkommen ) . A Lump Sum Agreement with GPE was concluded on CARDINAL DATE according to which the parties agreed that the GPE would pay to GPE a certain lump sum in order to settle property claims of GPE as well as of NORP citizens and legal persons . The last rate of the lump sum was paid in DATE by GPE ( ORG ) as the legal successor of the GPE . The lump sum was distributed by ORG ( Bundesverteilungskommission ) in ORG on the basis of NORP law , in particular the so - called LAW ( Verteilungsgesetz DDR ) .", "In DATE , Mr PERSON applied to ORG for consideration of the PERSON estate , which had been put under GPE administration in DATE , in the negotiations for the Lump Sum Agreement . Mr PERSON was informed by ORG on CARDINAL occasions in DATE and DATE that the PERSON estate was part of the negotiations to ORG .", "In DATE , PERSON ( who had inherited from Mr PERSON and whom the applicant succeeded in DATE ) applied to ORG for compensation from the lump sum . Her application was dismissed on DATE . ORG found that Mr PERSON and PERSON fulfilled the conditions of NORP nationality under LAW . However , PERSON , who had been the owner of the PERSON estate when it was put under GPE administration in DATE , did not have NORP citizenship on DATE , CARDINAL of the relevant dates . The Commission reasoned that NORP nationality of PERSON as the injured person was a necessary requirement under the said legislation .", "The applicant , who pursued the application after PERSON death in DATE , filed a constitutional complaint with ORG ) against the decision of ORG . ORG dismissed the application on DATE . It observed inter alia that there should be congruency between the Lump Sum Agreement and the national legislation governing the distribution . In its view , LAW met that requirement .", "On DATE , upon application by ORG ( GPE PERSON Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) , the real estate in GPE was allocated to the ORG in accordance with LAW ( b ) LAW ( Verm\u00f6genszuordnungsgesetz ) by order of ORG ) . LAW ( b ) LAW provides that assets for which compensation was provided for in bilateral treaties between the GPE and third states should be allocated to the ORG . The provision refers to LAW ( b ) of ORG , hereinafter the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , which excludes restitution for property losses which are covered by bilateral treaties between the GPE and third states .", "The applicant who had been participating in the allocation process subsequently brought an action for annulment of the allocation order .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim and refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law . Referring to the established case law of ORG , it found that , since the purpose of LAW CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW was to avoid that GPE had to pay double compensation where damages imputable to the GPE had already been compensated . Accordingly , the only prerequisite for of LAW CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW was the asset in question had been covered by LAW . As it was based on the payment of a lump sum , it did not matter whether the individual had actually received compensation , a matter which was anyway within the sphere of ORG to the agreement with the GPE . ORG to the lump sum agreement with the GPE had protected the interests of their nationals on the international level and the international agreement , once full payment was made , finally solved all property issues covered by that agreement . ORG , having regard to the material before it , established that the PERSON estate had been covered by LAW between GPE and the GPE . In this respect , the court noted that , in the appendix to the ORG , the NORP delegation had registered the estate as a subject matter during the negotiations . It further found that the estate had been validly included , with the consent of its then owner . In this respect , ORG referred to ORG which interpreted the relevant provisions of LAW to the effect that it applied to individuals of NORP citizenship on DATE and on DATE , the date of signature , but did not require that the owner at the time when the estate was placed under public administration held NORP citizenship on DATE . The refusal of compensation from the lump sum was a matter of NORP law and the legal opinion of ORG could not be decisive for the allocation of the assets under NORP law .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion against ORG refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law . ORG , referring to its earlier case law , confirmed that LAW ( b ) of LAW merely required that the asset in question was covered by LAW . The actual compensation on an individual basis , which in any event was subject to the domestic law of the third ORG which had received and distributed the lump sum , was not required . The purpose of LAW CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW was to avoid double compensation of financial and property losses which were attributable to the GPE but which had already been compensated by the payment of a lump sum to a third ORG . ORG took note of the fact that the applicant had neither been compensated by ORG nor had he received any restitution by GPE . However , ORG stressed that the NORP side had paid a lump sum to the NORP government for all assets which were covered by the Agreement ( including the estate in GPE ) in order to compensate individuals who had suffered material losses . The NORP side however had no influence on whether these individuals participated in the distribution of the lump sum . The applicability of an exclusion clause such as Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW could not depend on whether or not ORG had in fact made payments to all individuals whose claims had been taken into account when calculating the lump sum . It could therefore not be regarded as unfair if NORP law would deny restitution to such individuals .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , finding that the impugned decisions did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to property as guaranteed by LAW ) .", "According to its ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the Lump Sum Agreement covers property and financial claims of GPE as well as of NORP citizens and legal persons with regard to property which was under GPE administration . LAW provides that \u201c NORP nationals \u201d within the meaning of DATE are those who had NORP citizenship on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE of the signing of the Agreement , i.e. on CARDINAL DATE . LAW provides that , if the property claimant died before LANGUAGE DATE and held NORP citizenship upon his or her death , the successor is entitled under the condition that he or she held NORP citizenship on DATE .", "According to LAW , all property and financial issues covered by the Agreement were to be settled exhaustively and definitely with the payment of the lump sum .", "LAW is the domestic law which corresponds to LAW . According to LAW , the term \u201c NORP nationals \u201d was defined as persons who had NORP citizenship both on DATE and on the date of the signing of the Agreement , i.e. on CARDINAL DATE . If the owner died before CARDINAL DATE and held NORP citizenship upon his or her death , the successor is entitled under the condition that he or she held NORP citizenship on DATE .", "ORG , also known as LAW , entered into force on DATE and was a part of LAW . Under the terms of the LAW , LAW was to continue to subsist in the reunified GPE after the reunification of the two GPE on DATE . The aim of the LAW was to resolve disputes over property in the territory of the GPE in a way that was socially acceptable , in order to achieve permanent legal order in GPE .
