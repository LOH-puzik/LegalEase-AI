CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney - General of GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of a plot of land ( no . CARDINAL ) in PERSON , in the district of GPE . The surface area of the plot was QUANTITY .", "On DATE a notice of compulsory acquisition ( no . CARDINAL ) was published in ORG concerning a number of properties including that of the applicant . In total QUANTITY were to be compulsorily acquired from his property . The purpose of the compulsory acquisition was the construction , improvement , alignment and paving of a public road .", "On DATE the order of compulsory acquisition ( no . DATE ) was published in ORG .", "On DATE a revocation order was published in respect of QUANTITY . Accordingly , the part of the applicant \u2019s property to be compulsorily acquired was reduced to QUANTITY .", "As a result of the compulsory acquisition the road was diverted and cut across the applicant \u2019s plot dividing it into CARDINAL equal parts . Furthermore , during the road \u2019s construction , damage was caused to CARDINAL almond trees that had been on the part of the property not affected by the compulsory acquisition .", "The applicant and the acquiring authority did not reach an agreement as regards the compensation to be granted in respect of the compulsory acquisition . The latter considered that the applicant was not entitled to any compensation for the acquisition and the damage caused to the trees but only for expenses in respect of construction works he would have to carry out as a result of the acquisition .", "On DATE the applicant filed an application ( no . CARDINAL ) with ORG of GPE under LAW Law DATE ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) requesting an award of just and equitable compensation for the compulsory acquisition of part of his property . The applicant claimed that his property had suffered significant damage because of the compulsory acquisition . His expert assessed this damage at CARDINAL GPE pounds ( ORG ) . This amount included compensation for the compulsory acquisition ( ORG CARDINAL ) , the almond trees ( CYP CARDINAL ) and the construction works that had to be carried out ( ORG CARDINAL ) . On the other hand , the ORG \u2019s expert considered that there had been an increase in the value ( betterment ) of the remaining part of the property due to the acquisition and consequently , that no compensation should be granted . Furthermore , the ORG \u2019s expert considered that the damage to the almond trees could not be taken into account when determining the compensation since the property was located in a residential area and could be used for building purposes . Finally , he assessed the expenses to be incurred by the applicant in carrying out construction works due to the acquisition at ORG CARDINAL .", "ORG carried out a local inspection of the property in the presence of the parties , their lawyers and the Government \u2019s expert .", "On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment by which it dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation concerning the compulsory acquisition . In particular , the court considered that the evidence submitted by the ORG \u2019s expert was more thorough , accurate and credible . It stated that the applicant \u2019s expert had admitted making mistakes several times and that his evidence had been ambiguous and vague . He had not carried out a valuation of the whole property in order to determine any possible damage or betterment caused by the acquisition . In this connection , the court noted that it was not possible to determine whether there was betterment or injurious affection to the CARDINAL parts of the property without assessing what the value of the whole property was before it was affected by the acquisition . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s expert had been unclear about the manner in which he had determined the value of the property per square metre . In addition , although the applicant \u2019s expert assessed the property \u2019s value on the basis that it constituted residential property , he then included the value of the uprooted almond trees in his valuation on the basis that the property was not within a residential area .", "The value of a plot of land was assessed in monetary terms on the basis of its use and the purpose for which it was suitable . The view of the Government \u2019s expert that residential development was more profitable than agricultural development was reasonable and therefore this test was the starting point for determining the compensation to be awarded . The court noted that the property should be considered as residential property since it was within a residential area . Accordingly , any damage to the trees was included in the valuation which was based on the residential value of the property .", "On the evidence submitted the court found that there had been an increase in value ( betterment ) to the remaining part of the property due to the construction of the new road . It held , therefore , that the applicant was not entitled to compensation in respect of the compulsory acquisition or any compensation in respect of injurious affection to the remaining part . However , the court awarded the applicant the sum of QUANTITY ( ORG ) in respect of the construction works . It also awarded interest on this amount from the date of publication of the notice of acquisition at the DATE rate of PERCENT . Finally , the court awarded the applicant costs and the amount of ORG DATE which was agreed between the parties as fees for the applicant \u2019s expert .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG . In his appeal the applicant invoked CARDINAL grounds challenging the evidence given by the Government \u2019s expert and the findings of the district court that he was not entitled to any compensation for the compulsory acquisition and damage cause thereby . In the first ground of his appeal the applicant stated , inter alia , that", "\u201c the court had been mistaken in accepting the perjured testimony of the ORG \u2019s expert witness absolving thus the acquiring authority from paying a sum of money as compensation which should have been paid in conformity with the LAW as just and equitable compensation in cash and promptly ... \u201d .", "In the seventh ground of his appeal he repeated that reasonable compensation should have been granted and in the eleventh ground he argued that his human rights had been violated .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Upon examining the applicant \u2019s arguments ORG considered that ORG had given satisfactory reasons in its judgment and had correctly approached the expert evidence submitted . It therefore upheld ORG findings and awarded costs against the applicant .", "LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every person , alone or jointly with others , has the right to acquire , own , possess , enjoy or dispose of any movable or immovable property and has the right to respect for such a right .

The purpose of this type of proceedings is the determination of such compensation ( PERSON v. The Attorney - General of GPE , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the same PERSON sets out the criteria and principles for the purposes of determining fair and equitable compensation for the compulsory acquisition of property .
