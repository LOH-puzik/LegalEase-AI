The date of the conference was fixed for DATE . According to the Regulation on the Composition of the Academic Senate of ORG , candidates to the senate were to be nominated at staff meetings in structural entities by open majority vote ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Unhappy about the fact that neither he nor his colleagues in the physics department had been consulted or informed about the nomination and discussion of candidates to the academic senate , the applicant took the floor at the above public conference and spoke as follows :", "\u201c ... the elected academic senate may not be considered a legitimate body and its decisions likewise can not be considered legitimate . All of them can be challenged in courts . The problem is that the staff or departments did not know anything about the candidates to the academic senate or of their academic achievements ; no one nominated those candidates . This is some kind of a private party that is going on , some people have gathered and elected themselves . My rights have been violated : I , as a member of the faculty , have been excluded from the procedure which is of great importance both for me and for the university as a whole \u2013 the election of the academic senate . My rights have been breached , and I will complain to courts about the breaches of my rights . The rights of ordinary university employees , ordinary lecturers , have been breached , too : they were removed from the election to the academic senate , this is discrimination .

The Sovetskiy District Court of PERSON reviewed the university statutes and regulations on the procedure for the election of the academic senate and took oral evidence from witnesses . CARDINAL witnesses testified that the physics department had not held a meeting for the election of delegates to the conference or nomination of candidates to the senate because the delegates and candidates had been elected and nominated at the meeting between the heads of departments .

The statements were made in the affirmative form which is apparent from TIME of the conference of DATE , the audio recording of the conference , and testimony by witnesses . The witnesses PERSON and PERSON . who had attended the conference on DATE explained that they understood the statements as an affirmation which produced a negative impression on them ...", "Every legal entity has the right to require that a public appraisal of its activities reflect the real state of affairs .

On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment on the merits but partly amended it . Firstly , it considered that the sentences \u201c All of them can be challenged in courts ... Any discrimination is a form of war ; you have declared war to the people , and sooner or later you will get the results of this war in some way or another , in your own families . \u201d did not contain any statements about the plaintiff and could not therefore be damaging for its reputation . Secondly , it noted that the sentence \u201c no one nominated those candidates [ in the departments ] \u201d was actually true because candidates had been nominated at the meetings of department heads . Thirdly , ORG considered it appropriate that the operative part of ORG judgment be read out at the following conference by the president rather than by the applicant . Finally , it offered a more nuanced characterisation of the disputed phrases as a statement of fact :", "\u201c Mr GPE \u2019s speech contained a statement of fact : the elected academic senate may not be considered a legitimate body and all of its decisions are likewise illegitimate , in other words , the academic senate was unlawfully elected and its decisions are unlawful . This is a verifiable statement . Accordingly , this information is not a subjective opinion of the defendant but a factual allegation . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
