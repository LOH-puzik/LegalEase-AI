In respect of the first applicant , the investigation also concerned charges of abuse of position , fraud and forgery and as regards the third applicant , charges of fraud . After having heard oral evidence from the accused , the investigating judge , in a single decision , ordered that QUANTITY of the accused , including the applicants , be placed in pre - trial detention for DATE . The detention order was based on all the grounds specified under section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely , a risk of the accused absconding and reoffending and interfering with the investigation . The judge relied on the gravity of the charges , the severity of the potential sentence and the possibility of the accused influencing witnesses , accomplices and other people concerned .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants appealed , arguing that the investigating judge had not given any concrete reasons to justify the detention of each of them . Both applicants pointed out that they had a permanent residence and family in the respondent ORG . The second applicant further submitted evidence regarding his poor health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of the trial court ( \u201c the panel \u201d ) , set up under section PERSON ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , sitting in private , dismissed the appeal submitted by the first applicant .

As regards the risk of absconding , the extension order of CARDINAL DATE stated that :", "\u201c Having regard to the type , gravity and nature of the criminal offenses with which the accused are charged , the panel considers that there is a real risk of them absconding if they are released . That is sustained with the behaviour of some of the accused , namely [ the first applicant ] has a previous criminal record and criminal proceedings are pending in respect of [ the second applicant ] . As regards the personal circumstances of the accused , the panel took into consideration that most of them have a family ; that they are parents and have possessions , but it considers that they do not provide for a sufficient guarantee , at this stage of the investigation , that they would not abscond if they are released ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Particular attention has been paid to the fact that the criminal offences with which the accused are charged ( or \u2018 in respect of which there is a reasonable suspicion\u2019 ) have been committed through the use of the position and characteristics of the accused as holders of special powers [ \u0441\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0430 ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The extension order of CARDINAL DATE relied on the same reasons and used identical wording to justify the risk of the applicants absconding and reoffending . It added a reference to the severity of the potential penalty , as a ground that justified the risk of flight .", "CARDINAL . As regards the risk that the applicants might flee , the extension order of CARDINAL DATE stated :", "\u201c ... The contents and quality of the material and verbal evidence adduced corroborates the suspicion that the accused have committed the crimes with which they are charged ... Consequently , the panel considers that at this stage of the proceedings , namely , after the indictment was lodged ... there is still a real risk of the accused absconding if they are released . That would considerably affect the proceedings and prevent the case from being decided . Having been acquainted with the indictment and the reasons given therein , and having been faced with the possibility of a prison sentence , the accused , if released , could flee or otherwise go into hiding ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the possibility that the applicants might reoffend this order provided an explanation identical to that contained in the previous orders . The panel further added :", "\u201c ... In particular , [ the first and third applicants ] are the owners of several companies through which the offences with which they are charged were committed . The other accused are employed by or otherwise connected with those companies ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The risk was justified , in all extension orders with an explanation identical to that described above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Besides the above reasons , in all CARDINAL extension orders given during this time , the panel stated :", "\u201c ... Given the fact that the detention in prison custody and house arrest are the most efficient measures that secure the attendance of the accused at the trial ... which had a positive bearing on their right to a hearing within a reasonable time .... the panel considers that the extension and maintaining of the detention .... is justified ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Mr PERSON visited the first applicant in GPE prison . On that occasion , the first applicant signed a letter of attorney for Mr PERSON to represent him in the proceedings before ORG .

As evident from the available material in the case file , the applicants appealed against the extension orders , arguing , inter alia , that the panel had not given sufficient reasons to substantiate the risk of them absconding and reoffending , given their family situation and the state of health of the second applicant ( who suffered from a chronic illness and needed regular medical care ) . The first applicant further argued that his previous conviction concerned a traffic offence , which could not be relied on by the courts to justify the risk of his reoffending . The applicants also complained that the wording used in the decisions in question violated their right to the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by the LAW and the LAW . The first and third applicants further requested , under section CARDINAL ) of the consolidated version of the LAW ( the text of which is identical to section CARDINAL ) of the LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to be informed of the date of the session ( \u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) of ORG .
