Likewise , places reserved for certain other subjects such as \u201c informatics \u201d , \u201c music \u201d and \u201c fine arts \u201d were left blank .", "LAW , adopted on DATE , provides that freedom of faith and religion shall be ensured to everyone . Pursuant to this LAW , freedom of religion shall include the freedom to profess or to accept a religion by personal choice as well as to manifest such religion , either individually or collectively , publicly or privately , by worshipping , praying , participating in ceremonies , performing rites or teaching . Freedom of religion shall also include the possession of sanctuaries and other places of worship as well as the right of individuals , wherever they may be , to benefit from religious services .", "According to this Article , parents shall have the right to ensure their children \u2019s moral and religious upbringing and teaching in accordance with their convictions .", "The religion of a church or other legally recognised religious organisation may be taught in schools , but the freedom of religion and conscience of others shall not be infringed thereby .", "The freedom to express publicly one \u2019s religion may be limited only by means of statute and only where this is necessary for the defence of ORG security , public order , health , morals or the rights and freedoms of others .", "No one shall be compelled to participate in religious practices or prevented from such participation .

In DATE ORG issued CARDINAL Ordinances , introducing religious instruction in ORG and other religions into public schools on a voluntary basis .

Separate school reports were to be issued with marks for religious instruction .", "The ORG lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) , challenging the conformity of certain provisions of those Ordinances with the law . The ORG considered that they breached the statutory guarantee of the right to remain silent with regard to one 's religion and convictions , as provided for in the Freedom of Conscience and LAW of DATE . He contended that the ORG disclosed a breach of this guarantee as their implementation would result in an obligation to reveal the religious convictions of parents and children .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG found that voluntary religious tuition at school was not in breach of the Freedom of Conscience and Religion Act . The court considered that by allowing a child to attend religious instruction a parent is not obliged to reveal his or her beliefs , since a non - believer could agree to the child attending such classes whereas a believer could refuse . It further considered that the right to remain silent with regard to one 's religion and convictions could not be interpreted as an obligation to remain silent .

The Ordinance replaced the DATE Ordinance referred to above . It provides for participation in religious instruction on a voluntary basis , a course on ethics being organised on the same voluntary basis for those pupils who do not wish to attend such instruction . It further provided for marks for \" religious instruction / ethics \" to be included in the official school reports .

The ORG submitted that including marks for religious instruction in an official school report breaches the principle of the separation of churches and the ORG , and infringes the right to remain silent CARDINAL 's beliefs and convictions , guaranteed by law .", "In a decision given on DATE , ORG found that including marks for \" religion / ethics \" in official school reports did not reveal whether a pupil had attended CARDINAL course or the other . Therefore , the court found it unnecessary to examine the question whether the impugned ORG had infringed the right to remain silent regarding one 's religion and convictions .", "On DATE GPE ratified the concordat with the FAC .
