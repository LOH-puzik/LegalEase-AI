ORG Following a suggestion made by her to the ORG \u2019s social workers , the applicant \u2019s wife took S home on DATE but subsequently changed her mind and returned him to the foster parents . On DATE , the ORG , which had already given previous consideration to such a course , passed resolutions assuming the parental rights of the applicant and his wife over S ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It had apparently not informed them that such resolutions were proposed , but on DATE it reached an agreement with them that S would be returned to them in DATE if they overcame their domestic difficulties . In any event , the applicant did not exercise his right to object to the resolution affecting him ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , DATE after the applicant \u2019s wife had been admitted to hospital for treatment following a deterioration in her alcoholism , the ORG reviewed the family circumstances . It was concluded that the prospects of ORG \u2019s rehabilitation were poor but that the aforementioned agreement should be retained , the social workers responsible considering that there could be no postponement of the date for ORG return to his natural parents beyond DATE . In case it proved impossible to effect the return at that time , it was also agreed that the possibility of finding long - term foster parents should be examined as a contingency plan .", "CARDINAL . ORG S spent DATE over DATE with his natural family . The applicant continued to look after his CARDINAL older children but in DATE they were placed temporarily into voluntary care as he was threatened with loss of his job if he did not resume work ; the placement was intended to end on his wife \u2019s discharge from hospital .", "A social worker saw the applicant \u2019s wife in hospital on DATE and reported that she seemed worried at the prospect of the children \u2019s return home . The social worker warned her that , as regards S , the alternative would be his placement in long - term care . On DATE , the social worker saw the applicant in connection with his matrimonial difficulties and the future of the CARDINAL older children , but the prospect of S not being returned to his natural parents was not discussed .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG passed resolutions to assume parental rights over the CARDINAL older children . According to the applicant , he raised no objection since it was agreed between the parents and the ORG \u2019s care officers that these children would be returned to their parents over a period . They were in fact returned on CARDINAL DATE and have remained at home ever since . The applicant and his wife contend that they understood the agreement to envisage the return of S as well .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the report of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the social workers responsible for S and the remainder of the applicant \u2019s family reached the conclusion in DATE or DATE , from their nearly continuous review of the circumstances , that the arrangement for returning S to his natural parents would not work in view of the prognosis for the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s alcoholism and the apparent breakdown of the marriage . On an unrecorded date , an unspecified person or persons in the ORG \u2019s ORG decided that ORG should not return home but should be placed with foster parents on a long - term basis with a view to adoption and that the natural GPE access to him should be restricted . There is no recorded minute of any decision to this effect having been taken by the ORG in a formal manner at that time and the possibility of such placement was apparently not mentioned to the applicant when the social workers saw him on DATE nor to his wife on DATE , when they visited her to inform her of the resolutions concerning the CARDINAL older children . Although it appears from ORG report that the parents had on previous occasions been made aware of the possibility that S might be placed in long - term care , he was clearly not satisfied that the likely course of events with regard to S had been made sufficiently plain to them and that they had been properly consulted before the decision was taken not to return the child to them .", "In any event , on CARDINAL and DATE respectively , the applicant and his wife were informed of the decision orally by the social workers responsible . According to ORG report , the social worker dealing with the case was not sure that even then either parent clearly understood what was being said about PERSON \u2019s future , their concern at the time being \" totally focused \" on the CARDINAL older children .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG \u2019s Adoption and ORG , without further reference to the applicant or his wife , considered and approved the proposal to place S with long - term foster parents and to restrict his natural GPE access to him . The ORG was told by the social workers responsible that the applicant and his wife , who were neither present at nor knew of the meeting , disagreed with the proposal . The minute of the ORG \u2019s discussion records : \" It was suggested that if there was to be no parental contact the mother particularly would \u2018 search to the ends of the earth for [ ORG . However , parental contact to be controlled and not at [ the foster GPE ] home . \"", "The ORG informed ORG in the course of his enquiries that , in its view , TIME reflected the intention that the applicant and his wife should not know where PERSON was placed . In any event , it clearly records a decision that access should be restricted , both as to location and frequency , but not terminated .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the senior social worker responsible for the case visited the applicant and his wife to inform them that S was being moved to new foster parents ; the record of his visit states that he told them that he was not prepared to disclose where the foster parents lived . In addition , it appears that since the Area Director of ORG considered that access would jeopardise the chances of S developing a satisfactory relationship with the new foster parents , he had decided that the applicant and his wife should not be allowed to visit S. It is not revealed how , if at all , this decision to terminate access derived from the discussions of ORG as recorded in the minute quoted above . According to the Government , the applicant was made aware of this decision in DATE", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , S was moved to a new foster family for long - term fostering , with a view to adoption .", "CARDINAL . ORG Some time after DATE and apparently as a result of the shock of being sentenced to prison for theft , the applicant \u2019s wife made a remarkable recovery from her alcoholism . The couple also resolved their matrimonial difficulties . They continued to seek access to S and protested to ORG at the refusal thereof ; a meeting for them to see the child at the social services building was eventually arranged in DATE . Having consulted solicitors in DATE with a view to challenging the ORG \u2019s actions , the applicant and his wife were granted legal aid to apply to a juvenile court to discharge the ORG \u2019s parental rights resolutions concerning S ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and proceedings were issued on DATE . At the request of the ORG , the hearing , originally fixed for DATE , was postponed to DATE . On DATE , the juvenile court held that both of the resolutions should \" henceforth be terminated \" , thereby permitting S to be returned to the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG appealed to ORG against the juvenile court \u2019s decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and also issued proceedings in the local ORG of ORG to have PERSON made a ward of court ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "There followed a period of uncertainty as to which of these proceedings the ORG would pursue . On DATE ( the last possible day to prevent the wardship from lapsing ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the ORG took out a notice for an appointment , to be held on DATE , for hearing the summons initiating the wardship . On DATE , when the ORG applied to ORG for directions , the applicant \u2019s solicitor challenged the propriety of the wardship proceedings as a duplication of the jurisdiction and this question was referred as a preliminary issue to be heard before a ORG judge . On DATE , the judge permitted the ORG , which undertook to withdraw its appeal before ORG , to continue with the wardship proceedings ; he directed that the case be heard as soon as possible and ordered that it be set down in DATE , no earlier date being available having regard to the expected length of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG The case was heard on CARDINAL and DATE . After evaluating the evidence submitted in relation to ORG \u2019s well - being and the applicant \u2019s circumstances ( including a report of DATE from an independent welfare officer ) , ORG held that the wardship should continue and directed that the child should remain with the foster parents with whom he had been placed in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) : there was no longer any practical alternative to this , too long a period having elapsed since LOC \u2019s last contact with his natural parents ( on DATE ) for any change to be justified . ORG also held that the applicant and his wife should not have access to the child , noting that restoring rights of access would only encourage them in their attempts to have PERSON returned to them , a course which would not be in his best interests . However , in the course of his judgment , the judge stated :", "\" I can only say that it is extremely unfortunate that these [ wardship ] proceedings were not heard within a matter of DATE after the [ juvenile court \u2019s ] decision . I see no reason why they could not have been ... However , the hearing did not take place and the parents and ORG are now faced with the fact that a further DATE have gone by in which ORG has become even closer to his foster parents . \"", "\" ... I am not happy about the use of LAW [ of LAW DATE ] powers to change the status of the child and to cut the parents out of his life , and I am unhappy about a decision arrived at by the local authority without the parents being heard or having the opportunity to make their own representations to the decision - making body ... \"", "The judge also commented on the \" massive help \" received by the parents from the social services .", "CARDINAL . ORG An appeal by the applicant to ORG was dismissed on DATE . ORG expressed its sympathy for the natural parents , describing the case as \" tragic \" , but stressed that its duty was to arrive at a decision which was in the best interests of the child and that \" the question from beginning to CARDINALend is whether the child \u2019s best interests would be served by remaining with his foster parents or by being transferred to his natural parents \" . Although the ORG recognised that \" both the mother and the father deserve all the credit for pulling themselves out of an appalling situation \" and that they had \" succeeded remarkably \" in coping with their older children , it found that S presented \" a different problem \" in the light of the fact that he had spent almost the whole of his life in the care of other people .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant referred the matter to ORG , who has the task of investigating complaints made by a member of the public claiming to have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration in connection with action taken by a local authority in the exercise of its administrative functions .", "In his report of CARDINAL DATE , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s allegation of maladministration in the way in which the ORG had taken its decisions concerning ORG , stating in particular that he criticised \" the failure to put the parents properly in the picture before firm decisions were taken \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the foster parents with whom S had been placed in DATE were granted leave to apply to adopt the child ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . An adoption order relating to him was made on DATE , ORG having decided to dispense with the applicant \u2019s consent ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of ORG , it has for DATE co - existed with , but not been ousted by , various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority .", "Although the terms are not wholly accurate , the legislation is commonly divided into CARDINAL categories : the first provides for \" compulsory care \" , by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care ; the second concerns \" voluntary care \" , the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts . At any given time , there are CARDINAL children in public care in GPE and GPE , of whom CARDINAL are not living with their parents or a relative .", "The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on DATE .
