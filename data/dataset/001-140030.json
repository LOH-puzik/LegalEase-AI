It was further noted that the lengthy proceedings had been extremely stressful for the applicant , who had been forced to relive the painful events too many times , in addition to which she had had no effective remedies at her disposal in order to accelerate the proceedings . Thus , having regard to the importance of the case for the applicant and the lengthy period of absence of any procedural acts on the part of the criminal court , the court deviated from the general practice of the domestic authorities to award , within the statutory range of CARDINAL , PERCENT of the sum that would be awarded for a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time by ORG .

On DATE ORG rejected the constitutional appeal as inadmissible . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s petition for the review of the constitutionality of LAW limitation on compensation was also rejected , as the court held that the possible annulment of the challenged statutory provision could not have had any legal effects on the applicant \u2019s position .", "CARDINAL .

However , in the course of the retrial proceedings , a new LAW was adopted in DATE introducing more lenient sentences for the criminal offences of rape and aggravated rape . In accordance with the general principle of domestic criminal law that a law more lenient on the perpetrator may be applied retroactively , LAW was used in the proceedings , which reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Whoever compels a person of the same or opposite sex to submit to sexual intercourse with him by force or threat of imminent attack on life or limb shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not CARDINAL and not DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) If the offence under the preceding paragraph has been committed in a cruel or extremely humiliating manner or successively by CARDINAL perpetrators or against an offender serving a sentence in a closed or semi - open type of penal institution , the perpetrator(s ) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not DATE .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
