GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Eckart Klein;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Volodymyr Butkevych", "TEXT": ["The CARDINAL applicants are PERSON , PERSON PERSON and their CARDINAL children : PERSON , and PERSON . They are all NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "The applicants were all represented before the ORG by the second applicant , Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON ORG , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "According to the initial regulation of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) of CARDINAL DATE , a child born in wedlock would obtain the surname of the father , which would also be the common family name . With the introduction of the LAW on the Reform of the Marital and Family Law ( Erstes Gesetz zur Reform des Ehe- und GPE ) of DATE , a married couple could choose either of the spouses\u2019 surnames as the family name . Their children would then obtain the same family name . If the parents were unable to choose a family name , the husband \u2019s surname would automatically become the family name according to the then applicable version of LAW of LAW . That provision was held to be unconstitutional and incompatible with the prohibition of discrimination against women ( LAW ) by ORG on DATE .", "ORG ordered that , until the legislator had found a new regulation , couples who married after DATE of the publication of the judgment and who were unable to agree on the choice of a common family name would provisionally keep their surnames . In such an instance , their children were provisionally able to obtain a compound name composed of both surnames of the parents , in order to leave to the legislator the option to introduce the possibility to obtain such names .", "On DATE , the Act on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names ( Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Familiennamensrechts ) came into force which corrected the above constitutional flaws . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by giving both spouses the possibility to keep their surnames . According to the henceforth relevant LAW ( replaced in DATE by LAW ) , a child would either obtain the surname of the father or the mother . Currently , if the parents can not agree , the competent family court will refer the right to determination to CARDINAL parent .", "A compound name for the child was not provided for by LAW .", "The first CARDINAL applicants married in DATE and decided to keep their birth names . After the birth of their children , they applied to ORG ) in order to obtain for their children the surnames \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c PERSON \u201d . Their applications were to no avail .", "On DATE , they applied again to ORG in order to be considered for the period indicated by ORG in its judgment of DATE during which compound names were provisionally permitted . Moreover , they argued that the current law as provided for by the Act on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names was unconstitutional in as far as it precluded compound names for children . Their application was dismissed by ORG which found that both children had obtained the last name \u201c LOC \u201d in accordance with the then applicable LAW of LAW .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the first CARDINAL ORG claim to order ORG to register their children with compound names . It held that , both under the present law and under the law that had been in force before the judgment of ORG in DATE , their children were not entitled to obtain compound names . ORG did not find any reasons for the unconstitutionality of the present law , nor had any concerns been raised by academics and legal scholars in that connection . In its judgment of DATE , ORG had indicated a provisional period in which compound names could be obtained only with respect to those marriages that were concluded after the date of the publication of the judgment .", "ORG found that that judgment was plain and unambiguous in this respect , and the applicants were clearly not concerned by the provisional period as they had married DATE before the judgment was published .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the first CARDINAL ORG appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . The first CARDINAL applicants\u2019 further appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court found that LAW was constitutional and neither violated the right to a family ( LAW ) nor the right to educate one \u2019s own children ( LAW ) . A positive obligation on the legislator to provide the possibility for children to obtain a compound name could not be derived from ORG judgment of DATE . On the contrary , ORG had granted the legislator a wide margin of appreciation when setting the law on family names , and the provisional period in which compound names could be obtained had only been introduced in order to allow the legislator the choice of all existing options within that margin .", "The first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the LAW on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names in DATE . On DATE , ORG refused to admit that complaint .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL ) of all CARDINAL applicants lodged in DATE against the above decisions by referring to a leading judgment of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) in which the constitutionality of LAW had been confirmed .", "The applicant children \u2019s younger siblings bear a compound name , but are neither born , nor registered in the birth register , in GPE .", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL Spouses should designate a common family name ( marital name ) . The spouses shall use the marital name which they have designated . If the spouses do not designate a family name , they will continue to bear those surnames after the marriage which they bore at the time when entering into the marriage .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL By declaration to the registrar , the spouses may designate , as their marital name , the birth name of the husband or the wife or the name he or she has at the time of the designation of the marital name . ( ... )", "\u00a7 CARDINAL A spouse whose name does not become the marital name may , by declaration to the registrar , attach , before or after the marital name , his or her birth name or the name he or she has at the time of the declaration on the designation of the marital name . This shall not apply if the marital name consists of CARDINAL name . If the name of CARDINAL of the spouses consists of CARDINAL name , CARDINAL of these names may be attached . ( ... ) \u201d", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL If the parents do not have a marital name but if they have joint parental responsibility , they shall , by declaration to the registrar , designate the surname that the father or the mother has at the time of the declaration as the birth name of the child . ( ... )", "\u00a7 CARDINAL If parents make no designation within DATE of the birth of the child , the family court shall transfer the right of designation to CARDINAL of the parents . Subsection ( CARDINAL ) applies mutatis mutandis . The court may impose a time - limit on the parent for the exercise of the right of designation . If , after the time - limit has expired , the right of designation had not been exercised , the child shall be given the name of the parent to whom the right of designation was transferred . \u201d", "Under NORP law , authentic compound names are permitted only in very specific circumstances . For example , compound names may be retained if they were used prior to state regulation of the law governing names . Moreover , pursuant to LAW PERSON , compound names may come into being when persons with surnames which are highly common in GPE such as \u201c PERSON \u201d or \u201c PERSON \u201d ( so - called PERSON ) add another name to render their family name easier to distinguish . Compound names created in this way may be passed on to children .", "In a leading judgment of DATE , ORG held , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , the former version of LAW of LAW ( which is identical to LAW of the current version of LAW ) to be constitutional . In particular , ORG found that the provision neither constituted a violation of the right to a family ( LAW ) , the right to educate one \u2019s own children ( LAW ) nor the children \u2019s right to protection of their personality rights as guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG considered that , once children would be allowed to obtain compound names , the number of surnames could exponentiate with each future generation . The next generation would already be able to obtain a surname comprised of CARDINAL names . Such growing \u201c chains of surnames \u201d would not only be impracticable , they would also be to the detriment of future generations whose surnames would be at risk of losing their function as a means of identification . LAW would not prohibit the legislator from reducing the number of possible surnames to avoid such \u201c name chains \u201d in order to secure the function of the surnames of future generations .", "ORG considered that a different way of avoiding \u201c name chains \u201d would have been to allow compound names , but to restrict the number of surnames to CARDINAL . This method , however , would prevent parents who already bear a compound name to give their children a compound name comprised of both GPE surnames , or obtain such a surname themselves . A person with a compound name could no longer keep his or her surname after marriage and add the surname of his or her partner , as currently provided for by LAW . Therefore , the introduction of an option to let children obtain compound names would at the same time reduce the choice of surnames for those who already bear a compound name . Such a situation , in which CARDINAL fundamental right restricts another , would consequently require a balancing of interests , which the legislator had done when introducing the former version of LAW of LAW ( now LAW ) . ORG stated that the legislator had had several options to balance the above interests . The option which the legislator chose was thereby neither required nor prohibited by LAW .", "Lastly , ORG found that the former version of LAW of LAW did not violate the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex as guaranteed in LAW . If each spouse kept his or her surname after marriage , married couples could choose CARDINAL of their surnames as the surname for their children . LAW CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code reduced the possible options to give their children a surname , but this concerned spouses of both sexes alike .", "The fact that married couples with different surnames were in practice more likely to choose the husband \u2019s surname for their children was not considered to suggest a different finding . Even though this could possibly indicate a widespread affirmation of traditional marriage patterns , LAW could not be interpreted as containing a positive obligation on the ORG to introduce a GPE right to choose a compound name for their children . In any case , such a regulation had only minor effects on the ORG \u2019s positive obligation to secure equality of the sexes as contained in the second sentence of LAW of LAW .", "That children could still obtain a compound name under certain circumstances , particularly in cases in which CARDINAL parent already bore a compound name was not regarded as a violation of the prohibition of discrimination against those children who could not obtain a compound name . In both instances , children were only allowed to obtain either the surname of the mother or the father ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
