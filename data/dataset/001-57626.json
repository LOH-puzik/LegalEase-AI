The gendarmes reported DATE to colleagues from the criminal - investigation branch of the police . On DATE an investigating judge in GPE had issued a warrant to these officers to investigate that case , and they now immediately listened to the recording of the telephone conversation in question , had it transcribed and appended the text to a report drawn up at TIME on DATE ; the original tape remained , sealed , with the gendarmerie .", "CARDINAL .
