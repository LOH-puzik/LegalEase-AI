PERSON , \u201c the FAC \u201d ) took a decision concerning , among other things , flood prevention work in the floodplain of the GPE river . The decision stated that although the question of cleaning up the course of the GPE river was repeatedly raised DATE , no actual measures had yet been taken . It went on to say that outlet channels and the river channel itself were abundantly overgrown with small trees and bushes , cluttered with debris and household waste and blocked by unlawfully built dams and various structures which all created a threat of flooding over an area of QUANTITY , with a population of over CARDINAL people , in the event of the urgent release of a large quantity of water from the NORP reservoir . The decision called on ORG , along with ORG , to take measures to clean up and deepen the channel of the GPE river to ensure that its throughput capacity ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c ) was CARDINAL CARDINAL cubic metres per second .

According to the Government , the authorities had taken a number of measures to implement the decision of DATE . In particular , in a letter of CARDINAL September CARDINAL ORG instructed the head of the FAC bridge construction crew immediately to clean the GPE river channel in the area where CARDINAL of the bridges was being built and the river channel was full of debris . In the ORG \u2019s submission , in the absence of information concerning the clogged - up river channel in subsequent reports , it was reasonable to assume that the FAC bridge construction crew had cleaned it in compliance with the letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Also , in a letter of DATE ORG urged the head of the council of horticultural cooperatives to instruct the ORG members to engage in an effort to clean up the GPE river channel and avoid littering the land around the river . The Government further referred to relevant reports attesting that in DATE and DATE and DATE work had been done to clean up the river channel . They were unable to say whether those measures helped to increase the river \u2019s throughput capacity to QUANTITY per second as prescribed by the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed ORG that the water level in the NORP reservoir was close to critical and that some of it would have to be evacuated . However , the GPE river channel was densely overgrown with small trees and bushes and cluttered with debris and household waste , creating a threat of flooding over a large populated area in the event of the urgent evacuation of water from the dam . The letter went on to say that , in accordance with the decision of ORG dated DATE , it was necessary for ORG to take urgent steps to clean up the GPE river channel .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG requested ORG to earmark a certain amount from the regional budget for clean - up work on the GPE river , stating that the work would reduce the area in danger of flooding in the event of the sudden evacuation of water from the reservoir . It does not appear that this request was heeded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a committee of officials from ORG drew up a report presenting the results of the examination of the GPE river bed . The report stated that the part of the river that fell within the CARDINAL zone under the responsibility of ORG was being kept clear , whereas the river channel and floodplain outside that zone were overgrown with bushes and trees and littered with household waste and bodies of old cars . The report also noted that owners of private houses on the river banks had narrowed the channel by piling earth into the river in an attempt to enlarge the size of their plots of land . Moreover , earth was regularly excavated and removed from the river banks , with the result that the banks crumbled and were washed away . The committee recommended that the municipal authorities clear the bushes and trees from the floodplain , deepen the channel , clear the river bed and banks of household waste and car bodies and restore the banks to their natural state .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG instructed the city authorities to take a number of measures to prevent emergency situations in connection with the possible flooding of rivers during DATE . It indicated , in particular , that it was necessary to verify the condition of water evacuation systems , bridges and river beds and channels , to check and activate the early warning system , to check whether rescue services were prepared for flood situations and to equip them with means of communication . It is unclear whether any such measures were taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME a regional meteorological service forwarded a storm warning for DATE to the Primorskiy regional and the GPE city authorities .

On DATE , on the basis of the aforementioned warning , ORG calculated that the water inflow to the NORP reservoir , which had a maximum storage capacity of QUANTITY and which on DATE contained QUANTITY , would be QUANTITY . Having regard to these calculations , ORG started releasing QUANTITY of water per second from the reservoir .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it started raining TIME . The intensity of the rain proved to be much higher than forecast by the meteorological service DATE . The amount of rain that fell on DATE was the equivalent of DATE rainfall . In particular , within a CARDINALhour period the amount of rain that fell in the area of the Pionerskoye reservoir totalled CARDINAL to QUANTITY . The rain was heaviest QUANTITY , when QUANTITY fell .", "CARDINAL . Until TIME on DATE , water was released from the NORP reservoir at the rate of QUANTITY per second .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicants , because of the urgent release of a large quantity of water from the GPE reservoir on DATE , a large area around the reservoir was instantly flooded , including the area where the applicants resided . In the ORG submission , the water arrived and rose very quickly at some point TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , no emergency warning had been given before the flood . The Government referred to a letter of ORG of ORG in LOC , dated DATE , to the effect that at the relevant time there had been no local emergency warning system in place at the NORP reservoir .", "CARDINAL . According to the first applicant , a disabled person , on the date in question she was at home and found out about the flood from her daughter and granddaughter , who came running to her flat to help her out to a safe place . Just as they reached her home , the water started rising rapidly , and by the time her relatives had helped her out onto the roof of the building , the water had reached waist level in the flat and was much deeper in the courtyard . In the first applicant \u2019s submission , her home and belongings , land , outhouses and CARDINAL cars were flooded .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was not at home DATE as she was at work . Her disabled brother , who was at home during the flood , apparently later told her that at TIME water started rising from the cellar and within TIME the house was flooded . According to the second applicant , some of her belongings were washed out of the house and some damaged by the water , which remained in the house for some time .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant was at home with her DATE son when the flat was instantly flooded . She managed to dress the boy and to escape , wading breast - deep to a nearby motorway , which at that point had not yet been flooded ; from there she took a bus to a safe place . Soon after the third applicant had left , all motorways in the vicinity were submerged and the public transport lines disrupted . In the third applicant \u2019s submission , her property was severely damaged by the flood .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant , the third applicant \u2019s mother - in - law , was at work when the flood occurred . She returned home in TIME and , according to her , suffered severe distress when she found her daughter - in - law and grandson missing and her home and possessions ruined .", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant was at work when the flood occurred . His son , A. B. , who had been at home at the time , told him what had happened . According to PERSON , at around TIME he heard the sound of seething water in the cellar and then saw water running from the street into the cellar . He looked out into the courtyard and realised that the water level was rising fast . He tried to leave but was unable to open the front door because the water in the street was already QUANTITY high . PERSON then jumped through a window into the flooded street , where the water was above shoulder level . He swam to a nearby shed , through seething water among household belongings , planks , logs and other litter . He managed to climb onto the roof of the shed and saw the surging water destroy sheds and fences , while people screaming in panic swam to any elevated places they could reach . According to the fifth applicant , when he returned home in TIME the water had already subsided . In his submission , his house and its contents and his land , outhouses and car were all damaged by the water .", "CARDINAL . The sixth applicant and her CARDINAL-year - old son were at home when the flood began . They opened the door to the street and their home was instantly flooded with water . They rushed out into the street , where within TIME the water had risen to breast height . According to the sixth applicant , she was in a state of shock , as she could not swim . Her son swam away and brought a ladder , which enabled them to climb onto the roof of a garage . In the sixth applicant \u2019s submission , her house and belongings , land and outhouses were all flooded .", "CARDINAL . As far as can be ascertained from the parties\u2019 submissions , the water in the first CARDINAL ORG flats reached a height of QUANTITY ; in the fifth applicant \u2019s home the level was between CARDINAL and QUANTITY and in the sixth applicant \u2019s flat , QUANTITY . According to the applicants , the water remained at those levels for DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , no evacuation of the population from the flooded area had been organised following the flood of DATE . In their submission , they had had to find their own way to safety , and subsequently to cope with the consequences of the flooding on their own .", "CARDINAL . The documents submitted by the Government indicate that by a decision of DATE ORG ordered that a number of rescue measures be carried out . A similar decision was taken on DATE by ORG of the Primorskiy Region .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , those affected by the flood had been evacuated and provided with food and accommodation at temporary accommodation centres . Also , staff from various rescue services had been sent to the flooded area .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG reported to ORG on the measures taken in the period from DATE to provide those affected by the flood and the personnel engaged in the rescue operation with food and drinking water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC prosecutor \u2019s office opened a criminal investigation in connection with the flood of DATE . At some point criminal proceedings were brought against PERSON , the director of ORG , on suspicion of his having committed an offence punishable under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( professional negligence ) . The case was assigned the number DATE .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL decisions of DATE the investigator in charge declared the first applicant both victim and civil claimant in the case . It appears that at some point the second , fourth , fifth and sixth applicants were also granted victim status . The sixth and fifth applicants were informed of the relevant decisions in letters from ORG of the ORG dated DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge inspected the scene of the incident at the first applicant \u2019s domicile and questioned her . The first applicant stated that she had spent DATE at home . It had been raining but at first there had been no water in the courtyard . At TIME a wave of water had swept in from the direction of the Pionerskoye reservoir and within TIME the water level had risen to QUANTITY . The first applicant said that there had been no prior warning of any evacuation of water from the NORP reservoir . She further stated that she had been living in her flat for DATE and had never been warned that the flat was located in a flood zone . This was the first time that such large - scale flooding had happened . She also listed the property lost in the flood and indicated its value .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge inspected the scene of the flooding at the fifth applicant \u2019s domicile . The ensuing report attested , in particular , to the presence of traces on the walls at a height of QUANTITY , left by water which had remained in the LOC for a prolonged period . The investigator also questioned the fifth applicant , who stated that he had been away from home when the flooding had occurred and had been informed of the event by his son . DATE he had returned home at TIME and the water had already subsided . The fifth applicant also said that there had been no prior warning of any evacuation of water from the NORP reservoir . He had lived in the house for DATE and had never been warned that it was located in a flood zone . The fifth applicant also listed the property lost in the flood and indicated its value .", "CARDINAL . At some point the investigating authorities questioned the second applicant , who stated that she had been living in her flat for DATE and that it was only during DATE that the building in which she lived had been regularly flooded , which she explained by the absence of proper drains along the roads and the fact that the GPE river was littered and obstructed by unauthorised structures . She explained that on DATE , at TIME , water had started rising from the cellar of the building in which she lived and filled her flat within TIME . There had been no prior warning concerning any evacuation of water from the NORP reservoir and she had not seen any officials from the district or city authorities on CARDINAL or DATE . She indicated the amount of the pecuniary damage she had suffered as a result of the flood .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant was also questioned as a witness and made oral statements similar to those of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating authorities ordered that the criminal proceedings against Mr L. be discontinued owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence in his actions . According to the decision , the preliminary investigation had established that because of exceptionally heavy rains on DATE the water level in the NORP reservoir had been close to critical , with the result that there was a real risk of a dam breaking , which could have claimed numerous lives and caused extensive pecuniary damage , and that in ordering the evacuation of water from the reservoir Mr L. had acted within his competence and in full compliance with the relevant regulations and had thus prevented more extensive damage to the residents of GPE . At the same time , according to an expert report of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the main reason for the flood of DATE had been the poor state of the channel of the GPE river , and in particular the fact that it had been overgrown with trees and bushes and obstructed by various structures . On DATE the investigating authorities accordingly ordered that separate criminal proceedings be brought under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( abuse of power ) against officials of the GPE municipal and the Primorskiy regional authorities in that connection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC of GPE ( \u201c the district prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) brought criminal proceedings in case no . DATE against officials of the GPE municipal and Primorskiy regional authorities under LAW ( abuse of power ) on suspicion on them having , in excess of their power , allocated plots of land for individual housing construction within a water protection zone of the GPE river .

NORP In letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively the prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC ( \u201c the regional prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) informed the second and fourth applicants that the investigation in case no . DATE had been repeatedly suspended owing to the lack of any evidence of a crime and then reopened , and that on the CARDINAL most recent occasions it had been suspended and resumed on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating authorities discontinued the proceedings in case no . DATE , referring to the absence of evidence that a crime had been committed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision stated that , in accordance with an applicable governmental regulation , a water protection zone should be delimited in a city \u2019s general development plan or , in the absence of such a plan , should be established by a regional administrative authority . Moreover , in accordance with the relevant construction rules and regulations , construction of residential and non - residential buildings and , in particular , the allocation of plots of land for individual house building , was prohibited in water protection zones ( \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b ) as well as in catastrophic flood hazard zones ( \u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) . These latter zones were defined as areas where water levels during a flood could reach QUANTITY and where flooding could cause death , destroy residential and non - residential buildings and disable industrial equipment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision noted , with reference to the findings of the investigation , that when the NORP reservoir had been built in DATE , no severe flood hazard zone had been delimited in the adjacent area as no methods existed in GPE for identifying such zones until DATE . It was stated in the decision that an attempt to identify such zones in the city of GPE had been made at some point in DATE , when an expert agency was commissioned to prepare a feasibility study on the \u201c Protection of GPE from Floods \u201d , in the context of the federal programme for the protection of territories from typhoons and floods . However , the resulting document had not been duly registered with the competent ORG authority and had thus remained ineffective and could not be taken into account in elaborating town planning restrictions . As a result , no potential flood zones or catastrophic flood hazard zones , including the GPE river valley , had ever been delimited in the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan .", "CARDINAL . The decision also stated that no water protection zones had ever been marked in the city \u2019s general development plan either . ORG , which by virtue of the aforementioned governmental regulation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been under obligation to establish such zones , had repeatedly failed to do so despite requests from the competent ORG agencies , with the result that regulations imposing town planning restrictions , particularly those restricting construction of individual houses within such zones , had remained inoperative . Not until DATE had the Governor of the Primorskiy Region finally adopted a decree establishing a water protection zone that included the GPE river valley . The decree required the GPE authorities to delimit water protection zones in the city \u2019s general development plan , but the instruction was not followed as it would have meant updating that plan , which in turn would have meant conducting an ecological impact assessment of the plan . According to the decision of DATE , ORG had not yet submitted the city \u2019s general development plan with water protection zones marked on it to ORG for impact assessment .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above findings , the decision concluded that prior to CARDINAL September CARDINAL , when no water protection zones had been established by the Primorskiy regional authorities , any town planning restrictions concerning construction activities in such zones had been inoperative , officials of ORG could not be said to have exceeded their powers when allocating plots of land on the banks of the GPE river at that time . After that date , no plots of land had been allocated within that zone . The decision thus confirmed that all the properties on the banks of the GPE river that had been flooded on DATE , including the buildings in which the applicants lived , had been built before DATE , that is , lawfully .", "CARDINAL . It also stated that construction activities along the GPE river in the area downstream of the reservoir at present were allowed within the limits of the site where buildings already existed , that no zones where new construction was prohibited were delimited in the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan , that no demolition or transfer of previously constructed buildings was planned , and that the owners and leaseholders of those buildings and plots of land were entitled to use and dispose of them , and in particular to construct new buildings in the place of old ones .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision also stated that there were no legal instruments or documents governing clean - up operations in the downstream area of the GPE river channel . Also , according to the decision , since DATE ORG for ORG in the Primorskiy Region ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) had been making DATE inspections of the GPE river channel . The results revealed that ORG had cleared the part of the river channel near the NORP reservoir ; but the area downstream of that zone was only cleared sporadically by the people living there . The decision further stated that in view of the need to keep the channel of the GPE river clear ORG had submitted suggestions to ORG concerning measures to be taken with respect to the GPE river in DATE , DATE and DATE , including clean - up work . It did not indicate whether those suggestions had been accepted and implemented .", "CARDINAL . The decision went on to note that the LOC reservoir belonged to the regional authorities and was operated by ORG . Under domestic law , the owner of the reservoir and the body operating it were responsible for ensuring its safe exploitation . Accordingly , the authorities of LOC and ORG were under obligation to secure the safe evacuation of water from the reservoir , which meant ensuring the necessary throughput capacity of the river channel below the dam . The decision further stated that , according to the relevant governmental decree , the proper technical and sanitary maintenance of reservoirs and use of water resources obeyed rules of exploitation of reservoirs to be elaborated by the owners of the reservoirs or the bodies operating them . It was the owner of the NORP reservoir and the body operating it who were responsible for planning and carrying out measures to ensure its proper functioning .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of DATE , the investigation remained suspended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office ordered that the materials of criminal case no . DATE be sent to the investigation department of LOC of GPE ( \u201c the district investigation department \u201d ) for examination , with a view to setting aside the decision of DATE by which the criminal proceedings in the case had been discontinued . The decision of CARDINAL DATE stated , in particular , that the decision of DATE had been unfounded , as the investigation had not made any assessment of the GPE authorities\u2019 failure to clear and clean up the GPE river channel , or the failure of the GPE city and the Primorskiy regional authorities to delimit water protection and riverside zones in the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan , to determine the legal status of the land adjacent to the GPE river , to comply with the regulations governing the exploitation of that land and to make the necessary changes to the feasibility study on ORG from Floods \u201d so that it finally became operative .", "CARDINAL .

In the ORG \u2019s submission , this report stated that because of the exceptional meteorological conditions on DATE , when the actual rainfall exceeded several times the amount forecast , it had not been possible to avoid a sudden large - scale evacuation of water from the NORP reservoir . According to the Government , the report further stated that the actions of ORG on the date in question had been in compliance with relevant regulations and correct , and in particular the water release regime chosen by ORG on DATE had been close to optimal . According to the report , on DATE TIME the evacuation of water remained at its maximum rate of QUANTITY . In the Government \u2019s submission , if the Pionerskoye reservoir had not existed , rainwater would have flooded to the mouth of the GPE river at a maximum rate of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . An expert examination of the area flooded on DATE was carried out DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The resulting report , dated DATE , was entitled \u201c On the flooding of non - residential and residential objects in the area downstream of [ the NORP reservoir ] ... as a result of the evacuation of rainwater by the reservoir on [ DATE ] \u201d . It described the system for evacuating excess water from the LOC reservoir as comprising an open spillway with a floodgate situated below the normal water level , and a siphon spillway . The maximum throughput capacity of each of the CARDINAL spillways was equal to QUANTITY per second . According to the technical documentation of the Pionerskoye reservoir , excess water should normally be evacuated through the open spillway by operating the floodgate . The siphon spillway was to be activated automatically only if the water level was still rising when the floodgate was fully open .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report explained the sudden increase in the water level in the reservoir on DATE by the exceptionally heavy rain on DATE , which had been much heavier than forecast , making it necessary to evacuate water . It confirmed that the type of flooding that occurred on DATE was thought to occur only once a century .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also noted the extensive damage caused by the flood , listing in particular the residential buildings which had been flooded near the GPE river , including those in which the applicants lived , and indicated that over much of the flooded area the water had been CARDINAL to QUANTITY deep .", "DATE . The report further confirmed that the river bed was overgrown with vegetation and littered with household waste , that its course had been significantly altered by human activity and that a number of unauthorised constructions , including road bridges and footbridges , had been built , reducing its throughput capacity .", "CARDINAL . The report concluded that the staff of ORG had done well in evacuating the water from the NORP reservoir on DATE . In particular , after partially opening the floodgate of the open spillway for a short time , the staff had then opened the gate completely . However , the water evacuated had flowed down the river in the form of a wave , which had magnified its destructive effect , and the presence of debris and constructions in the floodplain had considerably contributed to raising the water level during the flood . In particular , the presence of bridges and service pipelines at some points on the GPE river had increased the water level by QUANTITY , which had been the main reason for the destruction of a road and railway bridges at the mouth of the river .", "CARDINAL . The report also stated that under the relevant planning and development rules and regulations governing urban and rural settlements , territories where residential and non - residential buildings had been constructed or were to be constructed should be protected from floods of once - a - century proportions like the one on DATE . The same regulations prohibited the construction of various buildings in catastrophic flood hazard zones .", "CARDINAL . The report went on to note that the instruction for the exploitation of the LOC reservoir made it clear that no constructions should be allowed in the area downstream of the reservoir without measures being taken to protect that area from floods . According to the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan , there should be no building development in the area downstream of the NORP reservoir ; any individual housing as well as recreational and industrial facilities located in that area should therefore be demolished or transferred .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report further concluded that all building development in the area downstream of the reservoir from its very beginning had been , and was being , carried out in breach of the relevant technical standards and the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan . It added that the constant increase in the density of constructions in the area downstream of the reservoir in the absence of any measures to protect the area from floods led to increased losses when floods occurred .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE a commission of officials from ORG drew up a report presenting the results of the inspection of the flat where the third and fourth applicants lived . The report listed in detail the damaged possessions and stated that the resulting damage amounted to MONEY ( \u201c RUB \u201d , MONEY , \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a similar report was drawn up following the inspection by the same authority of the fifth applicant \u2019s home . The report confirmed that the fifth applicant \u2019s house , its contents , the outhouses and land and CARDINAL cars had been damaged as a result of the flood , and indicated that the damage amounted to RUB MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . It also mentioned that during the flood the water in the fifth applicant \u2019s house had reached a level of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE to the third and fourth ORG complaint , ORG stated that according to the information at their disposal , the human factor had played a role in the flood of DATE , as the water had not been released from the reservoir until a critical situation had emerged where a large volume of water had to be evacuated urgently to save the dam . The letter further stated that the work done by the city authorities to clear the river channel had not helped to prevent the houses and other structures from being flooded because the evacuation of water by ORG had been sudden and massive , with the result that even special concrete waterfronts of the dam outlet channel had been broken . The letter went on to say that the reservoir was the property of the regional authorities and therefore the GPE city authorities had no power to reprimand staff of ORG . However , criminal proceedings had been brought in connection with the pecuniary damage suffered by residents of GPE and the disruption of transport lines during the heavy rains and the evacuation of water from the NORP reservoir which should lead to the punishment of those responsible . Also , ORG had filed a civil claim requesting that the actions of ORG be found unlawful . Lastly , the letter stated that compensation for pecuniary damage would only be possible from the federal budget ( a request to that effect had already been sent to ORG ) and from insurance companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that funds be allocated for restoration work in the area flooded on DATE and financial support to the victims of the flood . By a decree of DATE the Governor of ORG ordered the distribution of the funds allocated by the Government . According to the Government , the first applicant received a lump sum of RUB CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and the remaining applicants each received RUB CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in financial support . Also , according to the Government , the victims of the flood could each have received QUANTITY of coal with a PERCENT discount .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the Primorskiy Region informed the second applicant that so far no work had been carried out to repair the consequences of the flood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office sent a request ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) to the head of ORG . An inquiry by the prosecutor \u2019s office had established that over DATE the city authorities had not taken any measures to remedy the consequences of the flood of DATE and , in particular , that the GPE river remained abundantly littered with household and other debris , including large fragments of concrete structures destroyed during the flood , as well as wood and silt . The prosecutor \u2019s office went on to say that the city authorities\u2019 inactivity was putting the lives of the people living along the river in danger , since in view of the heavy rainfall in DATE and the need to evacuate water from the NORP reservoir , there was a real risk of a flood similar to that of DATE . The prosecutor \u2019s office thus urged the city authorities to carry out clean - up work and to inform it of the results within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In similar letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , the regional prosecutor \u2019s office notified the fourth and second applicants of the status of the proceedings in cases nos . DATE and DATE and stated that , following its requests of DATE , work had been carried out to clean up the GPE river , financed by the regional budget . Also , further funds would be allocated for flood protection work in the area close to the GPE river . The fourth applicant was also informed of her right to be declared a civil claimant in criminal case no . DATE , and sought compensation for the pecuniary damage she had suffered as a result of the flood of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office further replied to the fourth applicant that an expert inquiry had confirmed that the building in which she lived was in an unsound state following the flood and that repair work was necessary . According to the letter , ORG had been asked to do the work .", "CARDINAL . In a working report of CARDINAL DATE the head of ORG informed the deputy head of ORG that the residential quarters near the GPE river were regularly flooded during heavy storms because the river was full of litter and obstructed by earth dumped into it for construction work , as well as the absence or poor state of drainage along the streets in the affected area , including FAC . A series of measures were needed to protect the city of GPE from floods and , in particular , to clear the GPE river and equip the streets in the area near the river with a proper drainage system .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG notified the second applicant of the allocation in DATE of funds for work to repair the consequences of the flood of DATE . According to the letter , the work was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a complaint from the second applicant , the regional prosecutor \u2019s office confirmed that ORG had failed thus far to take any measures to prevent Semiradskiy Street from being flooded and , in particular , to carry out the work indicated in the working report of DATE , and that no budgetary funds had been or were being allocated for such work .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office further informed the second applicant that the authorities were currently working on a fortification project to protect GPE , including the area near the GPE river , from floods , that funds for the work had been assigned from the federal budget and that the work would be completed on schedule .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the second applicant that no funds had been appropriated for clean - up work in the GPE river in the DATE budget .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought CARDINAL separate sets of civil proceedings against LOC and GPE authorities and DATE save for the second and fifth applicants \u2013 ORG , seeking damages for their lost property as well as compensation for the anguish and distress they had suffered during the flood of DATE . They claimed that the flood had had such devastating effects mainly because of the poor state of the channel of the GPE river and the drainage system and the authorities\u2019 failure to check and clear them . The first and second applicants reported that during the flood the water in their flats had risen to a height of QUANTITY and remained at that level for a long time . The fifth applicant reported that during the flood the water in his house had risen to a height of QUANTITY and remained at that level for TIME . The sixth applicant reported that she had been at home during the flood and that the water in her flat had risen instantaneously to above head level and remained at that level for a long time .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of DATE , a judgment of CARDINAL DATE and a judgment of DATE , all very similar , ORG of FAC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed the claims brought respectively by DATE applicants . It noted , in particular , that according to the expert report of DATE the action taken by ORG in a situation of extremely heavy rainfall had been correct . The court further referred to an expert report of CARDINAL DATE which had found that the flood had been caused by the fact that the river channel had been narrowed by various structures and overgrown with vegetation , whereas the action taken by ORG in the circumstances had been correct . The court concluded that both expert reports suggested that the heavy rainfall had been the main cause of the flood .", "CARDINAL . The court also referred to the investigating authorities\u2019 decision of DATE to discontinue criminal proceedings against PERSON , the director of ORG , owing to the absence of any constituent elements of a crime in his actions , and the decision of DATE to discontinue criminal proceedings against officials of the city of GPE and LOC for lack of evidence of a crime .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that under the relevant legislation waterways like the GPE river could not be municipally owned , so there had been no obligation on ORG to assign funds from the local budget for clean - up work on the river . The GPE authorities had requested ORG to assign money for the work from the regional budget .", "CARDINAL . The court thus concluded that no fault could be attached to any of the defendants for the damage sustained by the relevant applicants , which had been the result of force majeur . In the court \u2019s opinion that conclusion was corroborated by the fact that following the flood , in the period between CARDINAL and DATE , the authorities had declared an emergency situation throughout the city of GPE and not only in the flooded area near the GPE river .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Primorskiy Regional Court ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) upheld on appeal the judgment delivered in the second applicant \u2019s case . It confirmed that the GPE city authorities had had no obligation to clear the GPE river as it was not municipal property , and that any clean - up work should have been carried out by ORG . The court went on to say that it followed from the CARDINAL expert reports relied on by the first - instance court that even if the GPE river channel and floodplain had been cleared it could not be excluded that the residential buildings near the river , including the one in which the second applicant lived , would nevertheless have been flooded , taking into account the exceptional intensity of the rains on the date in question . The court also noted that the defendants had offered welfare aid to the victims of the flood , including the second applicant , within the amount assigned for that purpose , and that her claim regarding pecuniary damage had not been supported by any documentary evidence and was therefore unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG also upheld on appeal the judgments given in the first , fifth and sixth ORG cases , adhering to the reasoning of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment in the case brought by the third and fourth applicants . It based its findings on expert reports of CARDINAL May and DATE and DATE produced in the context of the investigation in criminal case no . DATE and on other materials in that criminal case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court established that the NORP reservoir was run by ORG and was the property of the regional authorities . It also noted that since DATE a special - purpose federal programme on protection of LOC from floods had been in progress , and that it was the Primorskiy regional authorities who had requested that programme and controlled the receipt and use of the funds earmarked for that purpose . The court went on to say that the programme had envisaged extensive work to reconstruct and build flood - protection facilities in inhabited areas , including the GPE river channel , and the construction of a water evacuation channel .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further stated that all CARDINAL aforementioned expert reports had established that no measures to implement the federal programme in question had been taken . It then described in detail the poor state of the GPE river channel .", "ORG . The court also referred to the decision of DATE in which ORG had urged the city authorities to clear the GPE river channel ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and to a report by a committee of officials from ORG dated DATE , which reflected on the poor state of the ORG river channel and invited the city authorities to have it cleared ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court noted that the city authorities had not adduced any evidence that any such measures had been taken , or that the authorities had ever complied with their own decisions .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the defendants had not adduced any evidence confirming that the GPE river was regional property and that there was any separation of powers between the regional and municipal authorities concerning the maintenance of the GPE river , which , in the court \u2019s opinion , had led to the inactivity and shifting of responsibility by officials at various levels . The court stressed that proper , reasonable maintenance and exploitation of the river by the authorities would have helped avoid such drastic consequences .", "CARDINAL . As regards the action taken by ORG , the court found it established that the third and fourth ORG flat had remained intact until the large - scale evacuation of water by ORG on DATE , following which the flat had been instantly flooded . The court concluded that on DATE in question ORG had evacuated a large quantity of water which had overflowed the river banks and flooded the residential area . The court rejected an argument of ORG representative that if the water had not been evacuated the reservoir would have burst its banks , which might have caused more serious damage . The court noted in this connection that in view of the weather conditions ORG should have evacuated water in smaller quantities over a longer period of time .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court thus attributed responsibility for the events of DATE to all CARDINAL defendants , stating that they should have foreseen the adverse consequences and prevented them , but failed to do so . It stated that the GPE fault in the damage caused by the flooding of residential buildings situated in the vicinity of the NORP reservoir was established by the expert reports of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the third and fourth ORG claims , the court established , on the basis of the available evidence , that the fourth applicant was the owner of the damaged flat , where she was living with her husband , her son and daughter - in - law ( the third applicant ) and a grandchild . The court further examined an evaluation report drawn up in the fourth applicant \u2019s presence by a competent ORG authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court noted that the report was signed by the fourth applicant , who had never disputed the amount of the damage indicated therein . Moreover , she confirmed to the court that as a civil claimant in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the incident of DATE , she had claimed the same amount . The court therefore granted the fourth applicant \u2019s claim for pecuniary damage in the amount reflected in the evaluation report and found the remainder of that claim , as well as the third applicant \u2019s claim for pecuniary damage , unsubstantiated , given in particular the fact that the third applicant lived in the fourth applicant \u2019s flat , and all the damaged possessions in the flat had already been listed and the resulting damage assessed in the aforementioned evaluation report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination . It noted , in particular , that in stating that ORG had funds at its disposal in the context of the federal programme to protect the region from floods , the first - instance court had not checked whether any funds from the federal budget had ever been allocated to the Primorskiy regional authorities and , if so , how they had been used . Therefore , in ORG opinion the lower court \u2019s finding concerning the regional authorities\u2019 failure to have work carried out in the GPE river had not been based on the materials of the case .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court also noted that the fact that ORG was regionally owned , in itself , could not be regarded as engaging the responsibility of ORG , as ORG was a legal entity , and the responsibility of an owner of an entity such as ORG could be limited by relevant civil law provisions or that entity \u2019s constituent documents . ORG further stated that in the first - instance judgment no distinction had been made between the consequences of the exceptionally heavy rain on DATE and those of the authorities\u2019 alleged failure to take measures to prevent flooding .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the third and fourth ORG claims in their entirety as unsubstantiated . The judgment was based essentially on the same reasoning as the judgments given in the cases brought by the first , second , fifth and sixth applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal . It stated that when rejecting the third and fourth ORG claims , the first - instance court concluded that the flood of DATE had been caused by a natural disaster whose extent could not have been foreseen by the defendants or avoided as a result of any purposeful action on their part .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the first - instance court had duly examined and rightly dismissed the PERSON arguments to the effect that the defendants should be held liable for the destructive consequences of the evacuation of water from the reservoir . The appellate court referred to the expert report of DATE , which stated that the actions of ORG on DATE had been correct and explained the flood on that date by the presence downstream of the NORP reservoir of unauthorised constructions built in breach of the city of GPE \u2019s general development plan , and the presence of debris and constructions in the floodplain of the GPE river .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the expert report of CARDINAL DATE stated that the cause of the flood had been the fact that the river channel was narrowed by constructions and overgrown with vegetation , and that the water evacuation strategy used by the Pionerskoye reservoir on the date in question had been optimal .", "CARDINAL . The court also quoted the expert report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had established that the vegetation obstructing the river channel had helped to reduce the force of the wave following the evacuation of water from the reservoir , and that if the water had been evacuated \u201c in accordance with the relevant instruction \u201d , the area would have been flooded regardless , but the level of water would have been CARDINAL times lower . The report also noted that ORG had not taken measures to alert the population with a view to minimising the damage caused by the flood .", "CARDINAL . ORG then concluded that all CARDINAL expert reports singled out the exceptionally heavy rain as the main reason for the flood on DATE , and that they considered it likely that flooding would have occurred irrespective of the evacuation of water by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court accordingly found that ORG had correctly concluded , on the basis of the available materials , that in view of the exceptionally heavy rainfall , the GPE", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides for damage caused to the property of an individual or of a legal entity to be compensated for in full by the person responsible for the damage . The latter may be released from the obligation to make compensation if he or she can prove that the damage was not caused through his or her fault ; however , the law may provide for compensation in respect of damage even in the absence of fault on the part of the person who caused it .
