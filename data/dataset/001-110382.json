By a judgment of DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action for divorce , awarded sole custody of the child to O.M.M. , and ordered the applicant to pay DATE child support . By relying on witness statements and on ORG ( PERSON ) social investigation and recommendation the court held that the mother was the child \u2019s main caregiver . Consequently , it considered that the mother was able to ensure PERSON \u2019s emotional and physical development , and that her presence was still essential , given the young age of the child . The judgment was final , as neither the applicant nor O.M.M. appealed against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE attached to ORG ( ORG \u015fi Protec\u0163ia Copilului \u2013 PERSON de Interven\u0163ie pentru PERSON ) produced a psychosocial report in respect of PERSON According to the report ORG carried out an investigation into the case after they were informed by O.M.M. that the child \u2019s father had behaved inappropriately towards his daughter by bathing with her without wearing underwear , and had neglected the child when she was left alone with him . The report also stated that following a discussion with both parents they accused one another of inappropriate behaviour towards the child which negatively influenced the minor \u2019s behaviour . In addition O.M.M. also accused the applicant of being physically aggressive towards her in DATE . Consequently , both parents were invited , and agreed , to attend psychological counselling sessions at GPE for Abused Children . The child \u2019s father was informed on several occasions that his behaviour in bathing naked with his daughter could influence his relationship with her and could have unforeseen negative consequences . The report concluded that the child \u2019s situation needed to be monitored and that the parents needed to continue the psychological counselling sessions within the centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached to ORG produced a psychological evaluation report in respect of PERSON The report stated , inter alia , that the child was developing normally for her age . She felt closer to her mother and evaluated her in positive terms . She started being upset when she was asked about her father . The father was represented in a negative way because of the tense situation between the parents . None of the father \u2019s actions were received positively , and she did not wish her father to visit , because of the tense situation with her mother . She considered her father \u2019s visits to be a negative process . Her father was excluded from the description of her family , which in her opinion consisted of her mother and her maternal grandparents . She refused to discuss any potential sexual abuse by her father . The report concluded that the child was scarred by the tense situation between her parents , and that consequently she did not wish to receive visits from her father . Moreover , there was no clear evidence that she had been sexually abused by either of her parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached to ORG informed the Government , inter alia , that attempts were being made to mediate the relationship between the applicant and his former wife to help them protect the best interest of their child . In DATE the parents were asked to attend psychological counselling sessions . After CARDINAL meetings the applicant decided that the sessions were useless and discontinued attending them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought injunction proceedings against DATE , seeking to establish a schedule for visiting rights . He requested the court to order O.M.M. to allow him to see his daughter on DATE , on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ; DATE for ORG and CARDINAL for DATE every DATE ; in DATE ; DATE between ORG , ORG and ORG ; and to allow him to leave the country with the child for DATE during the time they spent together and in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action in part , seeking to establish a schedule for visiting rights . Relying on the statements of the parties\u2019 witnesses and on the report produced by ORG attached to ORG , the court held that the father could visit the child and spend TIME with her in the mother \u2019s absence . The absence of her mother would avoid any stressful situation for the child caused by the tension between the parents . Also the contact with her father would be welcomed by and beneficial for the child as long as GPE needed the attention of both parents for her balanced emotional and physical development , which could not be achieved in the presence of both parents . According to the social investigation carried out at the applicant \u2019s home , his living conditions were appropriate . The fact that the supplement to the social investigation , which the court did not order , mentioned that the rooms of his home looked unwelcoming , without providing details on why they would be unfit to host a child , could not be considered a well - grounded reason for refusing the applicant contact with his daughter . Moreover , DATE \u2019s arguments that the applicant was not capable of taking care of the child were rebutted by the available witness statements .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s request to be allowed to occasionally take the child out of the country the district court held that regardless of the parent \u2019s position , the minor had a legal right to meet her relatives , including the paternal ones . The paternal relatives met the child and had her wellbeing at heart . In PERSON \u2019s case , she enjoyed ties with both NORP and NORP cultures , and she could not be denied the right to maintain those direct contacts with the CARDINAL countries . In addition , no evidence supported O.M.M. \u2019s argument that the applicant would fail to return the child to GPE . The child had been left alone with the applicant before and he had always returned her to her mother . Moreover , the witnesses stated that whenever O.M.M. did not agree to leave the child alone with him he did not insist on DATE doing so . Also , she never expressed concern that the applicant would fail to return the child to her . The applicant \u2019s failure to indicate the dates for travelling abroad and for returning to GPE by providing plane tickets could not be considered arguments for the dismissal of his request , as it was the court \u2019s task to set those dates . Also , the applicant had provided the names and addresses of all his relatives , where he would like to take the child . Consequently , after it had been established that the schedule suggested by the applicant was not in the minor \u2019s best interest , the court set a contact rights programme for the applicant and allowed him to take the child away from DATE \u2019s home , even in her absence and without her consent : on DATE , on DATE and CARDINAL August ; DATE on DATE , a week at ORG and DATE . In addition , the court allowed the applicant to take the child out of GPE , even without DATE \u2019s consent , DATE at LOC and for DATE and yearly between CARDINAL and DATE . The parties appealed against the judgment . O.M.M. asked the court , inter alia , to order a psychological evaluation of the child , but the applicant contested DATE \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed O.M.M. \u2019s request for a psychological evaluation of the child , on the ground that it would be inconclusive for the case , and allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal in part . It also allowed the applicant to take the child away from DATE \u2019s home DATE on DATE , even in her absence , and upheld the judgment of DATE . The judgment became final on DATE , as the parties\u2019 appeal on points of law ( recurs ) was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , following DATE \u2019s and his daughter \u2019s move to GPE on an unspecified date in DATE , the applicant brought proceedings against DATE , seeking a new contact schedule and an injunction for his daughter to be brought to his home at DATE \u2019s expense under the penalty of CARDINAL new NORP lei ( PERSON ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in DATE compensation for any delay on the following dates : every second DATE ; DATE on DATE , at ORG and at DATE ; and DATE QUANTITY August .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action in part . It held that the change of the child \u2019s residence to a different country justified the applicant \u2019s action for a new contact schedule . However , the court considered that the schedule suggested by the applicant was too tiring for the child , taking into account her young age and her need to attend school . In this respect the court held that the Orthodox Easter period would prove a good opportunity for the applicant to visit his daughter at her home and would give him the opportunity to meet the child in a familiar environment for the latter . For DATE , when the applicant and his daughter could spend more time together , he was allowed to take his daughter away from her mother \u2019s home , since there would be enough time for the child to rest and play . Moreover , the court considered that the parents must share the child \u2019s travelling expenses for DATE , while the travelling expenses for GPE would be incurred by the father . Furthermore , on account of DATE \u2019s previous obstructive behaviour with regard to the enforcement of judgments , the court ordered her to pay a ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) DATE compensation for any delay if she failed to comply with the contact schedule established by the court , as follows : DATE at ORG at the child \u2019s home in GPE , at the applicant \u2019s expense and CARDINAL DATE at both GPE expense ; and DATE every DATE at both GPE expense . The applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , in part . It held that DATE at ORG , the child was to travel to GPE and stay at the applicant \u2019s home . The expenses would be borne by both parents and the child would be accompanied by the mother on the outbound flight from GPE and by the father on the return flight home . Moreover , the father could travel to visit his daughter DATE for DATE , while the mother had to bring the child to GPE to her father \u2019s home DATE for DATE . Both parents had to pay their own travelling expenses . The DATE travel visits could not take place around the LOC and DATE , when the contact schedule established by the first - instance court applied . Lastly , it upheld the remaining provisions of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant informed the ORG on an unspecified date in DATE that NORP had appealed on points of law ( recurat ) against the judgment of DATE , and that her appeal ( recurs ) had been allowed . He submitted that the contact schedule had been changed by the final judgment , in so far as he was forced to travel to GPE on DATE to see his daughter . Moreover , according to him the judgment did not refer to the mother \u2019s duty to bring his daughter to him for DATE . Furthermore , for GPE he would be able to see his daughter once DATE starting from DATE , but only for DATE and not for DATE . The LOC holiday was the only time the courts had ordered the mother to bring PERSON to him . The applicant did not submit a copy of the alleged final judgment to the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE a bailiff employed by the applicant attempted to enforce the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The enforcement reports produced by the bailiff on the same dates stated that DATE had left her home with the intention of preventing the enforcement of the judgment , although she had been notified of the bailiff \u2019s visits ; and also that she allowed the applicant to see his daughter at her home and in her presence but did not agree for him to take her away .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a bailiff employed by the applicant attempted to enforce the judgment of DATE . The enforcement report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that O.M.M. had allowed the applicant to see his daughter at her home but did not agree that he could take her elsewhere , because PERSON refused to leave with her father . Eventually , the CARDINAL parents agreed that their daughter could leave if she was accompanied by her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff employed by the applicant attempted to enforce the judgment of DATE . On DATE the bailiff notified O.M.M. that on DATE the applicant wanted to take GPE to GPE for DATE at GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE O.M.M. contested the enforcement proceedings opened against her on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff requested ORG to delegate a representative to accompany him to O.M.M. \u2019s home on DATE on account of DATE \u2019s previous repeated refusals to allow the applicant to have contact with his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff accompanied the applicant to O.M.M. \u2019s home . The enforcement report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that it was impossible to enforce the judgment , as neither the mother nor the daughter were present , and O.M.M. had written to the applicant that she had gone on holiday for GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the bailiff \u2019s office that so far as the enforcement proceedings were concerned the ORG was not party to the proceedings , did not have legal standing and it did not have any record of the child being placed under special protection measures .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed O.M.M. \u2019s action contesting the enforcement proceedings opened against her on DATE , on the ground that they were lawful . There is no evidence in the file that O.M.M. appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff made a second attempt to enforce the judgment of DATE . On DATE the bailiff notified O.M.M. that the applicant would visit her home on DATE at TIME to take the child away for the period between CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff accompanied the applicant to O.M.M. \u2019s home . The enforcement report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the child refused to leave with her father and consequently O.M.M. did not agree to allow her to go .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought proceedings against O.M.M. , seeking an injunction for a fine of between RON CARDINAL and RON CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) for every DATE O.M.M. refused to allow him to see his daughter as required by the final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action for a fine . It held that according to the enforcement report produced by the bailiff on DATE had allowed the applicant to see his daughter at her home and in her presence , but that she had refused to allow him to take the child away . In these circumstances the ORG considered that O.M.M. had not obstructed the enforcement of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against O.M.M. , seeking an injunction for a RON CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) security deposit and a civil fine of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) for every day she prevented him from enforcing the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action of DATE in part . It ordered O.M.M. to pay a ORG CARDINAL fine for DATE she prevented the applicant from enforcing the judgment of DATE . In this respect it held that O.M.M. had prevented the applicant on several occasions in DATE from seeing his daughter , either by not being at home or by refusing to allow him to take his daughter away from her home . However , the court dismissed his claim for a security deposit , on the ground that it had already ordered O.M.M. to pay a fine for obstructing the enforcement of a final judgment . The applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE , on the ground that the applicant had already been ordered to pay a fine . Moreover , forcing her to pay an additional ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL penalty would be disproportionate , and might affect the child due to the financial burden imposed on her mother . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE in part and ordered O.M.M. to deposit on a bank account a payment of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in the applicant \u2019s name . In also upheld the remaining part of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It held that while the mother \u2019s financial stability had to be considered , the child had a right to spend time with her father . Moreover , the mother had a good income and the amount established by the court for the warranty maintained a balance between the financial burden imposed on DATE and the aim of preserving family ties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against O.M.M. , asking the court to establish the amount of the fine O.M.M. had to pay following the judgment of DATE and seeking an injunction for O.M.M. to pay him ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage following her repeated refusals to accept the enforcement of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the court could not establish the amount of the fine due , as the applicant had not been able to show how many times he had been obstructed in the enforcement of the judgment of DATE after DATE \u2019s duty to pay a fine was set by the court on DATE . Moreover , the tense relationship between the parents , reflected also in his relationship with his daughter , did not allow the applicant always to see his daughter in the circumstances he would have wished . While separation from one \u2019s child after divorce implied a certain suffering , this was not of such a level as to engage DATE \u2019s civil liability . The problems faced by the applicant , in particular his former wife \u2019s behaviour , had already been punished by the courts , which had obliged her to set up a security deposit in his favour . In addition , the fact that his daughter had left GPE and he had not been able to see her since DATE could not have caused him additional suffering , since he was notified about his ex - wife \u2019s decision , was informed of his daughter \u2019s address in GPE , and had brought proceedings for the contact rights schedule to be changed . Consequently , pending those proceedings , his only discomfort was caused by the fact that he did not live in the same country as his daughter any more . The applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE as timebarred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought criminal proceedings against O.M.M. for obstructing the enforcement of the judgments allowing him contact rights with his daughter . He argued that although he had attempted repeatedly to enforce the judgments of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL June and DATE and the judgments allowing him exceptional contact rights with his daughter for DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE , he had been unable to do so because of DATE \u2019s behaviour .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint of DATE , on the ground that DATE \u2019s behaviour could not be classified as criminal . However , the court applied an administrative sanction , issuing DATE with a warning . It held , inter alia , that although O.M.M. had obstructed the enforcement of final court judgments , her conviction would not serve and adequate purpose considering that the parties have a child together and a conviction could also influence the future of the said child , particularly if O.M.M. did not change her behaviour . The applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE . It underlined , inter alia , that , according to a report produced by GPE for Abused Children attached to ORG following counselling sessions with the parties which were quit by the father , the child was affected by the conflict between her parents and considered her mother to be \u201c good \u201d and her father to be \u201c bad \u201d and wanted him to \u201c leave her alone \u201d and to stop visiting her . The child was closer to her mother and was somewhat detached from her father , even rejecting him of her own accord , whether or not induced to do so by her mother . In this context , the court held that although O.M.M. obstructed the enforcement of final court judgments it could not be argued that she did not have in mind the best interest of her child . She allowed the father to visit the child at her home and in her presence . Consequently , given the tense relations between the parents and the need of the child , convicting O.M.M. would not serve any purpose , as it would preserve , inter alia , the child \u2019s feelings of uncertainty .", "CARDINAL . In a letter addressed to the ORG in DATE the applicant stated that from DATE until DATE he had attempted to exercise his acknowledged visiting rights CARDINAL times . All the attempts of the applicant to visit his daughter according to the schedule established by final judgments were obstructed by the categorical refusal of O.M.M. to let him take the minor away from her home , and whenever he was allowed to see his daughter he was compelled to agree to the visits taking place in her presence , or else in the presence of the minor \u2019s maternal grandmother . Consequently , he lodged CARDINAL criminal complaints against O.M.M. for noncompliance with the provisions of the final judgments allowing him personal contact with his daughter .", "CARDINAL . In a letter addressed to the ORG on an unspecified date in DATE the applicant stated that he had no knowledge of his daughter \u2019s whereabouts and that he had not seen her for DATE . His former wife had allegedly moved from the address he had known in GPE and had not notified him of the new address . Moreover , although the domestic courts had been informed about the mother \u2019s failure to notify him of his daughter \u2019s new address during the proceedings seeking to change the contact rights schedule , they did not order her to disclose it to him . Consequently , he was unable to contact or see his daughter .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic legal provisions are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of GPE v. GPE ( no .
