The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was stopped by the police at CARDINAL p.m. while driving his car on a public road . He was ordered to undergo a breathalyser test . After CARDINAL attempts to measure the amount of alcohol , among which CARDINAL was valid , the test was discontinued . The applicant \u2019s conduct was considered to amount to a refusal to undergo the breathalyser test and his driving licence was temporarily withdrawn . CARDINAL different sets of proceedings were initiated against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Bezirkshauptmannschaft , DAA ) issued a decision to withdraw the applicant \u2019s driving licence for DATE as a preventive measure to secure road safety . The ORG observed that , according to the case - law of ORG , it amounted to a refusal to undergo a breathalyser test if the person who had been ordered to undergo the test had made CARDINAL invalid attempts out of CARDINAL . According to the statements of police officers PERSON and NORP and the paper print outs of the test results , the applicant had been allowed to make much more attempts , namely CARDINAL and CARDINAL had produced a valid result . When the applicant had claimed that the breathalyser had been defective , police officer R had made himself CARDINAL attempts using the same mouthpiece as the applicant and both attempts had produced valid results . The ORG also noted that technical tests of the breathalyser had been carried out on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE and each time the breathalyser had been found fully functioning . On the basis of this evidence it was safe to conclude that the applicant had refused to undergo the breathalyser test . The ORG also ordered that an appeal had no suspensive effect because it was necessary to avoid the risk that a person lacking trustworthiness for road traffic might drive . Moreover the applicant was ordered to follow driver improvement training before his driving licence would be returned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and argued that the ORG should have obtained the report of a technical expert on the functioning of the breathlyser as only such an expert could clarify whether the machine was working properly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . He found that according to the paper print out of the breathalyser test the applicant had made CARDINAL attempts of which CARDINAL had been valid whereas during the other attempts the applicant had not blown sufficient air into the mouth - piece . Thereupon CARDINAL attempts with the same mouth - piece as used by the applicant had been made by police officer NORP , which both produced valid results . Thus , there were no indications that the breathalyser did not function properly or that it had not been handled correctly by the police officers who had been specially trained for this task . In such circumstances a request for obtaining a report by a technical expert , without giving clear indications in what the malfunctioning of the breathalyser might have consisted , amounted to an inadmissible request for evidence ( PERSON ) . The Regional Governor concluded that refusing to undergo a breathalyser test was as serious as driving under the influence of alcohol because it prevented the authorities from verifying whether a person was actually drunk . The additional measure imposed on the applicant was therefore justified in order to improve his attitude .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG and requested an oral hearing . In his complaint he argued that ORG had not been competent to decide on his case as he resided in GPE . He further complained about the authority \u2019s assessment of evidence , as the statements of the police officers who had ordered him to undergo the breathalyser test were contradictory and stated that they should be questioned on the precise circumstances in which breathalyser test had been carried out . Lastly he complained that the authority had wrongly applied the law because it should not have refused to obtain the opinion of a technical expert on the functioning of the breathalyser .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that on the basis of the evidence before them the authorities had arrived at the conclusion that the applicant had refused to undergo the breathalyser test . The applicant had failed to raise any substantial arguments against these findings and had not shown that the assessment of the evidence carried out by the authorities was contradictory or implausible . In accordance with LAW of LAW ( Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz ) ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a hearing as it found that an oral hearing was not likely to contribute to the clarification of the case . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a penal order ( PERSON ) and imposed a fine for refusal to take the breathalyser test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that , since no decision had been taken within the prescribed time limit of DATE after the lodging of the appeal , the fine imposed by the ORG had expired ipso iure ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
