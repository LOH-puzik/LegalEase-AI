The applicants in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( NORP ) are a mother and father . Their son PERSON was born on DATE . The applicants in application no . CARDINAL ( ORG ) are also a mother and father . Their CARDINAL daughters PERSON and NORP were born on DATE and their son PERSON was born on DATE . All the applicants are members of ORG ( PERSON ) who lived in a community of around CARDINAL members of the church in GPE , GPE . A second community with CARDINAL members was located in the nearby village of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the press reported about ORG and its position on the right of parents to apply corporal punishment , especially caning . Furthermore , statements by a former member of the community were published , confirming that children had been punished with rods .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the local youth offices ( ORG ) visited both communities and its spokespersons were invited to a meeting at ORG . Corporal punishment and the issue of compulsory schooling were discussed at the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP youth office and ORG received video footage from a television reporter showing CARDINAL different instances of corporal punishment in the community in GPE . The footage , filmed with a hidden camera , showed the caning of various children DATE . According to the television reporter , the person who carried out the punishment was not , in most cases , a parent of the child being punished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , upon an application by the competent youth office , made an interlocutory order regarding all children in the CARDINAL NORP community in GPE , including the applicants\u2019 children . The court withdrew the applicants\u2019 rights to decide where their children should live ( GPE ) , and to take decisions regarding their health ( GPE ) , schooling and professional training , and transferred those rights to the youth office . The court based its decision on the above - mentioned video footage and the testimony of the television reporter and CARDINAL former members of the CARDINAL NORP community . It concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that the children would be subjected to corporal punishment in the form of caning and so - called \u201c restraining \u201d , involving holding a child \u2019s limbs tight and pressing his or her head down until the child had no strength left to cry and struggle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the youth office took the community \u2019s children into care . They were supported by around thirty police officers , who , at the same time , searched the community \u2019s premises and found a wooden rod .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 children were subsequently examined but no physical signs of abuse or beating were revealed .", "CARDINAL . J. Tlapak was subsequently placed in a foster family . As he was still being breastfed , his mother was permitted DATE visits to give him milk .", "CARDINAL . A. and PERSON were also placed in a foster family . Their aunt \u2019s family was approved as fosterers and they were then placed with them .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since PERSON was then only DATE and DATE and was also still being breastfed , he and his mother were placed together in a foster family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the applicants and on DATE it upheld its order of CARDINAL DATE in an interim decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants against the interim decision of ORG in essence , but set the decision aside to the extent it concerned the parental right to decide on schooling matters . Given the son \u2019s age , the court held that there was no need to decide on that issue in the interim proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants moved \u2013 without their son PERSON to GPE , where they have been living since .", "CARDINAL . The Ansbach Family Court heard the applicants on DATE and the applicants\u2019 daughters on DATE in the foster family \u2019s home . The daughters reported that their parents had hit them on the hand with a rod as a form of corporal punishment . On DATE ORG upheld its order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon an appeal by the applicants , ORG reversed the decision to withdraw the right to decide where PERSON should live . The earlier decision on the daughters was upheld , with the proviso that the parents were to retain the right to take decisions on school matters and on their daughters\u2019 choice of education or training and career .", "CARDINAL . The son was subsequently returned to the applicants , who moved first to GPE and later to GPE , where they have been living since . The applicants\u2019 daughters are still in the care of the foster family ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon an application made by the applicants on DATE ORG initiated the main proceedings and , on DATE , it commissioned an expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . After interviewing the applicants and observing a meeting between them and their son , the expert submitted a written opinion on DATE . He found that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their son , they considered corporal punishment with objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method . Owing to their willingness to apply that method to their son , there was a likelihood bordering on certainty that if he remained with them , they would apply corporal punishment . This , the expert concluded , would significantly jeopardise the son \u2019s development and result in psychological problems . Overall , it was in the child \u2019s best interests to place him away from his parents to protect him from the applicants\u2019 parenting methods , which were dangerous for the child . Since their parenting was based on religious convictions , they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and lacked the will to cooperate with the authorities or accept help . Consequently , less intrusive measures could not be considered sufficient .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicants submitted a privately commissioned expert opinion , in which the court - appointed expert \u2019s approach and methodology was criticised . In addition , the applicants retrospectively withdrew their consent to being assessed by the court - appointed expert and to an assessment of their son .", "CARDINAL . In separate proceedings ORG , on DATE , issued an interim decision in which it withdrew the ORG parental right to decide on the son \u2019s assessment by the court - appointed expert and consented to such a measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court - appointed expert , who responded to the criticism and gave details of his methodology in a letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a hearing on DATE the court proposed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office , with the aim of returning their son to them . However , the applicants and the youth office did not agree on a settlement owing in particular to a disagreement about the son attending a state school and play therapy . Moreover , there were concerns about the parents attending a development course and assisting with medical measures . The youth office considered those aspects as essential and declined the partial settlement proposed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . After hearing the applicants\u2019 son in the home of the foster family where he had been placed on DATE , ORG decided on DATE to withdraw the applicants\u2019 right to decide where their son should live and to take decisions regarding his health and schooling , and transferred those rights to the youth office , which had been appointed as supplementary guardian .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of the child if the son continued to live with the applicants owing to their parenting methods . Based , in particular , on the courtcommissioned expert opinion and the statements by the applicants during the court proceedings , the court concluded that there was a high , concrete probability that the son would be subjected to corporal punishment using physical objects over the course of DATE . According to the expert , this would give rise to an expectation that the ORG son would suffer from psychological issues . Even though separating the parents and the child constituted a severe interference with their right to a family under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and may possibly have negative consequences for the child , that interference was justified in the case at hand . Corporal punishment of the kind at issue was particularly degrading for a child . It was not only banned by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) but also constituted an interference with a child \u2019s human dignity , protected under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and a child \u2019s right to physical integrity , protected under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that the risk to the child could not be averted using less drastic measures . Throughout the course of the proceedings the applicants had unreservedly advocated their parenting style and had refused to accept the opinion that the type of corporal punishment they endorsed was covered by the ban on violence under LAW . The physical effects of such punishment were only short - lived , which was why it would only be possible for the youth office to observe any such effects if it made unannounced visits and the child had \u2013 by chance \u2013 been punished immediately prior to such a visit . According to the expert \u2019s explanations , the psychological consequences could , by contrast , only be determined after a longer period of time and they were difficult to discern at first glance . Although the applicants had most recently indicated to the court that they were ready to refrain from corporal punishment in the future , the court regarded such statements as not being compelling since they had not provided any grounds . ORG , nonetheless , pointed out that the applicants were free to reach an out - of - court settlement with the youth office concerning the conditions under which the son could be returned after the proceedings had been concluded . However , the previous settlement proposal had been refused because the applicants had not been willing to agree to have their son take part in play therapy and attend a state school .", "CARDINAL . In regard to the fact that the applicants had withdrawn their consent to being examined by the court - appointed expert after the expert opinion had already been submitted , both for themselves and their child , the court held that this did not render the expert \u2019s report unusable in the proceedings . While the court had given its own consent in place of the GPE as far as it concerned the son , the GPE actions on that point could not , in light of the state \u2019s obligation to protect children under constitutional law , hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings . Allowing parents to reject expert opinions they disagreed with by retrospectively withdrawing consent to an examination would prevent any effective protection of children in family court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of ORG . ORG , after hearing the applicants , their son , the son \u2019s guardian ad litem , a representative of the youth office , the courtappointed expert and the expert commissioned by the applicants , dismissed the ORG appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL pages , ORG considered in detail the applicants\u2019 statements concerning corporal punishment , publications by ORG , the expert \u2019s opinion and the criticism of the report by the privately commissioned expert . Overall it confirmed the decision and reasoning of ORG of DATE . The court emphasised that not all individual violations of the right to a non - violent upbringing under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) could justify a withdrawal of parental authority . However , there was a fear in the applicants\u2019 case that systematic caning with a rod would be the reaction whenever the child was deemed to have broken a rule . There was moreover already a threat to the child \u2019s best interests as he would live in constant fear of suffering physical pain and experiencing the resulting humiliation as psychological suffering . Beatings as such , the court held , constituted child abuse and misuse of parental authority . It was of no relevance whether or not lasting physical injuries occurred .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that on account of their religious beliefs , the applicants were convinced that their child - rearing methods were legitimate . Accordingly , they were neither willing nor able to avert the danger to their child and the recent contradictory statements they had made could not be considered as credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicants ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , without providing reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG , upon an application by the applicants dated DATE , initiated the main proceedings and on DATE commissioned an expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . After interviewing the applicants , their CARDINAL daughters and the children \u2019s foster parents , and observing a meeting between the applicants and their children , the expert submitted a written opinion on DATE . He stated that the applicants and their daughters had confirmed that the parents had used a rod as corporal punishment on the daughters and that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their children , they considered corporal punishment using physical objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method . Given the past incidents of corporal punishment and the ORG general willingness to use that method on their children , it was virtually certain that they would subject them to corporal punishment again . The expert concluded that the ORG rigid , authoritarian parenting style and their conviction that children should be raised to obey their parents by means of corporal punishment using physical objects from DATE conflicted significantly with the best interests of the children and was also detrimental to the unimpaired development of their personality . He expected that such methods would likely result in psychological issues . Overall , it was in the best interests of the children to place them away from their parents . Since the applicants\u2019 parenting style was based on religious convictions , they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and were not fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and accept help . Consequently , measures that infringed on their rights to a lesser degree could not be considered sufficient .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicants submitted a privately commissioned expert opinion , in which the court - appointed expert \u2019s approach and methodology was criticised . In addition , the applicants retrospectively withdrew their consent to being assessed by the court - appointed expert and to the assessment of their CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . In separate proceedings ORG , on DATE , issued an interim decision in which it withdrew the ORG parental right to decide on the children being assessed by the court - appointed expert and consented to the psychological examination . It also forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court - appointed expert , who responded to the criticism in it and gave details of his methodology in a letter of CARDINAL October CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a hearing of DATE the parties discussed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office , with the aim of returning the daughters to the applicants and protecting all CARDINAL children . However , the applicants and the youth office could not agree on a settlement as there was disagreement in particular on the children attending a state school and therapy . Moreover , the applicants were unwilling to remain in GPE under the supervision of the youth office for an extended period of time .", "CARDINAL . After hearing the applicants and their daughters several times , including in parallel proceedings , ORG decided on DATE to withdraw the applicants\u2019 right to decide where all CARDINAL children should live and to take decisions regarding the children \u2019s health and schooling , and transferred those rights to the youth office , which had been appointed as supplementary guardian . Additionally , the court ordered the ORG son to be handed over to the youth office .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , which was similar to that in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , ORG held that the applicants\u2019 parenting methods meant that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of all CARDINAL children to continue to live with their parents . The court emphasised that the aim of Article DATE of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not to penalise past child abuse or views on parenting that were in contradiction to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , but to prevent imminent threats to the best interests of children . Based , in particular , on the opinion by the courtappointed expert and the statements by the applicants and their children , the court concluded that there was a high , concrete probability that the children would be subjected to systematic corporal punishment using physical objects , which would in turn be detrimental to the best interests of the children in physical and psychological terms . The severe interference with the applicants\u2019 right to a family under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by separating them from their children was nonetheless not only justified but also proportionate since the risk to the children could not be averted using milder means . Besides the problem of detecting corporal punishment through unannounced visits by the youth office ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court also pointed out that the applicants had consistently , over the course of the proceedings , shown a lack of willingness to cooperate with the youth office and had refused to accept state schools , both of which the court found necessary to prevent degrading corporal punishment and ensure the children \u2019s autonomous development . Furthermore , the court held that it could be expected that the applicants would leave GPE if their children were returned to them and thereby elude any orderly monitoring and supervision by the competent youth office . Lastly , the court concluded that the withdrawal of the consent to being examined by the court - appointed expert did not hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of ORG and applied for an interim measure to suspend the order to hand their son over to the youth office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG provisionally suspended enforcement of ORG order on the son . The court held that given his age , DATE and DATE , and the fact that he was still being breastfed , enforcement would constitute an especially serious interference with the applicants\u2019 rights . In addition , the son \u2019s young age meant there was no imminent and sufficient risk of him being subjected to corporal punishment .", "CARDINAL . During the appeal proceedings the applicants proposed a settlement to ORG . The applicants would temporarily return to GPE and for DATE they would gradually be reunited with their CARDINAL daughters under the supervision of the youth office . At the end of that period , if the family reunification had been successful , ORG decision would be set aside and the whole family would move to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG conducted an oral hearing during which it heard , inter alia , the applicants , their daughters , the courtappointed expert , the expert commissioned by the applicants and the children \u2019s guardian ad litem . The applicants\u2019 daughters stated that , even though they would like to see their parents more often , they would prefer living with their foster parents . Moreover , a representative of the youth office indicated during the hearing that the applicants had not distanced themselves from their previous parenting methods in a credible way and that therefore the youth office was not able to agree to the settlement they had proposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a detailed decision of fortyfive pages , rejected the ORG appeal and confirmed the reasoning of ORG . The court held that corporal punishment with a rod , prohibited by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , constituted the physical abuse of children and if applied regularly and repeatedly the competent authorities were obliged under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to intervene and take the necessary measures in the best interests of the children . The applicants\u2019 daughters had consistently stated during the proceedings that they had been caned on a DATE basis and the applicants themselves had confirmed that they had \u201c disciplined \u201d their daughters with a rod . The court was convinced that the applicants would continue to use corporal punishment on their children in the future since that parenting method was already firmly established and was based on religious beliefs from which the applicants had not fundamentally distanced themselves . Their statements had shown that they , in essence , continued to approve of corporal punishment and considered it an appropriate parenting method . The fact that the applicants had recently acknowledged that their children had a right to a non - violent upbringing did not mean they had changed their attitudes to parenting in a permanent way ; rather , that had only served a procedural purpose , namely to have their daughters returned to them as soon as possible . In the court \u2019s opinion , the applicants were only prepared to refrain temporarily from corporal punishment . The court was therefore unable to find that the applicants had changed their way of parenting and distanced themselves from corporal punishment in a manner which the court could regard as credible . Consequently , there was an imminent danger of systematic corporal punishment if the CARDINAL daughters were returned to their parents . The danger also existed for the applicants\u2019 son as there was no fixed age when the applicants started \u201c disciplining \u201d their children as they rather considered it a tool to enforce their parental authority . As the DATE son was expected to start his \u201c phase of defiance \u201d soon , it also had to be expected that the applicants would respond with caning .", "CARDINAL . ORG also confirmed that the applicants\u2019 withdrawal of their consent to being assessed did not prevent the courts from using the expert opinion as evidence and that there were no less severe measures available to avert the imminent detriment to the best interests of the children resulting from their GPE use of corporal punishment . In that regard , the court , inter alia , pointed to the fact that the applicants had already left GPE with their son and refused to return to live there permanently . The competent authorities would therefore from the very outset be unable to provide sufficient support to the family or effectively monitor the applicants\u2019 parenting methods .", "DATE . On DATE ORG refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicants ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , without providing reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
