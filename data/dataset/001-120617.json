GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE , the applicants live together in a registered civil partnership ( eingetragene PERSON ) . On DATE the second applicant gave birth to a son , L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE - Eimsb\u00fcttel Civil Registry Office issued a birth certificate naming the second applicant as PERSON \u2019s mother . The space provided in the form for the father \u2019s name was left blank .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and the second applicant concluded an agreement whereby the child L. would be adopted by the first applicant . On DATE the GPE - Altona District Court granted the adoption order under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on Registered Civil Partnerships ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) and declared that the child PERSON obtained the legal position of a child of both applicants .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the applicants requested ORG to rectify the birth certificate by inserting the first applicant as L. \u2019s second parent . They submitted that section CARDINAL LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) , stipulating that the father was the man who was married to the mother of the child at the time of birth , should be applied mutatis mutandis in case the mother lived in a registered civil partnership with another woman . They argued that it was irrelevant under LAW whether the mother \u2019s husband was indeed the biological father of the child born into the union . There was thus no reason to treat children born into a civil partnership any differently from children born in wedlock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG rejected the ORG request as being unfounded . ORG considered that there was no reason to rectify the birth certificate , because the birth certificate was neither incorrect nor incomplete . The birth certificate documented the child \u2019s descent . It contained the names of the parents the child descended from . It was irrelevant in this context whether the parents were married or not . The prerequisites of CARDINAL of LAW were clearly not met in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that there was no legal ground for inserting the first applicant as \u201c second \u201d mother into the birth certificate , as it was impossible that the child had descended from her . The mere fact that the child \u2019s mother lived in a registered civil partnership when giving birth did not justify inserting a second parent . This was not called into question by the fact that section CARDINAL of LAW contained the rebuttable presumption that the mother \u2019s husband was the child \u2019s father . In the instant case , there was no room for the presumption of the child \u2019s descent from his mother \u2019s partner ; on the contrary , such descent could be ruled out .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally observed that the possibility of adoption of the partner \u2019s child under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Law on Registered Civil Partnerships demonstrated that the legislator had been aware of the civil partner \u2019s rights in respect of the other partner \u2019s children . Under these circumstances , there was no room for an analogous application of section CARDINAL of LAW in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal on points of law . ORG confirmed the lower courts\u2019 reasoning . It further considered that the applicants had not been discriminated against in their capacity as women living in a registered civil partnerships vis - \u00e0 - vis persons living in wedlock . It could not be said that persons living in a civil partnership were discriminated against or that they were deprived of certain rights enjoyed by married couples , as a child could only descend from a specific mother and father . This was excluded on biological grounds in the case of CARDINAL women living in a registered civil partnership .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that it followed from the above considerations that there had been no violation of the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW in conjunction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( case - file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to accept the ORG constitutional complaint for adjudication . ORG observed , at the outset , that there was no indication that the lower courts had failed to take into account the requirements of LAW . It further considered that the refusal to insert the first applicant into the birth certificate prior to adoption did not violate the applicants\u2019 right to the enjoyment of their family life . LAW protected the family as a union of parents and children . It did not matter in this respect whether the children descended from their parents and whether they were born in or out of wedlock . However , the entry of the name of a civil partner into the birth certificate did not concern the family life between the civil partners and the child . The birth certificate had the sole purpose of giving evidence of the child \u2019s descent . It did not interfere in any way with the child \u2019s living together with his or her parents within the family .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further considered that the applicant had not been discriminated against . Civil partners did not have a right to be treated equally to legal or biological fathers with respect to their entry into the birth certificate . In this respect , the CARDINAL groups were not comparable , as biological or legal paternity established a legal relationship comprising mutual rights and duties . Such a legal relationship did not exist between the civil partner and the child , as long as the child was not adopted .", "CARDINAL . The fact that there was no legal presumption that the mother \u2019s civil partner was the child \u2019s second parent did not amount to discrimination vis\u00e0 - vis married couples , as the legal presumption was based on biological descent and did not have a basis in the case of civil partners .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The ORG shall watch over them in the performance of this duty . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
