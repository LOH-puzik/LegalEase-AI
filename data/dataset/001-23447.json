It noted that ORG , ORG had decided that the applicant had had no right to a pension for the period in question and found that a regular civil court had no competence to set aside such a decision issued by an administrative body , but only to determine the applicant \u2019s civil claim for payment . However , such a claim had no legal ground as the applicant \u2019s right to receive a pension in the period from DATE until DATE had not been recognised by the competent authority .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the first instance judgment .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment .", "On DATE all CARDINAL applicants filed together a constitutional complaint . They recalled that they had requested payment of the pension instalments for the respective periods during which no pension had been paid and alleged that ORG refused to pay , contrary to the law . Thus , their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property had been violated .", "Furthermore , they alleged that their right to equality before the courts was violated because in other proceedings concerning similar claims , other courts in GPE had granted such claims . Also , the exact amount of the pension instalments that they claimed had never been established .", "They argued furthermore that the lower courts had erred in the application of laws because they had applied LAW retroactively and also wrongly interpreted the rules regulating statutory limitation .", "In respect of the first CARDINAL applicants ORG rejected the complaint on DATE and in respect of the fifth applicant the complaint was rejected on DATE .", "It found that , in essence , the constitutional complaint was of a fourth instance nature since the applicants complained that the lower courts wrongly established the facts and erred in their application of the laws . It concluded that the lower courts\u2019 decisions were based on law and well reasoned and that the rights complained of were not violated .", "In respect of the first applicant , PERSON ORG stated as follows :", "... The applicant is treating her constitutional complaint as a regular legal remedy and is asking ORG to act as a court of appeal in respect of the courts that gave the impugned judgments .", "However , according to the constitutional definition of ORG jurisdiction , as regulated by LAW as well as by LAW of LAW , a constitutional complaint is a remedy established for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and may be filed against an act ( and the proceedings that preceded such an act ) that has violated an applicant \u2019s human rights or fundamental freedoms guaranteed by LAW ( constitutional rights ) .", "The applicant asks ORG to rule that the contested judgments violated her rights guaranteed in LAW , LAW , Articles DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , LAW and LAW in connection with ORG , DATE and DATE and LAW .", "More specifically , the applicant alleges an infringement of her constitutional rights under LAW and LAW , in that her right to equality before the law and before the courts had been violated because the first - instance court failed to ask the defendant to certify the exact amount of the pension instalments that had not been paid to the applicant during the material period .", "However , the first - instance court established that the late applicant \u2019s husband had received a pension from a \u201c para - fund \u201d , whose acts were recognised on the basis of LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . According to LAW of the former LAW ( Official Gazette nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and LAW of LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) a beneficiary who has acquired the right to CARDINAL or more pensions is allowed to receive CARDINAL pension . Accordingly , the first - instance court established that the late applicant \u2019s husband had chosen to receive in the relevant period a pension based on the act that that court recognised pursuant to LAW ; it further established that the applicant had no legal basis to claim for the same period another pension on a different basis .", "The applicant herself indicated the value of her claim . In rejecting the applicant \u2019s request that the exact amount of the pension instalments that she sought be established , having already ruled that her claim had no legal basis , the first - instance court did not violate her right to equality before the law and the courts .", "Lastly , the second - instance judgment accepted the defendant \u2019s objection based on the statutory limitation in LAW , which provides that all outstanding payments under LAW of that provision ( pensions and other monetary instalments ) that have not been paid owing to circumstances caused by a beneficiary can be sought only for DATE when the claim for payment has been filed , noting that the applicant had filed her claim on DATE but had been in receipt of her family pension since DATE , a period of DATE before the time when she filed her claim .", "The facts relevant in the proceedings in which the impugned judgments were given , and on which the applicant based her constitutional complaint , are not relevant for the assessment whether the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights were violated . Presentation of evidence and the establishment of facts fall within the competence of the courts that conducted those proceedings . \u201d", "In respect of the other CARDINAL applicants ORG gave very similar reasoning .", "The relevant parts of LAW ( Zakon o mirovinskom osiguranju - ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provide in its LAW that pension instalments which have not been paid owing to circumstances caused by a beneficiary can be sought only for DATE , and that the period before that falls within the statutory limitation .", "Section CARDINAL provides that a person who , according to NORP law , is entitled to CARDINAL or more pensions under the compulsory national retirement pension scheme may receive CARDINAL of those pensions .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Zakon o konvalidaciji , Official Gazette no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that all individual acts and decisions issued by various bodies or legal persons exercising public authority in matters of a judicial or administrative nature in the parts of GPE that were under the protection and authority of ORG , are to be validated by that LAW , according to LAW , LAW on human rights and freedoms and the rights of ethnic and national communities or minorities in GPE and other statutes ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
