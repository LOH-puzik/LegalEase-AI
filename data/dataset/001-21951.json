SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national born in DATE who resides in GPE in GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON M. Ziegler , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows .", "Criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on account of water pollution . During the course of the investigations he was remanded in custody for DATE . On DATE the ORG ( LOC ) convicted the applicant of various charges of having contravened LAW ( Umweltschutzgesetz ) and ORG ( Gew\u00e4sserschutzgesetz ) . The conviction was confirmed upon appeal by ORG ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE which sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended on probation , a fine of MONEY ( CHF ) , and damages of CHF CARDINAL .", "The applicant then filed CARDINAL pleas of nullity ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL with ORG ( Kassationsgericht ) of the GPE of GPE in which he complained of various procedural deficiencies , the other with ORG ( PERSON ) in which he complained of his conviction . On DATE ORG partly upheld the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity . In particular , it found that ORG , contrary to LAW , had not pronounced its judgment publicly ; however , ORG considered it unnecessary for this reason to quash the previous decision as this would unnecessarily prolong the proceedings .", "Against the decision of ORG the applicant filed on DATE a public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) with ORG . Therein , he complained , inter alia , that ORG had not conducted an oral hearing and had disregarded certain submissions of his ; that it had failed to transmit CARDINAL submission of a lower instance to him for observation ; that it had failed to draw the necessary conclusions from the fact that the judgment of ORG had not been pronounced publicly ; that a LOC Attorney who had ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand had breached LAW ; that certain ORG judges had been biased ; and that previous instances had in various respects incorrectly assessed the evidence . In his public law appeal the applicant also requested all submissions in the proceedings to be transmitted to him for his observations .", "ORG transmitted a copy of the applicant \u2019s public law appeal to ORG of the GPE of GPE and to ORG . The latter filed no observations , whereas ORG submitted a reply , numbering CARDINAL pages , on DATE . Therein it explained , inter alia , why the applicant could in respect of CARDINAL issue no longer be considered a victim , and why certain other submissions were new and could not therefore be considered by ORG . It pointed out that the ORG \u2019s jugment in the PERSON ( judgment of DATE , Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL ) would , if applied consistently , prolong proceedings ad infinitum , and it also explained its point of view in respect of the complaint under LAW .", "On DATE ORG transmitted a copy of the observations of ORG to the applicant . By letter of DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG , asking for the opportunity to reply to the observations of that court , though it appears that he received no reply thereto .", "In CARDINAL judgments of DATE ORG dealt with the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity and public law appeal . Both judgments were served on the applicant on DATE .", "In the judgment of DATE concerning the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity , ORG considered the various relevant legal provisions and concluded that the applicant had been incorrectly convicted . As a result , it quashed the judgment of ORG of the GPE of GPE of DATE . The applicant was awarded CHF CARDINAL as compensation for costs .", "In the other judgment of DATE , numbering CARDINAL pages , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s public law appeal , while imposing CHF CARDINAL as court costs on him . In its judgment it dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints that he had not had an oral hearing before ORG and that his subsequent submissions had not been considered . To the extent that the applicant had not been able to comment before ORG on the observations of a lower instance , ORG considered a reply unnecessary as the submissions had been \u201c completely irrelevant \u201d ( v\u00f6llig belanglos ) . Insofar as the applicant complained about the consequences of the lack of public pronouncement , ORG found that the applicant had insufficiently substantiated this complaint , and that in any event it found ORG reasoning pertinent . ORG also dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints about the taking of evidence .", "Proceedings were then resumed before ORG of the GPE of GPE which on DATE acquitted the applicant of the various offences ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
