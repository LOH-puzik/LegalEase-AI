SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and claims to be NORP . However , the NORP authorities found that she had not made it probable that she originates from GPE and therefore held that her case should be tried not only against GPE but also against the neighbouring countries GPE and GPE .", "In DATE , the applicant had a relationship with a man who turned out to be a drug addict and dealer . After her parents banned her from seeing him , he started to harass her and threatened to kill her . Her brother also threatened to kill her due to that relationship .", "On DATE ORG rejected her asylum application as it found the alleged incident to be an act of criminality which was for the domestic authorities to handle . The applicant had neither turned to those authorities for protection nor made it probable that they could not provide protection against the threats in question . ORG therefore held that , should the applicant be victim of further crimes upon return , she could seek protection from the authorities in GPE , GPE or GPE . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . As stated by herself in the present application , the applicant did not appeal against ORG judgment to ORG . With the rejection of the applicant \u2019s asylum application she has no right to remain in GPE and can be removed without further proceedings .", "The provisions applicable in the present case are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) . The LAW defines , inter alia , the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from GPE as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "The LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This is the case where new circumstances give reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or where there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . If a residence permit can not be granted under these rules , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so . Should the applicable conditions not be met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "Matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances : ORG , ORG and ORG . The applicants are entitled to be represented before these bodies by publicly - appointed counsel ( LAW , section CARDINAL , LAW , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The time - limit for appeals to the final instance is DATE from the date of the appealed judgment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . For a case to be considered by ORG , leave to appeal is required and will be granted if there are special reasons for hearing the appeal or if the determination of ORG may be of importance as a precedent . If leave to appeal is granted , ORG can decide the case on the merits ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
