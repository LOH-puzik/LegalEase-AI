THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 3;No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza;Simon Brown", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a schizophrenic suffering from a psychotic illness . He appears to have experienced the first symptoms in DATE . When he first came to the attention of the mental health services , his condition was so severe that consideration was given to detaining him compulsorily in a psychiatric hospital . However , this turned out to be unnecessary as he responded sufficiently to treatment and his illness has been successfully managed . At DATE , he was admitted to hospital for DATE following a minor relapse which his psychiatrist attributed in part to side effects from his previous medication . His antipsychotic medication was changed from sulpiride to olanzapine .", "Schizophrenia is an illness or group of illnesses affecting language , planning , emotion , perceptions and movement . \u201c Positive symptoms \u201d often accompany acute psychotic episodes ( including delusions , hallucinations , disordered or fragmented thinking and catatonic movements ) . \u201c Negative symptoms \u201d , associated with long - term illness , include feelings of emotional numbness , difficulty in communicating with others , lack of motivation and inability to care about or cope with everyday tasks .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE as a visitor on DATE and was granted DATE leave to remain , which was extended until DATE because he was undertaking studies . In DATE an out - of - time application for a further extension was rejected and in DATE he was requested to leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married PERSON , a GPE citizen . On DATE he applied for leave to remain on account of his marriage . He was granted leave to remain on that basis until DATE . On DATE he applied for indefinite leave to remain as a foreign spouse . This was refused on DATE . On DATE the applicant made further representations and on CARDINAL DATE he was granted indefinite leave to remain as a foreign spouse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left GPE to visit GPE . As a result , his indefinite leave to remain lapsed . He returned to GPE on DATE and sought leave to enter as a returning resident . The immigration officer , whose suspicions were aroused about the subsistence of the marriage on which leave to remain had been obtained , granted him temporary admission pending further enquiries . On DATE the immigration authorities decided to refuse leave to enter on the ground that indefinite leave to remain had been obtained by deception , the marriage being one of convenience . He was given notice of intention to remove him from GPE . He was only entitled to appeal against the basis of that decision after leaving GPE . The applicant sought deferral of the removal directions on the basis of his medical condition . The Secretary of ORG refused to defer the directions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for judicial review of the proposed expulsion on the grounds that it would cause him a full relapse in his mental health problems and would amount to inhuman and degrading treatment , contrary to LAW . By a letter of DATE , the Secretary of ORG gave detailed reasons for his decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to apply for judicial review . The applicant renewed his application before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made further representations about his medical condition , which were considered by the Secretary of ORG and rejected in letters dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the application to enable the Government to reconsider their position in the light of further material submitted by the applicant . It suggested that the Government might wish to obtain their own medical examination of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Government indicated that they did not wish to have the applicant medically examined . They submitted that there was a hospital in GPE which provided treatment \u201c not solely to those who have committed crimes \u201d and which could admit the applicant and administer the medication which the Government understood the applicant to be receiving . The hospital was situated at GPE , DATE to QUANTITY from the applicant 's village of GPE . In a letter dated DATE , the immigration authorities stated , inter alia , that , as advised by ORG , there was at that time no particular danger in travelling between GPE and PERSON . As regards the applicant 's state of health , they stated that they would only remove the applicant if he was certified as fit to travel , and he would be accompanied by medical personnel during the journey . As medication and treatment would be available to him in GPE , it was concluded that his circumstances were not so exceptional or compelling that he should be granted entry .", "CARDINAL . The applicant obtained opinions from his psychiatrist as to the likely effect of his removal to GPE . In a letter dated DATE , Dr PERSON stated that there was a high risk that the applicant would suffer a relapse of psychotic symptoms on being returned to GPE . The requirement to undertake regularly an arduous journey through a troubled region would make the risk still greater . She pointed out that when individuals with psychotic illnesses relapse , they commonly have great difficulty in being sufficiently organised to seek help for themselves or to travel . For this reason , it was necessary for the management of such illnesses to be local and readily accessible . It was therefore very unlikely in these circumstances that any relapse of the applicant would be effectively treated . In a supplementary report of DATE , PERSON stated that any suffering which might accompany a relapse would be likely to be substantial . When the applicant 's illness had been severe , he had lost all insight into the fact that he was ill and believed the persecutory delusions and abuse which he experienced , including voices telling him to harm other people . He had previously felt sufficiently depressed and hopeless to contemplate suicide .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also obtained opinions from PERSON , Deputy Director of ORG as to conditions in GPE . In a letter of DATE , PERSON stated that the area in which GPE and PERSON were situated had been a focus of terrorist violence and terrorist action since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following further adjournments requested by the Government , the matter came before ORG on DATE . The court dismissed the applicant 's appeal . In giving his judgment , with which the CARDINAL other judges concurred , Lord Justice PERSON referred to the evidence from the Government relating to the possibilities of treatment and to their view that there was no particular danger in travelling along the main road between GPE and PERSON by DATE . He referred also to the evidence from the applicant with respect to the risk of relapse , the inadequacy of the alleged facilities and the state of disorder and violence which was alleged severely to compromise his ability to travel for regular treatment . He concluded , however , that matters of that sort were for the judgment of the Secretary of ORG :", "\u201c It is not for this ORG to take the decision as to whether the applicant should in all the circumstances be removed to GPE . It is for this Court to review in appropriate cases the decision of the Secretary of ORG on well - known grounds and the limitations imposed on the ORG are well - established . [ Counsel for the applicant ] , of course , is submitting that the facts as disclosed in the evidence filed on behalf of the applicant show that the decision is unreasonable in a ORG sense and/or constitutes a breach of LAW . However , it has to be said that the letters from the Chief Immigration Officer answer , it seems to me , with particularity each of the points which is made on behalf of the applicant . It is not for us to judge where the truth lies , for example , between the account of PERSON [ Deputy Director of ORG ] on the one hand and the account on which the Secretary of ORG has based his view on the other as to the situation obtaining in the area between GPE and PERSON . What would have to be established if this application were to stand any chance of success would be that the decision of the Secretary of ORG in the light of the information available was so unreasonable that no reasonable Secretary of ORG could have come to it . For my part , I see no prospect of a ORG being persuaded , if leave were granted , that that was the position . Moreover it is clear from the letter of CARDINAL July that quite exceptional steps are intended to be taken by the Secretary of ORG to endeavour that the applicant is adequately cared for on the journey and on his arrival , and , finally , I observe that it has twice been reiterated that his case will be reviewed in respect of the situation in GPE and also no doubt in respect of his current state of health before any removal directions are put into effect . ... while this is obviously a case which must have occasioned the Secretary of ORG considerable thought and which poses difficult decisions , he has taken decisions on the basis of information available to him and given a full and detailed explanation of his reasons . I see no prospect whatever of the ORG being persuaded that his decision is in the circumstances so unreasonable that no reasonable Secretary of ORG could have reached it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Removal directions were set for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's home village is GPE . His parents live there , as do CARDINAL of his brothers and a sister . His father is retired and lives on his pension . He has a CARDINAL - bedroom house . None of the family has a car . The nearest hospital with facilities for treating mental illness is PERSON in GPE , QUANTITY away . The Government have provided a letter dated DATE from Professor PERSON , a senior psychiatrist at that hospital , indicating that the hospital CARDINAL beds catering for persons committed in the context of criminal acts and CARDINAL beds for persons referred administratively . He stated that the drug olanzapine was available in GPE and could be prescribed in hospital pharmacies . Medical treatment , including drugs , was provided free to persons treated at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . In a further opinion dated DATE sought by the immigration authorities with the applicant 's consent , PERSON reported that , when seen in DATE , the applicant showed some signs of deterioration , with his auditory hallucinations having become more intrusive and with thoughts about harming himself and voices telling him to harm himself ( \u201c positive symptoms \u201d ) . He had been unable to sleep because of this . His olanzapine had been increased and he had responded to this . However , he continued to have considerable difficulty with motivation and social withdrawal ( \u201c negative symptoms \u201d ) . The applicant 's mental illness was likely to be a long - term one . She would expect that he would continue to have positive symptoms , which would persist and could worsen , although controlled to a substantial degree by olanzapine . At times , he might require urgent help with these symptoms . There had been a significant deterioration in his level of social functioning probably due to negative symptoms and which was likely to be significantly handicapping in DATE . With continuing medication and support from the mental health services , however , he would be likely to remain at the same level and not require very long periods of institutionalisation . Nor was he at a very serious risk of suicide . She stated , however , that if the applicant were to be returned to GPE she would be more uncertain of the prognosis . She thought it was", "\u201c highly likely that stressful life events such as deportation together with the more stressful environment he would be likely to encounter in GPE would trigger exacerbation of his symptoms as occurred on his last visit to GPE . ... his fearfulness when unwell and also the motivational difficulties and flatness of affect makes it very difficult for him to seek appropriate help when he does become unwell . ... If he were unable to obtain appropriate help , if he began to relapse I think that there would be a great risk that his deterioration would be very great and he would be at risk of acting in obedience to the hallucinations telling himself to harm himself or others ... Thus I do think that there is a substantial likelihood that forcible repatriation would result in significant and lasting adverse effect . \u201d", "She further advised that any change in medication from olanzapine to sulpiride would create a risk of deterioration in his negative symptoms and diminish the control of the positive symptoms .", "CARDINAL . Subject to exceptions , persons who are not GPE citizens may not enter or remain in the GPE unless given leave to do so . The grant of leave may be for a limited or indefinite period . Leave to enter is granted by immigration officers . Leave to remain is granted by the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG makes rules concerning the practice to be followed in applying LAW DATE . The rules concerning the admission and residence of spouses provide that indefinite leave to remain as a foreign spouse requires , inter alia , that the marriage be still subsisting .", "CARDINAL . Where there has been a refusal of leave to enter , there is a right of appeal under LAW of LAW DATE to an adjudicator . However , this appeal can not be exercised until the applicant has left GPE .", "CARDINAL . Persons seeking to enter GPE for medical treatment must show that they can maintain and accommodate themselves without recourse to public funds . The Secretary of ORG retains a power to grant leave to enter outside ORG , known as \u201c exceptional leave \u201d . The policy statement entitled \u201c Exceptional Leave \u201d ( DATE ) , although it applied to asylum - seekers , reflects the approach taken by the Secretary of ORG in this case :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Eligibility criteria", "ELE / R [ exceptional leave to enter or remain ] must be granted to asylum applicants if they fall under the following criteria", "\u2013 where the DATE LAW requirements are not met in the individual case but return to the country of origin would result in the applicant being subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or where the removal would result in an unjustifiable break up of family life . For example ...", "\u2013 where there is credible medical evidence that return , due to the medical facilities in the country concerned , would reduce the applicant 's life expectancy and subject him to acute physical and mental suffering , in circumstances where the GPE can be regarded as having assumed responsibility for his care . In cases of doubt , a second opinion should be sought from a credible source . ...", "CARDINAL . Disqualifying criteria", "A person should never be disqualified from ORG / R if there are substantial reasons for believing that he or she would be tortured or otherwise subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment if they were to be returned to their country of origin ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Decisions of the Home Secretary to refuse asylum , to make a deportation order or to detain pending deportation are liable to challenge by way of judicial review and may be quashed by reference to the ordinary principles of NORP public law .", "CARDINAL . These principles do not permit the courts to make findings of fact on matters within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of ORG or to substitute their discretion for the minister 's . The courts may quash his decision only if he has failed to interpret or apply LANGUAGE law correctly , if he failed to take account of issues which he was required by law to address , or if his decision was so irrational or perverse that no reasonable Secretary of ORG could have made it ( ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the recent case of NORP v. Home Secretary , ex parte PERSON ( DATE ) concerning the Secretary of ORG 's refusal of asylum to a young male NORP draft evader , Lord Justice PERSON , in ORG judgment , stated as follows :", "\u201c I therefore conclude that the domestic court 's obligation on an irrationality challenge in an LAW case is to subject the Secretary of ORG 's decision to rigorous examination and this it does by considering the underlying factual material for itself to see whether it compels a different conclusion to that arrived at by the Secretary of ORG . Only if it does will the challenge succeed .", "All that said , however , this is not an area in which the ORG will pay any especial deference to the Secretary of ORG 's conclusion on the facts . In the first place , the human right involved here DATE the right not to be exposed to a real risk of LAW treatment DATE is both absolute and fundamental : it is not a qualified right requiring a balance to be struck with some competing social need . Secondly , the ORG here is hardly less well placed than the Secretary of ORG himself to evaluate the risk once the relevant material is before it . Thirdly , whilst I would reject the applicant 's contention that the Secretary of ORG has knowingly misrepresented the evidence or shut his eyes to the true position , we must , I think , recognise at least the possibility that he has ( even if unconsciously ) tended to depreciate the evidence of risk and , throughout the protracted decision - making process , may have tended also to rationalise the further material adduced so as to maintain his pre - existing stance rather than reassess the position with an open mind . In circumstances such as these , what has been called the ' discretionary area of judgment ' DATE the area of judgment within which the ORG should defer to the Secretary of ORG as the person primarily entrusted with the decision on the applicant 's removal ...
