By contracts signed in DATE , in respect of donations inter vivos , the applicants became the owners of CARDINAL plots of land on the island of GPE . This island , situated close to the mouth of LOC , is part of the city of GPE , to which it is connected by a road bridge and a railway line .

The clauses of the contracts in question were practically identical . The contract entered into by the first applicant stipulated that the second applicant was acting as the donor \u2019s representative . Similarly , it was stated in the first CARDINAL contracts entered into by the second applicant ( see points ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the previous paragraph ) that the first applicant was acting on behalf of the donors .", "CARDINAL . The donors were all the heirs of the legitimate owners of the land in question , which had been expropriated by GPE after DATE . They had recovered ownership in the context of the \u201c denationalisation \u201d process in DATE . According to the applicants\u2019 explanations , which were not contested by the Government , the donations had been made in return for certain personal services that the applicants had rendered to the donors . PERSON NORP had thus given her land to the second applicant by way of remuneration for having helped her to complete the formalities to obtain restitution of her CARDINAL properties located throughout GPE . PERSON had apparently been a longstanding friend of the second applicant , whilst the donor of the other CARDINAL plots , PERSON , had given them to him as a token of gratitude because he had covered the cost of expensive heart surgery .

The parties agreed that the said value was not the cadastral value of the land in question ( that is to say , the reference value for the calculation of land tax ) , but an indicative sum solely for the purposes of calculating the registration tax , which at the time represented PERCENT of the property \u2019s value . Indeed , according to the applicants\u2019 explanations , which have not been challenged by the Government , cadastral values did not exist at the relevant time and the sole basis of calculation for the tax was the property \u2019s sale price , in accordance with the applicable law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicants paid ORG in notary \u2019s tax . However , they were not obliged to pay income tax in respect of the transactions , as gifts between individuals were not liable for such tax .

The parties disagreed as to the actual value of the plots of land in question at the time of their expropriation . The ORG explained that the use of the land had begun during the NORP era , in DATE , at the time of the construction of the port infrastructure \u2013 storage containers and open - air freight platforms \u2013 which can be found there DATE . In their submission , those port facilities are outside the general property market , with the result that an estimation of their possible market value would be impossible and devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 submission , the CARDINAL plots of land contained no infrastructure except for concrete blocks . They explained that the latter enabled the land to be used for the storage of shipping containers , but that no other equipment such as railway lines , cranes or warehouses had been installed there . Inventory records of CARDINAL of the plots of land , to which the applicants referred , indicate that the value of these concrete blocks is ORG QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL .

By Regulation no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , which was adopted in the context of delegated legislative authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and which entered into force on DATE , the ORG ordered the expropriation of all the land in question for the benefit of the ORG . On DATE the measure was confirmed by ORG , which enacted a special law for that purpose ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Under that law Mr PERSON and PERSON were to be paid compensation for the expropriation , which would be deemed completed once the sums had been paid into their current accounts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG ( Latvijas PERSON un zemes banka ) opened current accounts in the names of each of the applicants . On DATE the bank officially certified that the above - mentioned sums of ORG and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , awarded to the applicants by way of compensation , had actually been paid into the CARDINAL accounts . The applicants , however , refused to make use of those sums in any way . Following the payments , by CARDINAL orders of CARDINAL and DATE ORG ( zemesgr\u0101matu tiesnesis ) ordered that the title to the expropriated land be registered in the name of the ORG . No tax was levied on the above - mentioned sums .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant brought CARDINAL sets of proceedings to obtain rent arrears for the use of his land . In the first set of proceedings , against ORG and ORG , he requested the payment of sums due under the lease for the period from CARDINAL DATE to DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , upheld in cassation proceedings on DATE , ORG ordered ORG to pay the second applicant ORG ( about EUR CARDINAL ) for the use of his land during the period in question .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant subsequently filed a new claim against FAC , seeking the payment of rent arrears for the period after DATE , together with compensation for the servitude imposed on his property . On DATE ORG of ORG partly upheld his claim , awarding the applicant the sum of ORG ( about ORG CARDINAL ) on that basis , after fixing the amount of the rent at PERCENT of the cadastral value of the land at the material time . In fixing that amount ORG particularly took into account the fact that the second applicant had not invested in any development of the land in question . It further indicated that the applicant \u2019s title to the property had ceased on DATE , when the expropriation had become effective . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG of ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , PERSON , brought similar proceedings . In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered ORG to pay him ORG CARDINAL ( QUANTITY ) in rent arrears for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants sued ORG ministrija ) before ORG . In their pleadings they requested the annulment of the cadastral registration of the ORG \u2019s title , and the restoration , in the land registers , of the previous entries attesting to their ownership of the land in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of their claim , the applicants alleged that LAW provided for a uniform procedure which had not been observed in their case . According to that procedure , after the enactment of the special LAW DATE , ORG was required first to start negotiations with them with a view to reaching a friendly settlement as to the amount of the compensation ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) ; if those negotiations failed , ORG would have to refer the matter to the competent court for settlement of the dispute ( section CARDINAL ) . The applicants particularly emphasised that they were not satisfied with the sums paid by way of compensation and that they were deprived of their right to challenge those sums before a court . In this connection , the applicants pointed out that the orders of ORG had been made in the absence of any prior final judgment concerning the amount of the compensation ; they thus argued that the orders did not comply with CARDINAL of LAW . The applicants submitted that the expropriation in general and the transfer of title in particular had been carried out in breach of that LAW , thus directly entailing a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims . According to the judgment , the expropriation was not based on LAW , as the applicants had claimed , since the measure in question had been decreed in the context of the NORP land reform , and thus the special PERSON of DATE was to be applied . Section CARDINAL of the special PERSON provided that the mere existence of the law and the payment of compensation for the expropriation sufficed for the statutory transfer of title to the ORG . Noting in the present case that the corresponding sums had been paid into the applicants\u2019 accounts , ORG found that both of those elements were present , and that by registering the ORG as the new owner of the land in question , ORG had acted in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG pointed out that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE ( on the calculation of compensation ) referred to LAW decision on the conditions of entry into force of LAW and that this decision had been declared compliant with LAW No . CARDINAL by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed before ORG of ORG . They emphasised at the outset that they did not object to the expropriation as such , provided the statutory formalities were observed and the amount of the compensation was reasonable . In their view , this had not been the case , as , in particular , no expert \u2019s report had been ordered for the purpose of determining the actual value of the disputed land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The applicants did not challenge ORG finding that the PERSON of DATE constituted a lex specialis in relation to the general law ; they argued , however , that the said law could not be construed as derogating from the normal expropriation procedure and that , consequently , by recognising the ORG \u2019s title without having received a copy of a judgment determining the amount of the compensation , ORG had acted illegally .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal , essentially endorsing the reasoning and findings of the judgment in question . Addressing the applicants\u2019 objection to the compensation awarded , it pointed out that the amounts had been determined in accordance with LAW above - mentioned ORG decision . If the applicants had considered that the calculation by the ORG \u2019s ORG had been erroneous and that the relevant coefficients had been incorrectly applied , they could have challenged the calculation in separate proceedings , but they had not done so .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with the ORG of ORG . In their appeal , they submitted that the direct and immediate object of their claim was not to challenge the calculation of the compensation as such , but rather the fact that they had not been able to have the amount fixed through fair judicial proceedings , as required by LAW . If such proceedings had taken place , they would have been able to provide the court with evidence of their investments in respect of the land in question ; they pointed out that they were not entitled to initiate such proceedings themselves , as LAW reserved that right for the ORG authorities .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on the same grounds as ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG had granted the use of all the plots of land in question to a private transport company , B. , from which it has been receiving rent to date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG notified the first applicant of a tax reassessment , requesting him to pay the sum of ORG CARDINAL in land tax in respect of the land that had belonged to him , plus penalties , for the period from DATE to DATE , the date of the expropriation . The first applicant challenged this before LOC , which upheld his claim and annulled the reassessment . ORG appealed before ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the annulment of the reassessment . In its judgment the court found that , as the land tax was attached to a plot of land and not to a specific individual , it could be paid by someone other than the owner . It noted that the tax had already been paid by the public corporation responsible for the port \u2019s management which was using the land on the basis of a servitude . ORG lodged a cassation appeal with the ORG of ORG , which dismissed that appeal in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the second applicant of a tax reassessment for ORG , including penalties , for DATE . The applicant brought annulment proceedings before the court of competent jurisdiction , which upheld his claim . ORG appealed and on DATE ORG annulled the judgment of ORG , finding that the second applicant \u2019s land was not part of that for which the public corporation had paid land tax . That judgment was upheld in cassation proceedings . However , in DATE the ORG of ORG reopened the proceedings on account of newly discovered facts . The case file was sent to ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the second applicant \u2019s claim and annulled the disputed reassessment on the ground that the port management company had already paid land tax for the land in question . On DATE the ORG of ORG , ruling on a cassation appeal , upheld that judgment , so the second applicant was not obliged to pay any supplementary tax on the land in question .", "CARDINAL .
