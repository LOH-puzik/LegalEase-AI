He was the President of ORG .", "The second applicant , Mr Isorni , who was born in DATE and died on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , was formerly a lawyer practising in GPE . As First Secretary of ORG , he was officially appointed to assist the President of ORG in defending Marshal P\u00e9tain at his trial before ORG . On DATE ORG sentenced PERSON to death and forfeiture of his civic rights for collusion with GPE with a view to furthering the designs of the enemy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE newspaper ORG published a CARDINAL - page advertisement bearing the title \u201c People of GPE , you have short memories \u201d in large print , beneath which appeared in small italics , \u201c PERSON P\u00e9tain , DATE \u201d . The text ended with an invitation to readers to write to ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The text , which was divided into several sections each beginning with the words \u201c People of GPE , you have short memories if you have forgotten \u2026 \u201d in large capitals , recapitulated , in a series of assertions , the main stages of PERSON life as a public figure from DATE to CARDINAL , presenting his actions , first as a soldier and later as NORP Head of State , in a positive light .", "In respect of the CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL period , the text contained the following passage :", "\u201c PEOPLE OF GPE , YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES", "\u2013 IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ...", "\u2013 That in DATE the civil and military authorities had led GPE to disaster . Those responsible begged him to come to its assistance . By his call to the nation of CARDINAL DATE he secured an armistice and prevented the enemy from camping on the shores of the LOC , thereby saving the ORG . Power was then legally conferred on him by ORG , in which ORG had a majority . The grateful NORP people rightly saw him as their saviour . There were \u2018 forty million P\u00e9tainists\u2019 ( PERSON ) .", "How many no longer remember this and how many have disavowed it ?", "\u2013 That in the thick of difficulties which no NORP Head of State had ever known , NORP atrocities and persecutions , he protected them against NORP omnipotence and barbarism , thus ensuring that CARDINAL prisoners of war were saved .", "\u2013 That he provided DATE bread , re - established social justice , defended private schools and protected a pillaged economy .", "\u2013 That , through his supremely skilful policy , he managed to send a personal representative to GPE on DATE that he went to PERSON , thereby allowing GPE , in defeat , to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the NORP and the ORG and , through his secret agreements with GPE , to prepare and contribute to its liberation , for which he had formed the army of LOC .", "\u2013 That he preserved for GPE virtually every part of what people then still dared to call the NORP GPE .", "\u2013 That he was threatened by PERSON and PERSON for resisting their will , and that on DATE NORP troops carried him off to GPE .", "PEOPLE OF GPE , YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES", "\u2013 IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ...", "\u2013 That , while he was a prisoner of the enemy , PERSON was prosecuted on the orders of PERSON for betraying his country , whereas he had done all he could to save it .", "\u2013 IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ...", "\u2013 That , having escaped from GPE , he returned to GPE , however great the personal risk to himself , to defend himself against that monstrous accusation and to try to protect , by his presence , those who had obeyed his orders .", "PEOPLE OF GPE , YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES", "\u2013 IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ...", "\u2013 That the prosecution , with the collusion of persons in the highest authority , used a forgery , as in the PERSON case , to secure his conviction and that at DATE of age he was condemned , in haste , to death ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Members of the Resistance filed a criminal complaint , together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party , against a Mr L. , the publication manager of ORG , for publicly defending the crimes of collaboration with the enemy , and against Mr PERSON as President of ORG , Mr Isorni as the author of the text complained of and PERSON , as President of ORG , for aiding and abetting a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy .", "The civil party argued that the text was an apologia which contravened the criminal law since it tended to justify the policy of PERSON , who had been found guilty by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants denied that their advertisement constituted a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy , but acknowledged that the spirit of the text was consistent with their aim of having the judgment of ORG overturned and rehabilitating Marshal P\u00e9tain .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor filed his final submissions recommending that the charges be dropped on the ground that the offence had not been made out .", "He considered that \u201c the political and historical light \u201d in which the applicants had portrayed PERSON policy during DATE was \u201c radically different from the approach adopted by ORG of Justice \u201d : \u201c far from glorifying the policy of collaboration , the defendants ... [ gave ] credit to Marshal P\u00e9tain \u2013 the fact that their historical perception [ might ] appear incorrect , misguided or partisan being of little consequence \u2013 for his endeavours and actions to protect GPE and its people and his contribution to the country \u2019s liberation ... \u201d . He added that , although their aim had been to enhance PERSON image and praise his conduct during the Second World War , this positive assessment could be construed as a public defence of his actions \u201c only by arbitrarily separating the image thus embellished from its supporting text and its link with the purely extrinsic information which , for the most part , was contained in the documents on ORG file \u201d . He concluded that \u201c it might appear strange to commit for trial before ORG the authors and producers of a text which glorifies an individual , not for the crimes of which he was convicted , but for the beneficial actions which he is deemed to have performed for the good of GPE , its people and , secretly , the Allies \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge did not follow the public prosecutor \u2019s submissions . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , he committed PERSON , the applicants and PERSON for trial before ORG on charges , against the first defendant as principal and the others as accomplices , of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy , defined in section CARDINAL ) of the Freedom of the Press Act of DATE .", "The investigating judge observed : \u201c a public defence means a speech or text which tends to defend or vindicate a doctrine or an action \u201d . He noted that the applicants had presented Marshal P\u00e9tain \u2019s policy during DATE in a favourable light , crediting him with endeavours and actions to protect GPE and its people , whereas the same events had been the subject of lengthy , detailed reasoning in the judgment of ORG convicting PERSON . He therefore considered that the part of the published text referring to the GPE period incorporated , developed and glorified the grounds of defence submitted by PERSON at his trial before ORG and therefore amounted to a \u201c justification of the actions and policies of PERSON , convicted under ORG DATE of the LAW \u201d then in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , the proceedings before which had been joined by ORG and ORG and Interned Members of ORG , as civil parties , acquitted the defendants and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the civil parties\u2019 application .", "The court stated that its task was \u201c not to take sides in the historical controversy which , for DATE , has pitted the Resistance associations against PERSON supporters \u201d , but to determine whether the offence had been made out in the instant case . In that connection , the court specified that , \u201c according to the civil parties\u2019 and the public prosecutor \u2019s own submissions , the defendants [ were ] being prosecuted for their opinions ... \u201d and that \u201c no restrictions [ could ] be imposed on freedom of expression other than those derived from statute , strictly interpreted ... \u201d .", "The court held that only the part of the text referring to the PERSON period could be construed as a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy . It noted that this part of the text was clearly a eulogy of PERSON , an appeal in his defence designed to create a shift in public opinion favourable to the reopening of his case . It considered , however , that the offence had not been made out , for the following reasons : the text contained \u201c no attempt to justify collaboration with NORP GPE \u201d , but stated that PERSON aim had been to \u201c facilitate the Allies\u2019 victory \u201d ; PERSON collaboration with NORP GPE was neither acknowledged nor presented in a favourable light ; the fact that the judgment of ORG constituted res judicata did not in any way prevent the defenders of PERSON memory from criticising it ; the text was part of a campaign in which the second applicant had been engaged DATE to have the judgment of ORG overturned , an objective which was \u201c perfectly legal \u201d .", "The court emphasised , \u201c for the avoidance of any doubt \u201d , that its judgment \u201c should not be deemed to favour one of the arguments put forward in the historical controversy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG held , firstly , that the combined effect of LAW of LAW and LAW of DATE was that the civil parties did not have standing to trigger a public prosecution and , secondly , that the prosecutor \u2019s submissions on their complaint did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down on pain of nullity in the same LAW . The court therefore declared the prosecution and subsequent proceedings null and void .", "CARDINAL . ORG Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed on points of law against the above judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ) held that ORG had erred in law . Accordingly , it quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in its entirety and remitted the case to ORG with a differently constituted bench .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the CARDINAL civil party applications admissible , set aside the acquittals and awarded the civil parties damages of MONEY . It also ordered the publication of excerpts from the judgment in ORG .", "In its judgment it held that the CARDINAL constituent elements of the offence of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration had been made out .", "It found , firstly , that the public element had been made out owing to the fact that the text in question had been published in ORG .", "It went on to say that the text contained an \u201c apologia \u201d for the crimes of collaboration , and that the mental element had been made out , for the following reasons :", "\u201c The glorification of PERSON by the authors of this manifesto is conveyed by the celebration of what they seek to portray as great deeds ; thus , equal prominence is given , for example , to the victory at GPE and the defeat at FAC , attributed to PERSON like the securing of the armistice in DATE and \u2018 his policy\u2019 , described as \u2018 supremely ORG : \u2018 He managed to send a personal representative to GPE on DATE that he went to PERSON , thereby allowing GPE , in defeat , to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the NORP and the ORG and , through his secret agreements with GPE , to prepare and contribute to its liberation , for which he had formed the army of ORG . Praise of the PERSON policy is thus magnified by reference to its supposed results . This is indeed an unreserved eulogy of a policy which is none other than that of collaboration . The significance of the meeting between PERSON and PERSON at PERSON on DATE to which the authors of the advertisement refer were specified as follows in a radio broadcast by P\u00e9tain of DATE :", "\u2018 It is in honour and in order to maintain NORP unity , a DATE unity , within the framework of constructive action for a new NORP order that I DATE embark upon the path of PERSON", "The order referred to here was none other than the NORP order based on racism defined in PERSON , to which PERSON had just officially subscribed in advance by signing , on DATE , the so - called LAW relating to aliens of NORP race , who were later to be interned in camps set up in GPE for that purpose , in order to facilitate their conveyance to the NORP concentration camps which were their intended destination .", "Through the absence from the text of any criticism of these artfully concealed facts or even any attempt to distance its authors from them , this manifesto does indeed , therefore , implicitly but necessarily , contain an apologia for the crimes of collaboration committed , sometimes with the active participation and sometimes with the tacit consent of ORG , that is of PERSON and his zealots , in the very \u2018 atrocities\u2019 and \u2018 NORP persecutions\u2019 to which the text refers .", "The court is forced to the above conclusion without taking sides in the historical controversy between those who think that PERSON was really playing a double game supposedly beneficial to the NORP and those who place reliance only on PERSON \u2019s avowed policies and publicly announced official decisions , regardless of the excuses that he was able to put forward or that his supporters now seek to cloak him in . Accordingly , this court finds that the advertisement in issue did contain the apologetic element of the offence charged .", "In addition , for the offence to be made out , the mental element must be established .", "The accused , headed by GPE , the author of the manifesto , are seeking revision of the judgment given by ORG on DATE , which sentenced PERSON to death , forfeiture of his civic rights and confiscation of his possessions for collusion with GPE , a power at war with GPE , with a view to furthering the enemy \u2019s designs , this conduct constituting offences defined by and punishable under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW .", "The accused , with the exception of [ Mr L. ] , all claim responsibility for the text in issue and maintain that their object in publishing it was to create a shift in public opinion which , in their view , would increase support for a decision to reopen the case .", "This goal , pursued unremittingly by PERSON in particular , PERSON \u2019s former defence counsel before ORG , who seeks to have a new judicial decision substituted for ORG judgment , is considered by that lawyer to be a sacred duty of the defence . However legitimate on his part and the part of those who expressed their support for his action their intention to have the case reopened may have been , it did not justify the use of unlawful means to further that aim , since they knew that by putting forward an unqualified and unrestricted eulogy of the policy of collaboration they were ipso facto justifying the crimes committed in furtherance of that policy , and therefore can not have acted in good faith . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON appealed on points of law against the above judgment . In their statement of the grounds of appeal they relied on LAW and complained that they had been convicted for their opinions . Their aim had been to defend what they considered to be just in the action of a convicted person , without glorifying war crimes or the crimes of collaboration of which he had been convicted in the judgment which they were seeking to have overturned . They asserted that ORG had found them guilty of making an \u201c implicit apologia \u201d , constituted more by what they had not said than by the content of the text itself , holding that the manifesto in issue \u201c implicitly but necessarily \u201d contained an apologia for the crimes of collaboration and convicting them for what they had not written and the criticisms they had not made , despite the fact that they had referred in their text to NORP atrocities and barbarism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals on the following grounds :", "\u201c Having regard [ to the ] findings [ of ORG ] ORG , whose task is to determine whether the text prosecuted under section CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE constitutes a public defence of the crimes contemplated in that LAW , is satisfied from its examination of the article in question that the passage referred to by ORG falls within the contemplation of the aforementioned LAW . In presenting as praiseworthy a person convicted of collusion with the enemy , the text glorified his crime and , in so doing , publicly defended it . The mental element of the offence can be inferred from the deliberate nature of the acts on account of which the defendants were charged .", "In delivering that judgment , ORG did not exceed its powers . Nor did it infringe the right to freedom of expression protected by LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , since the exercise of that right may , under paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , be subject to certain restrictions prescribed by law , where these are necessary , as in the instant case , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE section CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW of DATE read as follows :", "\u201c Where a crime or major offence is committed , anyone who , by uttering speeches , cries or threats in a public place or assembly , or by means of a written or printed text , drawing , engraving , painting , emblem , image , or any other written , spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed , offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly , or by means of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public , has directly and successfully incited another or others to commit the said crime or major offence shall be punished as an accomplice thereto . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the same time , section CARDINAL provided that \u201c anyone who , by CARDINAL of the means set out in section CARDINAL , has made a public defence of ... the crimes of collaboration with the enemy \u201d was to be liable to CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of from CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts have gradually clarified the conditions for the application of the provisions making public defence of a crime a criminal offence .", "ORG has ruled that public defence of the crimes defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW of DATE is a separate offence from unsuccessful incitement to commit CARDINAL of the crimes listed in sub - sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the same section and that the constituent elements of each of those offences must not be confused ( Crim . DATE , ORG . crim . no . CARDINAL ) .", "As early as DATE ORG held that public defence of a criminal amounted to public defence of his crime ( Crim . DATE , ORG . crim . no . DATE ) .
