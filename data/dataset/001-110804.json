The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was questioned by the police after shouting from the window of the applicant \u2019s room . She stated that she had met the applicant that afternoon in a public house . After visiting further pubs she had accompanied him to his rented room where , she alleged , he had attempted to rape her . On DATE PERSON was again questioned by the police and criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . TIME and TIME on DATE PERSON was questioned by the investigating judge in the presence of the applicant , his lawyer , a psychiatric expert Mr H and the court stenographer . The applicant and his lawyer were given the opportunity to put questions to PERSON and the hearing was recorded on video . PERSON stated that in the course of the attempted rape the applicant had hit her across the left temple , grabbed her by the hair and threatened her with a knife . In the course of the struggle she had injured her hand on the knife . PERSON also stated that she had worked as a prostitute DATE , but said that the applicant had been unaware of this . At the end of the examination the applicant \u2019s counsel stated that she had no further questions to put to PERSON Subsequently the questioning was transcribed and the transcript ran to CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Graz Regional Court ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of attempted rape with violence . At the trial PERSON refused to give evidence . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) , which upheld his plea of nullity and quashed the conviction . It found that the proceedings before ORG were defective LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafproze\u00dfrechtsordnung ) as ORG had based its findings on PERSON statements to the police , which had not been read out at the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG then resumed the proceedings in a new composition . At hearings on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , it heard evidence from the applicant and further witnesses . These witnesses included PERSON , a waiter working in CARDINAL of the pubs which the applicant had visited with PERSON , PERSON , the innkeeper of another pub , and Mr L , PERSON partner . In the course of their testimony these witnesses made inter alia the following statements : PERSON , who had previously stated that he had noticed a blue mark on PERSON left temple , now said that he did not know exactly where the blue mark was and that he had not seen PERSON face . PERSON stated that PERSON behaviour often became erratic after she had consumed alcohol , that she frequently sought refuge from her partner and later invented a pretext , that her partner beat her and that she often had black eyes . Mr L stated that PERSON had worked as a prostitute but had stopped doing so DATE prior to the incident .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard evidence from CARDINAL police officers who had been called to the scene . All of them had noticed a knife wound on PERSON hand . CARDINAL officers had noticed a slight swelling on her temple . Another police officer had noticed loose strands of PERSON hair including some on the applicant \u2019s clothes .", "CARDINAL . ORG also heard evidence from Mr H , who had submitted an expert opinion on the question of the extent to which PERSON alcohol level at the material time had affected her ability to remember the events . Mr H stated that PERSON statements were likely to be true .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was invited to give evidence while the applicant , pursuant to LAW , was taken into an adjacent room . However , as LAW subsection CARDINAL of LAW entitled her to do , PERSON refused to give evidence and requested that the statements she had made to the police and the investigating judge be read out instead . The court granted her request . The ORG also granted the applicant \u2019s request for the video recording of her deposition before the investigating judge to be shown . However , when played , the video recording turned out to be a blank tape .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested PERSON credibility . He argued in particular that her account of how she had come to be in his room and of her conduct after the alleged offence was not plausible and requested the court to inspect the scene . He further contended that there were a number of discrepancies between the events as described by PERSON to the police and those she had described to the investigating judge , as well as between her evidence and the evidence given by the witnesses , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , at the trial . He therefore requested the court to call PERSON again and , to the extent his opinion was of relevance for the court , the expert witness PERSON The applicant submitted that PERSON should also give evidence on the methods he had used to assess PERSON credibility and the kind of questions he had asked when she appeared before the investigating judge . The applicant argued , lastly , that , in view of the large number of contradictions in the evidence given by PERSON , who was the sole prosecution witness , it was essential for the court to view the video recording of her hearing in order to be able to assess her credibility . He added that , if the recording could not be shown , then he should be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests for the further taking of evidence . It did not consider it useful to visit the scene as the room in question was no longer in the state it had been in at the material time . Furthermore , photographs of the LOC could be seen in a file prepared by the police , and it was for the court to analyse the inconsistencies between PERSON and the applicant \u2019s differing statements . For the latter reason it also refused to put further questions to Mr H. Lastly , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for PERSON to be called again to give further evidence as she had refused to give evidence at the trial and there was no indication that she would change her mind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in a formation of CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL lay judges , convicted the applicant of attempted rape with violence . It relied partly on PERSON statements to the police and the investigating judge . It noted that PERSON had been under the influence of alcohol to a considerable degree at the time of the events . The court accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that PERSON had accompanied him to his room voluntarily . It found , however , that despite PERSON inability to recall the events immediately before and after the attempted rape , her allegations of assault were credible . It noted in this regard that they were consistent with the other evidence obtained in the proceedings , namely the injuries to PERSON witnessed by the police officers . The court did not believe the applicant \u2019s account that he had invited PERSON for drinks all afternoon and then to his room out of sympathy for her . It further noted that the applicant could not give any convincing reason for the fact that strands of PERSON hair had been spotted by a police officer on his clothes . Furthermore , it did not believe the applicant \u2019s assertions that PERSON had injured herself in a fall on the way from the pub to his flat or that she had not suffered any other injuries , in particular the wound to her hand . Having regard to PERSON injuries and to the applicant \u2019s criminal record of CARDINAL previous convictions , it sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . Referring to a psychiatric expert opinion , it further ordered that he be detained in an institution for mentally ill offenders .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a plea of nullity with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) in which he complained inter alia about the dismissal of his requests for further evidence to be taken . He submitted in particular that the photographs to which ORG had referred did not show the room as it was at the time of the events . He argued that in view of the various inconsistencies in PERSON description of the events , ORG should have visited the scene in order to stage a reconstruction . He further argued that the proceedings had been conducted contrary to the direct evidence rule ( GPE ) in that the trial court had not seen the video recording of the hearing at which the depositions were taken . In view of this and of new evidence that had come to light at the trial , namely the statement by PERSON that PERSON frequently made up stories as she feared being beaten up by her partner , the trial court should have recalled PERSON or , at least , allowed further questions to be put to PERSON In the applicant \u2019s submission , the proceedings had therefore violated his right under LAW to conduct his defence effectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity . It noted that no inspection of the scene was necessary as the applicant \u2019s intention was to prove that PERSON allegations concerning the way to his room and her behaviour after the attempted rape were not true ; however , these facts had not been relevant to the court \u2019s decision . As regards his request to call PERSON again , the applicant had not submitted any reasons why PERSON would be prepared to give evidence after refusing to do so at the trial on DATE . ORG also found that the applicant \u2019s request to hear further evidence from Mr H had not been sufficiently substantiated as it was conditional . In any event , ORG had not relied on Mr H \u2019s expert opinion in its judgment . ORG noted , lastly , that ORG had dealt with the inconsistencies between PERSON statements to the police and to the investigating judge and between her statements and ORG statement in the context of its assessment of evidence , an assessment that appeared logical .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , but granted ORG cross - appeal and increased the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) , provides that all evidence must in principle be taken at the trial . In particular , witnesses and experts must make their statements orally before the court . Documents may only be used as evidence if they have been read out in court .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL lays down that court transcripts of the questioning of witnesses , other official documents in which statements of witnesses have been recorded and technical recordings of the questioning of witnesses may only be read out or shown at the trial if the witnesses concerned are entitled to refuse to give evidence at the trial ( Article CARDINAL ) and the parties have had the opportunity to participate in the questioning ( Article CARDINALa and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure provides for an adversarial hearing before the investigating judge if , on factual or legal grounds , there is reason to fear that the hearing of a witness will not be possible at the trial . The public prosecutor , the defendant and the defendant \u2019s lawyer should be given an opportunity to attend the hearing and question the witness .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL states that victims of sexual offences by the accused are exempted from giving evidence at the trial if there has been an adversarial hearing of the victim in the preliminary proceedings . This provision was introduced as part of the DATE reform of LAW . Prior to this reform , only minors aged under CARDINAL at the time of an alleged sexual offence were exempted from giving evidence at trial . The relevant explanatory notes to the government bill ( Erl\u00e4uterungen PERSON ) state :", "\u201c In fact it is to be assumed that the manner in which and date on which the victim gives evidence in criminal proceedings are closely linked to the context of the conflicting aims of victim protection , defence rights and the interest of prosecution . The DATE reform of LAW has already taken account of the necessary rights for the defence to participate in the proceedings and to question [ the victim ] and these are also relevant to the provisions of LAW . However , it would also appear to be in the interest of victims of sexual offences aged over CARDINAL for them to be questioned only once , as , in general , making a statement places a heavy mental burden on them . On the other hand , it can not be overlooked that if the victim is only questioned once and at DATE , there is a danger that it will not be possible to obtain complete consistency between this testimony and the results of subsequent investigations or examinations ... However , the argument in favour of nevertheless increasing procedural safeguards for the alleged victims of sexual offences is the danger of the court proceedings causing damage and traumatisation [ to the victim ] ( secondary victimisation ) which has , incidentally , been highlighted by all the experts who work with such victims . When responsibly weighing these interests of the victim against the interests of ascertaining the facts , preference must nevertheless be given to the protection of the victim , especially since it is usually possible to at least partly counterbalance the possible negative effects on evidence by corresponding \u2018 case management\u2019 and since an examination at a potentially DATE is not only in the interest of the witnesses but also promotes the purpose of the procedure , as recollections will still be fresh . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the presiding judge at the trial may exceptionally order an accused to be held in an adjacent room while a witness gives evidence . The accused must be informed of all statements made in his absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Code of LAW ( Strafprozessreformgesetz ) entered into force . While this act brought major changes in particular for the proceedings at the pre - trial stage , the above provisions remained essentially unchanged , even though the numbering of some of the Articles described changed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of Council Framework Decision no . CARDINAL of DATE on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings requires each Member State inter alia to supply evidence and to take appropriate measures to ensure that its authorities question victims only in so far as necessary for the purpose of criminal proceedings . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) require each Member ORG to make every effort to ensure that victims are treated with due respect for their personal dignity during proceedings , to ensure that particularly vulnerable victims benefit from specific treatment best suited to their circumstances and to ensure that where there is a need to protect victims , particularly those most vulnerable , from the effects of giving evidence in open court , victims may , by decision taken by the court , be entitled to testify in a manner enabling that objective to be achieved , by any appropriate means compatible with its basic legal principles .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE in case no . C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG stated that the objectives of these provisions consist , in particular , in ensuring that particularly vulnerable victims receive \u201c specific treatment best suited to their circumstances \u201d and the benefit of special hearing arrangements that are capable of guaranteeing to all victims treatment which pays due respect to their individual dignity and gives them the opportunity to be heard and to supply evidence , and in ensuring that those victims are questioned \u201c only insofar as necessary for the purpose of criminal proceedings \u201d . Where national legislation allows testimony to be given only once , during the preliminary enquiries , a national court should be able , in respect of particularly vulnerable victims , to use a special procedure if it best corresponds to the situation of the victims and is necessary in order to prevent the loss of evidence , to reduce the repetition of questioning to a minimum and to prevent the damaging consequences , for the victims , of their giving testimony at the trial ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
