On DATE the ORG ( Vojensk\u00fd obvodn\u00fd prokur\u00e1tor ) discontinued the proceedings that had been commenced on DATE and had subsequently led to the charges against officer PERSON After examining documentary evidence and testimony by the applicant , the accused and witnesses , the prosecutor found that the purpose of the applicant 's conversation with officer PERSON on the morning of CARDINAL December CARDINAL had not been to lodge a new formal criminal complaint against her husband . She had merely sought information about the state of the proceedings further to her criminal complaint of CARDINAL DATE and there was no suspicion that officer PERSON had committed any criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON \u00farad vy\u0161etrovania ) discontinued the criminal proceedings instituted against officer PERSON on DATE . Observing that he had acted in good faith and in accordance with the applicant 's express wishes , the investigator decided that the actions of officer PERSON had not involved the element of social gravity that was requisite in order to constitute a criminal offence . The investigator also observed that officer PERSON had already been discharged from the police and that therefore no disciplinary proceedings could be brought against him . The applicant challenged this decision by means of a complaint which ORG declared inadmissible on DATE , finding under LAW ( ORG ) that she had no right to make it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG summoned officers PERSON , GPE and GPE for trial in ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) on a charge of negligent dereliction of duty ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) in connection with the above events .

On DATE , following a hearing on DATE in which the applicant took part through the intermediary of her lawyer , ORG dismissed the summons . It found that the criminal offence of dereliction of duty presupposed a complete or enduring failure to discharge the duty . Merely impeding the discharge of the duty was not enough .

On DATE ORG quashed both ORG decision of DATE and ORG judgment of DATE . ORG found that the lower courts had assessed the evidence illogically , that they had failed to take account of all the relevant facts and that they had drawn incorrect conclusions . ORG found that it was clear that the accused officers had acted in dereliction of their duties . It concluded that there was a direct causal link between their unlawful actions and the fatal consequence . ORG remitted the case to ORG for reconsideration and pointed out that , pursuant to LAW ORG , the latter was bound by its above legal views .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in which the applicant took part in the capacity of a witness . Following the hearing , on DATE , ORG found officers PERSON , GPE and ORG guilty as charged and sentenced them to , respectively , CARDINAL , DATE imprisonment . All sentences were suspended for DATE . It was found that the accused had negligently breached the applicable service regulations and had thereby caused the death of the applicant 's children . When determining the sentence , ORG took into account inter alia the fact that the accused had thus far been leading honest lives , their work appraisals were positive and officers PERSON and GPE had already been discharged from service in the police . All the accused and the public prosecution service appealed . Officer PERSON later withdrew his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard and dismissed the outstanding appeals . It found that ORG had adequately established and correctly assessed the facts and had drawn accurate legal conclusions both as regards the guilt and the sentences . No ordinary remedy was available against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , lodged a complaint under LAW with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . She formally directed her complaint against ORG , maintaining that its officers ' failure to act had led to a violation of her right to protection of her personal integrity ( LAW ) , her right to protection from unjustified interference with her private life ( LAW ) and her right to legal protection ( LAW ) . She asserted that the police had been well aware of the situation that had preceded the tragedy of DATE and , in breach of their positive obligations , had failed to take the necessary action . She claimed that responsibility for this failure lay with ORG . She also maintained that the criminal proceedings which were currently pending could not afford her complete redress for the damage she had sustained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge bench of ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It observed that ORG only had jurisdiction if the matter concerned did not fall within the jurisdiction of another authority . Its power to award just satisfaction in respect of non - pecuniary damage could only be exercised if ORG had substantive jurisdiction over the matter . In the present case the primary issue was whether the officers who had dealt with the applicant 's case had complied with the applicable regulations . That issue fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and was being examined in the criminal proceedings which were currently under way and in which the applicant could claim standing to intervene as an aggrieved party . A ruling on that issue could nevertheless also be sought before the civil courts . To that end , the bench observed that the applicant 's range of options was not limited to actions of the type specifically provided for by statute . The bench concluded that , in these circumstances , the applicant 's complaint was premature and ORG had no jurisdiction to entertain it .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge , however , did not share the majority view and gave a dissenting opinion . According to him , in view of its primary purpose , namely to uphold constitutionality , ORG was free to examine complaints under the legal provisions which it considered to be the most relevant . The present case was to be examined primarily from the standpoint of the right to life and , in particular , the positive obligations inherent in that right . Contrary to the bench 's finding , and in breach of the positive obligations in question , there were no remedies available to the applicant under civil or criminal law permitting her to claim and obtain adequate and sufficient redress for her alleged nonpecuniary damage . He pointed out that not even the bench had clearly identified the remedies available to the applicant for that purpose . Finally , the presiding judge said that the principle that ORG jurisdiction was subsidiary , which was set out in LAW , was to be interpreted with a degree of flexibility in the light of the circumstances of each particular case . In his view , ORG was the only authority to which the applicant could have made her claim for compensation for nonpecuniary damage in the present case . It therefore should not have been precluded from examining the case by the possible existence of other remedies which in any event were not complete .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , lodged a fresh complaint against ORG with ORG . She reiterated the arguments she had submitted in the first complaint and added that the criminal proceedings had ended without producing any positive results in respect of her complaints . She maintained that she had no remedy before any other authority as regards the non - pecuniary damage she had suffered . She concluded that ORG was therefore called upon to deal with the merits of her case . She alleged a violation of her children 's right to life ( LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW ) . She further alleged a violation of her right to protection of her personal integrity and privacy ( LAW ) , her right to protection from unjustified interference with her private and family life ( LAW ) , her right to legal protection ( LAW ) , her right to security of person ( LAW ) and her right to respect for her private and family life ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint of CARDINAL DATE inadmissible , holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain it . In this context ORG held that the principal questions of whether there had been any illegal action causing damage to the applicant and who was responsible for it fell to be determined by the ordinary courts . More specifically , the question of whether a crime had been committed in connection with the events complained of was to be determined in criminal proceedings . ORG noted that in the criminal proceedings in the present case the applicant had failed to claim standing as an aggrieved party , which would have given her a series of procedural rights enabling her to influence their outcome . The fact that the criminal courts had sole jurisdiction in the matter meant that ORG had power to intervene only if the criminal courts had acted manifestly arbitrarily . The applicant had , however , put forward no arguments to that effect . ORG further held that , in any event , in so far as the complaint pertained to ORG failure to take action in DATE , it had been submitted outside the statutory DATE time - limit . Furthermore , the applicant had no right of petition , either of her own or on behalf of her late children , in respect of the alleged violation of their right to life . Finally , part of the second complaint was in any event inadmissible as it raised issues that were res judicata by virtue of the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The law concerning protection of personal integrity under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW is summarised in the decision of DATE in the present case . In addition , the following judicial decisions are of relevance .", "CARDINAL . In an action in ORG ( file no . CARDINALC CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) a mother claimed , among other things , financial compensation for non - pecuniary damage in connection with the death of her daughter . She relied on the previous conviction for manslaughter of a car driver who had run over her daughter .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG accepted that the plaintiff had suffered damage of a non - pecuniary nature and awarded her CARDINAL NORP korunas by way of compensation .", "CARDINAL . In an action in ORG ( file no . CARDINAL ) PERSON brought claims for protection of personal integrity against the ORG , in the person of the police , in connection with the death of her husband . She relied on a penal order ( trestn\u00fd rozkaz ) of that court of DATE in which a police officer had been found guilty of manslaughter under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW on the ground that , while questioning the applicant 's husband at a police station , he had failed to secure his service gun in an appropriate manner . He had thereby enabled the applicant 's husband to grab the gun and shoot himself dead .", "PERSON claimed , inter alia , financial compensation for the non - pecuniary damage suffered by herself and her late husband . She later withdrew the claim while at the same time submitting a similar claim in the name of her and her husband 's daughter , Miss PERSON", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the withdrawal of the claim by PERSON and discontinued the proceedings in respect of that claim . At the same time , it dismissed the claim in the name of Miss PERSON The reasons for dismissing her claim were multiple . The ORG was not the defendant to be sued in the present case , the police having their own legal personality and the capacity to be sued . The claim was statute - barred . And finally , at the time of the tragedy Miss PERSON had only been DATE and had mainly not been living with her father . She therefore could not have suffered any trauma . The action is still pending on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW and DATE , the public prosecution service is obliged to prosecute all criminal offences of which it learns , unless a statute or an international treaty provides otherwise . Authorities involved in prosecution , that is to say the police , investigators , public prosecution service and courts , are obliged to act on their own initiative .", "CARDINAL . ORG If a criminal complaint does not contain information excluding the possibility that a criminal offence was committed , and if there are no special circumstances , the police or investigator , as the case may be , are obliged to commence criminal prosecution immediately ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The concept of a criminal attempt is defined in LAW Conduct which is dangerous for society , which immediately leads to the completion of a criminal offence and which the culprit carries out with the intention to commit a criminal offence is considered a criminal attempt provided that the offence itself has not been completed .
