The applicants were subsequently moved back to FAC , where the investigator offered them documents to sign under threat of further ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were taken to FAC . As was later explained by the NORP police officers , this was necessary in order to verify the applicants ' possible involvement in the crime against NORP described above .

None of the police officers was suspended and some allegedly put pressure on the applicants and their families to withdraw their complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police inspector , Colonel PERSON , submitted a report to the Minister of ORG , describing the visit of the ORG to ORG and the findings made on DATE , namely that the conditions of detention and medical care there were inadequate and that a person detained there , identified as Mr PERSON , had been found to have suffered serious bodily harm . PERSON proposed that the person concerned be transferred as a matter of urgency to a secure location and offered access to a lawyer and that a report be drawn up in compliance with the recommendations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were taken , in the absence of their lawyers , to a doctor to determine the degree of damage to their health .

The preliminary investigation established the names of CARDINAL police officers who had dealt with the applicants ' case there and those of another QUANTITY officers involved in the case at FAC in GPE . On questioning , all the officers had denied ill - treating the applicants . Since medical reports showed slight injuries to both applicants and since the inconsistencies between the various pieces of evidence could only be explained after a full investigation , PERSON recommended the initiation of criminal proceedings against all QUANTITY police officers and investigators involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG asked ORG to initiate a criminal investigation into the case .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG acquitted CARDINAL officers accused of abuse of power for unlawfully beating the applicants . The court noted the ORG report , which stated that the delegates had examined the applicants and \u201c found certain bodily injuries \u201d . However , it found that it could not rely on the ORG report because , under procedural rules , only medical reports by specialist doctors could serve as a basis for a criminal conviction . Since the ORG report had not been made during the criminal investigation but was annexed to the file by the victims , it could not be relied on . The same could be said of the reports by ORG see above ) . The court did not comment on the medical reports dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the officers were convicted of negligence for failing properly to register ORG 's complaint in DATE and attempting to solve the alleged offence beyond the ambit of a proper criminal investigation . The applicants ' claims for compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of ill - treatment were rejected as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal of DATE PERSON complained , inter alia , of the court 's failure to convict the officers of torture . He also pointed out that both he and ORG had identified the police officers at an identity parade as the persons who had tortured them and that none of the officers could explain the origin of the injuries they had sustained while in detention . He referred to the statements of several fellow detainees in FAC who confirmed that they had seen ORG being taken in good health out of the cell only to return later with clear signs of ill - treatment . These witnesses denied seeing anybody in the cell hurt themselves . PERSON referred to the absence , in the criminal file against both applicants , of any reference to the applicants ' participation in procedural steps at FAC . This confirmed , in his view , that they had not been taken to that station for any lawful purpose . He finally referred to the civil action lodged by him and GPE within the criminal proceedings . He questioned the application of the amnesty law to accused persons who had not compensated the victims of their crime , a state of affairs which he submitted was contrary to the law . ORG lodged a similar appeal . In the prosecutor 's appeal it was mentioned that each applicant had been offered photographs of the entire staff of ORG for identification purposes and both had identified the police officers who had ill - treated them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly quashed the judgment given at first instance . It acquitted the CARDINAL officers who had been convicted of negligence by the lower court , finding that it had not been their duty to register ORG 's complaint . The court upheld the remainder of the lower court 's judgment , finding in particular that it had been right to reject the applicants ' complaint of ill - treatment . It considered that the statements made by the applicants were untrue because the description of their injuries in the medical reports did not coincide with their own description of the manner in which they had sustained the injuries and because \u201c they could use their statements as a means of defence in the criminal proceedings in which they were accused of serious crimes \u201d . Moreover , the ORG report and other related documents did not prove that the applicants had been ill - treated specifically by the officers accused in the case and thus could not be used as a basis for a conviction .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' lawyer lodged an appeal on points of law , relying on the various documents in the file and seeking the conviction of the accused for exceeding their authority through ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicants ' appeal on points of law , but allowed an appeal by the prosecutor , in which the latter sought the conviction of the CARDINAL accused . It ordered the rehearing of the case by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the district court 's judgment in so far as it had acquitted the CARDINAL officers of ill - treatment . It adopted a new judgment convicting all QUANTITY officers of manifest abuse of authority ( LAW see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . Each officer was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and disqualification from working in a law - enforcement agency for DATE . The court also decided to suspend the enforcement of the judgment , with DATE probation , finding that the officers were relatively young , had families , had not been previously convicted and were viewed positively in society .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . It found that the material in the file , including the ORG report , the witness statements and the medical reports proved beyond doubt that the CARDINAL officers had ill - treated the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted copies of newspaper interviews with members of the GPE branch of ORG and the President of ORG asserting that ill - treatment was routinely used in certain law - enforcement agencies , especially the police and investigators , in order to obtain self - incriminating statements and the conviction of innocent persons .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the ORG dated DATE , the applicants submitted that they had been detained in inhuman and degrading conditions both in ORG situated at no . CARDINAL GPE and , from DATE , in Prison no .
