SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 14+11;No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The NORP Engine Drivers ' Union ( ORG ) is a trade union founded in DATE with its head office in GPE . It is open to the five to CARDINAL employees of ORG who are either crewmen or personnel from among whom crewmen are recruited . Its membership rose from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE , then dropped to CARDINAL in DATE . Thus the applicant union comprises PERCENT of the eligible railway personnel , by far the majority of PERCENT - belong to the ORG 's Section of ORG ( ORG ) , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL principal federations of ORG employees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant union is an independent trade union . It complains that ORG ( PERSON , hereinafter referred to as \" the Office \" ) concluded collective agreements on terms of employment and conditions of work only with the said federations . It maintains that this policy has led to stagnation and a drop in its own membership ; the Government challenges these statements .", "General background", "CARDINAL . For DATE , workers and employers in the private sector in GPE have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the ORG .", "Certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in DATE and DATE by the following legislation :", "CARDINAL . LAW deals with collective labour agreements between employers or employers ' associations and trade unions . It specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements . For example , the parties may not take strike or lock - out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW contained rules governing the composition , jurisdiction and procedure of ORG .", "ORG was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of LAW on the Right to Organise and Negotiate . It also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation and application of collective agreements , but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue . Unions or non - union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable ( paragraph CARDINAL below ) were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts , as the case might be .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned DATE Act guarantees CARDINAL distinct rights to the parties on the labour market , namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate .", "The right to organise is defined in LAW as the right of employers and employees to belong to an employers ' organisation or a trade union , to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union , and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union , without interference or pressure by the other party . LAW specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated \" if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer , as the case may be , to refrain from becoming a member of , or to resign from , an association , to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association , or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association , and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer , as the case may be , on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association , exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association \" .", "The only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the LAW is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as interference in the affairs of the association .", "The right to negotiate is defined in LAW as \" the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general \" . It imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations , to attend meetings for negotiations and , where necessary , to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved . This provision is applicable to all trade unions including the applicant union . As ORG ruled in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this does not mean that the negotiation must lead to the conclusion of an agreement even where the substantive terms are not in dispute .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the ORG determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the ORG and the employees .", "As from DATE , the DATE LAW ( statstj\u00e4nstemanalag ) has virtually assimilated ORG employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights , strikes , lock - outs , etc . The LAW made LAW , the DATE LAW and LAW on the Right to Organise and Negotiate applicable in the public sector . Furthermore , the LAW provided for collective agreements to be concluded , subject to certain exceptions , between the ORG , representing the ORG as employer , and the organisations of ORG employees . ORG has a nominee on the governing board of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The DATE legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the NORP trade union movement ; CARDINAL factor that contributed much to its adoption was the conclusion in DATE of LAW ( slottsbacksavtalet ) between the ORG and the CARDINAL main organisations of ORG employees , namely :", "According to the information at the disposal of the ORG , these federations , of which numbers ( ii ) and ( iii ) recently merged , represent the large majority of NORP ORG employees : CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL whose terms of employment are negotiated by the ORG . CARDINAL trade unions are affiliated to these organisations . The few independent trade unions , including the applicant , represent CARDINAL ORG employees in all .", "CARDINAL . Clause CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees behalf by the \" main organisation \" concerned , unless the ORG and the \" main organisation \" agree otherwise . A note is appended stating that it is not thereby intended to depart from the earlier practice observed in regard to negotiations with a particular association as to any question which exclusively concerns that association .", "CARDINAL exception was made to this rule in the case of ORG ( Sveriges L\u00e4karf\u00f6rbund ) ; some other exceptions have been or are made from time to time . For instance , in DATE , the ORG concluded a separate collective agreement with an independent union of forestry workers . The ORG and the applicant union disagree about the circumstances surrounding the making of such exceptions .", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE relating to LAW ( ORG om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m . ) includes the following provisions :", "\" Collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the King - in - Council or by ORG shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the King - in - Council . \"", "\" An ORG which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers , notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement . \"", "CARDINAL . Certain forms of employees ' representation are confined to parties to a collective agreement . Thus , the applicant union complains , inter alia , of being disqualified from representation on ORG of the NORP ORG established by ORG of DATE , on ORG established by FAC , and on ORG . The applicant further complains that it can not appoint official trade union representatives under LAW of DATE on ORG at ORG ( lagen om facklig f\u00f6rtroendemans st\u00e4llning p\u00e5 arbetsplatsen ) , or safety inspectors under LAW , as amended on DATE ( lagen om \u00e4ndring i arbetarskyddslagen ) .", "CARDINAL . The law described above at paragraphs CARDINAL has in DATE undergone various changes . Thus , trade union rights in both the public and private sectors have been embodied in the new NORP LAW which came into force on DATE . In addition , the Act of CARDINAL DATE on the Procedure for ORG ( lag om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i arbetsvister ) has replaced the DATE LAW . Since DATE , the new Act has enabled any trade union , whether a party to a collective agreement or not , to bring before ORG any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of such an agreement .", "Facts of the particular case", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , the terms of employment and conditions of work of ORG employees were governed by a collective agreement concluded by the ORG and the CARDINAL federations . The applicant was not affiliated to any of these federations , but the collective agreement was made directly applicable to it by an accessory agreement which the ORG concluded with the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant indicated that it wished to terminate the accessory agreement as from DATE and it asked for negotiations regarding a new agreement , indicating certain general guidelines for the negotiations .", "On DATE , the applicant union submitted more detailed demands regarding the terms of employment of its members and again asked for negotiations which were to start at the same time as the negotiations with other comparable unions . This request was repeated in DATE and DATE .", "In DATE and DATE , the ORG held exploratory meetings with the CARDINAL federations and provided them with certain proposals regarding the terms of employment which were to apply to ORG employees in DATE and DATE . Following these meetings , the ORG also held a meeting with the applicant on DATE . On this occasion , the ORG and the applicant union examined the demands formulated by the union in its letter of CARDINAL DATE . ORG also handed over the proposals which it had previously presented to the CARDINAL federations . These proposals concerned all ORG employees , including engine drivers . Finally , the ORG declared that it did not intend to conclude a collective agreement with the applicant for DATE , nor even an accessory agreement such as that concluded in DATE . It stated , however , that it was prepared to continue discussing engine drivers ' terms of employment with the applicant union .", "On DATE , the applicant union asked the ORG to reconsider its refusal to conclude a separate agreement with the union , but the ORG replied on DATE that it maintained its previous position .", "According to the Government , the new attitude of the ORG which , even after the DATE reform , had concluded accessory agreements with the applicant and other independent trade unions , could be explained by the fact that in GPE , at DATE and in DATE , the trade union structures in the public sector were tending to disintegrate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant union proclaimed a strike and a blacklisting of jobs as from DATE After certain legal and other questions regarding the strike and the blacklisting of jobs had been discussed in writing and orally between the ORG and the applicant , the ORG decided on CARDINAL DATE to proclaim a lock - out of members of the applicant union as from CARDINAL DATE .", "The strike and the blacklisting became effective on CARDINAL DATE but were cancelled as from DATE Consequently , the lock - out did not become effective . However , in retaliation against the strike action , the ORG refused to apply retroactively to the members of the applicant union a new agreement concluded with the federations on DATE . This caused each member of the applicant union a loss of CARDINAL to CARDINAL NORP Crowns . Proceedings brought in the name of CARDINAL of the applicant 's members concerning this dispute ended on DATE by a judgment of ORG dismissing the applicant 's claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG transmitted to the applicant a copy of the final proposal made in the course of its negotiations with the CARDINAL federations . At a meeting on DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to conclude with it an agreement which DATE apart from certain clauses - would be identical with the agreement to be concluded with the CARDINAL federations . The ORG rejected this proposal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG concluded with the CARDINAL federations a general collective agreement for DATE . In principle , the agreement applied to all ORG employees , including engine drivers . In accordance with LAW relating to LAW , the application of this agreement was extended to the members of the applicant union .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting on DATE , the latter submitted to the ORG its demands for DATE . The applicant union also raised the question of a separate agreement . A further meeting was held on DATE at which the demands presented by the applicant on DATE were examined in detail .", "CARDINAL . By letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the applicant union reverted to the question of a separate agreement , but ORG decided on DATE to maintain its refusal to conclude such an agreement with the union .", "CARDINAL . Negotiations between the ORG and the applicant union took place at CARDINAL further meetings on DATE , DATE and DATE . At these meetings the ORG and the applicant discussed the terms of employment of engine drivers , and the ORG informed the union about proposals which had been presented during the negotiations between the ORG and the CARDINAL federations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG concluded a general collective agreement with CARDINAL of the CARDINAL federations , namely GPE and ORG This agreement regulated the terms of employment of ORG employees , including engine drivers , for the period DATE . Under LAW of DATE , this general agreement became applicable to the members of the applicant union as well as to the members of the other CARDINAL federations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant union introduced proceedings against the ORG before ORG , seeking a declaration that the ORG was obliged to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement with the applicant union , and also to conclude such an agreement with the applicant union if the parties were in accord on the substantive issues .", "The applicant union referred to Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate . The union also invoked LAW then in force , some general principles of NORP law and a number of international instruments including LAW .", "ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim in a lengthily reasoned judgment delivered on DATE . ORG held that LAW neither debarred a party from declaring at the outset of negotiations that it would not conclude an agreement , nor implied an obligation to conclude an agreement following negotiations . The ORG added that LAW did not afford trade union organisations any protection in their own right .", "ORG noted that the international instruments relied on could serve to clarify NORP law : while they had not been incorporated into NORP law , it must be assumed that NORP law intended to respect them . Nevertheless , the ORG found that the submissions on this point in the instant case did not cause it to alter its judgment on the questions in dispute .", "CARDINAL . On several subsequent occasions , the applicant union attempted unsuccessfully to secure the conclusion of a collective agreement ; its latest attempt was in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its application lodged with ORG on DATE , the applicant union alleged violation of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( article CARDINAL , LAW , article DATE ) of the Convention .", "The Commission declared the application admissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its report on CARDINAL DATE the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion :", "- that the conduct of the ORG might in principle raise an issue under LAW ) of the LAW , even if the ORG were fulfilling typical employer functions ,", "- that the refusal by the respondent Government to enter into collective agreements with the applicant did not violate LAW para .
