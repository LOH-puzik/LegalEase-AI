The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was the director of a municipal utility company , PERSON ( hereinafter \u201c the company \u201d ) , whose sole shareholder is ORG ) . The company primarily provides public utility services such as parking , waste disposal , funeral services , maintaining green spaces , cemeteries and so forth .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an article published in the DATE ORG list of DATE , Mr GPE , who was the mayor of GPE and chairman of the company \u2019s General Meeting ( skup\u0161tina ) at the time , criticised the way the applicant performed her job . The relevant part of the article reads as follows :", "\u201c ... PERSON does not hide his dissatisfaction with the work of PERSON as head of PERSON .", "\u2018 I can not speak for the others , but after everything that has happened , I can say that PERSON has betrayed the trust of the members of ORG because she disclosed information which should only have been discussed at the General Meeting . Likewise , in DATE [ annual ] report she spoke in positive terms of building a sports hall , and I do not know what happened to make her change her mind.\u2019", "In his words , dissatisfaction with the functioning of PERSON goes beyond the current political crisis in PERSON and the public statements of PERSON .", "\u2018 The fact is that we had even earlier objected to PERSON work because [ the company ] has been stagnating for some time now and functioning as a means of transferring municipal funds . Our municipal utility company does not carry out the type of business for which it was established . For example , LOC was leased as a parking lot and a dry [ dock ] marina , and the same applies to the parking lot near GPE . My question is , how does it benefit the concessionaires to have it and in addition pay rent for it ? Had it stayed in our hands we would , apart from making a profit , also have had the chance to employ ORG . PERSON does not hide his dissatisfaction .", "In a lengthy list of criticisms of the current director of PERSON , GPE states that he does not like the fact that she has been referred to as a member of his [ political ] party . He claims that he was the one who had advised her when she was appointed to the position as head of ORG municipal utility company not to make public statements as a member of [ their political party ] because someone could misinterpret [ the nature of ] her work and the way she came to get that position . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an article published in ORG list DATE , on DATE , the applicant replied to the above criticisms . The relevant part of that article reads as follows :", "\u201c The mayor of ORG , GPE , has publicly criticised the current director of PERSON for having disclosed information which should only have been discussed at ORG and for the company \u2019s poor performance , saying it does not engage in the type of business for which it was established .", "\u2018 They betrayed my trust by not believing me . I first informed my [ political ] party but there was no reaction . In particular , at a meeting held before the DATE session of the General Meeting [ of the company ] DATE , I warned them of all the irregularities , the financial losses and the ruining of ORG business reputation . Then they asked me not to talk about it in the presence of ORG [ who was the only member of the company \u2019s ORG from the ruling political party at the ORG level],\u2019 says PERSON , repeating that there are written documents in respect of all the issues she had warned ORG about .", "As regards PERSON \u2019s remark that the company has been stagnating under her leadership , she says that GPE , which does not have a development strategy , has itself been stagnating ... The main precondition for that ... would be , in her opinion , the resolution of property issues which remain outstanding in the case of most of the parking lots administered by ORG municipal utility company . PERSON illustrates this by referring to the PERSON parking lot where the municipal utility company has been charging for parking on land which was not even owned by GPE .", "\u2018 The legal department of GPE still requires [ the company ] to charge for parking even though [ the company ] PERSON refused to do so because of unresolved property issues . That case has now gone to court,\u2019 warns PERSON , \u2018 and a similar situation exists with the parking lot in GPE and [ the CARDINAL ] near GPE , which have been leased CARDINAL", "\u2018 Given that my work has been called into question I demand an audit of ORG ORG , and the involvement of ORG and the State Attorney \u2019s Office . I sincerely hope that the ORG institutions will do their job in this case , as that will save PERSON . PERSON needs professionals , but they are being removed , the proof of which is the proposal to remove PERSON as a member of ORG . I hope that a young and ambitious person will replace me and continue the work the municipal utility company has been doing so far.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a decision of the company \u2019s General Meeting of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was summarily dismissed because of the statements she had made in the media , which were regarded as being damaging to the company \u2019s business reputation . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c On DATE the ORG list DATE published an article ... stating that the director of PERSON , PERSON , had given a statement to [ a ] journalist of ORG list saying that PERSON was acting unlawfully , that it was charging for parking where it was not allowed , that she demanded an audit of ORG , and the involvement of ORG and the State Attorney \u2019s ORG with a view to looking into ORG operations .", "The director PERSON was at the time of the publication of the article ... employed as [ chief executive officer ] of PERSON , that is , the officer who heads the company and is responsible for the consequences of her own work . Making such allegations in a DATE newspaper , if those allegations are true , testifies to unlawful conduct in her job precisely because it is her duty as the officer in charge [ of the company ] to monitor and make sure that the utility company operates in accordance with the law . If , on the other hand , those allegations are not true but were nevertheless made in the publication that has the largest circulation in the area [ of the country ] then those allegations gravely harm the [ business ] reputation of the company because they suggest that ORG operates unlawfully .", "That kind of conduct , by an employee who was at the time of the publication of the statement in the DATE newspaper the director of the utility company , which she headed , who makes such allegations in the media or engages in unlawful conduct , constitutes , in the opinion of the company \u2019s ORG , totally inappropriate behaviour which tarnishes the company \u2019s [ business ] reputation in the eyes of the public . ..", "Such conduct ... depicting the utility company in a negative light [ constitutes ] a particularly serious breach of employment - related duties , and is a particularly important fact which , taking into account all the circumstances and the interests of both contracting parties , makes the continuation of the employment relationship impossible [ under LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant launched an internal challenge to her dismissal by lodging a request for the protection of her rights ( zahtjev za za\u0161titu prava ) , a remedy which is guaranteed for every employee by LAW and which employees had to use before bringing a civil action against their employer . The applicant argued , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c I contest entirely the argument that by making statements in the media I acted inappropriately and allegedly attacked the [ business ] reputation of the company ...", "The utility company is a public company which belongs to the [ local ] community ... It was my duty , as a member of the [ company \u2019s ] Management , to contact the media and inform the public because it is a public company and not someone \u2019s private property . I particularly emphasise that I have always given accurate information to the public .", "It is a well - known fact that the media show a great interest in GPE because of political turbulence among those heading the GPE . However , my observations were always a defence against the media attacks directed against me by the chairman of ORG .", ".. it is totally unclear what unlawful conduct I engaged in ? ? ? It is true that I warned about unlawful acts [ by the company ] but [ I did so ] directly to ORG and ORG . My statements were not directed against the utility company but made solely and exclusively with a view to removing any potential liability from myself . Therefore , the arguments in the dismissal decision are a twisted interpretation of the events . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant received no reply to her request . On DATE she therefore brought a civil action for wrongful dismissal against the company in ORG ( PERSON ORG ) . She challenged the decision to dismiss her and sought reinstatement . The relevant part of her statement of claim read as follows :", "\u201c The defendant obviously did not properly read the [ impugned ] article because the plaintiff merely states some facts in it and , as an example , refers to a particular case of unresolved property issues , which is already the subject of judicial proceedings , and calls for an audit and the involvement of [ the prosecuting authorities ] with a view to protecting her integrity by expressly stating : \u2018 Given that my work has been called into question I demand an audit of ORG , and the involvement of ORG and the ORG Attorney \u2019s Office.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicant . The court accepted that her statements in the media had been damaging to the company \u2019s business reputation and as such had constituted a serious breach of employment - related duties within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , making her summary dismissal justified . However , it ruled in the applicant \u2019s favour because it found that pursuant to her employment contract , her job as director of the company had ended on DATE , when the company had been required to transfer her to another job . That meant that she could not have been dismissed from her job as director , let alone dismissed with retroactive effect , as the decision to remove her had indicated . Furthermore , since the decision to dismiss her had specifically related only to her job as director , it could not be assumed that it had also entailed the termination of her entire employment relationship with the company , including the job to which she was supposed to have been transferred after CARDINAL DATE . The court thus found that the dismissal had been wrongful and that the applicant \u2019s employment relationship had not been terminated . It accordingly ordered that she be reinstated and assigned to another job within the company .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) dismissed an appeal by the company and upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court . Its reasons , however , were different .", "CARDINAL . It first noted that , contrary to the opinion of the first - instance court , the decision to dismiss the applicant had been aimed at terminating the applicant \u2019s entire employment relationship with the company , and not only her job as director , and had been capable of having that effect . However , ORG also disagreed with the view of ORG that the applicant \u2019s behaviour , namely her statements in the media , had constituted a serious breach of employment - related duties such as to justify summary dismissal . In that respect ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... the defendant company \u2019s [ internal regulations ] state that the business activities of the company are public [ and ] that the company informs the public by notifying the media of its organisation , the way and the conditions under which it operates , [ and ] the manner in which it provides services and runs its business .", "It follows that neither the [ internal regulations ] nor the [ applicant \u2019s employment ] contract prohibit public statements or criticism of the defendant company \u2019s business activities , which are public .", "LAW guarantees freedom of thought and [ freedom of ] expression , particularly emphasising freedom of speech and [ the freedom ] to speak publicly .", "As established ... by the first - instance court , the plaintiff \u2019s public statements had been made in reaction to the statements of ORG published DATE in ORG list on DATE , where he had criticised the plaintiff \u2019s work and stated that she had betrayed the trust of the members of ORG by disclosing information that should only have been discussed at the General Meeting , [ had said ] that the [ company ] was stagnating , that it did not operate the type of business for which it had been established [ and so on ] ...", "...", "Therefore , in this court \u2019s view , the plaintiff \u2019s actions should be interpreted as [ the exercise of ] her right to speak publicly and the right to freedom of thought , which are rights guaranteed by LAW .", "Therefore , in the view of this court , the plaintiff \u2019s conduct does not constitute a serious breach of employment - related duties as envisaged in section [ CARDINAL ] of LAW as grounds for summary dismissal .", "Specifically , in the opinion of this court , the plaintiff \u2019s statements are to be seen as [ a way of ] informing the public of irregularities in the activities of the defendant company as a public institution ; [ the statements ] were given in the public interest and in good faith and constitute a value judgment rather than a serious breach of employment - related duties . The first - instance court therefore correctly applied the substantive law when finding the dismissal wrongful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The company then lodged an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) reversed ORG judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The findings of the lower courts can not be accepted . In this particular case , the aforementioned statements by the plaintiff clearly damaged the reputation of the defendant company , since an employer whose leadership structures tolerate and encourage criminal activities certainly can not have a good reputation or be trusted in the business world . Therefore , the behaviour of the plaintiff , in stating on DATE in the ORG list DATE ... that the defendant company , which she heads , had acted illegally , namely by charging for parking when it was not allowed [ to do so ] , asking that the [ company ] be audited , and also seeking the intervention of [ the prosecuting authorities ] with a view to verifying the activities of the defendant company , has significant repercussions on the employment relationship between the parties and gives the employer a justified reason for terminating the employment contract , within the meaning of section [ CARDINAL ] of LAW . Having regard to the given circumstances , it is precisely this which is a particularly important fact making the continuation of employment impossible ... In this particular case , the depiction by the employee of the employer \u2019s business activities in an extremely negative light in the media is a particularly important fact of the kind which gives the employer a justified reason to terminate the employment contract .", "The plaintiff \u2019s reliance on her duty to speak publicly is unfounded . In this regard it is to be noted that the plaintiff could only have pursued her intention to prevent abuses and protect the property of the defendant company by turning to the relevant ORG authorities and lodging a complaint with them , which would have resulted in that information being available to the press and other media , and which could not have served as a reason for her dismissal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint , alleging , inter alia , a violation of her freedom of expression . In so doing she explicitly relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and served its decision on her representative on DATE . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ORG observes that the complainant justifies her conduct towards the employer ( namely , her media statements ) , on account of which the employer summarily dismissed her , by arguing that she had merely been calling for the supervision of her actions in the company by the relevant authorities . That argument is incorrect [ having regard to her statements in ] the article published in ORG list of CARDINAL DATE ...", "ORG notes that the right \u2018 of a PERSON to publicly express his or her personal opinions can not justify a breach of employment - related rights and obligations stemming from an employment contract and the relevant legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
