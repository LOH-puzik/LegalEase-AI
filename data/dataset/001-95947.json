The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a graduate in international economic relations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting on a claim by a company ORG , issued an enforcement order against the applicant on the basis of a promissory note .

On DATE the bailiffs\u2019 service suggested to the director of ORG ( \u201c the director \u201d ) that the applicant \u2019s passport be withdrawn . That request was based on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) , which provided for the possibility of prohibiting natural persons who had debts towards other natural or legal persons amounting to more than ORG CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) from leaving the territory .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant brought an application for judicial review , arguing that the domestic legislation allowed for the imposition of those measures only where the existence of the debt had previously been recognised by a judicial decision that had become final .

On DATE , following a request submitted by the applicant , the director contacted the bailiffs\u2019 service , requesting its opinion on the appropriateness of lifting the prohibition on leaving the territory , and indicated that the applicant had submitted evidence that he had provided security to his creditor .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The court held that a enforcement order issued by a court represented sufficient judicial recognition of the debt in question .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application . The court held that the judicial recognition of a debt within the meaning of section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE could arise from a judicial decision that was not res judicata , such as the decision to issue an enforcement order . The other arguments raised by the applicant were dismissed as unsubstantiated or of minor relevance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant , representative and only associate of the limited liability company \u201c ORG \u201d ORG , signed a contract for the sale of NORP cosmetics and cleaning products with a NORP company .

As the applicant could not travel to GPE in order to obtain approval for the goods , he subsequently withdrew . The reasons for his withdrawal were considered as a case of force majeure by the other party to the contract , and the applicant was not required to pay penalties .

These preventive measures can not be imposed if the debtor has provided security to his or her creditor or if he or she possesses assets of sufficient value to be used as reimbursement of the debts ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG considers that the instruction by which a court issues an enforcement order on the basis of a promissory note constitutes judicial recognition of the debt within the meaning of the DATE Act ( see , inter alia , Decision no .

Thus , courts were required merely to verify that the legal conditions set out in the CARDINAL Act had been fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . The liability of the maker of a promissory note lapses by limitation DATE from the date on which it is payable ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The limitation period is interrupted if enforcement proceedings are brought , and the interruption causes a new limitation period to begin to run ( sections FAC and CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . If in the course of DATE the creditor does not request new execution measures , the enforcement proceedings must be closed ( Article CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Civil Procedure ) . This provision was reproduced in similar terms in LAW , in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant alleged that there had been a violation of his right to leave the country , guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW . This LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone lawfully within the territory of a ORG shall , within that territory , have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence .", "CARDINAL . Everyone shall be free to leave any country , including his own .", "CARDINAL . No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are in accordance with law and are necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security or public safety , for the maintenance of ordre public , for the prevention of crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others .", "CARDINAL . The rights set forth in paragraph CARDINAL may also be subject , in particular areas , to restrictions imposed in accordance with law and justified by the public interest in a democratic society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the application is not manifestly ill - founded within the meaning of LAW of the Convention . It further notes that no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established . It must therefore be declared admissible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that the preventive measures envisaged in the DATE Act were inapplicable in his case . He considered that the domestic courts had incorrectly applied the relevant legal provisions , given that the existence of his debts had not been recognised by decisions that were res judicata . In particular , he alleged that an enforcement order issued on the basis of a promissory note could not be equated with a document entailing judicial recognition of his debts . Accordingly , he considered that his debts had not been \u201c established by judicial means \u201d . The applicant concluded that the measure taken against him had not been \u201c in accordance with law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the prohibition on leaving the territory had been imposed in compliance with the legislation in force , that it pursued the protection of the rights of others and that it had been necessary in order to ensure that that objective was met .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that LAW No . CARDINAL to the ORG guarantees to any person a right to liberty of movement , including the right to leave any country for such other country of the person \u2019s choice to which he or she may be admitted . Any measure restricting that right must be lawful , pursue CARDINAL of the legitimate aims referred to in the third paragraph of the above - mentioned LAW provision and strike a fair balance between the public interest and the individual \u2019s rights ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY , ORG , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that in this case it was not disputed that there had been interference with the rights conferred on the applicant by LAW .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the lawfulness of the measure , the ORG reiterates its settled case - law according to which the expression \u201c in accordance with law \u201d not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law , but also refers to the quality of the law in question , requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects ( see PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-V ) . In order for the law to meet the criterion of foreseeability , it must set forth with sufficient precision the conditions in which a measure may be applied , to enable the persons concerned \u2013 if need be , with appropriate advice - to regulate their conduct .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the expression \u201c established by judicial means \u201d could have given rise to various interpretations at the time the CARDINAL Act was enacted . In so far as the applicant complains of the lack of precision and foreseeability of section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of that LAW , the ORG reiterates that it is normally in the first place for the national authorities , notably the courts , to interpret and apply domestic law . It notes in the instant case that there exists a settled case - law of ORG on this provision . In those circumstances , the ORG considers that , even if it could have resulted in a certain degree of uncertainty at the time , the ambiguity referred to by the applicant can not in itself lead to the conclusion that the interference was unforeseeable to the extent that it was incompatible with the principle of lawfulness set out in LAW No . CARDINAL ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and , mutatis mutandis , ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) . Moreover , the existence of the debt as established by a promissory note could be challenged before the courts .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also considers that the imposition of a measure such as that in the instant case was intended to guarantee the interests of creditors and that in principle it pursued a legitimate aim , namely the protection of the rights of others .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the proportionality of a restriction imposed on account of unpaid debts , the ORG reiterates that it is justified only so long as it furthered the pursued aim of guaranteeing recovery of the debts in question ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL to CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . Furthermore , even were it justified at the outset , a measure restricting an individual \u2019s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual \u2019s rights if it is automatically extended over DATE ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IX ; PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ... ; and PERSON , cited above , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In any event , the domestic authorities are under an obligation to ensure that a breach of an individual \u2019s right to leave his or her country is , from the outset and throughout its duration , justified and proportionate in view of the circumstances . They may not extend for long periods measures restricting an individual \u2019s freedom of movement without regular reexamination of their justification ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 MONEY ) . Such review should normally be carried out , at least in the final instance , by the courts , since they offer the best guarantees of the independence , impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures ( see PERSON , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . The scope of the judicial review should enable the court to take account of all the factors involved , including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG , PERSON and ORG v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the applicant was prohibited from leaving the territory for the first time on DATE . That measure was lifted on CARDINAL DATE . It therefore remained in force for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the parties have not submitted detailed information on the conduct of the enforcement proceedings which were used to justify the restriction on the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement . It is consequently impossible to assess whether or not the steps taken by the authorities and creditors to recover the debts were sufficient , or to evaluate the applicant \u2019s capacity to pay the amounts due to his creditors . Nor were those circumstances discussed in the decisions and judgments of the domestic authorities . The director explained his decisions by the existence of a request from the bailiffs\u2019 service , while the domestic courts merely noted in their judgments that the applicant did not possess assets of a value equal to the amount of his debt and that he had not provided security to his creditors . Accordingly , the ORG is unable to rule on whether the imposition and maintenance of this restriction over a considerable period was objectively justified by the aim of guaranteeing recovery of the debts .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , the ORG considers that the facts of the case suggest that the applicant was subjected , from the outset , to a measure of an automatic nature . The measure in question was imposed by the director without a request for explanations by the applicant concerning his personal situation or even about the circumstances surrounding the non - payment of his debts , and without these issues being examined in his decision . While it is true that the effectiveness of a preventive measure frequently depends on the speed of its implementation , this does not dispense the relevant domestic body from an obligation to gather the relevant information once the measure has been imposed . In the instant case , the applicant was merely invited to indicate , before the director issued his decisions , whether he had provided security to his creditors . Thus , the ORG is of the opinion that the administrative body did not take account of all the relevant information in order to ensure that the restriction on the applicant\u2019", "CARDINAL . The ORG further notes that the director \u2019s decisions to impose a prohibition on leaving the territory were examined by ORG . In so far as that court held that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the appropriateness of imposing such measures ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG considers that the scope of the judicial review also failed to satisfy the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As to whether the domestic authorities fulfilled their duty to re - examine regularly the measures restricting the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement , the ORG notes that no re - examination of the impugned measures was carried out following ORG confirmation of the decisions by the director of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , the applicant has not specified whether he asked the director of ORG to lift the impugned measures after ORG had given its judgments . However , given that in reality it appears that he could obtain a lifting of the prohibition on leaving the territory only in the event of payment of the debts , presentation of a sufficient guarantee or , as was the case here , in the event of termination of the enforcement proceedings , the ORG considers that the applicant can not be criticised for failing to avail himself of that possibility .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing considerations , the ORG considers that the applicant was subjected to measures of an automatic nature , with no limitation as to their scope or duration ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . It concludes that the NORP authorities have failed in their obligation under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW to ensure that any interference with an individual \u2019s right to leave his or her country is , from the outset and throughout its duration , justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances . In view of this conclusion , the ORG does not consider it necessary to address the issues of whether the application of a measure restricting the freedom to leave the country on account of debts owed to private persons can be justified by the high amount of the debts in question or by their particular importance for the creditor , as , for example , in the case of a maintenance order .", "Accordingly , there has been a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of movement , guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary damage , which he linked to loss of earnings arising from the prohibition on leaving the territory of GPE . He alleged that had the branch of his company \u201c NORP \u201d OOD been able to develop its commercial activity in GPE , it would have made a profit of ORG DATE , or LAW for the period covered by the prohibition . He also considered that the sales contract for cosmetics and cleaning products , signed in DATE , could have earned him ORG CARDINAL . Finally , he requested payment of interest on these amounts , at the statutory rate , to run from the date on which the application was lodged with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed ORG CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage . He argued that , on account of the prohibition on leaving the national territory , he had been unable to meet his daughters after their departure for GPE , in spite of the fact that he had extensive visitation rights . Finally , he alleged that he had been unable to exercise his profession and that his reputation had been tarnished among his trading partners abroad .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered that the applicant \u2019s claims were illfounded .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not perceive a sufficient causal link between the violation found and the alleged pecuniary damage . In particular , it considers that the applicant has not submitted convincing evidence that his presence was essential for the performance of the contract signed in DATE . Furthermore , it notes that the finding of a violation of a breach of the ORG \u2019s duty to examine the proportionality of the measure restricting the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement does not amount to a finding that the measure lacked any justification . Accordingly , the ORG dismisses the claim concerning pecuniary damage . It considers , however , that it is appropriate to award the applicant LAW in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed ORG CARDINAL for the costs and expenses incurred before the ORG , of which ORG CARDINAL were for lawyer \u2019s fees and LAW were for postage , translation and certification of a document . With regard to the remuneration of his lawyer , he also claimed the difference between the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the equivalent of PERCENT of the amounts that would be awarded to him in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage . He submitted a fee agreement and invoices with regard to the other costs .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered these amounts excessive .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that an applicant may recover his costs and expenses only in so far as they have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum . In the instant case , having regard to the documents in its possession and the above - mentioned criteria , the ORG considers it reasonable to award the applicant the aggregate sum of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of ORG , to which should be added CARDINAL percentage points ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
