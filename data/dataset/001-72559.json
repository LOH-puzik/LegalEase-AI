All applicants live in GPE , the region of Velingrad . They are the heirs of PERSON , who possessed land in the vicinity of GPE until the collectivisation of agricultural land in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG adopted LAW which provided for the restitution of \u201c collectivised \u201d agricultural land . The former owners , or their heirs , could request the restoration of their right under certain conditions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the applicants requested the restitution of several plots of land .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , the local agricultural land commission partially refused the applicants ' requests . The refusal concerned , inter alia , plots covering CARDINAL ha in the PERSON area , adjacent to the GPE reservoir , in the vicinity of GPE , which are the object of the present case , as delimited by the applicants ' complaints and the ORG 's admissibility decision in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicants ' appeal against the land commission 's decision , on DATE ORG set aside the commission 's decision and restored the applicants ' title on part of the plots of land claimed , including those covering CARDINAL ha in the PERSON area . On the basis of documentary evidence and testimony of witnesses , the court found that in DATE and at the time of the collectivisation PERSON had been the owner , by virtue of acquisitive prescription , of a part of the land claimed , and that the conditions for restitution under the DATE LAW had been met in respect of that part of the land . The agricultural land commission , the respondent in these proceedings , was summoned but did not take part .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Chief Public Prosecutor instituted review ( cassation ) proceedings before ORG against ORG judgment . At the relevant time and until DATE ORG could institute review ( cassation ) proceedings under former LAW , thus intervening in a civil dispute .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the case on the merits and by judgment of DATE upheld ORG judgment . ORG dismissed the prosecutor 's arguments that the property rights of PERSON PERSON , whom the applicants inherited , had not been proven , that the land in question was not agricultural , could not be restored under LAW and had therefore remained State property . In particular , ORG found that even if part of the land may have been forested after the collectivisation , that was not an obstacle to restitution under LAW , only protected forests being excluded from restitution .", "CARDINAL . In compliance with these judgments , on DATE the local agricultural land commission ordered the restitution of the applicants ' land to them . On DATE they formally entered into possession thereof . On DATE they obtained a notary deed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the local forest authority brought an action for rei vindicatio against the applicants , claiming that they had unlawfully entered into possession of State forest land . The claim concerned plots covering CARDINAL ha , including the plots of CARDINAL ha in the PERSON area relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the disputed land had remained state owned and ordered the applicants to vacate it . To reach that conclusion , ORG re - examined one of the issues determined in the DATE and DATE proceedings and found that the applicants ' ancestor had not been the owner of the disputed land at the time of the collectivisation . Therefore , they were not entitled to restitution under LAW . Addressing the applicants ' objection that that issue was a res judicata , the court stated that LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW third persons who had not been parties to previous judicial proceedings were not bound by the res judicata effect of final judgments delivered in such proceedings . The forest authority had not been a party to the DATE proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . On DATE ORG set aside the judgment of DATE and dismissed the rei vindicatio claim . The court found that the plaintiff , the local forest authority , had not established that the disputed land was state owned . That finding was based on a fresh examination of the relevant facts and evidence and not on the res judicata effect of the DATE and DATE judgments .", "CARDINAL . The forest authority filed an appeal on points of law to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and granted the rei vindicatio claim , ordering the applicants to vacate the land .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that the DATE and DATE judgments had been pronounced in proceedings which were administrative by their nature and that therefore the plaintiff in the rei vindicatio proceedings was not bound by them . Furthermore , in the DATE and DATE proceedings the applicants had been trying to prove that their ancestor , PERSON , had been the owner of the disputed land at the time of the collectivisation on the basis of declarations made before a notary and statements of witnesses . Reexamining that question , ORG found that the ownership rights of PERSON had not been established . Also , it was not true that the disputed land was agricultural and that the conditions for restitution under LAW had been met . ORG further found that the disputed land belonged to the ORG . The forest authority had acted on its behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an enforcement judge effected the forest authority 's entry into possession of the disputed land , including the plots of CARDINAL ha in the PERSON area .", "CARDINAL . In the period DATE the local forest authority fined CARDINAL or more of the applicants , including Mr PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on the basis that they had \u201c unlawfully used land for pasture \u201d , \u201c built a cattle - pen on state forest land \u201d and \u201c constructed a hut without a building permit \u201d . Mr PERSON , the son of CARDINAL of the applicants in application no . CARDINAL ( PERSON ) , was also fined . The amounts of the fines varied CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) ( ORG CARDINAL being the equivalent of approximately EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was fined by order no . CARDINAL of DATE . On appeal ORG upheld the fine on an unspecified date . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court 's judgment and set aside the fine , considering that it had been imposed in breach of the law . PERSON allegedly tried unsuccessfully to obtain reimbursement of the fine .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was also fined and complained to the local prosecutor . In DATE and DATE the prosecutor , acting in accordance with her powers to request review ( cassation ) of judicial and administrative decisions , instituted such proceedings before ORG in respect of CARDINAL separate fines imposed on PERSON ( nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE ) . The prosecutor stated , inter alia , that the forest authority had acted in breach of the law , as they had been aware that the applicants had become the owners of the land they were using .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL final judgments of ORG of DATE CARDINAL of the fines ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE ) were upheld , as there was insufficient proof that the land for the use of which the Mr ORG had been fined was the same as that which had been restored to the applicants . The court considered that it was for the appellant ( the prosecutor ) to prove that fact .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was not summoned to these proceedings . Copies of the judgments were not served on him . On DATE he was invited by the fiscal authorities to pay the fines . Thereupon , on DATE he obtained copies of the judgments .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the third fine against Mr PERSON ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , it is unclear whether a judicial decision was taken on the prosecutor 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants reported to the police that their hut had been set on fire .", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE provides , inter alia , that persons , or their heirs , whose land had been collectivised , may request restoration of their ownership rights under certain conditions ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) . On the basis of certain statutory criteria , such as whether or not the plot of land once owned by the claimant or his or her ancestors had remained unaffected by urban construction , restitution may be \u201c in actual boundaries \u201d or through a redistribution plan .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL possible ways of obtaining restitution are provided for : ( a ) administrative proceedings , within DATE following the LAW 's entry into force , through a request to the local ORG ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act ) whose decision is subject to appeal before the courts ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , or , ( b ) after the expiry of that time limit , through a civil claim to the competent court against the respective land commission ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time land commissions were state bodies whose members were appointed by the Minister of Agriculture ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) . In DATE the commissions were replaced by the local ORG , whose members are appointed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The commission 's task when seized with a request for restitution under LAW was to establish whether the relevant statutory conditions were met and , if so , to issue a decision restoring ownership .", "CARDINAL . In deviation from general evidentiary rules , section QUANTITY , CARDINAL of the LAW provides that a wide range of evidence , including declarations before a notary , are admissible before the land commissions .", "CARDINAL . Land commissions may not revoke their decisions . Favourable decisions are not subject to appeal and are final . Under an amendment of DATE to LAW , in certain circumstances , such as newly discovered facts or evidence , the land commissions may modify their decisions within certain time limits ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some courts have stated that the decisions of the land commissions have characteristics similar to those of certifications in ex parte notary proceedings ( opred . DATE ; opred . CARDINAL - CARDINAL-VAS ) . It has also been stated that land commissions ' decisions are administrative decisions ( DATE - CARDINAL-III ) .", "CARDINAL . A person whose request for restitution has been refused by the competent land commission may appeal to the respective ORG ( section QUANTITY of the Act ) . ORG has jurisdiction to examine the matter on the merits , i.e. to determine whether or not the claimant has the right to restitution under LAW . The court may need to establish , inter alia , whether the claimants or their ancestors owned land at the time of the collectivisation ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-III ) . If it finds that the relevant statutory criteria for restitution are established , the court shall set aside the land commission 's refusal and order restitution ( section QUANTITY of the Act ) . ORG judgment is amenable to review ( cassation ) .", "CARDINAL . The special evidentiary rules of section QUANTITY , CARDINAL and DATE , according to which declarations made before a notary are admissible , are also applicable in judicial proceedings under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . Statements of witnesses are also admissible ( CARDINAL ; CARDINAL - CARDINAL-III ) .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings before the courts under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( on appeal against land commissions ' refusals ) are judicial administrative proceedings suis generis , their object being control of lawfulness of the commissions ' decisions ; these proceedings can not be characterised as noncontentious ( DATE ) . Parties to these proceedings are the land commission and the claimant . A third party claiming title of its own may not intervene ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-VAS ) . The scope of the proceedings before ORG is circumscribed by the disputed grounds for the land commission 's refusal ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-III ) .", "CARDINAL . No disputes other than those concerning the relevant statutory criteria for restitution may be examined in the proceedings before the land commissions or on appeal against its decisions . If there are disputes on other matters , such as , for example , objections by third persons claiming rights in respect of the land or disagreement between heirs , they must be determined by the courts in separate civil proceedings ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The prevalent judicial practice appears to consider that judgments under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( on appeal against land commissions ' refusals ) do not have res judicata effects ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-III ; TIME ; DATE ) . The contrary has been stated in a recent decision of ORG ( opred . CARDINAL - CARDINAL-VAS ) .", "CARDINAL . Persons claiming restitution of agricultural land who have missed DATE time limit under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL , may bring an action for a declaratory judgment against the local land commission . In these proceedings the courts determine whether or not the claimant has the right to restitution .", "CARDINAL . The lenient evidentiary rules of section QUANTITY , CARDINAL of LAW , which deviate from the stricter general rules of evidence , do not apply . Declarations made before a notary and other evidence that would be admissible in administrative restitution proceedings under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the LAW , are not admissible in proceedings under LAW ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-IV ) .", "CARDINAL . In the civil proceedings under LAW , if the courts decide in favour of the claimant , the land commission must comply and issue the necessary restitution decision ( ORG ) . Where the judgment has become final after the publication of the local land distribution plan , the land commission shall allocate to the claimant other available land .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings under LAW being ordinary civil proceedings for a declaratory judgment , they determine , with effect of res judicata , the claimant 's property right .", "CARDINAL . In such proceedings the lenient evidentiary rules under section QUANTITY , CARDINAL of LAW are inapplicable . The general , stricter , rules of evidence apply .", "CARDINAL . Judgments of the civil courts are binding on the parties , their successors , the courts and all other ORG organs ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The issue determined in the court 's holding on the merits is a res judicata . In order to establish the content of the issue determined in the holding , regard must be had to the scope of the dispute and , therefore , to the court 's reasoning . In addition , certain decisive findings on elements directly determinative of the disputed right or obligation may also be seen as res judicata ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL-I , CARDINAL - CARDINAL-I , CARDINAL - CARDINAL-I , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Final judgments preclude any re - examination of the same dispute between the same parties ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ) . They are not conclusive in respect of disputes on the same subject between different parties or between the same parties on a different subject matter . The res judicata effect of a judgment thus has a limited scope ad personam and a limited subject - matter scope ( except for several particular categories of judgments , such as those concerning civil status , which are binding erga omnes ) .", "CARDINAL . In judicial administrative proceedings , courts ' judgments setting aside administrative decisions and deciding the disputed matter on the merits are binding on the parties and constitute res judicata in respect of the rights and obligations that formed the subject matter of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Local forest authorities are state administrative bodies subordinate to the regional forest authorities and ORG at ORG ( section CARDINAL of the Forests Act DATE and section CARDINAL of the Forests Act DATE , in force until DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
