{"ITEMID": "001-61213", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ISL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF SIGURTHOR ARNARSSON v. ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , TIME on CARDINAL DATE he , accompanied by CARDINAL other persons , including Mr S.T.E. , entered a night - club , named GPE , in PERSON . After a while the applicant had an argument with a certain Mr PERSON , whereupon the latter arm - locked the applicant 's throat and both fell to the floor . A fight broke out involving ORG and CARDINAL of ORG 's friends . PERSON tried to stop the fight but ORG knocked S.S. unconscious , following which he fell on his back and hit the back of his neck on the floor . The applicant and his companions left the night - club in a hurry for ORG 's home .", "CARDINAL . When , shortly thereafter , the police officers arrived at the scene , a man was lying unconscious on a sofa in the innermost part of the LOC . According to the summary of facts found in the national courts ' judgments referred to below , the police officers had been told that he had been struck on the head and that QUANTITY persons , QUANTITY men and CARDINAL woman , had attacked him , struck him , treated him roughly and kicked him in the head . The person who was said to be mainly responsible was nicknamed PERSON , a reference to the applicant . The persons in question were also said to have beaten CARDINAL of ORG 's friends , resulting in visible injuries . The former had then left TIME - club . The police reports recording the witness evidence were not entirely clear . Investigators of ORG had not been called immediately and arrived at the scene after the witnesses had left .", "CARDINAL . While an ambulance took FAC to the emergency ward of ORG his heart stopped beating and his breathing ceased . The heartbeat was recovered after resuscitation in the ambulance , but on arrival at the ward ORG 's pupils were still wide and unresponsive to light . The only injury noticed on first examination was a small haematoma at the back of the neck . A tomograph examination however revealed an extensive sub - arachnoidal haemorrage . Brain surgery was performed immediately , but the attempts to save his life were unsuccessful . FAC died DATE .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy carried out on CARDINAL DATE concluded that an extensive cerebral haemorrhage had been the cause of death . Moreover , according to the autopsy report , from a bruise on the hairy scalp in the neck region and a haematoma under the scalp , it could be deduced that an impact ( i.e. a blow , a kick or a fall ) causing a sharp movement to the brain could have resulted in a tear of an artery and the resultant haemorrhage . No evidence had been found to the effect that the haemorrhage could have been caused by disease . ORG had been heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time he received the injury to his head .", "CARDINAL . On becoming aware DATE after the incident that ORG had been taken to hospital and was in a poor state , the applicant reported to ORG . During questioning he admitted to having had a scuffle with the deceased but he denied having kicked him in the head . A forensic examination was carried out on the applicant 's shoes DATE after the event but no evidence was found to substantiate such an allegation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S.T.E. was indicted with having attacked FAC , and for having dealt him a heavy blow to the back of the head causing him to fall unconscious to the floor . The applicant was charged with having subsequently kicked FAC in the head once as the latter lay on the floor , causing a massive cerebral haemorrhage leading to ORG 's death . The charges were made under LAW ( No . CARDINAL ) , as amended by LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before it , ORG of PERSON heard both defendants and CARDINAL witnesses . The witness accounts relating to the incident diverged greatly and some of the witnesses changed the version they had previously given to the police .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , ORG convicted and sentenced ORG to DATE imprisonment and acquitted the applicant on the ground of lack of evidence . Its reasoning included the following observations :", "\u201c The accounts of the fight at the GPE club diverge greatly but it has been established that it was of short duration and that it involved not only the defendants and the late ORG but also others ... . The LOC were rather badly lit with coloured and blinking lights . It is also to be borne in mind that many of the witnesses who have testified in this case were under the influence of alcohol , some of them heavily . It is also established that the deceased was heavily intoxicated .", "The applicant has firmly denied having kicked ORG in the head . S.T.E. has stated that , as FAC was on all fours trying to stand up , the [ applicant ] had kicked him distinctly in the neck with the tip of his shoe . [ ORG 's ] account is not consistent with any other statement and must be rejected . A witness has testified that [ the applicant ] kicked with the tip of his shoe on the back of the deceased 's head as he lay on his side . Others have not ascribed such conduct to the [ applicant ] and the examination of his shoes fails to provide support for this testimony . Nor is [ ORG 's ] statement ... supported by the nature of the injury on the deceased 's neck and what has been found as regards the type of shoes the [ applicant ] was wearing . Bearing this in mind , and having regard to the [ applicant 's ] firm denial , it has not been established that he kicked the deceased 's head . He is therefore to be acquitted .", "The defendant ORG has also firmly denied having struck the late S.S. On the other hand ORG has stated that a big , thickset man in DATE , wearing a ... striped or brightly patterned ... garment , dealt a man in a blue shirt a blow behind his right ear , so that he fell forward . ORG has stated that he saw ORG strike S.S. high on his head . O.R.J. has stated that he saw a man ... strike the deceased on the head , at the rear or on the side . ORG has described how a man in a light coloured shirt and jeans struck another man to the side of his eye with an audible impact and has stated that the man fell on the floor , again with an audible impact . Despite the fact that their testimonies are inconsistent , they all agree that the man stricken did not stand up again . ORG finds it established that ... the defendant S.T.E. dealt the late S.S. one blow to his head in the course of the fight , so that he fell on the floor and lay there unconscious . Nothing can be determined as to whether the cerebral haemorrhage was a result of the blow or the fall or both , but the defendant is criminally liable for these tragic consequences . He is therefore guilty of a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against the applicant 's acquittal to ORG and requested his conviction of the charges in the indictment and a sentence , as well as a heavier sentence for ORG further stated : \u201c [ The defendants were ] therefore summoned to appear before ORG when the case will be tried there , to hear the charges , to respond on their behalf and to accept judgment . They may not expect to be served any further notification or summons . \u201d", "In his supplementary observations of DATE , the ORG reiterated ORG finding that the co - defendant ORG had dealt the victim S.S. one blow in his head in the course of the fight so that he fell on to the floor and lay there unconscious , and that nothing could be determined as to whether the cerebral haemorrhage was the result of the blow or the fall or both . He pointed out that defendant S.T.E had stated that the applicant had kicked FAC in the head when he was trying to stand up and that witness PERSON had definitely stated that the applicant had kicked the back of S.S. ' head as he lay on the floor . Their statements related to the same kicking of ORG 's head . The discrepancy in their statements could not justify rejecting PERSON 's statement on this point . The grave and sustained physical assault by both defendants led to the haemorrhage and the victim 's sudden death .", "CARDINAL . In a writ of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant 's defence counsel replied that it could not be seen from ORG submissions that he considered that ORG had incorrectly assessed the evidence , as he did not request ORG to quash the lower court 's judgment and remit the case to the latter . Counsel for the defence further made detailed arguments against those made by ORG on the witness evidence , stressing that the evidence of the co - defendant ORG was unreliable as he obviously had a personal interest in the applicant being found guilty of the charges .", "CARDINAL . After having heard the prosecution and counsel for the applicant , but not the applicant himself or any witnesses , ORG , by judgment of CARDINAL DATE , convicted the applicant of the initial charge and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . Moreover , it upheld ORG sentence of ORG case - file included transcripts of the oral evidence before ORG and all documents submitted in the proceedings before the latter , such as police reports concerning the incident at the GPE club , statements of witnesses provided to the police at the investigation stage , autopsy reports and other results from the medical examination of the deceased , as well as a medical report on the applicant , and photographs of the applicant , his co - defendant and the other QUANTITY persons who were involved in the fight and who later became witnesses in the case . It also included photographs of the shoes which the applicant was wearing that night and photographs and drawings of the LOC where the fight took place at the GPE club . There were , moreover , several other documents , such as the applicant 's criminal record .", "CARDINAL . ORG held :", "\u201c ... ORG finding that the deceased died from a sub - arachnoidal haemorrhage resulting from an impact or impacts on the head is upheld . The only external injuries observed on his head were a bruise on the hairy scalp on the neck and a haematoma under the scalp . The injury was not shown to have been caused by a heavy impact or impacts on the neck and it has been sufficiently determined that a relatively light impact could cause such injury . The fact that the deceased was heavily intoxicated is also of significance .", "Despite the fact that the [ witness ] statements ... are somewhat lacking in clarity , ORG does not find it imprudent to conclude that both defendants , together with ORG , assaulted the deceased . The latter witness stated to the police , and in fact confirmed in court , that defendant S.T.E. struck the man on his head . This is supported by the statements of witnesses ORG and O.R.J. and also by ORG 's own statement that he struck CARDINAL fellow . However , it must be borne in mind that PERSON traces an injury to the applicant , and PERSON traces an injury to ORG Accordingly , ORG finds it proven that ORG dealt S.S. a blow on his head , with the result that he fell onto the floor . In witness PERSON 's statement , which to a certain extent is supported by doorkeeper DATE 's statement and the initial statements of those who were present at the scene to the effect that the deceased was kicked in the head , it has also been sufficiently established that the applicant subsequently kicked ORG in the head while he was lying on the floor .", "In view of all the above evidence it has been proven that both defendants attacked the deceased , who was so much under the influence of alcohol that he was unable to fight or to protect himself from falling . No other person can be considered to have inflicted on ORG the injury that led to his death . The defendants ought to have been aware that their assault could result in serious injury . Considering the act and its consequences which are to be regarded as unintentional , both defendant 's conduct is deemed to violate LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ... . According to the autopsy report and the statement of the doctor performing the autopsy ... the consequences of the assault were more serious than what was to be expected . This must be taken into account in sentencing . \u201d", "The minority ( of CARDINAL judge ) stated :", "\u201c The witnesses ' statements relating to the events at the GPE club on CARDINAL DATE ... are described in the majority opinion and in ORG judgment . The description includes the part played by the defendant ORG , who denied the charges . In spite of his denial , I find it established that , with his fist , he dealt [ S.S. ] ... a blow on the back of the latter 's head causing him to fall onto the floor where he subsequently lay motionless . An injury was found on the upper part of the neck . I consider that a judgement shall be rendered on the basis that this act perpetrated by defendant S.T.E. led to [ ORG 's ] death . ... I concur with the other judges that the penalty of this defendant shall be DATE imprisonment .", "The [ applicant ] also denied the charges . CARDINAL witness firmly stated that he saw this defendant kick the deceased in the head as he lay in the floor . Another witness , a doorkeeper at the GPE club , testified that he had seen someone kick the man as he lay on the floor . To him this seemed a kick , but he could not state who kicked , nor where the kick hit the body . The witness did not mention this when making his statement to the police on DATE . When questioned again by the police DATE , the witness was quoted as saying : ' This was a fight where he saw hands beating and feet kicking , but he could not determine who beat whom or whether somebody kicked somebody ' . Considering the case as a whole , the charges are not borne out by this witness statement . I find that the prosecution has failed to establish the [ applicant 's ] guilt and that his acquittal by ORG is therefore to be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW ( as amended by LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG cases shall generally be presented orally during the final hearing . The ORG may however decide that the final presentation of a case shall take place in writing , if there are particular reasons making this commendable . ORG may also receive a case for adjudication without a final presentation if both parties request this or if the appeal only concerns a revision of the sanctions ordered . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG may decide , to the extent necessary , to receive in court statements given orally in evidence , if the ORG deems , in the light of the facts , that the evidence in question may affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG can not order a heavier penalty or other sanctions unless the prosecution authority has , for that purpose , appealed against a judgment .", "CARDINAL . If an appeal has been lodged against a judgment by the prosecution authority but not by the defendant , ORG may nevertheless change the judgment for the benefit of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . In the case of an appeal on the merits of a judgment , ORG shall not change the sanctions ordered except if they exceed the limits provided for in the relevant criminal provisions or if they are disproportionate to the offence committed by the defendant .", "CARDINAL . ORG can not revise a district court 's conclusion concerning the evidential value of oral statements , except if the witness in question , or the defendant , has made a statement before ORG .", "CARDINAL . If ORG considers it likely that the conclusion of a district court concerning the evidential value of oral statements in court may be incorrect so as to materially affect the outcome of the case , and the witnesses in question or the defendant have not provided oral statements before ORG , ORG may invalidate the judgment of the district court and the district court procedure to the extent necessary to enable oral evidence to be received by the district court as needed , and a new judgment to be rendered . \u201d", "The Government submitted that , according to legal practice , the meaning of the expression \u201c evidential value of oral statements \u201d in LAW ) is twofold . Firstly , it refers to the assessment of the credibility of a witness and his or her statements considered on its own . For this purpose it is necessary that the witness appear in court and be questioned by the judge directly . Secondly , the provision in LAW ) refers to the weight of his or her testimony as compared with that of other evidence in the case , where ORG has accepted ORG assessment of the witness ' credibility . The main purpose of the provision is to guarantee that ORG will not reassess the credibility of a witness who has given oral evidence to ORG . According to the Government , this interpretation finds support in the explanatory report accompanying the bill for LAW No . CARDINAL amending the provisions regarding proceedings before ORG . If the latter considers that ORG has assessed the credibility of the witness statements wrongly , it would quash the first instance judgment and , in so far as necessary , order ORG to take new oral evidence and give a new judgment . An example of ORG having taken evidence under LAW ) could be found in ORG case no . CARDINAL , adjudicated on DATE , where ORG , after having already once quashed ORG assessment of the matter , found it necessary in a second round to appraise itself of the credibility of the accused 's defence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
