The relevant parts of the decision read as follows :", "\u201c The first - instance court established in the impugned judgment that the criteria for formation of classes in the defendant elementary schools had been knowledge of the NORP language and not the pupils ' ethnic origin . The [ first - instance ] court considered that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that they had been placed in their classes on the basis of their racial and ethnic origin . The [ first - instance ] court stressed that the complainants relied exclusively on the ORG on the activities of the ORG in DATE . However , the ORG said in his evidence that the part of the ORG referring to the education of GPE had been injudicious because all the relevant facts had not been established .", "The first - instance court relied on section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ... which provides that teaching in elementary schools is in the NORP language and NORP script , and considered lack of knowledge of the NORP language as an objective impediment in complying with the requirements of the school curriculum , which also transpires from the conclusion of a study carried out for the needs of ORG . The [ first - instance ] court found : ' pupils enrolling in DATE of elementary schools have to know the NORP language so that they are able to follow the teaching , if the purpose of elementary education is to be fulfilled . It is therefore logical that classes with children who do not know the NORP language require additional efforts and commitment of teachers , in particular to teach them the NORP language . '", "The first - instance court found that the defendants had not acted against the law in that they had not changed the composition of classes once established , as only in exceptional situations was the transfer of pupils from CARDINAL class to another allowed . The [ first - instance ] court considered that this practice respected the completeness of a class and its unity in the upper grades .", "The [ first - instance ] court considered that classes should be formed so as to create favourable conditions for an equal approach to all pupils according to the prescribed curriculum and programme , which could be achieved only where a class consisted of a permanent group of pupils of approximately the same age and knowledge .", "Furthermore , the [ first - instance ] court found that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that ... they had a curriculum of significantly smaller volume than the one prescribed for the elementary schools by ORG and ORG on DATE . The [ first - instance ] court found that the above assertion of the complainants relied on the ORG 's report . However , the ORG said in his testimony that he did not know how the fact that in GPE - only classes the teaching followed a so - called special programme had been established .", "The [ first - instance ] court established that teaching in the complainants ' respective classes and the parallel ones followed the same curriculum , according to the submitted school curriculum . Only in ORG were there some deviations from the school curriculum , but the [ first - instance ] court found those deviations permissible since they had occurred ... at the beginning of DATE owing to low attendance .", "After having established that the complainants had not been placed in their classes according to their racial and ethnic origin and that the curriculum had been the same in all parallel classes , the first - instance court dismissed the complainants ' action .", "...", "The reasoning of the first - instance judgment ... shows that the defendant elementary schools replied to the complainants ' allegations as follows :", "' The [ defendant schools ] enrolled in DATE those children found psycho - physically fit to attend elementary school by a committee composed of a physician , a psychologist , a school counsellor ( pedagog ) , a defectologist and a teacher . They did not enrol NORP children or GPE children as such , but children found by the said committee to be psychologically and physically fit to be enrolled in elementary school . ( ... ) The defendant elementary schools maintain that the first obstacle for GPE children in psychological tests is their lack of knowledge of the NORP language in terms of both expression and comprehension . As to the emotional aspect of maturity , these children mostly have difficulty channelling their emotions . In terms of social maturity , children of GPE origin do not have the basic hygienic skills of washing , dressing , tying or buttoning , and a lot of time is needed before they achieve these skills . ( ... ) It is therefore difficult to plan class structures with sufficient motivation for all children , which is CARDINAL of the obligations of elementary schools . There are classes composed of pupils not requiring additional schooling to follow the teaching programme and classes composed of pupils who require supplementary work and assistance from teachers in order to acquire the necessary [ skills ] they lack owing to social deprivation . ... '", "The reasoning of the same judgment cites the testimony of ORG , a school counsellor and psychologist in ORG , given on DATE ... :", "' Before enrolment the committee questions the children in order to establish whether they possess the skills necessary for attending school . Classes are usually formed according to the PERSON curve , so that the majority in a given class are average pupils and a minority below or above average . ... However , in a situation where PERCENT of the population does not speak NORP , a different approach is adopted so as to form classes with only pupils who do not speak NORP , because in those classes a teacher 's first task is to teach the children the language . '", "The above shows that the allocation of pupils to classes is based on the skills and needs of each individual child . The approach is individualised and carried out in keeping with professional and pedagogical standards . Thus , the Constitutional Court finds the applied approach correct since only qualified experts , in particular in the fields of pedagogy , school psychology and defectology , are responsible for assigning individual children to the appropriate classes .", "ORG has no reason to question the findings and expert opinions of the competent committees , composed of physicians , psychologists , school counsellors ( pedagog ) , defectologists and teachers , which in the instant case found that the complainants should be placed in separate classes .", "None of the facts submitted to ORG leads to the conclusion that the placement of the complainants in separate classes was motivated by or based on their racial or ethnic origin .", "The Constitutional Court finds that their placement pursued the legitimate aim of necessary adjustment of the elementary educational system to the skills and needs of the complainants , where the decisive factor was their lack of knowledge or inadequate knowledge of NORP , the language used to teach in schools .", "The separate classes were not established for the purpose of racial segregation in enrolment in DATE of elementary school but as a means of providing children with supplementary tuition in the NORP language and eliminating the consequences of prior social deprivation .", "It is of particular importance to stress that the statistical data on the number of GPE children in separate classes in DATE ... are not in themselves sufficient to indicate that the defendants ' practice was discriminatory ( see also ORG judgments PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and ORG and Others v. GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Moreover , the complainants themselves maintain in their constitutional complaint that in DATE PERCENT of NORP children in GPE were placed in regular classes , which tends to support ORG conclusion that there is no reason to challenge the correct practice of the defendant elementary schools and expert committees .", "...", "In their constitutional complaint the complainants further point out that : ' Even if lack of knowledge of the NORP language on enrolment in DATE was a problem , the same could not be said of the complainants ' enrolment in upper grades . ' They therefore consider that their rights were violated by the courts ' findings that it had been justified to maintain separate [ GPE - only ] classes in the upper grades in order to preserve the stability of the wholeness of a given class . The complainants submit that the stability of a class should not have been placed above their constitutional rights , multiculturalism and national equality .", "In that regard ORG accepts the complainants ' arguments .", "While ORG considers correct and acceptable the courts ' findings that lack of knowledge of the NORP language represents an objective obstacle justifying the formation of separate classes for children who do not speak NORP at all or speak it badly when they start school , ... bearing in mind the particular circumstance of the present case , it can not accept the following conclusion of the first - instance court :", "' Furthermore , the wholeness and unity of a class is respected in the upper grades . Therefore , transfer of children from CARDINAL class to another occurs only exceptionally and in justified cases ( ... ) because a class is a homogeneous whole and transferring children from CARDINAL class to another would produce stress . ( ... ) The continuity of a group is a precondition for the development of a class collective ... '", "Accordingly , ORG can not accept the following view of the appellate court :", "' The classes are formed when the children enter DATE of their schooling , not DATE , and their composition changes only exceptionally . They become a settled whole which makes for work of a higher quality and it is not pedagogically justified to change them . Therefore this court , like the first - instance court , concludes that maintaining established classes did not amount to an unlawful act . '", "The above views of the courts would have been acceptable had they referred to the usual situations concerning the assignment of pupils to upper grade classes in elementary schools where no objective need for special measures exists , such as forming separate classes for children with inadequate command of NORP .", "Considering the circumstances of the present case , ORG finds that it is in principle objectively and reasonably justified to maintain separate classes in the upper grades of elementary school only for pupils who have not attained the level of NORP necessary for them to follow the school curriculum of regular classes properly . ...", "However , there is no objective or reasonable justification for not transferring to a regular class a pupil who has attained proficiency in NORP in the lower grades of elementary school and successfully mastered the prescribed school curriculum .", "...", "Keeping such a pupil in a separate class against his or her will ... for reasons unrelated to his or her needs and skills would be unacceptable from the constitutional point of view with regard to the right of equality before the law , guaranteed under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW .", "...", "... a constitutional complaint is a particular constitutional instrument for the protection of a legal subject whose human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed under LAW has been infringed in an individual act of a ORG or public body which determined his or her rights and obligations .", "The present constitutional complaint concerns impugned judgments referring to DATE . However , not a single complainant alleges that in DATE he or she was a pupil in a separate [ GPE - only ] upper - grade class or was personally affected or concerned by the contested practice ...", "Although it does not concern the individual legal position of any of the complainants ... , in respect of the complainants ' general complaint about the maintaining of GPE - only classes in the upper grades of elementary school ORG has addressed the following question :", "- was the continued existence of GPE - only classes in the upper grades of elementary school ... caused by the defendants ' intent to discriminate those pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin ?", "... none of the facts submitted to ORG leads to the conclusion that the defendants ' ... practice was aimed at discrimination of the GPE pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin .", "...", "The complainants further complain of a violation of their right to education on the ground that the teaching organised in those classes was more reduced in volume and in scope than the Curriculum for Elementary Schools adopted by ORG and ORG on DATE . They consider that ' their placement in GPE - only classes with an inferior curriculum stigmatises them as being different , stupid , intellectually inferior and children who need to be separated from normal children in order not to be a bad influence on them . Owing to their significantly reduced and simplified school curriculum their prospects of higher education or enrolment in high schools as well as their employment options or chances of advancement are slimmer ( ... ) '", "After considering the entire case - file , ORG has found that the above allegations are unfounded . The case - file , including the first - instance judgment ... , shows that the allegations of an inferior curriculum in GPE - only classes are not accurate . ORG has no reason to question the facts as established by the competent court .", "The possible difference in curricula between parallel classes for objective reasons ( for example the low attendance at ORG where in the first term of school DATE the pupils in classes CARDINAL , , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL missed CARDINAL lessons in total , CARDINAL of which were missed for no justified reason ) does not contravene the requirement that the curriculum be the same in all parallel classes .", "ORG is obliged to point out that neither the LAW nor the LAW guarantees any specific requirements concerning school curricula or their implementation . First and foremost the LAW and the LAW guarantee a right of access to educational institutions existing in a given ORG , as well as an effective right to education , in other words that every person has an equal right to obtain official recognition of the studies which he or she has completed ( a similar view was expressed by ORG in a case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in GPE v. GPE , \u00a7 BCARDINAL ) . ...", "... ORG finds the evidence submitted in the present proceedings insufficient to show beyond doubt that the complainants had to follow a school curriculum of lesser scope . ...", "Thus , ORG considers the complainants ' assertion about being stigmatised as a subjective value judgment , without reasonable justification . ORG finds no factual support for the complainants ' assertion that the source of their stigmatisation was an allegedly reduced curriculum owing to which their prospects for further education were lower , and dismisses that assertion as arbitrary .
