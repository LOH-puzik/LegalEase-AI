It further specified that the ORG \u2019s decisions in individual cases were to be taken on the basis of internal regulations . A decision in an individual case could be appealed against ; however , a decision taken after an appeal had been considered was final and no appeal lay against it ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of the amended statutes , ORG was to determine individual claims for assistance filed by victims of NORP persecution .

III ZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , holding that , since administrative functions could only be delegated by statute , which was not the case with regard to the Polish - German Reconciliation Foundation , its decisions did not meet the requirements of an administrative decision and thus could not be appealed to ORG . However , ORG refused to give a definite answer as to whether the ORG \u2019s decisions could be subject to judicial review in civil proceedings . It nevertheless observed that entitlement to receive a benefit from the ORG did not fall within the scope of civil law , and thus could not be raised before a civil court . In exceptional cases , such as where the claimant \u2019s eligibility had been established but the benefit was not paid , a claim could arise under civil law .", "In Resolution no . OPS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG upheld the earlier case - law to the effect that it did not have jurisdiction to review the decisions of the ORG and observed that :", "\u201c The Polish - German Reconciliation Foundation , which awards benefits to the victims of NORP persecutions using the financial resources allocated to it by foreign entities , does not perform functions in the area of public administration . Thus , the source of the entitlement to receive an award from the ORG does not stem from actions of the public administration . \u201d", "It further observed :", "\u201c There is no doubt that the Agreement of DATE , concluded between the NORP and ORG , which was not ratified , as well as subsequent acts [ starting with ORG and LAW ] concerning grants of financial assistance by the ORG on account of NORP persecution do not fulfil the criteria which would make it possible to classify them as sources of binding NORP law . No administrative - law relation arises between a claimant and the ORG on the basis of the aforementioned acts , and consequently the ORG is not an organ of public administration established by law to determine cases in the sphere of public administration . \u201d", "On DATE ORG adopted Resolution no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL in response to a question of law put forward by the ORG . It revisited its earlier case - law on the interpretation of the notion of a \u201c civil case \u201d laid out in LAW in relation to claims against the ORG . ORG held that :", "\u201c The [ civil ] courts have jurisdiction in the case where a claimant \u2013 due to an unfavourable decision by the \u201c NORP - German Reconciliation \u201d Foundation \u2013 is seeking a payment [ from the ORG ] in respect of NORP persecution . \u201d", "In the reasons for its ORG found , inter alia , that :", "\u201c The procedure concerning examination of claims under the first and the second NORP fund ... may not be currently instituted . The relevant funds were allocated and the disbursement of payments has been finally concluded . ( ... )", "There is no doubt that the current state of affairs resulting from the relevant case - law , under which those persons interested in challenging before a court the ORG \u2019s refusal to grant them a suitable payment are deprived of such a possibility , can not be accepted in the light of the binding constitutional and LAW . LAW in conjunction with LAW establishes a presumption in favour of jurisdiction of the ordinary courts which indicates \u2013 at least indirectly \u2013 that a possible jurisdiction of the administrative courts should be based on a specific statutory rule . ( ... )", "The need for extensive interpretation of the individual \u2019s access to a court , or in other words , the right to bring an action ( the right to a court ) follows also from LAW , which stipulate that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of his civil rights and obligations . It may be assumed from the established case - law of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention guarantees to everyone the inalienable right to submit for a judicial determination any claims concerning civil rights and obligations .... Obviously , the right to a court does not denote the right to \u201c win \u201d a case , but it signifies that the filed claim should be examined by a court and determined on the merits ( judgment of ORG of DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "The results of interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure thus require us to acknowledge that the [ civil ] court has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case in the substantive sense and where no particular provision delegates its examination and determination to a different organ than an ordinary court . The [ civil ] court also has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case only in the formal sense . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
