On DATE the Podkarpackie Governor replied to the statement of claim , arguing that he could not act as a defendant in the proceedings .

Nonetheless , the applicant had in the past received compensation , in an unspecified amount , for certain damage caused to her property after the expropriation proceedings had been instituted .

As for the physical damage to the house and garage , the court stated that the applicant had not established the responsibility of the defendant ORG for it . According to the court , it was essential to establish which administrative entity was originally to benefit from the property 's expropriation and which public authority had ordered the works carried out on the applicant 's plot . It fell to the applicant to establish the legal and factual elements of the case decisive for the determination whether it was ORG or the local municipality which should have been sued in the case .
