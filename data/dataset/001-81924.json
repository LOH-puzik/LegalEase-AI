No appeals were made and the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON ORG Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) issued a provisional penal order ( Strafverf\u00fcgung ) finding the applicant guilty of having failed to stop after the traffic accident of CARDINAL DATE and of having failed to inform the next police station ( LAW CARDINAL ( a ) and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW ( a ) of LAW ) .
