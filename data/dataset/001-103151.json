The applicant is a limited partnership under liquidation , with its seat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG established that the applicant owed MONEY ( ORG ) in outstanding taxes . To secure this claim , on DATE it attached a CARDINAL%-share the applicant had in another company , which was nominally worth over ORG CARDINAL . Aware of the applicant \u2019s own intention to sell the share by DATE , ORG forbade the transaction but did not proceed to auctioning it within the statutory DATE deadline or afterwards .", "CARDINAL . In the ensuing DATE administrative procedure , the applicant \u2019s tax debt was eventually cancelled and the asset unfrozen . However , by that time the company in which the share belonged had been liquidated \u2013 as of DATE \u2013 and the share had lost its value altogether .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time in DATE the applicant sued ORG for damages . On DATE the Baranya County Regional Court awarded it ORG CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed this decision . On DATE ORG again found for the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE ORG reversed this judgment and rejected the applicant \u2019s action . It held in essence that there had been no causal link between ORG unlawful omission to hold an auction to sell the attached asset within DATE from its attachment , as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Enforcement Act DATE , and the damage the plaintiff had sustained . In the court \u2019s view , the burden of proof to show that had there been a timely auction the share could have successfully been sold to a buyer with the requisite liquidity lay with the applicant . However , the applicant could not prove this assertion . The court observed that the buyer suggested by the applicant had never had , according to its books , the capital needed for the acquisition ; that the company in which the share belonged had lost all its own capital by DATE and been in liquidation as of DATE ; and that its manager had been convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy .", "CARDINAL .
