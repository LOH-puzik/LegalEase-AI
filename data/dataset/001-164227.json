The applicant held a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in GPE measuring QUANTITY . The flat was located in a socially - owned building in the centre of GPE built in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the local authorities decided to demolish the building because it was so dilapidated that it risked collapsing at any time and thus posed a risk to life and property . The decision specified that the building would be demolished once all the tenants ( CARDINAL at the time , including the applicant ) had vacated it , after being provided with replacement flats pursuant to the law , in particular section PERSON ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that decision CARDINAL of the tenants living in the building were subsequently allocated replacement flats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG entered into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It entitled holders of specially protected tenancies to purchase the flats in respect of which they held such a tenancy under favourable conditions . In that way , a large majority of specially protected tenancies became a right of ownership for those tenants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an explosive device was detonated in front of CARDINAL of the flats in the building , which caused further damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and another tenant who were still living in the building , wrote to the local authorities housing department asking it to allocate them urgently replacement flats , as after the explosion the building was no longer suitable for habitation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authorities held an on - site inspection and established that due to the damage caused by the explosion , the building was indeed no longer habitable and that the CARDINAL remaining tenants ( of which CARDINAL was the applicant ) had moved in with their friends .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was offered a replacement flat in GPE measuring QUANTITY .

On DATE the applicant , relying on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , brought a civil action against the local authorities , in particular GPE , before ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking to be provided with a replacement flat .

At the hearing held on DATE the applicant stated , inter alia , that the building in which his old flat was located had been demolished .", "CARDINAL .
