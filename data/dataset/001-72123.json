The official records indicated that the inhabitants of ORG had evacuated their village on account of intense terrorist activities in the region and threats issued by the ORG ( Workers\u2019 ORG ) terrorist organisation against the villagers . The security forces had not forced the applicant or his fellow villagers to leave their village .", "CARDINAL . NORP Currently there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages . Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages , as demonstrated by CARDINAL applicants who indicated in their petitions to ORG that their current domiciles were in their respective villages ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by ORG and entered into force on DATE . That PERSON provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the LAW grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages .", "CARDINAL .

NORP This report was prepared by a commission of inquiry composed of CARDINAL members of parliament . According to the report , in DATE and DATE the inhabitants of CARDINAL villages and CARDINAL hamlets were evicted and forced to move to other regions of the country . The number of people evicted from CARDINAL villages and CARDINAL hamlets in the province of GPE , which includes GPE , was estimated to be around CARDINAL .

NORP This report was prepared by a working and monitoring group composed of CARDINAL scholars and experts commissioned by the ORG ( hereafter \u201c ORG report \u201d ) . It contains the findings of the working and monitoring group subsequent to field researches they had conducted in ORG , Batman , ORG and GPE . The ORG report examines the problems arising from the implementation of PERSON no . CARDINAL on compensation for losses sustained as a result of terrorism or the fight against terrorism . It also aims to suggest policy proposals to the Government , national and international bodies and NGOs .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG report , there are serious problems concerning the return of internally displaced persons ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) to their villages . Firstly , IDPs are unable to fund their travel and removal expenses in order to return to their villages from the cities . Secondly , the infrastructure of the villages is not in a good shape . In most villages there is no electricity , water , mains or health services . Thirdly , IDPs still worry about the lack of sufficient security in their former places of residence on account of intimidation by the ORG , military operations and clashes or possible pressure exerted on them by the ORG authorities to agree to become village guards . Finally , non - governmental organisations point to the presence of land mines which cause the death or injury of people living in the region .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report welcomes the enactment of PERSON no . CARDINAL and considers it a positive step towards redressing the human rights violations caused by the forced displacements . However , it is unclear whether persons who left the country can benefit from the PERSON in question . It appears that the a majority of IDPs misconceive the rights contained in the PERSON . Although PERSON no . CARDINAL provides a remedy for cases of death or injury , most IDPs consider that the PERSON is confined to cases of forced evacuation of villages . Furthermore , since PERSON no . CARDINAL includes the term \u201c terrorism \u201d in its title , IDPs generally think that they might be considered terrorists if they lodged an application under the PERSON and complained about the ORG . Some IDPs think that the remedy envisaged by the PERSON falls far short of meeting their needs since it does not offer sufficient compensation and there is no possibility of bringing the perpetrators of unlawful acts to justice . Moreover , PERSON no . CARDINAL does not contain a right to non - pecuniary damages . IDPs therefore prefer to lodge an application with ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the implementation of Law no . CARDINAL , there are CARDINAL major problems . Firstly , the members of the compensation commissions have a very limited margin of appreciation in rendering decisions . Secondly , even if they are in good faith , the members of the compensation commissions , who are civil servants , do not want to take any risks and therefore expect the Government to demonstrate a clear political will in implementing the LAW . Thirdly , some of the commission members seem to be prejudiced towards IDPs , considering them to be opportunists and/or ORG sympathisers who want to misuse the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The burden of proof on the victims to prove their claims used to be a major problem . However , subsequent to decision no . DATE of ORG , on DATE , claimants can prove their allegations by means of any information or document .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the composition of the compensation commissions , it was noted that the majority of their members are civil servants . Accordingly , in the eyes of the victims there are doubts about their independence and impartiality .", "CARDINAL . It was recommended that the PERSON should stay in force for DATE so that justice can be done and the process of redress achieve its aim .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG report makes a number of other recommendations with a view to tackling the problems of the IDPs and to establishing peace and security in south - east GPE .", "CARDINAL . The documents listed below concern the inability of the administrative and judicial authorities to visit or to conduct on - site inspections in the villages of GPE on account of the lack of security in the area .", "CARDINAL . The Government claimed that LAW ( \u201c compensation commissions \u201d ) established to provide an effective domestic remedy for the grievances of persons who were affected either by terrorism or the acts of the security forces in combating terrorism had become fully functional . In this connection they furnished the ORG with copies of decisions and declarations issued by these bodies with a view to demonstrating the effectiveness of the new remedy offered by ORG resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a copy of CARDINAL decisions issued by the compensation commissions set up in GPE and ORG .
