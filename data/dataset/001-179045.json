CX of DATE , amending certain Acts on criminal matters in relation to the judgment adopted by ORG in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( hereinafter , the \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This Act was promulgated on DATE and entered into force on DATE . It was aimed at introducing preventive and compensatory remedies in cases of inadequate conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister of Justice of GPE addressed to the President of the ORG a letter \u201c concerning the implementation of the pilot judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE \u201d . The Minister noted that LAW , a complaint alleging conditions of detention in violation of LAW could be presented to the prison governor , who should , as far as practicable , take the necessary actions in order to improve the conditions or counterbalance the injury suffered ( for instance : relocation , increasing the time allowed for visits or the time spent in the open air , and improvement of the sanitary facilities ) . According to the Minister , in view of the progress of the prison capacity expansion programme , there was a \u201c real prospect \u201d of finding penal institutions with sufficient capacity . A preventive remedy could , however , be used only while the detention was still ongoing . After release , and within DATE of the termination of the prison sentence , only a compensatory claim could be submitted . This could lead to the granting of a sum calculated on the basis of DATE spent in conditions contrary to LAW , the daily tariff ranging from a minimum of MONEY ( ORG \u2013 approximately CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) and a maximum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . The judge must exercise his or her judicial discretion in order to award an amount proportionate to the gravity of the violation found , taking into account , for instance , the absence of toilets separated from the living space in the cell , in addition to a general situation of overcrowding , or to other inadequate conditions of detention . The sum thus determined must be paid within DATE of the decision being served .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister further stated that from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL applications for compensation had been lodged with the penal institutions , thus showing the accessibility of the new remedy . Referring to the strict time - limits provided for by LAW , the Minister argued that the remedy also satisfied the requirement of quick adjudication and underlined that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences must provide reasons for his or her decision . As to the amount of compensation , the Minister noted that the NORP legislation adopted following the pilot judgment in the case of GPE and Others v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL others , DATE ) fixed the sum to be granted at ORG CARDINAL per day of detention in conditions incompatible with the requirements of LAW . Having regard to the burden - bearing capacity and of the economic realities of the CARDINAL countries , the choice of the NORP legislator to fix the DATE tariff at between ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL could be deemed to be reasonable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister lastly noted that out of CARDINAL cases brought before the judges responsible for the execution of sentences , CARDINAL claims had been adjudicated by DATE , awarding a total amount of ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . Moreover , due to the extension of the prison capacity achieved as part of the action plan , overcrowding in NORP prisons had significantly dropped : whereas in DATE the occupancy level had been PERCENT , in DATE and DATE the respective figures were PERCENT and PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , the Minister urged the ORG to find that the preventive and compensatory remedies provided for by LAW were effective and needed to be exhausted in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL .
