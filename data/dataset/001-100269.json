The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the village of GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's son , PERSON , who was born in DATE , was fishing in LOC with a teenager , NORP According to NORP 's testimony in the subsequent proceedings , the water started to \u201c bite \u201d their feet when they reached LOC . They saw a wire hanging from a wooden support pole for power lines , dangling in the water . PERSON , saying that the wire was not dangerous and should be removed , stepped into the water and tried to pull the wire from the river . When he grasped the wire he cried out , fell into the water and died . NORP tried to pull the wire out of Mr PERSON 's hands . Unable to do so , he ran to the village for help .", "CARDINAL . Mr Z. , an engineer with ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Network \u201d ) \u2013 forming a part of the public company , GPE , owned by ORG \u2013 carried out an initial , immediate investigation into the accident . In his report of DATE , Mr PERSON concluded that the applicant 's son had died as a result of electrocution . This occurred because a live wire , which had been incorrectly fixed to a wooden support pole , had come loose during strong winds . He further concluded that the security trip switch had failed on account of an ineffective earth connection .", "CARDINAL . A further internal inquiry was subsequently carried out by a commission composed of CARDINAL Network officials ( hereinafter \u201c the commission \u201d ) . Its report , drawn up on DATE , states that the ORG owned CARDINAL wooden poles on opposite banks of ORG , supporting a power line strung across the river . In addition to that power line , those CARDINAL poles also supported a bare radio wire that had been attached to the poles \u2013 above the power line \u2013 by the local telecommunications service of ORG . Owing to stormy weather conditions , the hook with which the radio wire had been attached had come loose , the wire had snapped and CARDINAL end had fallen into the river . The commission found that , although in principle it was not unlawful to attach a power line and a radio wire to a single pole , the local telecommunications service had failed to obtain the relevant consent from the Network .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances of her son 's death , claiming that his death had been caused by negligence and carelessness on the part of the Network in that it had failed to repair a broken power line , whereas the Ayvove villagers had already reported a power failure DATE .", "CARDINAL . The autopsy report , issued on DATE by an expert with the local ORG at the request of ORG , stated that PERSON had suffered a sudden death as a result of an electric shock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the Network to make available documents relating to the accident , including the records of previous inspections and repairs of the power line . In its reply of DATE the ORG stated , inter alia , that it had not given its consent to the radio wire being attached to the pole , and that the manner in which it had been done contravened technical safety rules . It further stated that it had notified the telecommunications service several times of the potential danger of the installation and had unsuccessfully sought to have it comply with the relevant safety regulations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor 's Office informed the applicant that there was no reason for the ORG to take any criminal proceedings against the ORG 's management . None of the Ayvove villagers had called the ORG DATE to report a power supply failure , and the required DATE inspections and general revision of the power supply network had been conducted regularly and timely by the ORG . The last DATE inspection had taken place on DATE and the last general overhaul in DATE which was within DATE interval . Also taking into account the findings of the internal inquiry carried out by the ORG 's commission and statements given by various Ayvove villagers DATE according to whom the QUANTITY radio wire had come loose on DATE \u2013 the Prosecutor found no wrongdoing on the part of the ORG 's staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to conduct an additional criminal investigation into the death of her son and to take criminal proceedings in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the investigator from ORG decided against taking criminal proceedings against the ORG 's staff as there was no evidence of a criminal offence . That decision was based on statements taken by the investigator from the applicant , her son 's widow , her son 's friend NORP , QUANTITY Ayvove villagers and PERSON , a nurse who had been called for help on DATE . The CARDINAL villagers had stated that , although PERSON had experienced certain power supply problems as early as DATE , it was only on DATE that the radio wire had come loose from the pole , and that nobody had informed the Network about this . The investigator further noted that the applicant 's claim that her son had died as a result of negligence and carelessness on the part of the Network in that it had failed to repair a power line broken on DATE was not supported by the findings made by the ORG 's commission .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a complaint against that decision with ORG of GPE ( hereafter \u201c the POARC \u201d ) as well as an appeal with ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the POARC quashed the decision of DATE , finding that further inquiries were called for . It instructed the investigator to question officials of ORG , to question again the villagers as to when the radio wire had come loose and whether someone had informed the ORG about this , and to attach a copy of the onsite inspection of the scene of the accident and the report on the forensic post - mortem examination of the body of the applicant 's son . In view of that decision , ORG did not deal with the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator of ORG , after having heard an ORG employee \u2013 according to whom the radio wire had been attached to the pole in conformity with the relevant technical requirements DATE and after having heard the applicant , her son 's friend NORP , the CARDINAL Ayvove villagers already heard previously , and the nurse , PERSON , who gave the same testimonies as before , decided against taking any criminal proceedings because there was no evidence of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on an appeal filed by the applicant , ORG quashed the decision of DATE . It found that the inquiry carried out by ORG was incomplete , in that the case file contained no record of an on - site inspection of the scene of the accident and no report on post - mortem examinations of the body of the applicant 's son , and in that the investigation had failed to establish the reason why a dangerous live wire had been hanging in the river and who bore responsibility for this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having added to the case file the report on the post - mortem examination of PERSON body and an undated statement taken from the local electrician , ORG took a fresh decision not to initiate any criminal proceedings , which was based on essentially the same grounds as the decision of DATE . According to the statement given by the electrician , he had received no complaints or information about a wire hanging in the river . He did know that wires had come loose from their support , but did not know who was responsible for it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on a complaint filed by the applicant , the POARC quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG for further inquires in that , inter alia , the case file did not contain an internal investigation report from the company responsible for electricity network maintenance , and the investigation had not made any findings about who was responsible for the network 's maintenance .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the subsequent additional criminal investigation , the investigator of ORG examined the internal regulations governing the duties and responsibilities of the ORG 's staff , and identified and questioned CARDINAL officials responsible for the maintenance of power lines , as well as CARDINAL Network employees who had repaired the power supply network after Mr PERSON 's death . It further examined information about the meteorological conditions at the material time and concluded that the power cut had been caused by adverse weather conditions . On DATE , having found no evidence of negligence or involuntary manslaughter , ORG decided not to bring any charges against the ORG staff responsible for electricity network maintenance . According to ORG , the wire network in the Ayvove village had been maintained in accordance with the relevant technical rules and regulations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on a complaint filed by the applicant , the POARC quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case once more for additional investigations . It found that the investigator had failed to question a number of Network employees and that , despite repeated instruction , no on - site inspection report had been drawn up .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG conducted an on - site inspection at the scene of the incident . According to the inspection report , an unprotected radio wire , strung across ORG , had been attached to a wooden support pole . That pole also had an electricity power line attached to it . ORG concluded that such an installation was permissible under the relevant technical regulations . It further found that a storm had caused the radio wire to come loose and fall into the river .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded that Mr PERSON 's death had been the result of a tragic accident and decided not to institute any criminal proceedings . The applicant again filed a complaint against that decision . On DATE the POARC accepted the applicant 's complaint , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered further inquiries to be made , including a forensic technical examination of the cause of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor 's Office again decided against bringing any charges , having found no evidence that any criminal offence had been committed by officials of the Network . The applicant challenged the decision of DATE before the POARC . On DATE the POARC quashed the decision of ORG of DATE , finding that the criminal inquiry conducted had not been sufficiently thorough . It noted that , in the internal investigation into the incident carried out by the ORG 's commission in DATE , it had been found that the radio wire had been attached to the poles in a manner contrary to relevant technical regulations , whereas ORG had found that the relevant rules and regulations had been respected . The POARC further found it unacceptable that no documentary evidence had been obtained from the Network concerning inspections of the LOC village electricity supply network prior to the accident , and that the identity of the persons who were responsible for the maintenance of the Network wires had not been established .", "CARDINAL . In its subsequent decision of DATE the ORG maintained its conclusion that there were no reasons for taking any criminal proceedings . As to the installation of wires and poles , the investigation found that they had originally been installed in DATE and the relevant installation company no longer existed . It further stated that the forensic technical examination could be conducted by ORG ( \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e-\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0456\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0435\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437 ) , however , such examination would require pre - payment of fees and ORG did not have funds available to cover those costs . The applicant was offered an opportunity to meet those costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and ordered further investigation on the ground that technical expertise was required to establish whether there had been irregularities in the installation and use of wires that could have a causal link with the electrocution and death of the applicant 's son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the case file material to ORG , but the examination was not conducted owing to non - payment of fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings on the same grounds as in its decision of DATE . ORG noted that it had no available funds to pay for the forensic examination and the interested parties were not willing to meet the costs either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the POARC quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings on the same grounds as in its decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the POARC quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the ORG officials under LAW . ORG repeatedly noted that they had no funds available for forensic examination and the interested party refused to pay for it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about that decision to the POARC . She did not , however , provide information about any decision taken regarding her complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings before ORG against GPE , the public company of which the ORG formed a part . In those proceedings , the applicant claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage caused by the death of her son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , for reasons of territorial jurisdiction , remitted the case to ORG of GPE . On DATE , acting at the applicant 's request , ORG of GPE ( ORG ) ruled that ORG had jurisdiction over the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG assumed jurisdiction over the case and scheduled a first hearing for DATE . On DATE , it granted the applicant 's request to stay those proceedings pending the criminal investigation into the death of her son . It did not fix any date for a future hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted another request to stay the proceedings filed by the applicant , who had expected to receive further information from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG considered the proceedings and asked ORG for information about the state of proceedings in the criminal investigation . On DATE , after having received a copy of the decision taken by ORG on DATE , ORG resumed its examination of the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overruled the decision of the first - instance court , having held that under the law the owner of a source of the increased hazard could be exempted from liability in CARDINAL conditions : force majeure or the intentional actions of the victim . Neither of the CARDINAL had been established in the case . The court also noted that the prosecutor had refused to institute criminal proceedings owing to a lack of proof of a crime and not because there had been any doubt that the event had taken place . Therefore , the Network , regardless of guilt , bore liability and had to provide compensation for the death of the applicant 's son . Therefore , it awarded CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) to the applicant , UAH CARDINAL,CARDINAL to her daughter - in - law and LAW to her granddaughter .", "CARDINAL .
