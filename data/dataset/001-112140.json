On DATE after the surgery , an \u201c anastomotic leakage \u201d was detected . On DATE another surgery was performed by another doctor from outside the hospital for fistulas .

On DATE , they also lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor started an investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s mother . As far as understood from the case file , the applicant , the doctor who had performed the first surgery , some other medical staff involved in the treatment of the applicant \u2019s mother , including the doctor who had carried out the operation on DATE , gave statements . An expert opinion dated DATE was obtained from ORG ( CARDINALrd committee ) . Relying on the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s medical history and witness evidence , it was concluded in the expert opinion that the treatment administered following the diagnosis of stomach cancer had been adequate and that the anastomotic leakage , which led to the death of the applicant \u2019s mother , had been a typical complication in this kind of surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor gave a decision of non - prosecution based on the expert opinion , witness statements and the deceased \u2019s medical records . The objection filed against this decision was also dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG appointed CARDINAL professors from ORG for another expert opinion . In this expert report , the experts observed the following :", "\u201c It was the leakage after the first surgery that started the chain of events that led to the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s death ; the method to be used to close a surgical wound , namely stitching or stapling , is to be chosen by the surgeon depending on the circumstances . In view of the deceased \u2019s age , manual suturing could be considered as convenient . By the same token , in a total gastrectomy , it is for the surgeon to decide on the method to be applied in gastric reconstruction , either \u201c Omega \u201d or \u201c PERSON Y \u201d type . That the leakage was noticed on DATE after the first operation showed that the follow - up of the patient had been duly carried out . An anastomotic leak is the major post - operative complication of a total gastrectomy , the incidence of which has been reported to be PERCENT . In the deceased \u2019s case , the anastomotic leakage began at an early stage in the post - operative period . Although this suggests technical incompetence , there is no evidence to that effect ; the treatment to be administered for an anastomotic leakage is still debated . Treatment options range from conservative management to aggressive surgery . The course of treatment followed in the deceased \u2019s case seems to be appropriate and in line with the medical practice . Unfortunately , after all these complications , the development of multiple organ dysfunction could have been expected . There is no finding which might substantiate that the hospital and/or doctors involved in the treatment were at fault . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the findings of the CARDINAL professors and demanded that a new expert report should be obtained .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the expert reports drawn up by ORG and the CARDINAL professors appointed from ORG , the witness evidence , the medical records of the deceased and the investigation file of ORG , the first - instance court rejected the applicant \u2019s action on DATE on the grounds that they had been duly informed of the procedure followed and that there was no fault attributable to the hospital or doctors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first instance court after having held a hearing . The applicant requested rectification . ORG dismissed the request on CARDINAL DATE .
