The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal case was opened into smuggling of consumer goods .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of participation in a criminal enterprise , smuggling , customs duty evasion and fraud .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was granted access to the materials in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was referred for trial before ORG of PERSON . According to the Government , the case materials comprised CARDINAL binders ; charges had been brought against CARDINAL individuals who had acted in conspiracy ; the witnesses ' list included CARDINAL prosecution witnesses from several cities in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , as well as CARDINAL witnesses and experts for the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the preliminary hearing and fixed the opening trial date for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the case be returned to ORG for correcting defects in the indictment against the applicant . That decision was set aside by ORG on DATE , which referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the trial resumed but it was subsequently stayed from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released on bail .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the parties and the elements available in the case - file to date , the criminal proceedings are still pending before the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE remanded the applicant in custody on the ground that he was charged with serious and particularly serious offences and could abscond or interfere with the investigation , without citing specific reasons for these findings . On DATE ORG upheld the decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention . Each time it referred , using a summary formula , to the gravity of the charge against the applicant and to \u201c grounds to believe that he would abscond or interfere with the criminal proceedings \u201d . On DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the extension orders on appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the decisions of DATE and DATE ORG found as follows ( the same paragraph featured in both decisions ) :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is charged with crimes , including particularly serious crimes , punishable with DATE imprisonment . The factual circumstances of the offence imputed to [ the applicant ] call for the assumption that , once released , he would flee from the investigation and trial , re - offend or otherwise interfere with the criminal proceedings . In these circumstances , the [ first - instance ] court 's finding that any other , non - custodial preventive measure may not be applied to [ the applicant ] , appears justified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE also contained the following passage :", "\u201c The argument by the defence that the [ first - instance ] court did not take into account absence of any objective evidence of [ the applicant 's ] involvement in the commission of the imputed offence , is without substance because , in extending the applicant 's detention , the [ first - instance ] court did not make any findings as to the guilt of the accused or as to correctness of characterisation of the facts in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was moved to remand centre no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention , referring to the gravity of the charges and the risk that he would interfere with the course of the trial because CARDINAL other defendants had gone into hiding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL decision , ordered to extend the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's detention until DATE , holding as follows :", "\u201c In deciding on extending the period of detention , the court takes into account that the measure of restraint in respect of [ the applicant and his co - defendant ] was imposed in accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW as there existed sufficient grounds to believe that they would abscond investigation and trial or interfere with the criminal proceedings . The grounds justifying the application of the measure of restraint still persist to date . Positive references of the defendants and their medical ailments do not remove the grounds to believe that they can abscond because they are charged with particularly serious offences \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant filed an appeal . He submitted , in particular , that the first - instance court had failed to take into account the facts mitigating for the applicant 's release , such as the absence of a prior criminal record , positive references , a permanent place of residence , stable family connections with his wife , children and grandchildren , chronic ailments , and the long period of detention which had already exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nizhniy ORG upheld on appeal the extension order of DATE , noting that the initial grounds justifying the holding of the applicant and his co - defendant in custody still obtained and that the defence had not put forward any arguments warranting a change in the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG granted further extensions of the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's detention , invoking CARDINAL grounds : that they were charged with particularly serious offences punishable with up to DATE imprisonment , and that the applicant had been initially arrested because the investigation had received information about his intention to abscond .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that :", "\u201c ... if the preventive measure is replaced with a more lenient one , there exists a risk that the defendants would not appear at trial ; thus , only the custodial measure may ... ensure the protection of the interests of the ORG and society against crime and the possibility of a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE employed a somewhat different wording which read as follows :", "\u201c Another , more lenient preventive measure , such as bail , would not be able to ensure a fair trial in this particular case . For that reason the need to ensure an effective protection of the public interests \u2013 notwithstanding the presumption of innocence and long periods of detention of both defendants \u2013 justifies a departure from the principle of individual liberty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG upheld , in a summary fashion , the above decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's application for release on bail . It found that , although the risk of absconding still existed , with the passage of time that risk was no longer sufficient to justify a breach of the principle of individual liberty . The bail was set at MONEY ( MONEY ) . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE detention matters have been governed by LAW ( Law no .

It must also take into account the gravity of the charge , information on the accused 's character , his or her profession , age , state of health , family status and other circumstances ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Detention may be ordered by a court if the charge carries a sentence of DATE imprisonment , provided that a less restrictive preventive measure can not be applied ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . After arrest the suspect is placed in custody \u201c during the investigation \u201d . The maximum permitted period of detention \u201c during the investigation \u201d is DATE but it can be extended for DATE . Further extensions for CARDINAL or DATE may be authorised only if the accused is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences ( Article QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court , the defendant 's detention is \u201c during the trial \u201d . The term of detention \u201c during the trial \u201d is calculated to the date the judgment is given .
