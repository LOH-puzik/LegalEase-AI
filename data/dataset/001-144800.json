On DATE a senior judicial officer at ORG issued a decision to take into account , for the purpose of serving the consolidated prison term imposed by ORG , the period in which the applicant had been remanded in custody from DATE to DATE as well as the period from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , when he had served a prison sentence imposed on him in a different set of criminal proceedings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a complaint by the applicant , a judge rectified the above - mentioned decision on DATE . In particular , the judge noted that the applicant had started serving the sentence imposed by ORG on DATE . The period during which he had been serving a different sentence as from CARDINAL DATE and which was to be taken into account as regards the term of the consolidated sentence had therefore ended on DATE .
