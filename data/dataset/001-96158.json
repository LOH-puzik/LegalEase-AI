Article CARDINAL of the Code as applicable at that time listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged . It read as follows :", "\u201c The cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds :", "CARDINAL ) a breach of substantive law by its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application ;", "CARDINAL ) a breach of procedural provisions , if that defect could significantly affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the LAW reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . An advocate may only refuse to provide legal assistance for important reasons of which he must notify the interested party . Any doubts as to whether to provide legal assistance or refuse to do so shall be resolved by the local ORG , and in situations where time is of the essence , by the PERSON of that ORG .", "CARDINAL . In cases where legal assistance is granted on the basis of the legal regulations concerning legal aid , only the entity appointing the advocate to represent the client may decide to relieve him or her from providing legal assistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW , an advocate shall provide legalaid services in the jurisdiction of a court where he or she has their office .", "CARDINAL . Lawyers are bound to act in accordance with rules of professional and ethical conduct enacted by ORG . They may be held accountable for professional misconduct or a breach of ethical principles in proceedings before the bar disciplinary court .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW adopted by ORG on DATE , when an advocate , either privately hired by the client or appointed under the legalaid scheme , considers that submission of an appeal in a case offers no reasonable prospect of success and the client disagrees with his or her view , the lawyer shall give notice of termination of the power of attorney , terminate the representation , or notify the refusal to the body which appointed him or her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued a resolution in reply to a legal question whether a legalaid lawyer could refuse to lodge a cassation appeal . It replied to the question in the positive .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that issues involved in the grant of legal aid concerned not only the proper administration of justice , but also touched on human rights , and the right of access to a court in particular . Nevertheless , there was no comprehensive and coherent regulation of legal aid under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism . However , a certain conceptual confusion was to be noted in the provisions governing legal aid as a whole , mostly because the legislator had failed to harmonise the relevant provisions of civil and criminal procedure . In particular , the scope of legalaid lawyers ' obligations when legal representation was mandatory was not directly addressed by provisions of civil procedure . This was so partly because the essential body of law concerning civil procedure had been enacted in DATE , while the provisions on mandatory legal representation for the purposes of a cassation appeal had been introduced in DATE , when this new kind of appeal had been created .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the scope of legalaid lawyers ' obligations to provide a party to the proceedings with \u201c legal aid \u201d in civil proceedings was unclear . In particular , the provisions on lawyers ' legalaid obligations in connection with cassation proceedings before ORG lacked clarity . The court noted that the judicial practice regarding the application of the relevant provisions had given rise to serious difficulties of interpretation and discrepancies in the case - law of the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the issue of possible conflict between the opinion of a party granted legal aid and a lawyer assigned to represent him or her for the purpose of cassation proceedings had not been directly addressed by the applicable law . It further noted that the notion of legal assistance could not be identified with a simple obligation of a lawyer to act in accordance with the client 's wishes . The role of a legalaid lawyer had rather to be understood as obliging him or her to provide legal advice to the party , including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal against a given judgment .", "CARDINAL . The constitutional role of ORG , the highest judicial authority , was also an argument in favour of the conclusion that a legalaid lawyer was not compelled by the will of the party to have a cassation appeal lodged if such an appeal was bound to fail . In case of a disagreement between the party and the lawyer , it was open to the party to complain to the local Bar under LAW . The Bar could then appoint a new lawyer who could lodge a cassation appeal , requesting at the same time to be granted leave to appeal out of time under LAW . It was true that the practice of ORG was not coherent in that in some cases it had rejected such requests and in others it had accepted them . However , it did not prevent the parties from having recourse to this course of action .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a party to proceedings may ask for retrospective leave to perform a procedural measure outside the prescribed time - limit ; this measure shall be performed simultaneously with lodging the request .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c If a legal representative ... has been appointed in a case , the court correspondence shall be served on [ him or her ] .", "However , in a number of decisions the civil courts have held that the running of the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal is not affected in any way by a request for legal aid submitted by a hitherto non - represented party and its subsequent grant or refusal . That time - limit starts to run on DATE when the party was served with the judgment of the appellate court together with its written grounds , also where the request for legal aid has subsequently been granted ( ORG decisions of DATE , II CZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , II UKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , I CKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE ; II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , ORG , DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination ( DATE , II CZ CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a further series of decisions ORG considered that it would be unfair for the legally - aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within DATE counted from DATE of service of the judgment on the party . The parties waiting for legal - aid services can not be held at fault for shortcomings in the system . A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it . A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within DATE from the date on which the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal ( DATE , II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by ORG DATE , PERSON ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ DATE ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ;", "CARDINAL . In a resolution adopted by a bench of CARDINAL judges of ORG on DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that court acknowledged that there had been discrepancies in the manner in which the beginning of the DATE time limit for submitting an application for leave to appeal out of time by legally - assisted parties had been determined . The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to ORG for legally - aided parties genuine and effective . Hence , the beginning of the time - limit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases . The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
