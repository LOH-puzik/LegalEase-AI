For DATE , the court has been unable to take evidence from governor PERSON , at that time mayor of GPE , the most important witness . On numerous occasions , he was unsuccessfully summoned before PERSON . PERSON was sending excuses to the court or did not attend hearings without any explanation .", "For the first time , and so far the only time , the governor appeared before the court on DATE However , he could not be heard because the accused PERSON was absent , not for the first time , as he was quietly present at that time in the town hall situated ... QUANTITY away . It was \u2013 according to the observers of the case \u2013 another instance of dodging the proceedings in order to delay the date of delivery of a judgment . Protracting the case leads to the likelihood that the case will be discontinued or the accused will be acquitted . A judgment convicting PERSON would mean an interruption of his very lucrative career in local government .", "In addition , it is a very annoying and dangerous case for governor PERSON . The evidence taken so far from witnesses clearly shows that the burglary in ORG took place with his knowledge and approval . On DATE of the attempt to take over the TV cable operator he telephoned police and asked for ' assistance with eviction ' \u2013 misleading the law enforcement officers .

The proceedings lasted DATE . A judgment will be delivered on DATE .", "The PERSON court , after DATE of waiting for the busy governor of ORG , PERSON , was able at last to take evidence from him . The main witness in the case was hiding behind his lack of memory and the fact that on DATE , DATE of the burglary , he had been for DATE in ORG attending a meeting with governor PERSON . He called a local government team DATE which forced open a door and used violence against the employees of ORG \u2013 an inventory commission established by the municipal management . PERSON did not remember who exactly was entrusted with that task . The court did not try to clarify the role played in this criminal event by the then mayor , PERSON . It did not ask him why he had publicly , on television , supported an attempt to take over the television operator or why he had asked the police to ' assist in the eviction of ORG ' . In the view of many GPE councillors PERSON knew about the burglary and agreed to it . This is also shown by the fact that he did not punish the burglars \u2013 his subordinates \u2013 but systematically promoted them in local government .", "The accused PERSON filed CARDINAL additional requests , which would have delayed the proceedings . The court dismissed them .", "Counsel for ORG suggested that PERSON had broken into the offices of the cable operator to take revenge for the termination of a contract allowing him to provide television equipment maintenance services . PERSON claimed that ORG was taking revenge because he had discovered its ' swindles ' .", "It is widely felt that only ' small fry ' appeared before the PERSON court .

They were each also ordered to pay a MONEY fee and PERCENT of the costs of the proceedings .", "Counsel for auxiliary prosecutor PERSON , who represented ORG , declared that he would appeal , as he considered that the sentence was blatantly lenient . In his oral statement made before the judgment , he said that on CARDINAL DATE the municipal authorities had lynched ORG ' . In doing that , they showed ' a lack of basic legal culture ' and ' by using bandit tactics ' they wanted to resolve a dispute with a cable company . People like PERSON underlined the counsel \u2013 should not hold prominent posts in the town hall . The action of both accused deprived ORG of the ability to operate a network for DATE , which led to a loss of MONEY .", "The advocate of the deputy mayor of ORG said that the list of accused was too short . He suggested that it should include also PERSON , mayor at that time and DATE governor of ORG , and PERSON , a former town secretary and DATE the governor 's chef de cabinet , since a burglary in ORG had been committed with their knowledge and approval . He defended his client by claiming that he had only wanted to make an inventory in ORG .", "The accused PERSON asked to be acquitted . PERSON in his last statement attacked the counsel of ORG , claiming that he had been so active because he had expected from that company ' a financial bonus in the future ' .", "Tadeusz L. stands in the next elections to the municipal council .

The applicant was tried by ORG DATE . On DATE he was convicted of defamation under LAW . The criminal proceedings against him were then conditionally discontinued and he was ordered to pay MONEY to a charity . Furthermore , the applicant was ordered to reimburse the prosecutor MONEY for the costs of the proceedings . The trial court gave , in particular , the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c ( ... ) the accused did not show in a convincing manner that the allegations made by him were true .", "Making a reference to ' a mayor - burglar ' in the title of the article published on DATE could be ambiguous and susceptible to various interpretations only because there was a question mark at the end of the title [ sic ] .", "In the court 's view that [ question ] mark refers to the whole title and not only , as claimed by the accused , the words ' the end of career ' because coming to such a conclusion would be unjustified [ sic ] .", "However , the court is of the view that although in the light of the court proceedings before the GPE court the description of ORG career in local government as ' stormy ' [ was justified ] , the use of the adjective ' lucrative ' with respect to that career can not be considered as true . At the time of publication of that article , the private prosecutor was a mayor but his remuneration did not justify the use by the author of the article of such a term . In view of the evidence ( ... ) one can not consider as truthful the accused 's claims that PERSON was receiving a kind of special profit [ .The ] amount of remuneration of a deputy mayor and the amount of councillors ' allowances is usually decided by the local government authorities chosen in democratic elections and even against the background of the generally bad economic situation of the majority of GPE population can not be considered as exceptionally lucrative . Moreover , in view of the declaration made by ORG it can not be accepted that [ his ] participation in CARDINAL foreign trips during his work in local government was a sort of special bonus .", "With respect to the third charge , the accused 's defence that it was in fact a quotation from counsel for ORG is bound to give rise to doubts in view of the fact that it was not put in quotation marks , especially as the other statements made by that counsel were clearly put in MONEY .", "In addition , the accused was unable to prove the losses of the cable television given in that paragraph by pointing to or submitting a document containing the calculation of those losses .", "It also can not be accepted as entirely true ' that [ the court ] found deputy mayor PERSON L. , guilty of an attempt by local government officials to take over a private company \u2013 unprecedented in this country ' .", "Firstly , because at the time of delivery of a judgment the statement was not legally valid and the use of such a term could have been misleading and also because a conditional discontinuation of the proceedings is not identical to the conviction of an accused , but this is precisely how this part of the article could be understood .", "As far as the last charge is concerned , it should be underlined that the accused also did not prove [ his ] allegation that at the time when a hearing was held on CARDINAL before the PERSON court PERSON was present in the town hall . ( ... ) The evidence shows that the private prosecutor on DATE was in GPE on a business trip . ( ... )", "Even if one accepts that the accused really saw [ PERSON ] car in TIME and subsequently [ T. Lubaszewski ] himself , TIME after the end of the hearing , this did not entitle the author of the article to use the terms contained in the article .", "In conclusion , it should be observed that , in the view of the court , the evidence did not give grounds for accepting that the allegations made by the accused were true , especially as the legislator added another condition for accepting the impunity of the offence of defamation , namely that ( ... ) the allegation was made to defend a socially justified interest .", "After analysing the degree of guilt and the danger to society of a continuous act committed by the accused , the court concluded that it could be described as insignificant . This conclusion was obviously influenced by the clearly visible antagonism between the accused and the private prosecutor .", "The parties have been and are involved in at least several defamation cases , in which they play different roles . Those cases arise from the different political opinions of the parties and it is regrettable that they chose a courtroom as their arena for political disputes .", "Contrary to the private prosecutor 's claim , one can not find motives of private vengeance in the press articles containing the defamatory allegations . The accused undoubtedly acted within the framework of acceptable press criticism [ . H]owever , in the court 's opinion he overstepped its limits and did not convincingly display journalistic diligence as he made allegations which were not properly verified .", "Furthermore , taking into account the fact that the accused has no criminal record and his character and personal circumstances , the court has concluded that the measure of discontinuation of the criminal proceedings should be used in respect of him and his acts .", "The court is of the view that the fact of finding that the accused has committed the act with which he was charged will in itself be first of all a lesson for him for the future .", "In order to increase the educational effects of that measure , the court has ordered the accused to make a payment to a charity in an amount proportional to his financial standing .
