The applicant NGO campaigns against the use of animals in commerce , science and leisure , seeking to achieve changes in law and public policy and to influence public and parliamentary opinion to that end .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant began a campaign called \u2018 My Mate \u2019s a GPE which was directed against the keeping and exhibition of primates and their use in television advertising . As part of the campaign , the applicant wished to broadcast a CARDINAL-second television advertisement . The proposed advertisement opened with an image of an animal \u2019s cage in which a girl in chains gradually emerged from the shadows . The screen then went blank and CARDINAL messages were relayed in sequence : \u201c A chimp has the mental DATE \u201d ; \u201c Although we share PERCENT of our genetic make - up they are still caged and abused to entertain us \u201d ; and \u201c To find out more , and how you can help us to stop it , please order your CARDINAL educational information pack \u201d . In the final shot , a chimpanzee was in the same position as that of the girl .", "CARDINAL . The proposed advertisement was submitted to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for a review of its compliance with relevant laws and codes . On DATE the ORG declined to clear the advertisement . The objectives of the applicant were \u201c wholly or mainly of a political nature \u201d so that section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) prohibited the broadcasting of the advertisement . This decision was confirmed on DATE . The advertisement could and can be viewed on the internet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued proceedings seeking a declaration of incompatibility under LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) arguing that the prohibition on political advertising on television and radio imposed by LAW was incompatible with LAW . The only contested issue was whether the prohibition could be considered \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINAL . An affidavit from the Director General of ORG , Media and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) dated DATE was submitted on behalf of the ORG . It detailed how impartiality was a fundamental feature of the regulatory regime applicable to broadcasting and why it was considered that political advertising was incompatible with impartiality . It explained that a less restrictive prohibition was impracticable by describing the review process which began in DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) noting that the relevant bodies consulted had supported the prohibition and it considered this answered the applicant \u2019s arguments . Controls on broadcast media were justified given the unique nature of the medium and since there were other media available to the applicant . The affidavit referred to other GPE with similar provisions ( GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , concluding that , in countries which had allowed paid political advertising , there remained \u201c significant practical problems \u201d in running such a system particularly in being able to guarantee equal access to all parties where the political landscape was characterised by multiple parties , where parties / broadcasters circumvented rules on time / funding limits on paid political advertising and where there was confusion over what constituted \u201c political \u201d advertising .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . Both judges considered the prohibition to have been widely defined . PERSON observed that it covered \u201c a continuum of political activity and intensity from party political activity at election time to the pursuit by non - political bodies at any time of particular interests of public concern \u201d . While political expression was a highly prized form of expression , both found the interference justified .", "CARDINAL . Both judges rejected reliance on ORG gegen PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) which they found turned on its facts . ORG found LAW to have had a number of ameliorating features not present in the scheme at issue in ORG , including a relaxation of controls on the timing and content of political and election broadcasts . They relied on the criticisms of the PERSON judgment in R ( ProLife Alliance ) v ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) , PERSON finding that it was not possible to discern the basis of the PERSON judgment . Both judges doubted the relevance of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ( extracts ) ) : it did not concern political advertising and they were not convinced by the observation therein that the margin of appreciation for restrictions on political advertising might be narrower than those on religious advertising .", "CARDINAL . Both judges underlined the caution to be exercised by the courts as regards ORG \u2019s policy and legislative choices . ORG reiterated that :", "\u201c ... in such matters of social and political judgment , the executive and legislative authorities - particularly the latter - of a Contracting State may normally be expected to have a better or surer grasp of its democratic needs and their practicalities than ORG or its own courts . Therein lies the notion of deference which , under one name or another , still stands as a caution to our courts against interfering too readily with the ORG \u2019s policies or ORG \u2019s legislative schemes in implementation of them . Such caution is an agent for broadening rather than narrowing the margin of appreciation / ambit of discretionary judgement of a ORG in this context , just as it may be in the context of other important and sensitive issues peculiar to a ORG traditions , to which its authorities DATE like those of GPE in PERSON \u2013 are peculiarly alive and well qualified to assess .", "Here , ORG has chosen to introduce a prohibition on political advertising confined to the broadcast media because of its perceived greater power than that of other media and , consequently , greater potential for distortion by wealthy interests of the democratic process . It may be that it could have gone about it in a different way , but is the court to be the judge of that , faced as it is with wide and highly authoritative support for the Parliamentary scheme ? \u201d", "ORG was to later conclude that ORG had acted within the ambit of the discretionary judgment available to it .", "PERSON stated that ORG was not reliant solely on the evidence before it since the \u201c experience , expertise and judgment of ORG expressed in the legislation can demonstrate the necessary justification \u201d . As to the justification for the prohibition , he stated :", "\u201c There are competing interests at stake here which a legislature is entitled and obliged to balance , taking account of the way in which it can anticipate that groups and parties would use the greater access to the broadcast media which the Claimant seeks for itself and others . ...", "In this regard , it is clear that ORG has expressed a considered view , having grappled with the human rights implications of sCARDINAL . I give great weight to its view thus expressed as evidencing the need for this restriction . This is not an executive act , not secondary legislation but primary legislation which was passed without member dissent by ORG . It was aware of the opposition on human rights grounds of Professor PERSON , and of the reservations , based on ORG , expressed by ORG .", "I also give ORG \u2019s considered view great weight because of the subject matter . The impact of broadcasting on the topics , framework and intensity of political debate is CARDINAL which few would be better placed to assess than those who deal on a DATE basis with constituents and interest groups , whether to enlist , respond to or resist their influence . They would be well placed to know what manner of groups there were or might be who would take advantage of degrees of alteration to the present ban . It is not contestable that ORG , through its MPs and politically active peers , is far better placed to reach a judgment on those matters than judges . This is not an area which more readily falls into the sphere in which judges are more experienced and expert . This is the more true of non - national judges .", "I see these factors as giving substantial evidential weight to the view of a democratically elected body in deciding what restriction was shown to be necessary in the public interest . In substance , another way of putting that is to say that the subject matter warrants a considerable discretionary area of judgment being accorded to ORG .", "No doubt ORG could have devised a form of words which would present a solution of sorts to any problem as to where a line was drawn as between types [ of ] advertiser or advertisement . However , the complexities and inevitable arbitrariness of any solution , such as it might be called , are proper matters for ORG to consider in deciding that a complete ban on broadcasting advertisements is the only practicable and fair answer . \u201d", "Whether ORG \u2019s enactment of the prohibition was evidence for its necessity in an area of ORG \u2019s expertise or as a judgment in an area where a wider margin of discretion should be accorded to it , PERSON considered that ORG \u2019s decision should be respected by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Having noted the lack of a relevant NORP consensus , ORG remarked that the experts\u2019 reports submitted had been of little assistance , had been produced by the ORG as a matter of disclosure only and had not been relied upon by the ORG . PERSON noted that ORG had been provided with some , but not comprehensive , material about how some other ORG and commonwealth GPE had dealt with the issue . It was not of any great use save to demonstrate that there was a general consensus that electoral periods justified advertising prohibitions and that there was no clear consensus as to whether the present prohibition was necessary outside of an electoral period . Various states had decided what restrictions were necessary given their particular political sensitivities and broadcasting systems . The absence of consensus might have reflected those differing conditions which were properly part of a legislature \u2019s judgment as to whether or not this degree of prohibition was necessary in its democratic society .", "CARDINAL . Both Auld LJ and PERSON emphasised the rationale for the prohibition : to preserve the integrity of the democratic process by ensuring that the broadcast media were not distorted by wealthy interests in favour of a certain political agenda . PERSON characterised the prohibition as a restriction aimed at supporting the democratic process rather than CARDINAL with a specific content objection . Both judges considered it legitimate to single out the broadcast media as its impact was potentially more powerful : PERSON finding that it was not a matter of serious debate that the broadcast media was more pervasive and potent than any other media form . As to the debate about whether television was more expensive than other media , PERSON considered it sufficient to accept that broadcasted advertisements had an advantage of which advertisers and broadcasters were aware and for which the former would pay large sums of money far beyond the reach of regular groups who would wish to participate in the public debate .", "CARDINAL . Finally , both judges rejected the argument that the prohibition was disproportionate as it applied outside electoral periods and to groups such as the applicant who were not associated with party politics or electoral campaigns . ORG emphasised that it would not be \u201c a principled or logical distinction \u201d to limit the prohibition to electoral periods . Both judges considered that political advertising in the broadcast media outside such periods was likely to have an equally obvious influence on the democratic process . In this respect , PERSON noted that the broadcast media were ever - present , that contentious democratic issues could arise at any time and that purchased influence could affect the promotion of legislation , the decision to hold an election or its ultimate outcome . Both judges also considered that it was impracticable , arbitrary and potentially unfair to attempt to draw a line between party political matters and other matters of public importance : the distortion of the political debate could take many forms and could embrace a vast range of matters of public interest and certain issues would be difficult to categorise . There was also a risk that such a distinction might allow political parties to \u201c contract out \u201d their political advertising to \u201c splinter or supporter groups \u201d which would be free from restriction .", "CARDINAL . As a result , ORG refused a declaration of incompatibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON , ORG , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON ) unanimously dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON gave the lead judgment . He recognised that , since the prohibition interfered with political expression , the standard of justification imposed on the State was \u201c high \u201d and the margin of appreciation was correspondingly small . The objective of the prohibition was as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The fundamental rationale of the democratic process is that if competing views , opinions and policies are publicly debated and exposed to public scrutiny the good will over time drive out the bad and the true prevail over the false . It must be assumed that , given time , the public will make a sound choice when , in the course of the democratic process , it has the right to choose . But it is highly desirable that the playing field of debate should be so far as practicable level . This is achieved where , in public discussion , differing views are expressed , contradicted , answered and debated . It is the duty of broadcasters to achieve this object in an impartial way by presenting balanced programmes in which all lawful views may be ventilated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The objective was not achieved if :", "\u201c ... well - endowed interests which are not political parties are able to use the power of the purse to give enhanced prominence to views which may be true or false , attractive to progressive minds or unattractive , beneficial or injurious . The risk is that objects which are essentially political may come to be accepted by the public not because they are shown in public debate to be right but because , by dint of constant repetition , the public has been conditioned to accept them . The rights of others which a restriction on the exercise of the right to free expression may properly be designed to protect must , in my judgment , include a right to be protected against the potential mischief of partial political advertising . \u201d", "Lord PERSON did not think that the full strength of this argument had been deployed in the above - cited PERSON judgment .", "CARDINAL . He considered that a blanket prohibition was necessary to avoid the risk of advertisements by organisations with objectionable goals and he observed that this option had been discounted in ORG but recognised in the above - cited PERSON judgment . That the prohibition was confined to the broadcast media only was , as PERSON had found , explained by the particular pervasiveness and potency of television and radio , a factor recognised by this ORG in GPE v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and in PERSON although he noted that the PERSON judgment appeared to discount the point .", "CARDINAL . As to whether a less restrictive prohibition ( regulated by time , frequency , expenditure or by the nature and quality of advertisements ) would avoid the mischief sought to be avoided , Lord PERSON considered it unnecessary to explore this option in detail because , inter alia , any less restrictive system could be circumvented by the formation of small groups pursuing very similar political objects ; it would be difficult to apply objectively and coherently ; and it would be even more difficult for broadcasters to fulfil their duty of impartiality . While the ORG had requested a compromise solution , the Government had judged that no fair and workable compromise solution could be found which would address the problem , \u201c a judgment which ORG accepted . I see no reason to challenge that judgment \u201d . ORG \u2019s judgment was to be given \u201c great weight \u201d for CARDINAL reasons . In the first place , it was reasonable to expect that democratically - elected politicians would be \u201c peculiarly sensitive \u201d to the measures necessary to safeguard the integrity of democracy . Secondly , while ORG considered that the prohibition might \u201c possibly although improbably \u201d infringe LAW , ORG had resolved to proceed because of the importance it attached to the prohibition and its judgment which should not be \u201c lightly overridden \u201d . Thirdly , legislation could not be framed to address particular cases but had to lay down general rules and ORG would decide where the line would be . While that inevitably meant that hard cases would fall on the wrong side of the line , \u201c that should not be held to invalidate the rule if , judged in the round , it is beneficial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The fact that other means of communication were available to the applicant was a \u201c factor of some weight \u201d and this was to be contrasted with ORG ( DATE , Reports CARDINALI ) where the impugned provision was found to amount to be a total barrier to the applicant \u2019s communication of her views .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Lord PERSON observed that there was no clear consensus among member GPE on how to legislate for the broadcasting of political advertisements . ORG had widened the margin of appreciation in such instances and suggested that it might be that each ORG was best fitted to judge the checks and balances necessary to safeguard , consistently with LAW , the integrity of its own democracy . He dismissed the appeal , agreeing with PERSON and , in the main , with ORG . He did not accept Lord PERSON \u2019s view that the domestic courts could differ from this Court in interpreting Convention rights since the former should , in the absence of special circumstances , follow any clear and constant case - law of this Court .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON agreed with Lord PERSON , adding CARDINAL comments .", "In the first place , the prohibition could give rise to further LAW claims given its \u201c remarkable \u201d width : it could withhold from the applicant the ability to place advertisements for broadcasting with no political content or with an entirely neutral content and prevent the applicant from \u2018 countering\u2019 ... in a manner that is incompatible with that right \u201d and hypothetical examples of ways in which the legislative provision might be incompatible with a Convention right did not suffice . The conclusion was that the prohibition was not incompatible with the applicant \u2019s LAW rights .", "Secondly , it was not possible to assume from the PERSON judgment that the ORG would disagree with ORG in the present case . ORG in PERSON did not distinguish or qualify its reasoning in PERSON and this ORG \u2019s judgments focused closely on the particular facts of each case . There was no more than the possibility of a divergence between the finding of ORG and of this Court .", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON began her judgment by pointing out that there had been \u201c an elephant in the room \u201d when the case was heard and it was the dominance of advertising , not only in elections but also in the formation of political opinion , in GPE . She underlined the enormous amounts spent , and which have to be raised , for elections in GPE . There was no limit in GPE to the amount that pressure groups could spend on getting their message across in the most powerful and pervasive media available .", "CARDINAL . She went on to describe the rationale of the prohibition as ensuring that Government and its policies were not decided by the highest spenders :", "\u201c Our democracy is based upon CARDINAL person one vote . It is based on the view that each person has equal value . ... We want everyone to be able to make up their own minds on the important issues of DATE . For this we need the free exchange of information and ideas . We have to accept that some people have greater resources than others with which to put their views across . But we want to avoid the grosser distortions which unrestricted access to the broadcast media will bring .", "So this case is not just about permissible restrictions on freedom of expression . It is about striking the right balance between the CARDINAL most important components of a democracy : freedom of expression and voter equality . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON held , in full agreement with the reasons given by Lord PERSON , that the prohibition as it operated in the case was not incompatible with the applicant \u2019s LAW rights . On the contrary , it was :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... a balanced and proportionate response to the problem : they can seek to put their case across in any other way , but not the one which so greatly risks distorting the public debate in favour of the rich . There has to be the same rule for the same kind of advertising , whatever the cause for which it campaigns and whatever the resources of the campaigners . We must not distinguish between causes of which we approve and causes of which we disapprove . Nor in practice can we distinguish between small organisations which have to fight for MONEY and rich ones with access to massive sums . Capping or rationing will not work ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . She doubted the application of the ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case since , like all of this ORG \u2019s judgments , it was fact specific :", "\u201c DATE . ... Similar though the organisations were , the advertisements were rather different : \u201c eat less meat \u201d is a different message from \u201c help us to stop their suffering \u201d . Important arguments which were given less weight in PERSON were accepted in PERSON . If anything , the need to strike a fair balance between the competing interests is stronger in the political than in the religious context . Important though political speech is , the political rights of others are equally important in a democracy . The issue is whether the ban , as it applies to these facts , was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting the democratic rights of others . As Lord PERSON has demonstrated , Government and ORG have recently examined with some care whether a more limited ban could be made to work and have concluded that it could not . The solution chosen has all - party support . Parliamentarians of all political persuasions take the view that the ban is necessary in this NORP society . Any court would be slow indeed to take a different view on a question such as this . There may be room for argument at the very margins of the rule , for example , in banning any advertisement of any kind by a political body , or in banning any advertisement by anyone of matters of public controversy . But that is not this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG agreed with Lord PERSON ( disagreeing with Lord PERSON ) that the correct interpretation of the incorporated Convention rights lay ultimately with this ORG . The domestic courts should adopt a \u201c cautious approach \u201d where they must not \u201c leap ahead \u201d of the ORG \u2019s interpretations but \u201c keep pace with the GPE jurisprudence as it develops over time , no more and no less \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Both Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON dismissed the appeal for the reasons given by Lord PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The ORG came into force in GPE , GPE and GPE on DATE . Section CARDINAL allows courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility where it is impossible to interpret primary or subordinate legislation compatibly with the Convention . Section CARDINAL of the ORG is entitled \u201c Statements of compatibility \u201d and provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A Minister ... in charge of a LAW in either ORG of ORG must , before Second Reading of the PERSON :", "( a ) make a statement to the effect that in his view the provisions of the PERSON are compatible with the LAW rights ( \u201c a statement of compatibility \u201d ) ; or", "( b ) make a statement to the effect that although he is unable to make a statement of compatibility the government nevertheless wishes the ORG to proceed with the PERSON .", "( CARDINAL ) The statement must be in writing and be published in such manner as the Minister making it considers appropriate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Prior to LAW , the ORG was the only radio and television broadcaster in GPE and never broadcasted paid advertising . LAW opened the market to commercial broadcasters , reliant on advertising revenue for finance , and it established a regulatory body ( ORG , \u201c FAC \u201d ) to enforce , inter alia , a prohibition on paid political advertising introduced by LAW :", "\u201c No advertisement shall be permitted which is inserted by or on behalf of any body the objects whereof are wholly or mainly of a religious or political nature , and no advertisement shall be permitted which is directed towards any religious or political end or has any relation to any industrial dispute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequent legislation has preserved this prohibition .", "CARDINAL . ORG was set up by the Government to consider the broader issue of political party funding . Having visited GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , in DATE it presented its ORG to the Government . In LAW of the ORG , ORG recommended that the prohibition on political advertising on television and radio should be maintained , describing its benefits as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL Preventing the political parties and other politically motivated organisations from buying time on television and radio has the effect of restricting the total amount of money they can spend and also , thereby , of limiting the amounts of money they have to raise . These effects are almost universally agreed to be beneficial . Election campaigns in GPE are cheaper than in many other countries . During election campaigns , television viewers and radio listeners are not subjected to a continuous barrage of party political propaganda ( much of which , if it were permitted here , would undoubtedly be negative ) . The parties\u2019 dependence on wealthy donors is reduced . Political leaders are not forced to spend enormous amounts of time and energy raising money to fund television and radio campaigns . Not least of the benefits is the fact that the broadcasters provide the parties with free air - time . This means that all the major political parties , and not just the richest ones , are given an opportunity to state their views . Almost all those who have observed election campaigns in GPE regard these aspects of the GPE system as superior . We believe that the present arrangements have served this country well and should remain in place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the restriction on freedom of expression resulting from the prohibition was potentially justifiable . It concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... it is perfectly proper for the Government to continue to proceed on the basis that the ban on political advertising on television and radio is legally defensible . We refer in particular to the ORG \u2019s argument [ in the X and ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ] ... justifying the outright ban on the basis of protecting the democratic right of GPE citizens not to be subjected to a barrage of political propaganda at prime advertising time from the party with the richest backers . If a court were in the future to rule to the contrary , this would potentially have a dramatic effect on the funding of the political parties . If free to do so , the parties would almost certainly feel obliged to make use of the opportunity to advertise themselves ( or attack their opponents ) on television and radio . In GPE a high percentage of the expenditure by the political parties at election times is devoted to television advertising . It is the pressure to advertise , as much as any other factor , which generates the demand for money and hence the arms race between NORP and NORP ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went further suggesting that , if anything , the legislation should be reconsidered to ensure that it was sufficiently wide :", "\u201c CARDINAL Another possible future danger , to which reference was made in some of the evidence , is that as advances in technology bring in their train new and varied means of disseminating information ( cablevision , multi - channel digital television , the Internet etc . ) novel methods may be devised in an attempt to circumvent the current legal restrictions on political advertising . Vigilance will be required to prevent this happening . Existing legislation should be reviewed to ensure that its reach is sufficiently wide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Government began a comprehensive review of broadcasting regulation and engaged in consultation on , inter alia , less restrictive measures than the current prohibition on political advertising . In DATE the Government responded to ORG proposing legislation including maintaining the prohibition on political advertising :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The ban on paid political advertising on television and radio has been a major factor in limiting the amount of money political parties can spend on election campaigning and therefore on the amount they have to raise . As a result , the ban is supported across the political spectrum and the Government strongly endorses ORG recommendation that it should be maintained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government published a Communications White Paper proposing a Communications Bill to implement new controls on the broadcasting media in GPE and GPE including the maintenance of the prohibition on political advertising . During the resulting consultation period the ORG delivered its judgment in PERSON gegen Tierfabriken v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) .", "CARDINAL . Following that consultation period , in DATE the Government published the DATE PERSON , thereby opening a DATE consultation period . Programme services were not to contain any political advertising whether it was an advertisement inserted by or on behalf of a body which was political in nature or an advertisement directed to a political end . Documents published with DATE PERSON included Explanatory Notes ( which considered the PERSON judgment , noting that it had thrown some doubt on whether the prohibition was Convention compatible ) and a Policy document outlining proposals in the PERSON and related policy decisions and expressing the view , inter alia , that the PERSON reflected a proper balance of freedom of expression and the need to protect against certain types of broadcasted material .", "CARDINAL . The Joint Committee on Human Rights ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , a standing parliamentary committee tasked with examining the human rights implications of draft legislation ) considered the DATE PERSON and , in doing so in DATE , took evidence from Professor PERSON who was the ORG Professor of ORG ( DATE ) , the first chair in media law in GPE . In response to a question about whether there were restrictions that could be imposed on political advertising which could be compatible with LAW , Professor PERSON stated that he agreed with the result of the PERSON case . To disallow a charity with a political programme ( such as ORG ) which could afford to pay for a short commercial seemed to him to be a \u201c monstrous and unjustifiable infringement of freedom of expression \u201d . It made no sense to him to allow commercial advertisements for automobiles and products associated with driving but not to allow groups to broadcast advertising of the opposite case . He was not advocating unrestricted access but rather the adoption of rules to limit the number of spots which could be purchased . He considered that the distortion of the political debate could be \u201c avoided by imposing financial limits , just as we now have with regard to the financing and expenditure of political parties \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published a report on DATE PERSON , including on the prohibition of political advertising . The ORG acknowledged that the prohibition could well be found incompatible with LAW having regard to VgT. However , it urged caution in reversing the prohibition given the important rationale of the prohibition and the difficulty of devising a more circumscribed solution . Having noted the approach of ORG and the differing freedom of expression traditions in GPE and GPE , the ORG preferred the NORP approach in that it gave \u201c appropriate weight to the legitimate objective of securing equality of opportunity for political expression , at any rate in the broadcast media \u201d which tradition justified the prohibition . The ORG continued :", "\u201c DATE . ... there are wider considerations which we believe urge the utmost caution in moving from the current statutory position in the GPE ( where television and radio access to those seeking to advance political causes is restricted almost entirely to the highly regulated system of party political broadcasts ) . These wider considerations include the fear of the annexation of the democratic process by the rich and powerful , to which the ORG alluded in its judgment in PERSON ... The risks of this will be intensified where it proves impossible to prevent concentration of cross - media ownership in CARDINAL country . We are also conscious that the compromise hinted at by ORG more circumscribed ban applied more discriminatingly - presents a formidable challenge to put in statutory form . In particular , it is difficult to conceive of how to devise ways of allocating air time or capping expenditure in relation to a \u201c political viewpoint \u201d ( as opposed to a political party , however that might be defined in statute ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . While the ORG doubted the general applicability of the above - cited judgment in the PERSON case and saw some merit in waiting for the jurisprudence in this area to mature further before deciding on the appropriate legislative response , it nevertheless considered that a total prohibition on political advertising on radio and television was likely to be held to be incompatible with LAW , as the Government had itself recognised in the Explanatory Notes to DATE PERSON . The ORG recommended that the Government \u201c examine ways in which workable and Convention - compatible restrictions of this kind could be included in the Bill \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Bill ( \u201c the LOC \u201d ) was a parliamentary body set up to consider the Bill . Its report of DATE supported the principles underlying the proposed prohibition :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The Government \u2019s view is that there are strong grounds for re - enacting the long - standing ban on political advertising in the broadcast media , but it acknowledges that a recent decision of ORG has cast doubt on the compatibility of that ban with the Convention . Professor PERSON argued that a blanket ban on political advertising was not compatible with human rights and suggested that the aim could best be secured by limits on expenditure on political advertising . ORG has argued that a ban on the purchase of advertising time for political purposes is likely to be compatible with Convention rights . We support the principles underlying the proposed ban on political advertising ... and urge the Government to give careful consideration to methods of carrying forward that ban in ways which are not susceptible to challenge as being incompatible with Convention rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) had overall responsibility for commercial television at the time . On DATE the ORG invited the Government to maintain the prohibition :", "\u201c The ORG shares the ORG \u2019s principled objections to political advertising and hopes that the ban , which has been effective , will be retained . Our own assessment is that an ORG / broadcaster - administered scheme to \u2018 control\u2019 political advertising based around tests of due impartiality and undue prominence would , fairly swiftly , collapse on the grounds of unworkability in practice ... Once the absolute bar is removed , the broadcasters ... would at the very least be open to challenge if they refused to accept political adverts . We are then on a slippery slope ... banning named political parties is fairly ineffectual where ... it is not difficult to create front organisations .

By denying powerful interests the chance to skew political debate , the current ban safeguards the public and democratic debate , and protects the impartiality of broadcasters .", "Having examined all the facts , and following extensive legal advice , I have concluded that very strong arguments could be advanced in favour of the ban contained in this PERSON being compliant with the ORG . ...", "The Government apply testing standards to the consideration of the compatibility of their legislation with the convention and , given the existence of [ VgT ] , I must ask the ORG to consider this PERSON with a section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE statement attached to it .
