The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion of having participated in smuggling NORP nationals into GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the first part of its bill of indictment dated DATE ( running to a total of CARDINAL pages ) , ORG set out the charges ( GPE , compare LAW , first sentence , of LAW in paragraph CARDINAL below ) against the applicant and CARDINAL co - defendants , including his sister ( pp . CARDINAL ) . It accused the defendants of numerous counts of human trafficking , committed DATE in exchange for money and as members of a gang . In addition to that , the applicant and his sister were charged with planning a robbery .", "CARDINAL . In the part of the indictment setting out the essential results of the investigations ( wesentliches PERSON , compare LAW , first sentence , of LAW in paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the prosecution set out in detail the exact course of events for each charge of human trafficking and summarised the testimonies of the witnesses and the contents of the intercepted telecommunications which were to prove the charges ( pp . CARDINAL of the indictment ) . It took the view , inter alia , that the applicant had concluded a fictitious contract of employment with his sister in order to pretend to have a legal income to support his family . Moreover , it stated that it would have to be taken into consideration as an aggravating factor when sentencing the applicant that he had involved his young children in his criminal activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened the trial against the applicant and CARDINAL co - defendants , including his sister . The court , sitting as a grand criminal division ( gro\u00dfe Strafkammer ) , was composed of CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL lay judges . CARDINAL substitute professional judge and CARDINAL substitute lay judges also attended the hearings . The prosecution read out the charges against the applicant and his co - defendants at this hearing ( see Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following her confession , separated the proceedings against the applicant \u2019s sister from those against the applicant . The hearings in both sets of proceedings continued to be conducted by the same professional and lay judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of the separated proceedings against the applicant \u2019s sister , the lay judges and their substitutes were informed of the essential results of the prosecution \u2019s investigations against all ( CARDINAL ) defendants by being given a copy of this part of the indictment which they were to read outside the main hearing . The professional judges of ORG had considered it necessary to inform the lay judges of the contents of the essential results of the investigations as the applicant \u2019s sister had stated that she generally confessed to the offences described therein , including their manner of execution , without , however , being willing to make any further , more detailed statement . ORG subsequently convicted the applicant \u2019s sister according to the confession she had made of numerous offences of human trafficking in exchange for money and as a member of a gang .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant in the course of his hearing ( the fifteenth hearing before that court in his case ) that the lay judges had been given copies of the part of the bill of indictment containing the essential results of the investigations in the proceedings against his sister . The applicant thereupon lodged a motion for bias against the CARDINAL lay judges and their CARDINAL substitutes . He argued that the lay judges could no longer follow the trial without prejudice after having taken note of the entire pre - assessment of the evidence by the prosecution . Pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) it was expressly prohibited to disclose the essential results of the investigations to lay judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL lay judges thereupon made a separate formal declaration in writing in identical terms . They stated that in the proceedings against the applicant \u2019s sister , the latter had confessed that the accusations against her as set out in the prosecution \u2019s essential results of the investigations were well - founded . The applicant \u2019s sister , represented by counsel , had agreed that the lay judges were informed of the contents of these results by being provided with a copy of this part of the indictment , which they had read .", "CARDINAL . The lay judges further explained that prior to being given a copy of this document , the president of the chamber had informed them that , as a rule , this part of the indictment was not disclosed to lay judges as it contained the prosecution \u2019s view at the end of the investigation proceedings and was not to be confused with the taking of evidence in the main hearing . Moreover , the president had pointed out to them that the proceedings against the applicant and those against his sister had to be assessed separately . They were aware of this , able to distinguish between the taking of evidence in both sets of proceedings and knew that the essential results of the investigations , of which they had taken note in the proceedings against the applicant \u2019s sister , were not relevant for the taking of evidence in the proceedings at issue . Consequently , they were not biased against the applicant . They further stated that the submissions in writing were their personal declarations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL professional judges of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for bias as ill - founded . They argued that , assessing the case in a reasonable manner , there were no grounds to doubt the lay judges\u2019 impartiality ( compare Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE of the Code of Criminal Procedure in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Having regard to the diverging views taken by the criminal courts and by legal writers on the question as to whether lay judges could be provided with the essential results of the investigations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they took the view that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) presupposed that lay judges took note of the contents of the case file . As the lay judges had explained in their declarations made following the applicant \u2019s complaints of bias , they were aware , due to the explanations given by the professional judges , that the copy of the part of the bill of indictment containing the essential results of the investigations expressed the view taken by the prosecution . The lay judges understood that this document was not to be confused with the results of the main hearing , on which alone the judgment should later be based . Therefore , the defendant had no reason to fear that the lay judges could consider their reading of the document in question part of the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint of bias against the CARDINAL professional judges . He argued that they had failed to take account of his fears that the lay judges were no longer impartial and that the presiding judge had formulated the written declarations made by the lay judges . The court dismissed this complaint as inadmissible on DATE , arguing that it was in substance an appeal against the decision of DATE against which however no appeal lay to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a total of CARDINAL hearings , ORG read out numerous TIME of tape recordings of intercepted telecommunications , which had been made in NORP and translated into NORP , and heard many witnesses , some of whom had been named by the applicant , as well as CARDINAL experts on the question of his mental condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , while acquitting him of having planned a robbery , convicted the applicant , inter alia , of human trafficking , acting on a commercial basis and as a member of a gang , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It found that the applicant had been party to numerous offences of human trafficking by storing and handing over passports belonging to the persons smuggled into GPE by other gang members . It based its findings on the submissions of the applicant , who had admitted having stored and handed over passports in cooperation with his sister . Moreover , the court considered the testimony of a police officer who had reported on the results of the interception of the telephone conversations made from the applicant \u2019s phone and that of the caf\u00e9 he ran with his sister . Furthermore , a witness who had been smuggled into GPE had testified that he had picked up his passport at the applicant \u2019s caf\u00e9 . When searching his home , the police had found CARDINAL NORP passports . In fixing the sentence , ORG considered as a mitigating factor that the applicant had acted also with the intention of helping his fellow countrymen who had become refugees following the ethnic persecution of residents of NORP origin in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He claimed that the lay judges adjudicating on his case had been biased . He submitted that LAW only allowed documents serving as evidence to be brought to the notice of lay judges . However , the essential results of the investigations were not such documents within the meaning of that LAW Pursuant to LAW , it was expressly prohibited to allow lay judges to take note of this part of the indictment . The fact that it was impossible for the lay judges to distinguish between the proceedings against the applicant and those against his sister was illustrated by the fact that even in the judgment drafted by the professional judges the CARDINAL separate proceedings had been confused ( by referring to the wrong person as being the defendant ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant claimed that ORG had not fulfilled its duty to investigate the matter . In particular , it had not played the recorded telephone conversations in the main hearing and had merely questioned a police officer on their contents instead . In addition , ORG had failed to take into consideration relevant submissions of an expert on the cultural background and situation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . Referring to his submissions before ORG , he claimed that his trial before ORG had been unfair and that his right to liberty as guaranteed by LAW had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . Following an order issued by ORG , the applicant served the remainder of his prison sentence from DATE . In DATE he was again released from prison on probation , the remaining part of his sentence having been suspended .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG ) ( BGHSt ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG reiterated :", "\u201c Access to case files for lay judges \u2013 just as for associate professional judges DATE is not regulated by law . It appears that until now the courts only dealt with the specific case of providing a report by ORG on the essential results of the investigations to lay judges , which they considered as unlawful . ORG of ORG , referring to the legislator \u2019s will as apparent from the law \u2019s drafting history , specified in this respect that providing [ the report to lay judges ] contravened the principles of oral proceedings and immediacy . Lay judges risked mixing up their impressions from that report with those from the main hearing whereas professional judges , as a rule , were able to distinguish between the CARDINAL sources of information due to their training and professional experience ( see ORG of ORG of the German PERSON ( RGSt ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . ORG has until now shared this legal opinion ( BGHSt , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; ... BGHSt , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ... ; ORG ( PERSON ) , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . However , ORG , in an obiter dictum , raised doubts as to whether it would further follow these precedents , because different treatment for professional and lay judges was not provided for by law and no convincing reasons could be given for it . Lay judges , who were called upon to decide on all difficult factual and legal issues together and of equal rank with the professional judges , could well be believed to be capable of understanding the sense and meaning of the bill of indictment ( ORG , judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On the contrary , the majority of legal writers DATE consider granting lay judges access to the case files to be lawful ...", "The ORG does not have to decide in the present case whether the existing practice of ORG on providing the essential results of the investigations to lay judges can be upheld or whether the doubts expressed by ORG and the dissenting opinion of legal writers have to be preferred , what it indeed tends to do . In any event , it considers providing TIME of tape - recordings as a means to facilitate the better understanding of the taking of evidence about intercepted telecommunications in the main hearing to be lawful . It may adjudicate on this issue ... because providing such documents is vitally different from taking note of the essential results of the investigations , which essentially involves the evaluation of the suspicion of a criminal act on the part of ORG . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
