In decisions of DATE and CARDINAL and DATE ORG directed that the adoption process in GPE should not proceed any further , that the name and a photograph of the child were to be sent to PERSON and that its decisions were to be forwarded to the ORG d\u00e9partement council and the NORP social services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant went to the hospital \u2019s maternity ward and subsequently to the NORP social services , seeking the return of the child . According to a note drawn up by the social services , her request was based on CARDINAL reasons : firstly , the biological father had learned of the child \u2019s birth in the meantime and had brought an action in GPE , and secondly , she had managed to persuade her husband to recognise the child . Her request was refused because the DATE time - limit for withdrawing consent had expired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then applied to the GPE tribunal de grande instance , seeking the annulment of the decision to give the child up and an order for her return . She submitted that the consent she had given on DATE had been invalid on account of the family pressure exerted on her and because she had not realised the consequences of registering the birth anonymously , since the process had been explained to her without an interpreter being present .

On that occasion she expressed the wish for her admission and her identity to be kept secret .", "The exercise by any woman of this right , which is enshrined in LAW and which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , is governed by the provisions of LAW , as amended by LAW of DATE .", "It appears from the evidence before the court ... that CARDINAL lengthy interviews were held in order to explain to this woman the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of a birth . These interviews took place in the presence of NORP speakers , and PERSON , who chose to come to GPE to give birth , can not expect the social services to have offered anything more in this respect , particularly not the presence of an official interpreter , which is not provided for or required by any statutory instrument . Furthermore , it appears from the proceedings ... and from the written submissions summarising her counsel \u2019s address ... that PERSON was taken to hospital by a lawyer ; she had therefore clearly sought legal advice prior to the birth .", "Accordingly , no matter what psychological state the applicant may have been in , like any woman opting to give birth in these circumstances , it appears that PERSON was nevertheless fully aware of both the immediate and the future implications of her actions and decisions . She thus acted quite consciously in having the birth registered anonymously and giving the child up to the social services to be taken into ORG care , and there are no grounds for arguing that her intellectual faculties were impaired or that the consent was invalid in any way ; moreover , the question of consent is not applicable from a civil - status perspective .", "In addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of DATE , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... It appears from the record of the child \u2019s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child \u2019s placement in ORG care and the ensuing legal effects . Such information was , moreover , provided in LANGUAGE , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to PERSON . Furthermore , PERSON fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date .", "PERSON clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . Moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within DATE . It should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period .", "Accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of DATE , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in ORG care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on DATE with no established parentage ...", "Since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within DATE after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the ORG authorities with a view to her adoption under LAW .", "Such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of LAW , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . The first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective .", "PERSON further alleges a violation of ORG and CARDINAL of LAW .", "As stated above , PERSON gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in LAW and given effect by ORG .", "More generally , these ORG govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and/or withdrawal of any of these measures .", "They strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures .", "The instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by LAW , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of LAW . Similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in NORP law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of LAW ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside the first - instance judgment . After reiterating the content of the record of DATE , and in particular the information it provided , the court held :", "\u201c Paragraph CARDINAL of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of CARDINAL time - limits for the child \u2019s return without any further formalities , CARDINAL being DATE ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being DATE , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services .", "This DATE time - limit is mentioned on CARDINAL further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the DATE and DATE periods , a court action may still be brought .", "This information could have misled PERSON ... since in reality the DATE time - limit applicable under LAW in the circumstances referred to in LAW did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( CARDINAL ) of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "PERSON , an NORP national who is a native NORP speaker and does not speak LANGUAGE , could not have known the consequences in LANGUAGE law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of enlightening her in a clear and precise manner .", "Having been informed of the existence of a DATE time - limit where \u2018 the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service\u2019 , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure .", "It will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in LANGUAGE of the information given in LANGUAGE to PERSON ... However , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used LANGUAGE only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable PERSON ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent .", "It therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG for the taking of a child into ORG care ; that reference was made to a DATE time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native NORP speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict DATE time - limit that applied in her case .", "Furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that PERSON ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child .", "The note by PERSON who also drew up the record in issue \u2013 besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to PERSON ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent .", "Similarly , the fact that PERSON ... was in contact with a NORP lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the DATE time - limit ...", "PERSON belief ... in the possibility of recovering the child within DATE period is corroborated by the request she made in person on CARDINAL and DATE to the ORG health and social services department , citing this time - limit , and by the subsequent letters from her lawyer , which also state that his client thought that she could take her child back within such a period .", "Having regard to all these considerations , it appears that PERSON ... placed her child in State care while believing \u2013 legitimately , in view of the ambiguous information she had received when signing the record of the placement \u2013 that she could take her back within DATE and that this time - limit also applied to PERSON , who had , moreover , instituted proceedings in GPE on DATE .", "This error as to the time - limit for the return of the child concerns a significant element of her consent to the child \u2019s placement in ORG care , especially as the provisions of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG Code require precise information on the subject to be given to the mother .", "In these circumstances , the application for the record of the child \u2019s placement of DATE to be declared null and void must be allowed .", "... seeing that the handing over of the child to the ORG authorities was rendered void by a lack of true consent affecting the validity of the record drawn up on DATE , the child \u2019s placement in ORG care is to be retrospectively annulled and can not therefore have any legal effect .", "Accordingly , the application for the child to be returned to PERSON ... should be allowed , without there being any need to address the subsidiary arguments she submitted in support of that application .", "Pursuant to Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG , parental ties shall be established between PERSON ... and the child to whom she gave birth in the maternity ward of ORG on DATE and a reference to this judgment shall be entered in the register of births , deaths and marriages for the town of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
