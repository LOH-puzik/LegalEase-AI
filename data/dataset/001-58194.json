His view was that it would be dangerous for PERSON and her mother for PERSON to return to her natural family since the mother was suffering from a very serious \u201c psycho - dissociative \u201d illness .

A minor shall continue to be considered abandoned ... even if he is in a children \u2019s home or has been placed in a foster home . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides that a case of force majeure shall be deemed to have ceased where the parents or other members of the minor 's family responsible for providing support refuse assistance from the authorities and the court considers their refusal unjustified .", "The fact that a minor has been abandoned may be reported to the authorities by any member of the public or noted by a court of its own motion . Furthermore , any public official and any member of the minor 's family who is aware that a child has been abandoned must report the situation to the authorities . Any failing by the family in this regard may entail loss of parental responsibility . Children \u2019s homes must keep the judicial authorities regularly informed of the situation of minors whom they take into their care ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL provides that , pending a minor 's placement in a foster home before adoption , the court may order any temporary measure which is in the minor 's interests , including , if necessary , the suspension of parental rights .", "Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL provide that enquiries shall be made so as to clarify the minor 's situation and determine whether he has been abandoned . In particular , under section CARDINAL the President of ORG or a delegated judge may , if he considers it appropriate , order the parents to take measures to provide the minor with emotional support , maintenance , an education and an upbringing and at the same time require regular checks DATE with the assistance , if necessary , of the guardianship judge or the local social services \u2013 to ensure that the measures are taken .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL also provides that a declaration that a minor is available for adoption shall be made in a reasoned decision of ORG sitting in chambers , after it has heard ORG , the representative of the children \u2019s home in which the minor has been placed or any foster parent , the guardian , and the minor if aged over CARDINAL or , if under twelve , where necessary .", "Under section CARDINAL parental responsibility is suspended while a minor is available for adoption .", "Lastly , section CARDINAL provides that a minor shall no longer be available for adoption once he has been adopted or has come of age . Moreover , a declaration that a child is available for adoption may be annulled , either by the court of its own motion or at the request of the parents or ORG , if the conditions laid down in DATE have in the meantime ceased to apply . However , if the minor has been placed with a family with a view to adoption ( affidamento preadottivo ) within the meaning of sections CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , the declaration that he is available for adoption can not be annulled .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under ORG case - law , a child has been abandoned if the parents have been shown to be incapable of ensuring its normal mental and physical development ( judgment no . GPE ) . ORG has also held that the fact that a child \u2019s upbringing is less than perfect or that his relationship with his parents can be criticised on account of the latter \u2019s cultural or intellectual shortcomings or personality defects will not necessarily result in the child being declared available for adoption , unless such shortcomings or defects are likely to jeopardise the child 's mental development irremediably ( judgment no . DATE ) .", "ORG has also held that a parent does not have to have lost all interest in the child : it suffices that the behaviour of a parent living with the child seriously and irremediably jeopardises its mental and physical development ( judgment no . DATE ) . A child may therefore be held to have been abandoned even where it is living with its parents ( judgment no . DATE ) , as sometimes the mere presence of a parent may be detrimental to a minor 's balanced mental and physical development ( judgment no . DATE ) . The parent does not have to be guilty of wilfully neglecting or harming the minor 's interests to have abandoned it . Abandonment is an objective state of affairs and the declaration that a child is available for adoption flows from a decision which is not necessarily intended to penalise the parent ( judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code also provides that where the conduct of CARDINAL or both parents is not sufficiently serious to justify forfeiting their parental rights , but is nonetheless detrimental to the child , the court may take any appropriate decision and even order the child \u2019s removal from its home .", "CARDINAL . ORG said in its judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL that even if a declaration that a child is available for adoption is set aside on an application by the parents , the court must not automatically order the child \u2019s return to its family , but must verify whether , in the meantime , the child has adapted and become attached to its foster home and considers it as its own , and whether , consequently , it would be detrimental to the child 's equilibrium , physical and mental health , upbringing and future to return it to its natural family .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , where enforcement of a judgment may cause serious and irreparable harm , the court which delivered the judgment in question may stay its execution until an appeal on points of law to ORG has been heard ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
