The Justice of the Peace held , in particular :", "\u201c ... the court characterises the actions of [ the applicant ] ... as dissemination of false information defaming the honour and dignity of another person and damaging his reputation , connected to accusation of that person of having committed an especially serious criminal offence , because he , by oral statements [ addressed ] to a number of persons , disseminated false information concerning the organisation by PERSON of the attempted murder of [ the applicant ] . He disseminated that information in an affirmative rather than a presumptive manner . Furthermore , [ the applicant ] knew that PERSON was a top ranking governmental official who , at the time the statement was made , was running for election as Governor of GPE , thus any discreditable information could damage his reputation in some way . The statements made by [ the applicant ] were false ... unfounded and unsubstantiated : at the time the statements [ were made ] no criminal proceedings were instituted against PERSON and no other investigative measures were taken by law enforcement agencies ; the statement did not contain references to any reliable evidence or documents proving the truthfulness of the statement , or any reference to sources of information on the basis of which [ the applicant ] had concluded that PERSON had participated in the criminal offence committed against him . ORG , [ the applicant ] understood that , but he publicly and intentionally made the above - mentioned statement in the presence of representatives of the mass media , accusing PERSON of having committed an especially serious crime , thereby defaming the victim , his honour and his dignity , and [ the applicant ] , in his official position as the deputy Governor of GPE , must have been aware of that .", "At the meeting of the administration of GPE of DATE , [ the applicant ] only put forward one piece of evidence to substantiate his statement about Mr NORP involvement in the attempted murder : DATE before the [ attempted murder ] General PERSON had threatened him ( [ the applicant ] ) in the presence of a deputy president of ORG , PERSON , and a deputy prosecutor of GPE , PERSON This submission ... was examined in the course of the trial but was not proven , because PERSON and PERSON , questioned as witnesses in open court , did not confirm it .

No other evidence proving the truthfulness of [ the applicant 's statement ] was presented .", "The court also notes that [ there is evidence confirming ] the defendant 's intention to disseminate the false statements publicly ( whatever his reasons ) and thus to negatively influence people 's opinion of the victim , in order to damage his reputation before the election : firstly , the affirmative , rather than presumptive character of the statement ; the content of the [ the applicant 's ] speech before and after the libellous statement ; the dissemination of the false information at the meeting of the administration of GPE , that is , to individuals who had no right to institute criminal proceedings and verify the statement ; the fact that the statement was made on several occasions ... after the attempted murder ... and in the course of the pre - trial investigation ... Moreover , the false character of the statement made by [ the applicant ] was confirmed by his confession made at a press conference on DATE , during which he had confirmed that as far as he knew Mr PERSON had not participated in the attempted murder , and [ the applicant ] had apologised . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

However , the defendant could refuse legal assistance . Such a refusal would not be binding on the court , if the defendant , at the same time , asked for the case to be determined in his absence . Thus , the Justice of the Peace had lawfully ordered that PERSON should continue representing the applicant because the latter had not wished to participate in the trial , had refused the assistance of his lawyers and had not asked the trial court to appoint another lawyer .", "CARDINAL .
