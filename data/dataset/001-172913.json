The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant stated that , although he had been entered in the register of births as being male , he had always behaved like a girl and his physical appearance had always been very feminine . As an adolescent and young adult he had struggled considerably with his gender identity , since the male identity assigned to him at birth did not match his female psychological and social identity . In DATE , after several doctors had diagnosed a gender identity disorder known as \u201c PERSON syndrome \u201d , he had begun a transitional phase , living in society as a woman and undertaking a course of hormone treatment under the supervision of an endocrinologist , PERSON , and a neuropsychiatrist , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted CARDINAL medical certificates issued by these doctors during the period in question . In the first CARDINAL certificates , dated CARDINAL DATE , PERSON . stated that the first applicant had been under his supervision since DATE \u201c for a syndrome typical of gender identity disorder \u201d .

The doctor concluded that \u201c the marked , plausible and genuine nature of his gender dysphoria , together with the \u2018 real life test\u2019 , [ made him ] eligible for reassignment surgery , of which [ he had ] a legitimate expectation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also produced a medical certificate issued on DATE by another psychiatrist , PERSON . , which certified that he had \u201c typical PERSON syndrome \u201d and that \u201c there [ were ] currently no contraindications for the medical and/or surgical treatment entailed in the gender reassignment sought by the patient \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant stressed that he had not originally intended to undergo mutilating gender reassignment surgery , but had resigned himself to it because the NORP ORG case - law made it a precondition for a change in civil status .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant decided to undergo surgery in GPE , performed by PERSON , whom he described as a \u201c world - renowned specialist \u201d . The operation was carried out on DATE . PERSON issued the following medical certificate :", "\u201c ... following a period of diagnosis by psychosexual specialists and an appropriate period of living full - time with a female identity , the above - mentioned person was diagnosed with a gender identity disorder ( FCARDINAL.CARDINAL ) defined as ORG , ICD-CARDINAL . She was accepted for the appropriate surgical treatment , namely gender reassignment surgery .", "... The surgery consisted of an orchidectomy , a vaginoplasty , a clitoroplasty and a labiaplasty , combined in a single operation .

This involved removing the male reproductive organs , resulting in irremediable infertility .", "In accordance with all established medical and legal definitions , the operation is irreversible and means that PERSON [ A.P. ] \u2019s male sexual identity has been permanently changed to a female sexual identity . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant produced CARDINAL further certificates . The first , dated CARDINAL DATE , was signed by PERSON , a surgeon . It stated that the first applicant had undergone \u201c a cosmetic laryngoplasty as part of maletofemale transitioning , after irreversible reassignment surgery was performed on the external genitalia \u201d .

In the fourth certificate , dated DATE , PERSON , a doctor specialising in fundamental psychopathology and psychoanalysis and a psychotherapist , stated that he had started psychotherapy sessions with the first applicant and , in particular , had \u201c noted ... the consistency between Ms [ ORG ] \u2019s statements and her preferred gender identity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant brought proceedings against ORG in the GPE tribunal de grande instance seeking a declaration that he was now female and that his first name was PERSON ( a female forename ) . He submitted , in particular , the medical certificates of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE , and the certificate issued by PERSON On DATE ORG requested a multi - disciplinary expert assessment , on the grounds that the applicant \u2019s surgery had been performed abroad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in an interlocutory judgment , the GPE tribunal de grande instance stressed as follows :", "\u201c Where a diagnosis of gender identity disorder has been made following a thorough assessment and the person concerned has undergone irreversible physical changes for therapeutic purposes , it is appropriate to consider that , although the person \u2019s new gender status is imperfect in that the chromosomal make - up is unchanged , he or she is closer , in terms of physical appearance , mindset and social integration , to the preferred gender than to the gender assigned at birth . \u201d", "However , the court further found :", "\u201c Irrespective of the status of the authors of the medical certificates produced in support of the application , the need for a firm diagnosis means that a multidisciplinary expert assessment should be carried out in order to establish the applicant \u2019s current state from a physiological , biological and psychological perspective and to investigate the persistence of the alleged disorder in his past . \u201d", "The court appointed CARDINAL experts \u2013 a psychiatrist , an endocrinologist and a gynaecologist DATE and requested them , after interviewing and examining the first applicant and consulting the medical certificates and operation reports submitted , to :", "\u201c ( a ) describe the applicant \u2019s current physical state ... and the presence or absence of any external or internal genitalia of either sex ; order , with the applicant \u2019s consent , any samples and laboratory tests capable of establishing the biological and genetic characteristics of the applicant \u2019s sex ; state whether a mistake could have been made in the sex recorded on the birth certificate , or an organic or biological change could have occurred later ; look for traces of possible surgery aimed at bringing about or completing a transformation of the genitalia or secondary sexual characteristics ; state whether the patient has been treated with either medication or hormones ; state whether the surgery or hormone treatment was carried out on account of pre - existing physical anomalies or because of the patient \u2019s psychological state , leaving aside his deliberate intentions ;", "( b ) describe [ the first applicant \u2019s ] mental state and behaviour as regards his gender and , in so far as possible , indicate their origins and trace their development ; report on any course of psychotherapy followed , specifying its duration and outcome ; state whether the patient suffers from any mental disorder and , if so , specify the nature of that disorder ;", "( c ) express a view on the possible existence of gender identity disorder , giving reasons for making or ruling out such a diagnosis ; state whether , in the light of all the available individual medical data ( physiological , biological and physical ) , the person concerned should be regarded as male or female . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court ruled that the costs of the expert assessment should be met by the first applicant , and ordered him to deposit a sum of MONEY ( ORG ) for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant refused to submit to an expert assessment on the grounds that this type of assessment , as well as being very costly , also failed to respect the physical and mental integrity of the person concerned . In his view the documents he had submitted , which had been written by specialist doctors and noted the genuine nature of his change of gender , were more than sufficient and it was not necessary to make him undergo a further battery of traumatic tests .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the Deputy President of ORG refused the first applicant leave to appeal against this interlocutory judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance rejected the first applicant \u2019s request . It stressed that the certificates produced by the first applicant , however informative , did not answer the court \u2019s questions regarding the origin , nature , persistence and consequences of the disorder in question , and that the doctors who had been consulted could not , in the space of a few lines intended to allow the operation to go ahead , carry out the work of CARDINAL experts instructed on the basis of a very wide - ranging and detailed mandate . The court noted in particular that the certificates did not mention the applicant \u2019s mental state and attitude with regard to his gender , or express a view as to the origin of the disorder and its development . Likewise , they did not specify whether the first applicant suffered from mental - health problems and whether he had followed a course of psychotherapy , nor did they provide any information on his current state , having been written prior to his gender reassignment . The court added that patients who underwent surgery in GPE submitted a comprehensive file covering all the disciplines concerned as a precondition of reassignment surgery , something which the doctor who had operated on the first applicant in GPE had apparently not required . In order to have their costs covered by the social - security scheme , patients in GPE had to undergo a whole series of rigorous examinations . The court found that , in the light of the evidence in the file , the applicant should submit willingly to the expert assessment . In accordance with LAW , which authorised the courts to draw all the appropriate inferences from a party \u2019s refusal to cooperate with an investigative measure , the court found that , in the absence of a multi - disciplinary expert assessment , the first applicant \u2019s request had not been sufficiently substantiated .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the first applicant ORG , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it had rejected the first applicant \u2019s request for the indication of gender on his birth certificate to be corrected .", "CARDINAL . First of all , ORG inferred from LAW that \u201c where , following medical and surgical treatment undergone for therapeutic purposes \u201d , a person with a gender identity disorder no longer possessed all the characteristics of his or her original sex and had taken on a physical appearance closer to that of the opposite sex , which matched his or her social behaviour , the principle of respect for private life warranted amending the civil - status records to indicate the sex corresponding to the person \u2019s appearance .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG found that , in the light of the documents submitted by the first applicant , it was \u201c not established that he no longer possesse[d ] all the characteristics of the male sex \u201d . It stressed in that regard that , although the psychiatrists PERSON . and Ba . had given a diagnosis of gender identity disorder in their certificates of DATE and DATE , they had not noted the \u201c absence of mental - health problems \u201d . ORG further noted that the hormone treatment referred to in the certificates issued by PERSON on DATE and DATE dated back a long time . It also found that the certificate drawn up by PERSON , the doctor who had operated on the first applicant in GPE on DATE , was \u201c extremely brief \u201d and consisted merely in a list of items of medical information that did not make clear whether the gender reassignment surgery had been effective . Furthermore , the documentation produced by the first applicant concerning the clinic , which had been taken from the Internet , was not sufficient to establish either the scientific and surgical reputation of the surgeon who had performed the operation or whether the surgery had complied with standard medical practice . Nor was this demonstrated by Dr W. \u2019s certificate of CARDINAL DATE , \u201c owing to the lack of any detail \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to observe that the first applicant had refused persistently on principle to submit to an expert assessment and had not cooperated in the assessment ordered by the lower court , \u201c on the irrelevant pretext of protection of his private life , even though the aim [ had been ] to establish that a person presenting with a gender identity disorder no longer possessed all the characteristics of the sex assigned at birth \u201d . The court stressed that \u201c the possible interference with private life [ had been ] proportionate to the requirement to establish the person \u2019s gender identity , which [ was ] a component of civil status that [ was ] subject to the publicorder principle of inalienability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , however , that the fact that the first applicant was known by a female forename \u2013 as was clear from numerous statements from those close to him \u2013 allied to his conviction that he was female , the fact that he had had various medical treatments and operations , and the \u201c reality of his social life \u201d , meant that he had a legitimate interest in changing his male forenames to female ones . The court therefore ordered that his forenames be corrected on his birth certificate .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . He argued , firstly , that the right to respect for private life meant that gender reassignment should be authorised for persons whose physical appearance was closer to that of the opposite gender , to which their social behaviour corresponded . He criticised ORG refusal of his request to have the indication of his gender amended because he had refused to cooperate in an expert assessment aimed at determining the origins of his gender identity disorder and its development , and at ascertaining that he no longer had all the characteristics of the male sex . In his view , in ruling in this way after noting that he was known by a female forename , that he was convinced that he belonged to the female sex , and that he had had various medical and surgical treatments and lived in society as a woman , ORG had breached LAW . The first applicant referred , in particular , to the position of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe as set out in his issue paper of DATE entitled \u201c Human rights and gender identity \u201d , and to LAW ( DATE ) of ORG of ORG on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , he argued that it had been fully established by the medical certificates he had submitted that he was transgender , that he had undergone surgery which made him a woman , and that his physical appearance and social behaviour were female . In ruling that these documents were insufficient to establish the existence of the conditions required for gender reassignment , and criticising him for not cooperating with the expert assessment , ORG had therefore distorted the evidence .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , he alleged a violation of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW , taking the view that ORG , in finding that he should have submitted to the expert assessment and in dismissing his appeal , had based its assessment on discriminatory grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG , Bulletin CARDINAL , I , no . CARDINAL ) dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\u201c ... In order to substantiate a request to have the gender markers on a birth certificate corrected , the person concerned must demonstrate , in view of the widely accepted position within the scientific community , that he or she actually suffers from the gender identity disorder in question and that the change in his or her appearance is irreversible . After examining the documents submitted , without distorting them , and having noted , firstly , that the certificate describing surgery performed in GPE was very brief ( being confined to a list of items of medical information and saying nothing about the effectiveness of the operation ) and , secondly , that [ the first applicant ] refused in principle to undergo the expert assessment ordered by the first - instance court , ORG was entitled to refuse the application for correction of the gender markers on the appellant \u2019s birth certificate ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in FAC .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that , although he had been entered in the register of births as male , he had been aware from a very young age of belonging to the female gender .", "CARDINAL . Owing to social pressure he had tried to hide his true nature and had married twice while living with the male identity entered on his birth certificate . However the marriages , from which he had children , had ended in divorce .", "CARDINAL . He dressed as a woman and was perceived by others as a woman . Since DATE he had been undergoing treatment with feminising hormones and had undergone genital reconstruction surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant brought proceedings against ORG in the NORP tribunal de grande instance seeking an order for his birth certificate to be corrected by replacing the word \u201c male \u201d with \u201c female \u201d and replacing his male forenames with the name \u201c \u00c9milie \u201d . He referred in particular to a certificate issued in DATE by PERSON , a psychiatrist and specialist in transgender issues , stating that the second applicant was a transgender person .", "CARDINAL . The court gave judgment on DATE . It noted that the second applicant had merely filed a few invoices dated DATE and issued in the name of \u201c \u00c9milie \u201d Gar\u00e7on , CARDINAL statements made by witnesses in DATE saying that they had known the second applicant for DATE , knew that he was a \u201c transgender \u201d person ( or \u201c transsexual \u201d , as CARDINAL of them put it ) and had seen him \u201c evolve as a woman without any apparent difficulty \u201d , and a certificate dated DATE signed by the endocrinologist PERSON , according to which the second applicant had been receiving treatment for gender dysphoria since DATE and taking feminising hormones since DATE , a treatment that was well tolerated and effective . Noting also that the second applicant had not submitted the certificate from PERSON , the court found that he had not \u201c [ demonstrated ] that he was actually transgender as claimed \u201d . As he had not demonstrated that he actually suffered from the alleged disorder , his request had to be refused , since a change to the indication of gender in civil - status documents \u201c was possible only in order to make a proven de facto situation official \u201d . The court held that it had to refuse the request for a change of forename on the same grounds , as that request was merely secondary to the request for a change in civil status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an appeal by the second applicant , ORG upheld the judgment of DATE giving the following reasons :", "\u201c ... While the principle of the inalienability of civil status precludes the law from recognising a change wilfully sought by an individual , it does not imply that civil status can not be changed .", "Where a genuine gender identity disorder that is medically recognised and untreatable has been diagnosed following a rigorous assessment , and the transgender person has undergone irreversible physical changes for therapeutic purposes , it is appropriate to consider that , although the person \u2019s new gender status is imperfect in that the chromosomal make - up is unchanged , he or she is closer , in terms of physical appearance , mindset and social integration , to the preferred gender than to the gender assigned at birth . In these circumstances , and since LAW the birth certificate must mention the sex of the individual concerned , the principle of change should be accepted .", "In the present case PERSON ... was entered in the civilstatus registers as male .", "It is up to the appellant to give reasons , in particular on the basis of medical evidence , why he should be regarded as female as he requests .", "The appellant claims to be a transgender person who has lived with a female gender identity for DATE . He argues that the disparity between his preferred gender and the gender assigned to him at birth is sufficient to warrant a change in civil status without his first having to demonstrate that he has undergone gender reassignment surgery .", "Regarding the medical aspect he has simply submitted , as he did before the firstinstance court , a certificate issued by Dr [ T. ] dated DATE , written on the headed paper of Dr [ NORP S .- B. ] , in which that doctor \u2018 certifies that the endocrinologist Dr [ S .- B. ] has been treating PERSON ( \u00c9milie ) Gar\u00e7on for gender dysphoria ... since DATE , and specifies that the appellant has been receiving treatment with feminising hormones since DATE and that the treatment is well tolerated and effective .", "This medical certificate stating that the appellant followed a course of feminising hormone treatment from DATE to DATE does not in itself demonstrate the existence of a permanent physical or physiological change and hence the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process .", "An expert assessment appears pointless since the appellant , who rejects the idea of having to undergo genital surgery , does not mention any plastic surgery performed in connection with the current course of hormone treatment , and has not produced any opinion by a psychiatrist capable of demonstrating the existence and persistence of the alleged disorder , although PERSON birth certificate states that he has been married twice ... and divorced twice ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE . He argued in particular that , in refusing his requests on the pretext that he had not demonstrated either the existence of \u201c permanent physical or physiological change and hence the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process \u201d , or \u201c the existence and persistence of the alleged disorder \u201d , ORG had breached LAW , since the right to respect for private life implied the right for individuals to define their sexual identity and to have their civil - status documents amended to reflect their preferred gender identity , without having to demonstrate the existence of a gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria , or to undergo a prior process of irreversible gender reassignment . Making the right to amendment of civil - status documents subject to proof of having undergone an irreversible process of gender reassignment amounted to requiring the holders of that right to be sterilised in order to exercise it , thereby interfering with their dignity and with due respect for their bodies and the intimacy of their private lives . The second applicant inferred from this that there had been a violation of LAW of the fact that ORG had required him to furnish proof of having undergone that process . He added that it was discriminatory and contrary to LAW to make this right subject to such proof and to proof of a gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the appeal on points of law in the following terms :", "\u201c ... In order to substantiate a request for correction of the gender markers on a birth certificate , the person concerned must demonstrate , in view of the widely accepted position within the scientific community , that he or she actually suffers from the gender identity disorder in question and that the change in his or her appearance is irreversible .", "Furthermore , after noting that [ the second applicant ] had merely produced a certificate issued by a doctor on DATE on the headed paper of a different doctor , in which the former certified that the latter , an endocrinologist , was treating [ the second applicant ] for gender dysphoria , and which stated that the patient had been receiving treatment with feminising hormones since DATE , ORG found that this medical certificate alone did not demonstrate the existence or persistence of a gender identity disorder , or the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process . These are not discriminatory conditions nor do they infringe the principles set out in DATE and CARDINAL of LAW or Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , as they are based on a fair balance between the requirements of legal certainty and the inalienability of civil status on the one hand , and the protection of private life and respect for the human body on the other ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The third applicant was born in DATE and lives in Essey - les - PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that , although he had been entered in the register of births as male , he had been aware from a very young age of belonging to the female gender . He had lived with a woman from DATE and they had had a child together in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant said that he had hidden his true nature for a long time as he had been afraid of being bullied and later of losing custody of his daughter . Once his daughter was grown up he had adapted his appearance and social conduct to match his female gender identity . While most of the documents he used in everyday life reflected his gender identity , this was not the case of his civil - status documents , passport , driving licence , vehicle registration papers or entry in the national identity register . As a result , he was constantly obliged to refer to his transgender identity , to the detriment of his private life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant brought proceedings against ORG in the PERSON tribunal de grande instance seeking an order for his birth certificate to be corrected by replacing the word \u201c male \u201d with \u201c female \u201d and for his forenames to be replaced by the name \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON tribunal de grande instance delivered an initial judgment on DATE . It pointed out that it was \u201c now unanimously recognised by both domestic and NORP case - law that transgender persons [ had ] the right to respect for their private life \u201d and were therefore entitled to have their gender and forenames amended on their civil - status documents . However , the court stressed that a number of conditions had to be met , stating as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he gender identity disorder [ must ] be established not only medically ( usually by a multi - disciplinary team of doctors , surgeons , an endocrinologist , a psychologist and a psychiatrist ) , but also judicially , either by means of an expert assessment ( although the court is not required to order one ) or on the basis of medical certificates produced by the person concerned establishing with certainty that he or she has undergone medical treatment and surgery in order to achieve gender reassignment . \u201d", "The court went on to find as follows :", "\u201c Persons wishing to have their gender changed in their civil - status documents must demonstrate that they have undergone medical and surgical treatment for therapeutic purposes and have had previous surgery to remove the external characteristics of their original sex .", "Hence , only \u2018 ORG transgender persons can have the gender markers in their civil - status documents changed , that is to say , persons who have already undergone an irreversible gender reassignment process .", "In other words , a court may order ORG civil - status documents to be amended to reflect their preferred new gender only after they have genuinely altered their sexual anatomy to make it conform as closely as possible to their preferred gender .", "These medical and surgical conditions are explained by the fact that a genuine gender identity disorder , which is characterised by \u2018 a deeply held and unshakeable feeling of belonging to the opposite gender to one \u2019s genetically , anatomically and legally assigned gender , accompanied by an intense and consistent need to change one \u2019s gender and civil status\u2019 , must be distinguished from other related but different concepts such as transvestism , which is based solely on reversible outward appearance and does not entail a change of anatomical sex .", "In the present case , although PERSON is female in appearance and has provided documents and invoices issued to him by certain bodies in the name of PERSON , these factors do not enable the court to assess whether he has actually changed gender . At the hearing , when questioned by the President regarding any treatment he may have undergone , PERSON took a militant stance DATE as he is perfectly entitled to do \u2013 and invoked the confidential nature of his private life ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court therefore stayed the proceedings concerning the third applicant \u2019s requests and ordered him to \u201c produce in the proceedings any medical documents relating to the medical and surgical treatment undergone and capable of demonstrating that he [ had ] actually changed gender \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant refused to produce any medical documents , taking the view that he had demonstrated sufficiently that he was physically and psychologically female and was integrated socially as a woman . He simply stated that his general practitioner had prescribed hormone treatment for him which meant that he had female secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts . ORG concluded that it was not possible to amend his civil status without proof of gender reassignment surgery .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON tribunal de grande instance noted that the third applicant had not produced medical and surgical evidence of gender reassignment , and therefore rejected his request . The judgment reiterated the reasoning of the judgment of DATE . The court stated as follows :", "\u201c [ A change of gender in civil - status documents may be granted only to ] \u2018 ORG transgender persons , that is , to persons who have already undergone irreversible gender reassignment , and not to persons who merely claim to be \u2018 ORG on the grounds that they are regarded socially as belonging to the gender corresponding to their outward appearance , but who oppose any gender reassignment surgery or refuse to provide medical and surgical evidence of such reassignment having been carried out by means of medical treatment and surgery . \u201d", "The court went on to find as follows :", "\u201c Granting PERSON request would effectively amount to the creation by the courts of a \u2018 third gender\u2019 , namely persons of female appearance who nevertheless continue to have a male external sexual anatomy but can marry a man . In the opposite case , a person who is male in appearance would continue to have female genitalia and could thus give birth to a child ! ! ! As the case - law currently stands , such a situation is wholly prohibited . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It stressed in particular that \u201c the request for a change in civil status [ did ] not necessarily require proof of surgical change such as the removal or alteration of the genitalia , or plastic surgery \u201d , but implied that \u201c the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process be established in advance \u201d . The court went on to find that the third applicant \u201c [ had ] not provided such intrinsic proof , which [ could ] on no account derive from the fact that he [ was ] regarded by others as female \u201d . It added that respect for private life could not result in the third applicant being exempted from this \u201c obligation to provide proof , which [ was ] not designed to confuse transgenderism and transsexualism but which , besides the inalienability of civil status , [ was ] aimed at ensuring the consistency and reliability of civil - status records \u201d . That requirement , which was legitimate and in no way discriminatory , was not in breach of LAW , and it was not the court \u2019s task to remedy the deficiencies in the evidence adduced by the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE . He argued that the right to respect for private life entailed the right to define one \u2019s gender identity and to have civil - status documents amended to reflect one \u2019s preferred gender , without a prior obligation to undergo an irreversible gender reassignment process and provide proof thereof . In finding that he should have furnished proof of this irreversible process , ORG had therefore breached LAW , especially since neither the principle of the inalienability of civil status nor the need for consistency and reliability of civil - status records made it necessary for individuals to undergo an irreversible process of gender reassignment , and provide proof thereof , in order to have their civilstatus documents amended .
