On DATE the applicants lodged an application for the registration of Ilinden with ORG . They submitted to the court a copy of the first version of TIME of the DATE meeting ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Finding that CARDINAL member of the management committee had not signed the application for registration and that the filed copy of the articles of association had not been signed either , the court invited the applicants to submit duly signed copies of the application and the articles . On DATE one of the applicants filed a signed application and an unsigned copy of the articles .

On DATE an unsigned copy of the second version of TIME DATE meeting ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , containing a resolution for the founding of GPE and the names of CARDINAL purported founders , was filed with the court . A hearing was held on DATE . On DATE a copy of the second version of TIME ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , signed by QUANTITY persons , was filed with the court . At a hearing held on DATE the applicants stated that this second version had been drafted by an attorney and had been signed by the founders before the first hearing on DATE . The court admitted the document in evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Blagoevgrad Regional Court gave judgment on DATE . It rejected the application in the following terms :", "\u201c By DATE ) of ORG [ of DATE ] , the application for registration of a nonprofitmaking association must be accompanied by a resolution for its founding [ and ] its articles of association , signed by the founders ...", "In their application for registration the members of the management committee state that in DATE the organisation was denied registration ... , which may lead to the conclusion that the resolution for the founding of ORG was adopted ... at the latest in DATE . This conclusion is supported by the first version of TIME . This version states that at a meeting held on DATE in GPE , with CARDINAL persons present , the question of the reregistration of GPE was discussed ...", "In a letter of DATE the court instructed the applicants to present a resolution for the founding of the association . Following this instruction the applicants submitted unsigned minutes dated DATE , which reflect a different agenda and different decisions . These new minutes contain an express resolution for the founding of GPE , for the adoption of its articles of association and the electing of a management committee . The heading of TIME indicates that QUANTITY persons were founders . An additional , signed version of these TIME bears the signatures of QUANTITY persons . CARDINAL of the alleged founders ... have not signed the minutes of DATE , while the CARDINAL state that the resolution for the founding of the association was adopted by unanimity . However , these persons have signed the [ first version of the minutes ] , which contain the resolution to re - register PERSON . [ During the hearing ] on DATE the members of the management committee averred that there had only been CARDINAL meeting , [ which took place ] on DATE . In view of these circumstances , the court considers that it has not been categorically established that a resolution for the founding of ORG was adopted on DATE . It is unclear who the founders were , because there are CARDINAL versions of TIME , signed by different persons and having different contents . Thus , CARDINAL of the absolute prerequisites of section CARDINAL ) of the [ Persons and Family Act of DATE ] \u2013 a resolution for the founding the association DATE is missing .", "The second mandatory attachment to the application for registration \u2013 articles of association signed by DATE is likewise missing .", "When the applicants first applied for registration on DATE ... , they were instructed to submit articles of association signed by the founders . This instruction has not been complied with . The articles ... dated DATE are not signed . Alongside the articles the applicants have submitted a separate sheet , stating : \u2018 The articles of association of Ilinden were discussed and adopted at the founding meeting on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL\u2019 . Only the signatures of the members of the management committee follow . The presentation of articles of association signed by the founders is an absolute prerequisite for [ registration ] . On this ground alone DATE the failure to comply with the requirements of section CARDINAL ) of the [ Persons and Family Act of DATE ] \u2013 the registration of [ Ilinden ] must be refused .", "The court considers it necessary to note that , alongside the above - mentioned [ reasons to refuse registration ] , there are a number of serious discrepancies between the submitted articles of association and the laws of [ GPE ] , which render the registration inadmissible .", "In clause CARDINAL of its articles of association [ Ilinden ] defines itself as a \u2018 NORP national organisation on ethnical basis and origin ... which is the successor and continuer of the national liberation struggle of the NORP nation ... and of the NORP fighters who have fallen victim to the NORP State terrorism and PERSON .", "This text clearly shows that the association considers itself a \u2018 ORG and continuer of ... the \u2018 national liberation struggle of the NORP nation\u2019 ... The evoking of historical events in which the NORP people fought for the protection of its national interests [ and ] for the restoration of ORG is puzzling in the context of an activity which is to be carried out against this same ORG . It is not clear how an association may be a \u2018 ORG of \u2018 fighters fallen victim\u2019 but probably the applicants wanted to underscore that they intend to lead a \u2018 national liberation struggle\u2019 on the territory of GPE through uprisings , which process is expected to lead to victims . Read this way , clause CARDINAL of the articles raises serious doubts as to the peaceful means for the achievement of the goals of the association declared in clause CARDINAL . Clause CARDINAL ) of the articles recognises the territorial integrity of the country , its laws and LAW , but under a condition : \u2018 if they are consistent with the international law and the international agreements on human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rights of GPE . The reservations relating to respect for the territorial integrity of the country continue in clause CARDINAL ) of the articles , which introduces the concept of modification of the borders through \u2018 negotiations\u2019 . The association \u2019s goal DATE to achieve a modification of the borders of GPE through taking of territory away \u2013 is clearly spelled out in clause CARDINAL of the articles , which indicates that [ Ilinden ] \u2018 expresses and defends the civil , political , national and social and economic rights of NORP living on NORP land under NORP occupation ( jurisdiction ) and of the NORP living in ORG . The use of the term \u2018 occupation\u2019 indicates that , according to the applicants , GPE includes forcibly annexed \u2018 ORG lands , for the liberation of which they will lead a \u2018 national liberation struggle\u2019 . This idea is underscored in several other provisions of the articles . Thus , clause CARDINAL speaks of protection against NORP \u2018 ORG through cultural autonomy of GPE , which takes as a given that the population there is not NORP , clause CARDINAL [ speaks of ] \u2018 taking the NORP out\u2019 of the state of [ being subjected to ] \u2018 discrimination and ORG by ORG .", "Clause CARDINAL of the articles indicates that the association will organise peaceful assemblies , meetings , marches and demonstrations with demands for political rights , and that it will participate in elections through the nomination of candidates . Therefore , even though it claims to be a non - profitmaking association , PERSON proclaims that it will carry out a political activity within the meaning of LAW of LAW [ of DATE ] and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW [ of DATE ] .", "LAW [ of DATE ] provides that associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties . This prohibition is developed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW [ of DATE ] . An association which pursues political goals such as those clearly designated by the applicants here may not be registered [ as such ] .", "Apart from the political character of the goals and of the future activity [ of the association ] , the aforesaid leads to the conclusion that [ Ilinden ] is an organisation directed against the sovereignty , the territorial integrity and the unity of the nation and towards the incitement of national hatred , and is not categorically excluding the use of violence .", "Clauses CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL of the articles of the association contain suggestions [ that there exists ] a NORP ethnos [ constituting a ] minority and deprived of the rights that the LAW [ of DATE ] bestows upon all NORP citizens .", "There is no NORP minority in GPE . There are no historical , religious , linguistic , or ethnical grounds for such an assertion . [ Such an assertion ] , coupled with the declarations alleging \u2018 assimilation , discrimination and xenophobia\u2019 in respect of the \u2018 Macedonians\u2019 , is in reality directed against the unity of the nation . Every organisation committed to such a political platform is prohibited by virtue of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the LAW [ of DATE ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The management committee of GPE appealed to ORG . They argued that ORG had deliberately misconstrued the articles of association . ORG had no political goals and had never intended to dispute the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of GPE , nor to incite violence or ethnic hatred . The court had refused registration because of its mistaken finding that the articles insinuated the existence of a NORP ethnos having a minority character . Also , as there had apparently been doubt about technical problems with the registration documents , the management committee submitted a fresh copy of TIME of the association \u2019s founding meeting . It also submitted a list of signatures of the founders of ORG who were not members of the management committee , apparently with the purpose of remedying the deficiency noted by ORG \u2013 that the articles of association bore the signatures of the members of the management committee only , not of all founders .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The relevant part of its opinion read :", "\u201c ... this court finds that the prerequisites for entering [ Ilinden ] in the register of nonprofitmaking legal persons are missing . The first irregularity of the association is that the submitted articles are not signed by the founders , as required by section CARDINAL of the Persons and Family Act [ of DATE ] . Furthermore , the articles contain a number of clauses which do not allow the registration of the association . Clause CARDINAL indicates that [ Ilinden ] shall be \u2018 a NORP national organisation [ based ] on ethnicity and origin\u2019 , and clause CARDINAL provides that \u2018 only a ORG may be a member of the organisation ; such type of association is inadmissible and contrary to LAW [ of DATE ] , which prohibits privileges based on \u2018 nationality , ethnicity , origin\u2019 ...", "In clause CARDINAL of its articles the association sets itself political goals , which it may pursue only if registered [ as a political party ] . The formulated aims , such as \u2018 participation in elections\u2019 [ and ] the holding of \u2018 meetings , marches and ORG run also against LAW [ of DATE ] , which does not allow associations to perform political activities . The legal definition of the term \u2018 political activity\u2019 set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW [ of DATE ] indicates that it comprises precisely the holding of meetings , demonstrations , assemblies and other forms of public campaigning .", "Clause CARDINAL of the articles provides that the association will carry out activities that are characteristic of a denomination ... : \u2018 struggling to achieve an autocephalous status of the NORP church and cutting off the assimilation activities of ORG [ ; such activities ] may be carried out only by nonprofitmaking organisations registered under section ORG of ORG [ of DATE ] and LAW [ of DATE ] .", "The proposition of the applicants is that the association should be registered because its articles do not set forth political aims and the association is not established on an ethnical or a national basis . These assertions are unfounded . On the one hand , the submitted articles of association have not been signed by the founders , which precludes the possibility of registration ... On the other hand , the activities the articles envisage ... may not be carried out by such a type of association . This indicates that the irregularities in the founding of the association may not be rectified through the additional presentation of evidence ; the registration is therefore impossible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The management committee of GPE appealed on points of law to ORG . They argued that ORG had erred in holding that the formation of an association could lead to discrimination . On the contrary , it was the exercise of a fundamental right . Also , ORG did not pursue any of the activities proscribed by LAW . As regarded the alleged political goals and activities of the association , they submitted that ORG had misconstrued the term \u201c political activity \u201d : the holding of meetings and marches was not the prerogative of political parties \u2013 they could be organised by any organisation or person . The statement of the court that the meaning of clause CARDINAL of its articles of association was that ORG intended to engage in religious activities was tendentious and untrue . In addition , the applicants complained that ORG had repeated the conclusion of ORG that they had not submitted a duly signed copy of the articles of association , apparently disregarding the fresh documents they had presented together with their appeal from the latter \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . It dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\u201c ... The appeal is illfounded .", "The [ PERSON ] ORG found that the submitted articles of association have not been signed by the founders , as mandated by the imperative rule of section CARDINAL of the [ Persons and Family Act of DATE ] . Secondly , the articles contain a number of clauses precluding the registration of the association . Clauses CARDINAL and CARDINAL contravene LAW [ of DATE ] , clause CARDINAL [ contravenes ] LAW [ of DATE ] in conjunction with LAW ) of the [ LAW of DATE ] , [ and ] clause CARDINAL [ runs counter to ] section ORG of the [ Persons and Family Act of DATE ] .", "The judgment of the [ GPE ] ORG is correct . The finding that the legal requirements for the registration of the association have not been met corresponds to the documents in the case file and more specifically to the articles of association [ of ORG ] .", "An association is registered pursuant to an application by its management committee which must be accompanied by a resolution for its founding and its articles , signed by the founders . This means a signed copy of the articles and not separate lists and TIME . [ In addition , ] LAW [ of DATE ] does not allow privileges on the basis of nationality , ethnicity , origin , etc . By LAW [ of DATE ] , associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities characteristic solely of political parties . Account should also be taken of LAW of the [ LAW of DATE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ilinden lodged another application for registration with ORG . In a judgment of DATE the court refused to register the association . Its opinion read , as relevant :", "\u201c The evidence ... indicates ... that the activities of the organisation which seeks registration are directed against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation . This is apparent from the main goals of the association ... and the means for their achievement ...", "The way they are formulated ... indicate[s ] their political character . ...

Obviously , the aim is to distort the historical truth and to ignore the NORP character of certain geographical regions [ and ] to cause overt opposition of CARDINAL part of the population to another . This also threatens the territorial integrity of the country , while Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW [ of DATE ] prohibits organisations engaging in such an activity .", "Even if , despite [ what was found ] above , it is assumed that the activities of [ Ilinden ] do not run counter to LAW [ of DATE ] , by LAW thereof associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties . The political character of the aims [ of GPE ] is clearly indicated by [ its articles of association ] , while the [ applicable law ] provides that organisations seeking to engage in political , trade union or religious activities shall be regulated in a separate statute .", "All this leads to the conclusion that what is sought is the registration of an association whose aims are illegal . It can not be accepted that what is at issue is an organisation seeking to preserve the historical traditions and the cultural riches of a specific community . ... The realisation of the true aims [ of ORG ] would no doubt be at the expense of the unity of the NORP nation [ and ] the sovereignty and the territorial integrity [ of the country ] , which is declared inviolable by LAW [ of DATE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Ilinden \u2019s ensuing appeal was dismissed by ORG in a judgment of DATE . The court held that the aims of ORG were political , which was impermissible for a nonprofitmaking association . It further held that the aims of ORG were directed towards a \u201c twisting of the historical truths and towards ignoring the NORP character of certain geographical regions , with a view to causing overt opposition of CARDINAL part of the NORP citizens against another , which imperil[ed ] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation , in breach of the imperative rule of LAW [ of DATE ] \u201d . Finally , the court held that there had been an irregularity in the number of elected members of the association \u2019s management committee .", "CARDINAL . Ilinden \u2019s appeal on points of law to ORG was likewise dismissed , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The court held that ORG \u2019s activity , which would include protecting the \u2018 civil , social and economic rights of the NORP living on NORP soil and of the NORP living in ORG ran counter to LAW . Even assuming that this was not the case , registration was impossible , because ORG aims were in reality political , as indicated by its declarations that it was a continuer of the \u201c national liberation struggle of the NORP nation \u201d and that its founders were \u201c spiritual successors of \u2018 the NORP fighters which had fallen victim of the NORP state terrorism and PERSON \u201d , which was impermissible for a nonprofitmaking association .
