Mr PERSON is a NORP of NORP origin and was born in DATE . He lives in GPE and works as a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a magazine , \u201c NORP \u201d ( NORP ) , published in its issue no . CARDINAL an article on a round - table debate it had organised under the chairmanship of Mr NORP in which the applicant had taken part . The applicant \u2019s comments were recorded in the article , entitled \u201c The past and present of the NORP problem \u201d ( PERSON ve PERSON ) , as follows :", "\u201c ORG \u2013 Leaving aside the humanitarian side to the current tragic plight of the NORP in GPE , there are important political aspects to the problem , the main one perhaps being the intensification , with the crisis in the LOC , of relations at international level between the NORP movements . At this stage , CARDINAL question needs to be asked : what did we hope to gain from the relations established with GPE and GPE and what have we in fact achieved ? ... If you would allow me to , I should like to return to the question ... of the orchestrating of developments in the regional situation , mainly by GPE and the LOC , ... Mr Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu , could I ask you to frame your answer in the context of the unitary ORG ?", "PERSON \u2013 Your question is badly put . It involves certain ideological considerations . Before answering , I think I should explain what the NORP question is about . It concerns a nation of CARDINAL people , one which has existed in the region since history began and one which has , in company with the other nations established here , played a major role historically ; but it is also a nation which has , since DATE and under the influence of the international and regional powers , been deprived of its national rights , seen its territory divided up between the States in the region and been divested of its sovereign rights so as to be subjected instead to the hegemony of other GPE . If we are to make progress on this question , that must be the starting point . Admittedly , that does not mean to say that a radical solution to the problem will be found from DATE to the next .", "Coming back to your question ... the idea that the NORP problem has been fuelled by outside forces , by imperialist powers , is not new . For DATE some observers have seen the problem in those terms . The underlying reasons may be summarised as follows .", "Firstly , there are the concerns of the nations which keep the NORP under their domination . From the beginning , those powers have attempted to assert that the problem is that the NORP are not a national entity , have no claims of their own and are manipulated by outside forces . Their aim , then , is to prevent international powers intervening in the problem and to cast doubt on its legitimacy and to distract attention from it . There is also the international socialist movement and the doctrine of imperialism which prevails in such circles . As you know , GPE was akin to an empire in the classic sense . ORG has always been against the NORP as it considered that , if it the NORP were given certain rights , the nations it controlled by force would inevitably also assert claims , and discussion of such issues at the international level would render its networks less inaccessible . That is why the NORP have since DATE of PERSON consistently sided with the powers who have kept the NORP under their domination and why the local socialist satellite powers have invariably put forward similar arguments . Given the negative attitude of these socialist powers towards the NORP , the relationship between the sovereign power of the former and the official ideology of the latter has also played a role . That attitude was reinforced by the NORP position . NORP ideology is in itself an ideology of the sovereign nation . In that regard , the ideology of NORP sovereignty and the NORP national ideology as applied in the region were at one . However , the said doctrine of imperialism does not end there . After DATE , the NORP , under the influence of NORP and NORP socialist propaganda , whether consciously or subconconsciously , adopted the same tack . That led the NORP movement into a series of dead ends .", "The allegation that the NORP problem arose as a result of provocations from outside is ill - founded . If one has to speak of imperialist protectionism in LOC , it will be noted that it has been of no benefit to the NORP , whereas , shielded by the imperialist powers concerned , the NORP , the NORP and the NORP have done quite well . If the NORP had not intervened in favour of the NORP in the Crimean War , the Russian Tsar would have expurgated GPE from the history books and would have seized the NORP heritage . Contrary to what is suggested by some left - wing historians , the imperialists tried to save the \u2018 sick man\u2019 rather than to kill him . That applies to the NORP , too . Up till now , the only people in LOC \u2013 if you except the NORP \u2013 who have fought for their national rights are the NORP people . The NORP , NORP and NORP have not fired a single bullet for their national rights . Not a shot was fired when the NORP invaded GPE in DATE . The so - called war of independence was merely a consequence of an historical conflict between the NORP and the NORP . The question of who was right is a controversial one . The resistance against the NORP , launched at NORP and GPE , was NORP . More precisely , it was NORP - NORP resistance that developed under the aegis of the local authorities . It was the spontaneous resistance of the people . Neither the NORP army nor the political authorities played any part in it . The NORP have fallen behind in obtaining their national rights not , as is suggested in DATE , because they are dependent on external powers , but , on the contrary , because they have failed to forge international relations and because the international powers have refused them admission .", "While the NORP problem is the problem of the NORP , its solution is also of concern to the regional and international powers as it directly affects their interests . The question can not be dealt with using concepts , such as imperialism , anti - imperialism , socialism and anti - socialism , that bear scant resemblance to the true position . You can not say : \u2018 It \u2019s our problem . You , GPE , GPE , the NORP , the NORP , do n\u2019t interfere ; you , the NORP , the NORP , stay out of GPE . We must solve the problem with all those whose interests are at stake . With or without their help . There , too , it has to be said that of all the parties involved in the NORP problem , it is the NORP who have taken the least initiative . So , the NORP must be realistic . As the question concerns their existence and is posed at a time when their efforts have been minimal , it would be foolhardy to attempt to solve the problems by denying that initiatives have been taken or opposing them . In practice , the NORP must on this point work out how and to what extent they can play a bigger role in finding a solution to the problem . That would be the practical approach .", "...", "ORG \u2013 I would n\u2019t want you to take what I said the wrong way . I do not suggest that the NORP revolt is dependent on imperialist factors . All I say is that the countries in the region do not have the resources to solve the problems that exist here by themselves . Accordingly , the continued presence of the international powers seems likely . Under those circumstances , how can the NORP play a greater role ?", "PERSON Firstly , when considering the NORP problem the international powers are mindful of their own interests . We have to be aware of that and determine where our common interest lies . There are a number of nations like the NORP in the world . Although LAW and the fundamental treaties refer to peoples\u2019 right to self - determination , it is not in practice accepted that that right applies to the NORP , any more than it is accepted that it applies to a series of other nations . Such nations only manage to obtain certain humanitarian and cultural rights that do not extend beyond the boundaries of the countries in which they live . None of them have been able to achieve more than that . The problems of peoples confined to minority status can not readily be referred to and resolved without taking this factor into account . All the boundaries need changing , but that is very difficult to achieve . For that reason , I believe that the NORP have committed an error of judgement . By that I do not mean that they must accept their present status right to the bitter end . If they wish to enter the history books , they have to be aware of the international implications their presence entails .", "I would add that I attach no credit to the idea that the NORP have been \u2018 deceived or sold\u2019 . Recently , GPE cautioned them to act with restraint ; they broke off their relations with PERSON and turned down all his requests for arms . In my view , the NORP have committed an error of judgement . They have adopted a quite radical approach , CARDINAL for which the organisations of NORP GPE can not be held responsible . The NORP , believing PERSON to be finished , attempted to rise up spontaneously in reaction to the oppression to which they have been subjected for DATE . PERSON and PERSON , in company with the other NORP leaders , were forced to accept that process . We are not strong enough to face the likes of GPE , GPE , the NORP or a PERSON exhausted to the point where he is no longer able to stay on his feet . We have to examine the problem in the light of these realities . The urgent need is to ensure the democratic unity of the NORP . We must abandon the notion of hostility . No side is strong enough to destroy the other and in any event there is no reason to come to that . Our relations should be friendly , not hostile . Similarly , when we forge relations with the western powers , it is necessary and even essential to afford preference to national values .", "...", "For my part , I am opposed to the definition of primitive nationalism that has often been asserted in recent times . The use of such terminology sometimes reveals a lack of discernment . Nationalism takes CARDINAL known forms . The first is that of the oppressor nation , the second that of the nation that is oppressed . Beyond that , scientific research into nationalism has not come up with any other definition . It is difficult to know what the notion of \u2018 primitive ORG covers : does it dismiss nationalism wholesale or does it suggest another form of nationalism ? It is unclear . Besides , this terminology is unscientific , of no value and merely serves to reflect certain absurd political preoccupations .", "I do not subscribe to the theory that the ORG lack of success is due to primitive nationalism . In fact , it is not the NORP who are responsible for their lack of success . The reasons for it are to be found in the international status of the NORP . A number of nations in the world are in the same position as the NORP . None of them has had , up till now , an opportunity to draw its own frontiers , whether by force of arms or otherwise . How can we expect the NORP to be given an opportunity that has been offered to no other nation ? Let us take the example of GPE . The NORP had organised a referendum on the question of their independence and had subsequently declared themselves independent by an overwhelming majority . Yet when GPE gave their approval , the NORP invaded with tanks . GPE was isolated . We have to speak therefore with the benefit of hindsight . Since DATE the struggle has continued in NORP GPE . The only people engaged in combat in LOC are the NORP people . Despite that , their position has not improved at all . The NORP will certainly find a solution to their problem , but one must be aware that the factors coming into play do not depend solely on the NORP .", "I should now like to clarify the notion of nationalism about which so much has been said . As you know , nationalist movements began in the west with the French Revolution and subsequently spread to LOC and LOC . The GPE were freed as a result of nationalism . However , the issue of nationality remains alive . There continue to be peoples who have been deprived of their national rights . If they are to be freed they must show nationalist sentiment . The fact that nationalist movements attract an imprecatory reaction from those whom they cause to suffer is understandable . Conversely , it is impossible to comprehend why people who claim to be on the side of the oppressed , who call themselves revolutionaries or innovators , should react in a similar fashion .", "The nationalism of the oppressed nation can not be considered to be a usurpation of the rights of another nation . On the contrary , I believe that internationalism in the modern sense is inherent in nationalism . I do not approve of lumping together all kinds of nationalism , without being aware of the difference between the nationalism of the oppressor nation and the nationalism of the nation that is oppressed . If you ignore that difference , then you are serving the cause of the oppressor nation .", "Why do NORP socialists , who outlaw NORP nationalism , not take a look at themselves ? They defend the staunchest nationalism of all time , namely NORP , yet they ban NORP nationalism . Prohibiting an oppressed nation from being nationalistic is to condemn it to slavery .", "My friend PERSON consistently holds the same line . His politics are always reactionary . The NORP may react , but building a policy on the back of that reaction will not achieve much . In politics , one does n\u2019t have friends or enemies , one has interests . Furthermore , politics is the art of seeking the feasible . Is the position of people who criticise advocates of autonomy and of NORP independence any different from that reached by the NORP national movement in GPE ? Not at all . In GPE , too , some benefit has been gained , but not from policies geared towards independence . Those in favour of independence may on occasion agree voluntarily to limit their demands saying : \u2018 Decree a general amnesty , allow us to get organised\u2019 . They even add : \u2018 We do n\u2019t want a separation\u2019 . Such policies can not be brought to fruition with plays on words . DATE , the NORP must come up with medium - term policies that are adapted to the international context . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG no .
