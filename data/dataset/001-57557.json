BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , is a gunsmith . He is in the process of serving in Mons prison a sentence of DATE hard labour imposed on him on DATE by ORG for murder .", "CARDINAL . During TIME DATE , QUANTITY NORP , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON , were killed by revolver shots in GPE whilst they were in a motor - car with Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON ( against whom proceedings were subsequently discontinued ) and a NORP national , Mr. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON , an investigating judge at ORG , issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant , who was suspected of having caused both deaths . He was in GPE at the time , but was arrested by the NORP authorities who , after agreeing to grant his extradition , handed him over to the NORP police ( gendarmerie ) on DATE . ORG ( public prosecutor ) so informed his colleague in GPE by a letter of DATE . Mr. PERSON , a senior deputy procureur , initialled the letter and forwarded it to the official in the public prosecutor \u2019s department ( parquet ) who was dealing with the case , one Mrs. PERSON . She transmitted it to Mr. PERSON with a covering note ( apostille ) dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the investigating judge wrote to the GPE procureur du Roi to enquire whether , as regards the co - accused PERSON , the public prosecutor \u2019s department intended to report the facts to the NORP authorities , those authorities apparently being no longer willing to grant his extradition . On his covering note , the judge added in manuscript , between brackets , the words \" for the attention of Mr. PERSON \" . Mrs. PERSON replied to Mr. PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ( ORG prosecutor ) attached to ORG sent to the procureur du Roi the results of letters rogatory executed in GPE concerning Mr. PERSON . After initialling the covering note , Mr. PERSON forwarded it to Mr. PERSON , the deputy who had taken over from Mrs. PERSON in dealing with the case ; Mr. PERSON transmitted the note to the investigating judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON took his oath as a judge on ORG , to which office he had been appointed on DATE . Most of the investigations had been completed by that time , although some further formal steps were taken at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , the deputy , Mr. PERSON , signed an application for an arrest warrant ( r\u00e9quisitoire de prise de corps ) ; prior to that , in a report of CARDINAL pages , he had referred the matter to the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG , who had replied on DATE By judgment of DATE , ORG ( Chambre des mises en accusation ) of ORG remitted the applicant for trial before ORG on charges of voluntary and premeditated manslaughter of Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON . The procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral drew up the formal indictment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The trial took place from DATE before ORG which was presided over by Mr. PERSON . After the court had heard , amongst others , numerous prosecution and defence witnesses , the CARDINAL members of the jury withdrew to consider their verdict . Mr. PERSON had maintained throughout that he was innocent . On the third question put to them , concerning the \" principal count \" , they arrived at a verdict of guilty , but CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . After deliberating on that question in private , the President and the CARDINAL other judges ( assesseurs ) declared that they agreed with the majority .", "In the final event , ORG convicted the applicant of the murder of Mr. PERSON and acquitted him as regards the other charges ; it accepted that there were mitigating circumstances and sentenced him on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 hard labour . It also recorded that on account of his nationality it had not been possible to obtain the extradition to GPE of Mr. PERSON , who had been arrested in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then appealed on points of law to ORG . His sixth ground of appeal , the only ground that is relevant in the present case , was that there had been a violation of LAW , which provides that \" proceedings before an assize court shall be null and void if they have been presided over by a judicial officer who has acted in the case as public prosecutor ( minist\u00e8re public ) ... \" . He contended that the words \" for the attention of Mr. PERSON \" appearing in manuscript on the covering note of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) showed that Mr. PERSON , and not some other judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department , had been dealing with the matter at the relevant time and had , accordingly , taken some part or other in the investigation of the case . Mr. PERSON made no mention of the letter of DATE and the note of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , since at that stage neither he nor his lawyer had identified the author of the initials marked thereon ; the Government on their own initiative supplied this information to the Commission in their written observations of DATE on the admissibility of the application .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions , Mr. PERSON , an avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , retraced developments in the relevant NORP legislation and judicial decisions , distinguishing CARDINAL periods :", "( a ) Before DATE , although there were no written rules on the subject , ORG had delivered CARDINAL judgments in which it had been held that a judicial officer who had acted as public prosecutor in criminal proceedings could not thereafter sit in the case as a judge and , in particular , on the assize court bench . ORG founded this prohibition on a general and absolute principle that was said to derive from the very nature of the functions . The avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral summarised the judgments as follows :", "\" It is of little moment - that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department intervened in the case only occasionally or by chance ... ;", "- that his intervention did not implicate one or more of the accused by name ;", "- that his intervention did not involve a formal step in the process of investigation .", "It suffices that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department personally played some part in the conduct of the prosecution in the case in question .", "There is incompatibility as soon as the judicial officer , during the course of the prosecution , has personally intervened in the case in the capacity of member of the public prosecutor \u2019s department . \"", "( b ) The second period ( DATE ) , during which ORG apparently did not have occasion to rule on the problem of incompatibility between the functions of public prosecutor and the functions of judge , was marked by CARDINAL new factors : the incorporation of the Convention into the NORP domestic legal system and the developments in domestic case - law with regard to the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court .", "The litigant \u2019s right to \" an impartial tribunal \" , within the meaning of LAW ( article DATE ) of the LAW , could imply either that a judge was simply obliged to withdraw if he were at all biased as regards the case or , alternatively , that he was under the more extensive duty of withdrawing whenever there was a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the requisite guarantees of impartiality . The avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral rejected the first interpretation , which he described as \" restrictive \" , in favour of the second , the \" extensive \" , interpretation ; he relied notably on LAW ( account to be taken of the object and purpose ) and on the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine ) . As regards the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court , he also referred to judgments of ORG and the NORP Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat . In addition , he cited the following passage from an inaugural address of DATE to ORG : \" any judge whose impartiality may legitimately give rise to doubts must refrain from taking part in the decision \" .", "( c ) The third period saw the entry into force of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the application by ORG second of these ORG to cases where a decision had been given by a judge who had previously acted as a member of the public prosecutor \u2019s department . According to the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , the CARDINAL judgments that he listed followed the same approach as those delivered in the first period and established that :", "( i ) notwithstanding LAW , the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court had retained its full force ;", "( ii ) for the purposes of that Article , the expression \" dealing with a case in the exercise of the functions of public prosecutor \" signified intervening therein in the capacity of prosecuting party ;", "( iii ) there could not be said to have been such an intervention if , in the case concerned , a judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department had simply", "- appeared at a hearing at which the court did no more than adopt a purely procedural measure ; or", "- taken some step which was manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution .", "In the light of the foregoing , the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral concluded that ORG should \" set aside the judgment under appeal ... whether on the sixth ground adduced by the appellant or on the ground , to be taken into consideration by ORG of its own motion , of violation either of LAW ( article DATE ) of the Convention ... or of the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court \" .", "The avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral stressed that the covering note of CARDINAL DATE emanated from the investigating judge , the person who quite naturally was best informed not only as to the background to the case but also as to the identity of the judicial officer or officers in the public prosecutor \u2019s department who were dealing with the prosecution . And Mr. PERSON had added to the covering note , in manuscript , the words \" for the attention of Mr. PERSON \" , thereby indicating the specific addressee for whom the note was personally intended :", "\" If the investigating judge marked this covering note as being for Mr. PERSON \u2019s attention , it is logical to suppose that he knew that that judicial officer had personally played some part or other in the conduct of the prosecution .", "What other reasonable explanation can be given for such a course of action ... which surely would not have been taken unless the CARDINAL officers had been in contact regarding the investigation of the case ?", "It is of little moment that other judicial officers in the public prosecutor \u2019s department intervened in the case , for example to follow up the investigating judge \u2019s covering note , or that Mr. PERSON intervened only by chance or occasionally , or that such intervention has not been shown to have implicated the appellant or a co - accused by name or ... to have involved a formal step in the process of investigation .", "Finally , there would be no reasonable explanation for the handwritten words ... if Mr. PERSON \u2019s intervention in the case had until then been limited to steps that were purely routine or ... were manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution . \"", "Even if ORG were not to allow the appeal on the sixth ground , which was based on LAW , the circumstances described above were , in the opinion of the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , Mr. PERSON , sufficient to give rise to legitimate doubts as to whether the President of ORG had offered the guarantees of impartiality required both by LAW ( article LAW and by the general principle whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE .", "As regards the sixth ground of appeal , ORG observed firstly that the mere despatch of the covering note of CARDINAL DATE did not necessarily show that Mr. PERSON had \" acted in the case as public prosecutor \" , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Judicial Code .", "ORG also took into consideration of its own motion LAW ( article DATE ) of the LAW and the general principle of law establishing the right to the impartiality of the court . It was true that both of these norms obliged a judge to refrain from taking part in the decision if there were a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused person was entitled . However , the ORG held that the documents which it could take into account did not reveal that after the public prosecutor \u2019s department had received the covering note mentioned in the ground of appeal , Mr. PERSON , who was then a senior deputy to the GPE procureur du Roi , had taken any decision or intervened in any manner whatsoever in the conduct of the prosecution relating to the facts in question . Admittedly , for a judge \u2019s impartiality to be regarded as compromised on account of his previous intervention in the capacity of judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department , it was not essential that such intervention should have consisted of adopting a personal standpoint in the matter or taking a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation . Nevertheless , it could not be assumed that a judicial officer in the public prosecutor \u2019s department had intervened in a case in or on the occasion of the exercise of his functions as such an officer merely because there was a covering note which had been addressed to him personally by the investigating judge but which had not been shown by any evidence to have been received by the officer or to have caused him to take even an indirect interest in the case . In this connection , ORG noted finally that it was not the senior deputy PERSON who had replied to the covering note .", "CARDINAL . In criminal matters , the public prosecutor \u2019s department \" conducts prosecutions in the manner specified by law \" ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph , of LAW ) . In that capacity , it investigates , and institutes proceedings in respect of , offences and then , if appropriate , appears at the trial in order to argue the case for the prosecution .", "All the judicial officers in the public prosecutor \u2019s department form a hierarchical body which is generally recognised as being characterised by unity , indivisibility and independence .", "In addition to the departments of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at ORG and of the procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux at ORG , there is a procureur du Roi for each district ; subject to the supervision and directions of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG , a procureur du Roi acts as public prosecutor before ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW ) . He is aided by one or more deputies who are subject to his personal supervision and directions , including one or more senior deputies appointed by LAW who assist him in the management of the public prosecutor \u2019s department ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s department , there are CARDINAL judicial officers all of whom are answerable to the procureur du Roi . The department is divided into sections , with a senior deputy at the head of each section . As a strict matter of law , the individual deputies come under the sole authority of the procureur du Roi who himself comes under the authority of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG , but in practice a senior deputy exercises certain administrative powers over the deputies . In particular , he revises their written submissions to the courts , discusses with them the approach to be adopted in a specific case and , if the occasion arises , gives them advice on points of law .", "CARDINAL of the above - mentioned sections - section B - deals with indictable and non - indictable offences ( crimes et d\u00e9lits ) against the person . Mr. PERSON was the head of this section during the period in question , until his appointment to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the Government , the procureur du Roi regarded himself at that time as personally responsible for cases - like Mr. PERSON \u2019s - involving an indictable offence , the number whereof was actually fairly small ; he worked on those cases directly with the deputy in charge of the file - on this occasion , Mrs. PERSON and then Mr. PERSON - , rather than through the intermediary of the senior deputy whose principal role was to countersign documents , if not to act as a \" letter - box \" . The applicant contested this version of the facts , maintaining that the Government were giving an exaggerated view of the \" autonomy \" enjoyed by the deputies vis - \u00e0 - vis the senior deputies .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a jury has to be constituted in all cases involving an indictable offence . PERSON are held , as a rule at the chief town in each province , in order to try accused persons remitted for trial there by ORG ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Judicial Code and LAW ) .", "Each assize court is composed of a President and CARDINAL other judges ( assesseurs ) ; for criminal matters , it sits with a jury of CARDINAL members ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) .", "The President \u2019s duties include directing the jurors in the exercise of their functions , summing - up the case on which they have to deliberate , presiding over the whole of the procedure and determining the order in which those wishing to do so shall address the court ; he also keeps order in court ( LAW ) . He is entitled by law to take , at his discretion and on his own initiative , any steps which he may consider expedient for the purpose of establishing the truth , and he is bound in honour and conscience to make every effort to that end , for example by ordering of his own motion the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After closing the hearings ( LAW , last paragraph , of LAW ) , the President puts to the jury the questions arising from the indictment and hands the text of those questions to the foreman of the jury ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . The jurors then retire to their room to deliberate together , in the absence of the President and the other judges ; they may return only when they have arrived at their verdict ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "To be valid , the jury \u2019s verdict must be adopted by a majority for or against the accused ; if the voting is equal , he is acquitted ( Article CARDINAL ) . However , if he is found guilty on the principal count by no more than the simple majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL - as was the case for Mr. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) - , the President and the CARDINAL other judges deliberate together on the same question ; if a majority of them does not agree with the majority of the jury , the accused is acquitted ( Article CARDINAL ) . If there is a finding of guilt , the judges retire with the jurors to the jury - room and they deliberate as a single body , under the chairmanship of the President of the ORG , on the sentence to be imposed in accordance with the criminal law ; the decision is taken by an absolute majority ( LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW prohibits the concurrent exercise of different judicial functions , except where otherwise provided by law ; it lays down that \" any decision given by a judge who has previously dealt with the case in the exercise of some other judicial function \" shall be null and void . LAW that \" proceedings before an assize court shall be null and void if they have been presided over by a judicial officer who has acted in the case as ... public prosecutor ( minist\u00e8re public ) or has delivered rulings on the conduct of the investigations \" ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
