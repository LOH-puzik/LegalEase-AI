On DATE the applicant company lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against the Deputy Minister of ORG \u2019s decision to provide the NORP tax authorities with the requested information . It argued that the provisions stated by the Deputy Minister in his notice could not be relied on as a legal ground for his decision .", "CARDINAL . After a hearing had been held in the objection proceedings , the applicant company argued additionally that its privacy of correspondence had been violated by the provision of the documents in issue to the NORP tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister dismissed the applicant company \u2019s objection . Its argument in relation to the violation of the right to respect for correspondence was rejected because , firstly , the inquiry had been carried out to provide information under ORG ) Act and not under LAW ( Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen ) ; secondly , the applicant company had not invoked its right to privacy of correspondence during the inquiry in DATE ; and lastly , the correspondence did not concern the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed against the decision claiming , inter alia , that its right under LAW had been violated because there had been no legal basis for the provision of the information to the NORP tax authorities . It further argued that it might suffer damage as a result of the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision , that it would need a judicial decision in order to submit a claim for compensation , and that it had incurred legal costs in relation to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( rechtbank ) declared the appeal inadmissible . It held that the applicant company had no standing because it had not substantiated that it had suffered any loss as a result of the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision to supply the information to the NORP tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a further appeal with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) arguing , among other things , that it had an interest in the examination of the lawfulness of the inquiry because the forwarding of its correspondence to the NORP tax authorities constituted an interference of LAW for which there had been no legal basis and the necessity of which in a NORP society was open to serious doubt . The applicant company suggested that this claim warranted an examination on the merits by a judicial authority .", "CARDINAL . Additionally , the applicant company argued that not only had prior judicial examination of the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision been impossible , owing to the fact that for \u201c urgent reasons \u201d the notice had been given to the applicant company after the implementation of the NORP request , but ORG judgment had also made retrospective judicial examination impossible . This lack of an effective remedy appropriate to its complaint under LAW , so it argued , constituted a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s arguments and upheld the judgment of ORG . In relation to the alleged violation of LAW it held that the mere fact that the applicant company wanted a judgment of principle on the issue did not constitute a sufficient interest . It further held that the applicant company had neither substantiated any pecuniary damage nor specified any non - pecuniary damage allegedly suffered as a result of the Deputy \u2019s Minister \u2019s decision .

The ORG has previously ruled that observance of the rights of the defence is a general principle of ORG law which applies where the authorities are minded to adopt a measure which will adversely affect an individual ( see [ Case CCARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON [ DATE ] ECR ICARDINAL ] , paragraph CARDINAL ) . In accordance with that principle , the addressees of decisions which significantly affect their interests must therefore be placed in a position in which they can effectively make known their views as regards the information on which the authorities intend to base their decision ( see , inter alia , ORG and Others [ DATE ] ECR I\u2011CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , and PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL ) . The authorities of the Member GPE are subject to that obligation when they take decisions which come within the scope of ORG law , even though ORG legislation applicable does not expressly provide for such a procedural requirement ( see PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL , and Case C\u2011CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG and R [ DATE ] ECR , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The question arises as to whether the decision of a competent authority of a Member ORG to request assistance from a competent authority of another Member ORG and the latter \u2019s decision to examine witnesses for the purposes of responding to that request constitute acts which , because of their consequences for the taxpayer , make it necessary for him to be heard .", "CARDINAL . All the Member GPE which submitted observations to the ORG argued that a request for information by CARDINAL Member ORG sent to the tax authorities of another Member ORG does not constitute an act giving rise to such an obligation . They rightly consider that , in tax inspection procedures , the investigation stage , during which information is collected and which includes the request for information by CARDINAL tax authority to another , must be distinguished from the contentious stage , between the tax authorities and the taxpayer , which begins when the taxpayer is sent the proposed adjustment .", "CARDINAL . Where the authorities gather information , they are not required to notify the taxpayer of this or to obtain his point of view .", "CARDINAL .

The same applies to the reply made by the requested tax authorities and the inquiries carried out to that end by those authorities , including the examination of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . It follows that respect for the rights of the defence of the taxpayer does not require that the taxpayer should take part in the request for information sent by the requesting Member ORG to the requested Member ORG . Nor does it require that the taxpayer should be heard at the point when inquiries , which may include the examination of witnesses , are carried out in the requested Member ORG or before that Member ORG sends the information to the requesting Member ORG .", "CARDINAL . None the less , there is nothing to prevent a Member ORG from extending the right to be heard to other parts of the investigation stage , by involving the taxpayer in various stages of the gathering of information , in particular the examination of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the answer to the first and second questions is that ORG law , as it results in particular from Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL and the fundamental right to be heard , must be interpreted as not conferring on a taxpayer of a Member ORG either the right to be informed of a request for assistance from that Member ORG addressed to another Member ORG , in particular in order to verify the information provided by that taxpayer in his income tax return , or the right to take part in formulating the request addressed to the requested Member ORG , or the right to take part in examinations of witnesses organised by the requested Member ORG . \u201d", "and ruled as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
