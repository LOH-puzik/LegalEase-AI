FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE as well as in DATE and DATE the applicant was apprehended by the police in his home after having disturbed his wife and grown - up daughter in a drunken state . On DATE the LOC police authority revoked his licences to keep CARDINAL rifles and CARDINAL pistols and seized them . The decision was based on CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , of LAW ( ampuma - aselaki , skjutvapenlag CARDINAL ) which had entered into force on DATE . On the strength of this provision a licence may be withdrawn due to the holder \u2019s state of health or dangerous lifestyle or behaviour such that it endangers the safety of himself and others and renders him unsuitable to possess guns , ammunition or related parts . The reason indicated in the decision was , in extenso , \u201c the applicant \u2019s repeated , disturbing behaviour while drunk \u201d .", "The applicant appealed , requesting an oral hearing of himself as well as his wife and daughter so as to prove that there was no causal link between his being drunk and the purported risk that he might use the firearms while under the influence of alcohol . His heavy alcohol consumption had been due largely to conflicts between himself and his daughter , who had moved away from home after the incidents leading to his apprehension . He had never assaulted her or anyone else and had never touched the firearms while drunk . The firearms had furthermore been locked . He further denied abusing alcohol continuously such that his behaviour met the condition in LAW for withdrawing his licences . That law required , in addition , that his behaviour was so problematic as to engender a risk that he might use his firearms for other than permissible purposes . The police authority \u2019s position that he was an alcohol abuser had not been backed up by any medical evidence . The revocation and seizure order had come as a surprise as he had not been warned that this might be the consequence of the behaviour which had led to his apprehension for drunkenness . Some of the firearms had been inherited by the applicant and had been in the family for CARDINAL generations .", "In its decision of DATE ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and PERSON refused the request for an oral hearing , considering that the applicant \u201c had accepted the basis \u201d for the revocation and seizure order , i.e. that he had behaved in a disturbing manner while drunk . Even though it had been contended that he had never been violent , in the circumstances at hand and given \u201c the other information emanating from the documents \u201d , it was manifestly unnecessary to hold a hearing , whether for the purpose of examining whether the legal conditions for the order had been met or for any other reason .", "The court went on to uphold the revocation and seizure order , noting that it had been based on the applicant \u2019s \u201c repeated , disturbing behaviour while drunk \u201d . The court recognised that no attempt had been made to establish whether he had acted violently but noted that the order had been based not on his violence but on his alcohol abuse which in itself could be considered a lifestyle endangering the safety of others and thus warranting a withdrawal of his licences .", "In its decision of DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint about the lack of an oral hearing before ORG . It also refused his request for an oral hearing before ORG . The highest court , like the lower court , noted that the applicant had accepted the basis of the decision made by the police , namely his alcohol problem and disturbing behaviour , adding that he had been apprehended in his home in DATE as well as in DATE and in DATE . In view of this and \u201c other information emanating from the documents \u201d a hearing was unnecessary .", "ORG also upheld the revocation and seizure order , essentially relying on the lower court \u2019s reasons . The justices in the minority would have remitted the case for an oral hearing before the lower court . They considered that the evidence which the applicant had wished to present as to the effect of his use of alcohol on his suitability to possess guns concerned a fact of relevance to the assessment of whether the legal conditions for the revocation of his licences were met . Considering also the importance of the licences for him , it was not \u201c manifestly unnecessary \u201d to hold an oral hearing .", "Under LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW a licence for the acquisition or possession of a firearm , firearm component , cartridges and specially dangerous projectiles may be revoked if , inter alia , the licence holder is to be deemed unsuitable to acquire or possess such objects , given that due to his state of health or his way of life or his behaviour he is endangering his own safety or that of others .", "According to the Government PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) for the enactment of LAW , a licence could for example be revoked for reasons relating to the licence - holder \u2019s health , way of life or behaviour . Before a licence can be revoked for reasons relating to the licence - holder \u2019s way of life or behaviour , this way of life or behaviour should endanger the licence - holder \u2019s own safety or that of others . Continued abuse of intoxicants \u2013 alcohol or drugs \u2013 may be considered such a way of life endangering safety as gives reason to revoke the licence . Thus , the danger caused thereby would not necessarily have to be related to firearms but even violent , dangerous or threatening behaviour without use of guns could constitute a ground for revoking the licence . However , in cases where the licence - holder \u2019s way of life was considered problematic to the extent that there was a risk of misuse of guns , it would always be necessary to revoke the licence .", "The revocation should nonetheless take account of all particular circumstances , the decisive matter being to what extent the act or conduct in question impacts on the license holder \u2019s suitability to handle firearms .", "In its decision no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ORG found that a case concerning the revocation of a licence to possess firearms involved no right or obligation within the meaning of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( perustuslaki , grundlagen ) or LAW . The case concerned a prohibition to appeal against a decision under LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Decree on Firearms and Ammunition . Under those provisions , the police had the right to revoke a licence to possess firearms if it was found necessary . ORG voted on the case ( CARDINAL ) . According to the dissenting members of the ORG , the revocation of a firearms licence involved the determination of a \u201c right \u201d or \u201c obligation \u201d within the meaning of LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW .", "Under LAW of the Act on Administrative Court Procedure ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag ORG ) , in its then form , the applicant was in principle entitled to a hearing once he had requested CARDINAL , but this request could be refused if a hearing would have been manifestly unnecessary in light of the subject - matter or for any other reason .", "Under LAW the applicant was entitled to designate or accept someone else as the owner of his firearms provided that person had been granted the requisite licence to that end . There is no indication that the applicant availed himself of this right within DATE ( possibly extended to CARDINAL ) or whether the firearms were sold at a public auction the yield of which was to be passed onto the applicant following a deduction of administrative costs . Any firearms that could not be sold were automatically transferred into ORG ownership without any compensation ( sections CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
