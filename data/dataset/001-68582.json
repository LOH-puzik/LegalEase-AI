The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s parents owned a CARDINAL - storey building in GPE . By virtue of LAW on the Ownership and Use of Land in GPE the GPE municipality ( and after DATE ORG ) became the owner of all plots of land located in GPE . The decree provided for a possibility to obtain the perpetual lease of a plot of land on request . On DATE the applicant \u2019s parents filed such a request . At DATE they were deprived of the right to manage the property and forced to renounce the rent collected from their tenants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined their request lodged in DATE . It refused to grant the applicant \u2019s parents the perpetual use ( former perpetual lease ) of the land and declared that the building located on that land had become the property of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision . It found that the building in question was not a small one - family house , which would qualify it for exclusion from the so - called \u201c communal administration \u201d of properties , provided for by a law adopted in DATE . As the building was covered by that administration , ORG considered that granting the perpetual use of the land would have no justification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed with ORG a request for the annulment of the decision of DATE . On DATE the Minister refused the request , considering that the challenged decision had been issued in accordance with the law . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the First President of ORG filed with that court an extraordinary appeal against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the DATE judgment of ORG and the decision of the Minister of Construction . It considered that they had relied on the conformity of the DATE decisions with the \u201c communal administration \u201d of properties , whereas the law providing for such administration had been adopted after the date of lodging the request for perpetual lease and therefore could not apply . The court observed that the DATE decree obliged the municipality to grant requests for perpetual use of land unless the use of that land by its former owner would be incompatible with its function set forth in the development plan . ORG pointed out that the organs dealing with the applicant \u2019s request had not examined the issue of such compatibility . It made reference to the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property , pointing out that the applicant \u2019s property had been expropriated on unspecified legal grounds and no compensation had been awarded therefor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Construction , having regard to ORG judgment , declared that the part of the decision of DATE concerning those flats in the disputed building which had been already sold by the municipality to their tenants had been issued in breach of the law . However , it was impossible to declare the decision null and void since , under applicable law , if DATE had elapsed from the date on which such an unlawful decision had been given , the Minister could only declare that it had been issued in breach of the law . The Minister annulled the remainder of that decision . In consequence , the appellate proceedings in respect of that part of the DATE decision were re - opened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Appeal quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case for re - examination .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG requested ORG PERSON to submit an extract from the town planning scheme concerning the plot under dispute .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE ORG informed the applicant about the problems hindering it from taking the requested decision . The first problem consisted in the fact that the applicant \u2019s mother had lodged her request to be granted the right to perpetual use before ORG became officially the owner of the plot . Another difficulty arose from the fact that the heirs of PERSON \u2013 the former co - owner of the plot \u2013 had not submitted to the ORG their legal titles to the ownership . Finally , it was necessary for the ORG to obtain the extract from the town planning scheme concerning the plot . In order to clarify the legal consequences arising from the first problem the ORG had posed a legal question to ORG , asking if the requirements of the CARDINAL Decree were fulfilled when the request had been lodged before the plot in question came officially into the ownership of ORG . The applicant was informed that as soon as the answer was provided the ORG would proceed further with his request .", "CARDINAL .
