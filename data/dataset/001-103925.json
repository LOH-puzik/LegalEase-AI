In DATE a plot of land measuring QUANTITY belonging to the applicant was expropriated for public needs in order to build an administrative and cultural centre and a road . The applicant received compensation of CARDINAL old NORP levs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the entry into force of the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant made a request to the mayor of GPE in GPE ( \u201c the mayor \u201d ) for the revocation of the expropriation because neither of the public works for the purposes of which it had been expropriated had commenced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid back the compensation he had received in DATE at the time of the expropriation .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the mayor revoked the expropriation . Because of administrative omissions in that decision , on DATE the mayor issued a new one to the same effect .", "CARDINAL . It appears that for a certain period of time the applicant was able to use and to benefit from the whole property or at least from part of it ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant requested the mayor to modify the land register in order to include the returned land . A procedure to that effect commenced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As by DATE the mayor had not yet ordered the modification of the land register , the applicant lodged an appeal against his tacit refusal to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor approved the modification and on CARDINAL DATE the applicant 's son in his capacity as owner of a neighbouring plot was officially informed about it .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant on DATE an administrative sanction was imposed on him for having used the land after the expropriation . He appealed against the sanction to the domestic courts . It appears that the appeal was granted and the sanction was quashed on an unspecified date not DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant found out that in the land register as modified in DATE the area of the returned land had been reduced to QUANTITY and a note had been added indicating that QUANTITY were part of a road the construction of which had already started .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant asked the court to declare the order of CARDINAL DATE null and void as it did not comply with the restitution orders .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the mayor 's order of DATE null and void as not being in compliance with the orders of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and thus being in violation of paragraph CARDINAL ) of the additional provisions of the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This judgment was not appealed against and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the mayor approved the modification of the land register to include the whole area of the land .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant initiated an action for damages under the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against ORG . Relying on the LAW and on LAW No . CARDINAL he alleged that due to the problems with the inclusion of the whole surface of the property in the land register , he had been unable \u201c to enter into possession , use and dispose of the returned land in the period DATE \u201d . He claimed potentially lost earnings and presented calculations from an expert based on the growing of certain types of agricultural products on the whole surface of the land for the period in question . The applicant also sought non - pecuniary damage for the anguish and suffering sustained .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the applicant 's son testified that the applicant had used the whole area for DATE , but thereafter the municipal authorities had forbidden him to use part of it claiming that it had been allocated for the construction of a new road . He also testified that the applicant had been involved in court proceedings over that question and that because of these problems with the land the applicant had suffered anguish and frustration .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the claim as manifestly ill - founded , as did ORG in a final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the one hand the courts admitted that there had been certain omissions on the part of the municipal authorities and that there had been obstacles preventing the applicant from using his land . On the other hand they held that registration in the land register was not decisive for ownership of the land , nor could it affect the right to use it . Furthermore , the applicant had not presented the order of DATE by which an administrative sanction had been imposed on him . Therefore , he had failed to prove the reasons and the extent of the alleged interference and that there had been a causal connection between the refusal to register the whole surface of the land in the land register and the damage allegedly sustained . He had also failed to prove that as a result of the actions or omissions of the municipal authorities he had sustained financial loss . The witness testimony had not clearly established what kind of anguish and suffering the applicant had experienced and there had been no medical evidence that he had suffered from a physical illness as a result of the alleged interference with his right of property . The courts did not specifically address the applicant 's arguments that he could not obtain an up - to - date plan view of the property and hence to dispose of the whole of this property .", "CARDINAL .

It provided for the restitution of expropriated property where specific conditions were met . The request for restitution had to be lodged with the mayor of the municipality , whose refusal could be appealed to the regional court . The mayor 's decision was binding on all ORG authorities ( paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the additional provisions ) . Owners who had received compensation for the expropriation had to return the compensation in order for the restitution order to enter into force ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The land register is a land survey information system which consists of registers and cadastral maps .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the adoption and modification of the land register were governed by LAW of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and the Regulations on its implementation ( \u201c the Regulations \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and the Regulations provided that the land register should contain information , inter alia , about the boundaries , the area and the type of plots of land , the constructions on these plots and the ownership rights over them . Most of this information had to be mentioned in the deeds and contracts concerning immovable property , such as notary deeds , sales contracts , superficio contracts , etc . All of these deeds and contracts had to be accompanied by a plan view issued by the regional land register service ( section CARDINAL of the Regulations ) . The state authorities and the domestic courts were under the obligation to inform the land register officials , inter alia , of all changes in the ownership and the boundaries of private properties which had come to their knowledge . These changes had to be duly entered in the land registers and maps ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE the ORG was replaced by ORG ( \u201c the CPRA \u201d ) . It clarified and expanded the provisions in respect of the land register . LAW b , in force as of DATE , provided that for the issuance of notary deeds and other acts concerning the rights over immovable property a plan view , i.e. a copy taken from the cadastral maps was necessary .
