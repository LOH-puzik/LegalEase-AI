The fact that the applicant had refused to sign it could not be interpreted to mean that the measure had not been applied . The preventive measure in the form of a signed undertaking not to leave one \u2019s place of residence was not meant to restrict one \u2019s freedom of movement ; its purpose was rather to keep the court informed of the person \u2019s whereabouts so that the criminal proceedings could be conducted without delays .
