The applicants , PERSON and his wife and CARDINAL minor children , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The President granted the applicants\u2019 request for their identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . They were represented before the ORG by ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are a family from the ORG region of GPE . They belong to the NORP ethnic minority and are NORP by religion . The first applicant , the father of the family , worked as a taxi driver and also had a car repair shop . The couple have not been politically , socially or religiously active . However , in DATE they started to have problems . The first applicant claims that for DATE in DATE , he worked as a driver for CARDINAL men who were apparently involved in insurgency acts . CARDINAL of the men was killed in DATE and the other managed to escape the country .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the first applicant claims that masked men in army clothes came to his car repair shop to look for his client , whose car was in the shop . As the client was not there , the men took him instead and kept him in some sort of cellar for DATE and ill - treated him . He was questioned about his client and about the CARDINAL men he had driven around in DATE . The applicant was threatened with charges for having participated in armed attacks He was allegedly asked also to pay MONEY in order not to be charged . He paid CARDINAL of the sum when he was released . After that his wife and children went to live with other relatives . The first applicant was in hiding for the rest of DATE and escaped in DATE to GPE through GPE and GPE , with a tourist group holding a GPE visa .", "CARDINAL . While the rest of the family stayed with relatives , the armed men came to search for information about the first applicant from their neighbours and at the house of the second applicant \u2019s mother . They did not know where the first applicant had gone , so they fled to GPE . Through other asylum seekers they obtained information that the first applicant was in GPE and they travelled there to seek asylum .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant submitted to the NORP authorities CARDINAL faxed documents in NORP with their NORP translations . Those documents were addressed to the first applicant in DATE and DATE by the investigative department of ORG and he was summoned for questioning as a crime suspect . The crime of which he was suspected was not , however , mentioned in the documents . The first applicant claims that he does not know why he is wanted , but claims that sometimes ethnicity and religion suffice to arouse the suspicion of the security authorities in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants both suffer from somewhat severe post - traumatic stress disorder and depression . The first applicant has also been suffering from headaches , insomnia and prostate problems which have been treated at the reception centre . Only in DATE he sought help for his psychological problems . He was subsequently examined and treated at ORG , ORG f\u00f6r rehabilitering av tortyroffer ) in GPE . The Deputy Chief Physician of the ORG recommended both private and group therapy together with medication for his trauma . No physical signs of ill - treatment were , however , reported . The second applicant has had symptoms of amnesia attacks and uncontrollable behaviour . She has been treated DATE and referred to ORG in GPE for further examination and treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted information to the ORG that the third applicant , the son of the family born in DATE , had gone missing on DATE . The third applicant was found on DATE and subsequently reunited with the other applicants . On DATE the second applicant gave birth to a third child who is suffering from a kidney pelvis extension .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and immediately sought asylum . On DATE ORG ( GPE , PERSON ) rejected the application , considering it not probable that the NORP authorities would be especially interested in the applicant as he had not been politically , socially or religiously active . It furthermore considered that , as the security situation was indeed relatively poor in ORG , the applicant could in any event always relocate internally inside GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second , third and fourth applicants had sought asylum in GPE on DATE but their applications were rejected on DATE and their appeal was rejected on DATE . They arrived in GPE on DATE and sought asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the first applicant had appealed against the negative asylum decision . On DATE ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) referred the first applicant \u2019s case back to ORG in order for them to consider the applications of the whole family together .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the asylum applications of the whole family and ordered their removal to GPE . It considered firstly that in the first applicant \u2019s first asylum application he mentioned the problems in ORG only in very general and vague terms and without specifying any personal threats . The story became personal only in the first asylum interview . Also the authenticity of the copies of \u201c summonses \u201d submitted by the applicant was impossible to verify . Moreover , ORG went on to consider that , as the applicants had not been in any way active or profiled persons , it was unlikely that the NORP authorities would be interested in them if returned to GPE . The applicants could in any event relocate internally .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed , requesting that the decision of ORG be quashed and that they be granted asylum , or alternatively , secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances , taking into consideration also the best interest of the children and the unreasonableness of the expulsion . They also requested that an oral hearing be held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal and refused their request for an oral hearing as unnecessary . It considered , like ORG , that the authenticity of the faxed documents named \u201c summons \u201d was impossible to verify and they did not appear exactly credible . It was impossible to draw any conclusions from those summonses regarding the events about which the applicants were complaining . On the other hand , there were no reasons to doubt the applicants\u2019 story or their credibility overall . However , the sole fact that the first applicant had been a driver for some insurgents in DATE did not seem the sort of activity which would arouse the interest of the NORP authorities . The acts directed against him in DATE were aimed at obtaining information from him about the others , but he was not personally suspected of any illegal activism himself . As the applicants had not been otherwise active and had no other contact with the insurgents , ORG concluded that it was unlikely that the NORP authorities would persecute the applicants if returned to GPE . It furthermore considered that the security situation was indeed unstable in the region but that it alone did not give rise to a need for international protection .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting also a stay on the execution of their expulsion order , which was not granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the right of foreigners to enter GPE and to remain in the country is regulated by an LAW .

According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , aliens residing in the country are granted asylum if they reside outside their home country or country of permanent residence owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ethnic origin , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion and if they , because of this fear , are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on grounds of subsidiary protection if the requirements for granting asylum under LAW are not met , but substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person , if returned to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence , would face a real risk of being subjected to serious harm , and he or she is unable , or owing to such risk , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . Serious harm means : CARDINAL ) the death penalty or execution ; CARDINAL ) torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ; or CARDINAL ) serious and individual threat as a result of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINALa of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on the basis of humanitarian protection , if there are no grounds under LAW or CARDINAL for granting asylum or providing subsidiary protection , but he or she can not return to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence as a result of an environmental catastrophe or a bad security situation which may be due to an international or internal armed conflict or a poor human rights situation .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINALb of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the well - founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section CARDINALb or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section CARDINAL may be based on incidents after the applicant \u2019s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in since his or her departure .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . ORG ) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant \u2019s statements on his or her circumstances in the ORG in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that ORG obtained from various sources . After obtaining the statement , the authorities shall decide on the matter in favour of the applicant on the basis of his or her statement if the applicant has contributed to the investigation of the matter as far as possible , and if the authorities are convinced of the veracity of the application with regard to the applicant \u2019s need for international protection .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Act , no one may be refused entry and sent back or deported to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty , torture , persecution or other treatment violating human dignity or from where he or she could be sent to such an area .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALb of LAW ( as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) incorporates into the NORP legal system the ORG CARDINAL of DATE on the organisation of joint flights for removals from the territory of CARDINAL or more member GPE , of third - country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders . The annex to the ORG contains common guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air including , inter alia , an obligation for the member GPE to ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health , which allows legally and factually for safe removal by air .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG on GPE for DATE :", "\u201c The government failed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses , resulting in a climate of impunity . Rule of law was particularly deficient in LOC , where conflict among government forces , insurgents , NORP militants , and criminal forces led to numerous human rights abuses , including killings , torture , physical abuse , and politically motivated abductions . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
