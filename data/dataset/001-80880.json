FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practicing in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Director of ORG , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant underwent gynaecological surgery ( a hysterectomy ) under general anaesthetic in ORG . When she came round , her left leg was paralysed . Whereas she had been able - bodied prior to the operation , subsequently she could only move about in a wheelchair or on crutches .", "On DATE PERSON , an expert in forensic medicine at the court of appeal , examined the applicant at her request . His report stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... immediately after [ the ] operation paralysis of the entire ... lower left limb occurred . To date , in spite of the various hypotheses put forward and ... the numerous in - depth examinations which have been carried out ... , it has not been possible to ascribe a precise aetiology to PERSON paralysis which would cause her sensory - motor disorder . The only undisputed fact is that this flaccid paralysis appeared in the immediate aftermath of the most recent operation on DATE ( on DATE ) . PERSON would appear to have a medico - psychological \u2018 field\u2019 which could have had an adverse impact on the durability of such disorders and the establishment of her current state . Nevertheless , as all the specialists agree ... , [ she ] has sustained a serious sensory - motor neurological injury , affecting the entire lower left limb , which arose following the operation of DATE . Is this the result of direct traumatic lesions to the nerve trunks ... or incorrect positioning on the operating table ? It is very difficult to choose between the various hypotheses put forward . In any event , [ the applicant ] has a serious disability which , in spite of every attempt at physiotherapy , seems to be permanent and without any significant possibility of improvement . Even if , as has been suggested , PERSON personal psycho - pathological \u2018 field\u2019 could have played a role in this situation , it is not the cause of it , which must be ascribed to the operation of DATE . It thus appears reasonable to request compensation for these post - operational complications from ORG . On the other hand , no \u2018 serious\u2019 fault giving rise to personal liability can be ascribed to the various specialists who treated the patient . \u201d", "On DATE PERSON , who held a degree in judicial compensation for personal injury and acted as an expert for ORG , examined the applicant at her request . His report , dated DATE , found that the applicant \u2019s paralysis had begun immediately after the operation of DATE and concluded :", "\u201c ... the only possibilities are : ( a ) incorrect positioning on the operating table ; or ( b ) , \u2018 sleep ORG , which is very similar ... Whatever the underlying psychological reality \u2013 and in this regard we ... found PERSON not merely uncomplaining but also surprisingly serene DATE the causal link is clear to all . \u201d", "On an urgent application by the applicant , the President of ORG appointed a medical expert ( Dr PERSON ) , who examined the applicant and studied her medical file . His report , dated DATE , concluded that there had been no medical or organisational error on the part of the hospital department . In particular , the report stated :", "\u201c ... PERSON underwent a hysterectomy on DATE . Since the operation there have been indications of a left crural injury , namely minor problems of sensitivity and motility in the area of the lower left limb which is innervated by the crural nerve . This is a relatively frequent post - operative complication following a hysterectomy . The reason [ for it ] has not yet been identified with any precision ; it is known , however , that these problems generally disappear after DATE . DATE , however , PERSON is still suffering from monoplegia of the lower left limb ... We are ... led to conclude that what we have here is pithiatic monoplegia of the lower left limb , linked to conversion syndrome . No psychosomatic or anatomical condition corresponds to the dysfunction complained of . Consequently , we can state that the observed monoplegia , of a conversion - syndrome type , has no causal link to the operation . However , while the operation is not responsible for the establishment of this pithiatic monoplegia , there is no doubt that [ it ] occurred immediately after the operation and especially after a crural injury linked to that operation . This pithiatic monoplegia could only have appeared in a woman who had a predisposition to psychological problems of this nature , but ORG has ruled that under no circumstances may one refer to a predisposition that had not [ previously ] come to light , and it would not appear that PERSON had shown signs of psychological problems of this nature in DATE the operation , not having seen a doctor for that reason and not having been treated at home or in hospital for such problems . ... No medical error occurred and the operation proceeded normally but , in a predisposed environment , [ it ] triggered a conversion syndrome on a bias point which , in PERSON case , took the form of pithiatic monoplegia of the lower left limb . In consequence , even if there was no error or fault on the part of the care team or hospital , given that the problems were indisputably triggered following the operation , it might be possible to envisage compensation for the consequent dysfunctions from a legal perspective , without a medical error having occurred during the operation ; this will be for the court to decide . We emphasise that , in this approach , imputability must be considered absolute from the medico - legal perspective , since it has been impossible to produce evidence of [ PERSON ] previous condition , even if , medically speaking , her previous condition is perfectly clear . ... \u201d", "The applicant applied to ORG , seeking to have ORG declared liable for the detrimental consequences of the surgery of DATE and to obtain an order that it was to pay compensation for her personal injury . Her application was dismissed on the following grounds by a judgment of DATE .", "\u201c ... The inquiry into the facts , and particularly the expert report ordered in interlocutory proceedings , revealed that the operation ... proceeded normally , with no medical error or fault by the theatre team which could be alleged to have caused the emergence of the problems complained of by the claimant , and that the monoplegia observed in [ PERSON ] is not imputable to the conditions in which the operation was carried out ; the circumstance that this operation could , as a psychological factor , have triggered a conversion syndrome on a bias point which , in the patient \u2019s case , took the form of pithiatic monoplegia of the lower left limb is not in itself sufficient to establish a causal link between the operation and the paralysis complained of by the claimant ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG . She complained , in particular , that the hospital had failed in its obligation to inform her fully of the risks connected with the operation that she was to undergo , with the result that she had not been able to give informed consent and had failed to carry out prior research into whether she was predisposed to somatisation . ORG dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE , giving the following reasons .", "\u201c ... The expert report reveals that , although the problems suffered by PERSON , which appeared in TIME following the operation before assuming a permanent nature , arose on the occasion of that operation , they are not a direct consequence of it but are only the expression of psychosomatic tendencies which had already been exhibited at a previous stage by PERSON ; there is therefore no direct causal link between the symptoms shown and the operation carried out .", "PERSON also seeks to establish the hospital \u2019s liability , alleging that it had committed a fault in failing to carry out in - depth tests prior to the operation in order to take account of these tendencies and cancel the operation in question ; on the CARDINAL hand , it is not alleged that the hospital was aware of this psychological frailty in PERSON and , on the other , in any event , the investigation reveals that the persistence of the appellant \u2019s gynaecological problems over DATE , in spite of various measures , amounted to an indisputable indication for the operation , having regard to the chronic and disabling nature of those problems , which were indeed completely removed by the operation . ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed to the ORG d\u2019Etat . In her full pleadings , complaining in particular that the appeal court \u2019s judgment had not replied to her argument alleging a lack of investigation and information , she invited the PERSON d\u2019Etat to hold that that judgment should be quashed and to determine the merits of the case .", "On DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the appeal in a judgment which was worded as follows :", "\u201c ... The evidence submitted to the trial judges reveals that , when finding that \u2018 there is ... no direct causal link between the symptoms shown and the operation carried out\u2019 , the court did not distort either the facts of the case or the conclusions of the expert report drawn up at the request of ORG , which noted that there is no direct link of cause and effect between the monoplegia suffered by PERSON and the operation .", "In ruling that \u2018 there is ... no direct causal link between the symptoms shown and the operation carried out\u2019 and by thus finding that the precondition for any liability on the part of the hospital , either on the ground of strict liability or of liability for negligence , was not met , the court gave sufficient reasons for its judgment ... \u201d", "In her observations in response to those of the Government , the applicant added that , at her lawyer \u2019s request , an expert named ORG had confirmed the following in a report of DATE ( not produced ) .", "\u201c In this case , there is an obvious cause for the patient \u2019s condition , namely the operation of CARDINAL[CARDINAL ] DATE , complicated by a lesion of the left crural nerve .", "The relationship between this cause and its consequences is substantiated by several factors : an initial injury to the crural nerve , confirmed by electromyogram ; a neurological syndrome of functional lameness of the lower left limb , in a person who was thus predisposed ; and an unconscious conversion in relation to the experience of the operation and the subsequent complication , taking the form of an injury to the crural nerve , which developed into a pithiatic symptom .", "These complications are disproportionate to what might have been expected from the initial hysterectomy .", "Conclusion : the problems evidenced on this date are to be directly and exclusively ascribed to the consequences of the operation of CARDINAL[CARDINAL ] DATE . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
