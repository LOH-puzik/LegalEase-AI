The explanatory note to the LAW includes the following commentary on LAW :", "\u201c Absence of prior ORG control", "This principle underlines the importance of no prior ORG control over what the public can search for on the Internet . In some countries , there is a tendency to block access by the population to content on certain foreign or domestic websites for political reasons . This and similar practices of prior ORG control should be strongly condemned .", "Although the ORG should by no means take broad measures to block undesirable content , exceptions must be allowed for the protection of minors . Where minors have access to the Internet , for example in schools or libraries , public authorities may require filters to be installed on computers to block access to harmful content .", "The absence of prior control by the ORG does not of course rule out measures being undertaken to remove content from the Internet or block access to it following a preliminary or final decision of the competent national authorities on its illegality , not only under penal law , but also under other branches of law such as civil or administrative law . This would typically be the case when injunctions are sought to prevent the publication on the Internet of content which is illegal . Such measures , which could entail some sort of prior control , would have to fulfil the requirements of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG and they would have to be directed at a clearly identifiable Internet content . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG adopted Recommendation CM / Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL on measures to promote the public service value of the Internet .

On DATE ORG adopted Recommendation CM / Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL on the protection of human rights with regard to search engines . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Recommendation stresses , inter alia , that \u201c [ s]earch engines enable a worldwide public to seek , receive and impart information and ideas and other content in particular to acquire knowledge , engage in debate and participate in democratic processes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Recommendation GPE ) , adopted by ORG on DATE , stated expressly that ORG should participate in efforts to establish an e - democracy on the basis of full and safe access to the Internet . ORG therefore recommended to member GPE that they should condemn governmentimposed censorship of the content that could be searched on Internet sites , and called on them \u201c to ensure that freedom of expression is not subject to arbitrary restrictions from the public and/or private sphere and to avoid all legislative or administrative measures that could have a \u2018 chilling effect\u2019 on all aspects of freedom of speech \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Case GPE , examined by ORG of ORG ( CJEU ) , concerned a reference for a preliminary ruling following an order issued by a NORP court requiring an Internet service provider to install a permanent monitoring system blocking all online activity liable to infringe intellectual property rights .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG held that the holders of intellectual property rights should have the possibility of applying for an injunction against an intermediary who carried a third party \u2019s infringement of a protected work or other subject matter in a network , and that the arrangements governing such injunctions should be left to national law . However , the national rules had to observe the limitations arising from ORG law and in particular from the Directive on electronic commerce ( CARDINAL ) , which prohibited national authorities from adopting measures which would require an Internet service provider to carry out general monitoring of the information that it transmitted on its network . The ORG took the view that injunctions of the kind issued in the case under consideration did not respect the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property on the one hand and the freedom to conduct business , the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information on the other . Accordingly , it concluded that ORG law , and in particular Directive CARDINAL and the applicable fundamental rights , precluded an injunction imposed on an Internet service provider to introduce a system for filtering all electronic communications passing via its services , applied indiscriminately to all its customers , as a preventive measure , exclusively at its expense and for an unlimited period .", "CARDINAL . In its General Comment No . DATE on LAW , adopted at its CARDINALnd session ( CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Any restrictions on the operation of websites , blogs or any other Internet - based , electronic or other such information - dissemination system , including systems to support such communication , such as Internet service providers or search engines , are only permissible to the extent that they are compatible with paragraph CARDINAL . Permissible restrictions generally should be content - specific ; generic bans on the operation of certain sites and systems are not compatible with paragraph CARDINAL . It is also inconsistent with paragraph CARDINAL to prohibit a site or an information - dissemination system from publishing material solely on the basis that it may be critical of the government or the political social system espoused by the government . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In view of the fact that legislation concerning the Internet , which has to be seen against a background of rapidly changing new technologies , is particularly dynamic and fragmented , it is difficult to identify common standards based on a comparison of the legal situation in ORG member GPE . A survey carried out by ORG , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) reveals that the right to Internet access is protected in theory by the constitutional guarantees applicable to freedom of expression and freedom to receive ideas and information . The right to Internet access is considered to be inherent in the right to access information and communication protected by national Constitutions , and encompasses the right for each individual to participate in the information society and the obligation for GPE to guarantee access to the Internet for their citizens . It can therefore be inferred from all the general guarantees protecting freedom of expression that a right to unhindered Internet access should also be recognised .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . PERCENT CARDINAL DC ) , ORG , for instance , stated clearly that freedom of expression implied freedom of access to the Internet . ORG also set forth a number of basic principles concerning the restriction of Internet access . Restrictions on the public \u2019s right to access online communication services could be ordered only by a judge , following a fair trial , and had to be proportionate . Finding that \u201c in view of the nature of the freedom guaranteed by LAW , the legislature may not ... confer powers [ to restrict or prevent Internet access ] on an administrative authority with the aim of protecting the holders of copyright and related rights \u201d , ORG declared to be unconstitutional the legislative provisions which provided for the blocking of Internet access in cases of infringement of copyright , in the absence of a prior judicial decision . It held that the suspension of access could be ordered only after adversarial judicial proceedings , as an ancillary penalty . Interim measures or injunctions could be ordered by the urgent - applications judge , provided that they were \u201c strictly necessary in order to preserve the rights in question \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards possible restrictions in cases of illegal Internet content , NORP countries have adopted a wide variety of approaches and legislative measures , ranging from the suspension of individual rights of Internet access or the removal of the illegal content , to the blocking of access to the specific website in question . In most NORP countries , the protection of the rights of minors and efforts to combat the sexual exploitation of minors constitute a basis for appropriate measures restricting access to the websites concerned ( this is the case in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . When it comes to ordinary crime , the measures restricting access are different and less severe in CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of the restrictions , a distinction is generally made according to the nature of the offence committed , namely between offences against intellectual property rights and other offences . According to a report by ORG in LOC ( LOC ) entitled \u201c Freedom of expression on the Internet : study of legal provisions and practices related to freedom of expression , the free flow of information and media pluralism on the Internet in LOC participating GPE \u201d , there are no general legislative provisions on the blocking of Internet access in GPE , GPE , GPE or GPE . CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) have no legislation providing for wholesale blocking irrespective of the offence but have enacted specific legislative provisions allowing access to be blocked in the case of certain types of offence . These include child pornography , racism , hate speech , incitement to terrorism and defamation .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , although a blanket prohibition on Internet access is not possible , access restrictions may be imposed under federal legislation on specific grounds , for instance to protect the foundations of the constitutional order , morals , health or the legitimate rights and interests of others , or in the interests of national defence and security ( Federal Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In those countries which do not have a general or specific legislative framework providing for the closure of sites and/or the blocking of access , blocking measures may nonetheless be ordered by a judge or applied on a voluntary basis .", "CARDINAL . The possibility of appealing against a measure prohibiting Internet access is closely linked to the general guarantees protecting the right to receive information and to express one \u2019s views . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , no specific provisions exist governing appeals against measures restricting access to an Internet page . Reference is made instead to the general constitutional provisions on freedom of expression and information or , in the case of GPE , to the possibility of judicial review if the user can prove that he or she has a sufficient interest linked to the subject of the impugned measure . In GPE , the legislation makes express provision for contesting a measure restricting access to information on the Internet before a higher administrative authority or a specialised agency or directly before the courts in cases concerning public information which the authorities are required to make accessible ( LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
