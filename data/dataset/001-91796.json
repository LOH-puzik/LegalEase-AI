After an autopsy had been carried out on DATE an opinion was submitted to the prosecutor on DATE .

The death certificate ( karta zgonu ) signed by PERSON , a forensic expert from the \u015al\u0105ska ORG in GPE , gave the following cause for PERSON death :", "\u201c Numerous effusions of blood in the soft tissue of the neck . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened an investigation in order to establish whether an offence prohibited by LAW ( unintentional homicide ) had been committed . The prosecutor interviewed several witnesses and ordered an examination of blood and other samples and the preparation of an expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation . The prosecutor observed that PERSON had been examined by a doctor at the time of his admission to the soberingup centre . The examination showed that he had been intoxicated and that he had no injuries to his body . As PERSON had uttered threats and had been aggressive , he had been tied up to a bed with belts . The room in which he had been detained had been inspected by an employee of the soberingup centre at TIME When the same employee had come to the room at TIME he had noticed spots on PERSON skin and had called the doctor on duty . The doctor had examined ORG and had called an ambulance . The doctor who had arrived in the ambulance had examined ORG and had declared him dead . Furthermore , the prosecutor referred to an expert opinion prepared by the \u015al\u0105ska ORG , which stated that PERSON had died of asphyxiation . The prosecutor concluded that the evidence collected in the course of the investigation did not show that third persons had caused the death of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision to discontinue the investigation . She also requested that the prosecution service carry out a reconstruction of the crime scene , with the assistance of a medical expert . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that her request had been granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical expert opinion was prepared by ORG in GPE . The expert established that the possible cause of PERSON death had been asphyxiation due to immobilisation of his chest by belts which might have obstructed his breathing . However , the expert was unable to establish the origin of the injuries to PERSON neck .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE and resumed the investigation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor charged GPE , an employee of the Centre , with the unintentional homicide of PERSON . CARDINAL other employees of the centre were charged by the prosecutor in DATE . On DATE Z.K. was suspended from his duties at the Tychy Sobering - Up Centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered the preparation of another expert medical opinion by the \u015al\u0105ska ORG in GPE . The opinion was inconclusive and did not rule out either the exertion of pressure on PERSON neck or his incorrect immobilisation by belts as possible causes of his death . The expert was also unable to establish precisely the time of his death .", "CARDINAL . In a supplementary expert opinion prepared in DATE the expert established that Mr Mojsiejew should have been released from the belts after TIME since he had ceased to be aggressive . Moreover , the staff had failed to supervise his state of health . The expert concluded that the death could have been caused by strong pressure on his chest and his lack of direct supervision for TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicted CARDINAL employees of the sobering - up centre before ORG . They were indicted under LAW for the unintentional homicide of PERSON . In particular , Mr GPE was accused of having incorrectly immobilised PERSON on the bed and , in doing so , having exerted pressure on his neck . In consequence the respiratory movements of his chest had been limited to a large extent , which had led to his death by asphyxiation . CARDINAL other employees of the sobering - up centre were charged with unintentional homicide by failing in their duty to care for and supervise Mr Mojsiejew .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested to join the proceedings as an auxiliary prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned as the parties had not been properly summoned to it . Afterwards , the trial could not start as on QUANTITY occasions new reporting judges had to be assigned to the case . In consequence , ORG held the first hearing on DATE . Subsequently , CARDINAL hearings were scheduled for DATE and CARDINAL DATE but they were adjourned .", "CARDINAL . The trial court held a hearing on DATE , at which it examined the accused . Some hearings scheduled afterwards were adjourned for various procedural reasons . On DATE an attempt by the applicant to challenge judges trying the case was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG held its next hearing on DATE and examined some witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the trial court held CARDINAL hearings in total and scheduled them at regular intervals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the court held only QUANTITY hearings , on DATE and DATE . On DATE the court requested a new expert medical opinion from ORG . The experts submitted their opinon on DATE . The opinion reads as follows :", "\u201c The above observations [ from photographs and an inspection of the room in which ORG died ] lead to a conclusion that the injuries to the deceased \u2019s neck most probably did not occur prior to his arrival at the sobering - up centre , or as a result of his being tied to the bed by belts . In consequence , another means by which these injuries occurred needed to be examined .", "The absence of external skin injuries and the presence of extensive internal injuries in the soft tissue of the neck indicate that a large amount of direct pressure had been applied with a blunt object of a substantial surface area . Such an object could have been , for example , an arm , or alternatively the elbow area between the forearm and arm , if somebody had applied the immobilisation technique called a headlock ( krawat ) . In this hold the person applying it normally stands behind the person to be immobilised and forcefully puts his arm around the neck [ ... simultaneously pushing the head with the other hand ... ] . This hold blocks breathing and hinders the access of blood to the brain , which in a short time leads to fainting . At the same time , if [ the headlock ] lasts long enough it may lead to death by strangulation or cardiac arrest . ... Cardiac arrest or respiratory failure occurs either immediately after [ the headlock ] has been applied or it can occur some time afterwards if the hold was applied for a long enough time to cause brain damage ...", "It appears from medical and forensic practice that the [ headlock ] is sometimes used on intoxicated and aggressive patients at sobering - up centres . Such actions , where they do not cause death , expose the person to a direct danger of loss of life or serious bodily injury within the meaning of LAW .", "The absence of any external signs of injuries on the chest which could indicate that strong pressure had been applied by narrow belts limiting the respiratory movements of the chest ... , taking into account the above considerations , makes it very doubtful that the immobilisation of the chest was the cause of [ ORG ] death .", "While the cause of death advanced by the \u015al\u0105ska Medical ORG can not be totally ruled out , it is much more probable that the cause of the sudden death of [ PERSON ] was strangulation ( uduszenie przez zad\u0142awienie ) by applying strong pressure with a blunt object to the neck , in the manner and circumstances described above .", "It should be added that such extensive injuries to the front side of his neck could not have happened if [ PERSON ] was trying to free himself from the belts while lying on his stomach . It is also impossible that such injuries occurred during convulsions ...", "A forensic examination of the body ( obdukcja s\u0105dowo - lekarska ) , in the place in which it had been found , was not conducted , which makes it impossible to establish the exact time of death . Analysing livor mortis ( plamy po\u015bmiertne ) [ and other factors ] , one can only advance the hypothesis that TIME had elapsed between his death and the time at which his body was found . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE and on DATE it gave its judgment . The court changed the classification of the offence and found all the accused guilty of having exposed PERSON to an immediate danger of loss of life within the meaning of LAW of LAW . They were sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the course of the events of CARDINAL DATE , the court established that during his arrest by the police , his transfer to the soberingup centre and his stay in the centre , PERSON had been calm and had not shown aggression . In the sobering - up centre , however , he refused to undress and became verbally abusive , which led the centre \u2019s staff to decide to put him in the special room with immobilising belts . At CARDINAL a.m. PERSON was put on the bed , on his stomach , and GPE tied his hands , legs and chest with the belts . During this , Mr Mojsiejew was calm and did not put up a struggle ; he was mumbling incomprehensibly . After having been tied to the bed and examined by a doctor , PERSON was left in his room . He was examined TIME but afterwards no employee from the shift that finished at TIME , or from the following shift , came into the room in which ORG had been immobilised and examined him . The employees occasionally observed him , looking mostly through a spy - hole in the door without entering the room , and were able to see his sides moving , from which they had concluded that he was still breathing .", "At TIME CARDINAL employee of the centre noticed through the glass in the door that the skin on PERSON hands was of an unnatural colour . He called a doctor on duty and together they came into the room . They untied Mr Mojsiejew . At CARDINAL an ambulance came and the doctor established that PERSON was dead .", "CARDINAL . As regards the cause of his death , the court noted that all medical opinions had found that PERSON had died of asphyxiation . The court considered that the experts from the \u015al\u0105ska ORG had avoided answering the question of the origin of the injuries to Mr ORG neck . Thus , the court accepted the conclusions reached by the experts from ORG , who dismissed as highly improbable the hypothesis that the belts had been tied too tight and had obstructed the movement of his chest , since Mr Mojsiejew had not had any marks on his body indicating that pressure had been exerted by the chest belt . The court thus concluded that his death had been caused by strangulation ( zad\u0142awienie ) as pressure had been applied to PERSON neck . It had most probably happened when someone had put ORG in a headlock . This immobilisation technique , if applied for a longer time , could lead directly to death , but if applied for a shorter period of time could cause brain damage , which affected breathing and after a certain time could also lead to death .", "CARDINAL . The court also considered that the failure to conduct a forensic examination of the body narrowed the evidence concerning the state of the body , its temperature and the state of livor mortis . Thus , the precise time of death could not be established .", "CARDINAL . Although the court was unable to establish beyond doubt who had applied the headlock on the applicant \u2019s son , it considered that all the accused had failed in their duty of care for PERSON by having exposed him to an immediate danger of loss of life . In particular , the employees of the centre had been obliged to carry out constant supervision of the rooms in which intoxicated persons were detained . Under domestic law , patients immobilised by belts should be examined and checked TIME . If patients stayed calm and there were no other indications for the use of belts , they should be released ; it should also be ensured that the patient did not need to use the toilet . However , PERSON had not been examined TIME . He had been properly examined only once , TIME after he had been immobilised by the belts . Moreover , immobilisation by belts should not have been applied to him in the first place . The accused had thus deliberately failed in their obligation to protect PERSON life . Moreover , they had been completely unaware of the rules governing the manner in which care was to be provided to immobilised patients . In particular one of the accused , who was a doctor , had believed that a patient could be kept immobilised for TIME without being released .", "CARDINAL . The accused and the applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the lower court . The court considered premature the first - instance court \u2019s conclusions relating to the manner in which Mr ORG death had occurred . It found that the accused had been correct in submitting that the exact time of the events and Mr ORG death should have been specified since the accused had been responsible for providing care to him at different times . It also indicated that other evidence needed to be taken , in particular from the expert witnesses from the ORG who had prepared the most recent opinion .", "CARDINAL . The case was transferred to ORG which held a first hearing on DATE . In DATE the case was still pending before that court .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW provide as follows :", "LAW", "\u201c Anyone who unintentionally causes the death of a human being shall be subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for a term of DATE . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL .
