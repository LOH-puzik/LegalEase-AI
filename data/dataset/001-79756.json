{"ITEMID": "001-79756", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "KLEINERT v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr. PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , a dentist , is the father of a daughter born out of wedlock in DATE . As the applicant and the mother with whom the child lives did not give a declaration on joint custody ( gemeinsame PERSON ) , the mother obtained sole custody ( alleinige PERSON ) pursuant to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of GPE ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch , see relevant domestic law ) .", "The applicant initially had access to the child on a regular basis . The child occasionally stayed with him . The applicant or his parents would also care for the child on DATE before the mother returned from work . DATE , the applicant had access to the child for DATE and during certain holidays . In DATE , ORG ordered that the applicant had the right of access to the child every other DATE and during holidays .", "At GPE DATE the mother informed the applicant that she was planning to move with the child to GPE in GPE in order stay with her partner from DATE . The applicant subsequently instituted civil proceedings in order to obtain the sole right to custody or , alternatively , to prevent the mother from leaving GPE with the child .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . The court heard the applicant , the mother and the child and considered a report from ORG . The child declared that it wanted to be both with the mother and the applicant . ORG considered the applicant as generally suitable for having the custody of his child and that the decision was therefore not a negative assessment of his suitability . However , ORG stressed that , in order to transfer custody to the applicant , it was necessary to withdraw it from the mother who had sole custody pursuant to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The only possibility under the NORP legislation to withdraw the mother \u2019s custody was therefore pursuant to sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , according to which the family court may order appropriate measures in case of an abuse of custody and a resulting threat for the child \u2019s physical , psychological or mental well - being . ORG found that the requirements of these provisions had not been met . The court held that , if the child accompanied her mother to GPE , neither her well - being nor her property was endangered in such a way that the only appropriate measure was the withdrawal of the mother \u2019s custody . Admittedly , the child would be taken away from her familiar environment , but this was generally the case when parents moved with their children . It was therefore decisive that the child was able to maintain contacts with familiar persons . Moreover , the child would be able to become familiar with a different culture and a new language . As far as the applicant complained that the mother of the child was not suitable for the exercise of custody , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s submissions as unfounded . Furthermore , the mother \u2019s decision to move to GPE to live with her new partner could not be challenged under LAW of LAW as the mother \u2019s reasons for moving were cogent . She had offered the applicant every possible access to his child once she had moved to GPE , and the applicant had the financial means for regular visits so that his right to access was not frustrated .", "Shortly after the GPE ORG decision , the mother and the child moved to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision . ORG heard the child which declared that she preferred to stay in GPE where her friends and her father , whom she loved , were . The court however found that the child \u2019s opposition of her new home in GPE would not last once the child grew up and developped further . Measures in accordance with section DATE of LAW would require more than a mere abstract danger for the well - being of the child . Because of the short time the child had spent in GPE , it was impossible for her to form relationships similar to the ones she had in GPE . The obviously painful separation from the applicant who had cared for the child to a remarkably large extent could be compensated by the fact that the applicant had the right of access to the child every other DATE and during holidays per court order of ORG of DATE . The exercise of his right to access was made more difficult due to the territorial distance but not reduced to an unjustifiable extent . ORG also took into account that the mother had cogent reasons to move to GPE in order to live with her new partner .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "The statutory provisions on custody and access are to be found in the NORP Civil Code . According to section CARDINAL LAW , the father and the mother have the right and the duty to exercise parental authority ( elterliche PERSON ) over a minor child . The parental authority includes the custody and the care of property ( Verm\u00f6genssorge ) of the child .", "Originally , the custody of children born out of wedlock was , according to section CARDINAL of LAW , automatically obtained by the mother . That provision was however declared unconstitutional by ORG in DATE . On DATE , the amended LAW DATE ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) , entered into force to implement ORG judgment of DATE . The relevant law in LAW was changed as follows : pursuant to section DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL , the parents of a minor child born out of wedlock jointly exercise custody if they make a declaration to that effect ( declaration on joint custody ) or if they marry . Otherwise section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the mother obtains sole custody .", "Pursuant to section DATE of LAW , the family court may order the necessary measures if the child \u2019s physical , psychological or mental well - being is threatened by malpractice of custody if the parents are unwilling to take those measures . Measures which cause a separation of the child from the parent are only admissible if the danger for the child can not be averted otherwise ( section CARDINALa of LAW ) .", "According to section DATE of LAW , a child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child . Moreover , the parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing .", "On DATE , ORG found that section CARDINALa of LAW was unconstitutional because it lacked a provisional period for unmarried couples with children who had lived together in DATE but separated before the amended LAW entered into force on DATE ( i.e. they could have had the opportunity to obtain joint custody if the legislation at the time would have been constitutional ) . In order to settle the above constitutional flaws , the NORP legislator introduced on DATE section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz in ORG ) , according to which a court can substitute the mother \u2019s consent to joint custody if an unmarried couple has a child born out of wedlock , has lived together with the child and has separated before DATE , provided that joint custody would serve the child \u2019s interest ( PERSON ) .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG however also held that section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , apart from the lack of a provisional period , did not violate the right to respect for their family life of fathers whose children were born out of wedlock . Parents who were married had obliged themselves upon marriage to take responsibility for themselves and their children . In contrast to this , the legislator could not assume that parents of children born out of wedlock lived together or wanted to take responsibility for each other . Moreover , there was not sufficient actual evidence that a father of a child born out of wedlock wanted to bear joint responsibility as a general rule . The child \u2019s well - being therefore demanded that the child had a person upon birth which can act for the child in a legally binding way . In view of the very different life conditions into which those children were born into , it was justified to generally grant sole custody to the mother , and not to the father or to both parents . This legislation could also not be objected from a constitutional point of view because the legislator had given parents of children born out of wedlock the possibility to both obtain custody through a joint declaration ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
