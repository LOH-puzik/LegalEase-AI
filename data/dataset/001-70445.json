On the basis of the above - mentioned expert report , ORG submitted that even if the samples had not been transposed , the results would have been uncertain , having regard to the presence of the mother \u2019s blood in the sample taken . Consequently , the applicants would not in any case have had reliable information available to them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG varied the order issued by the urgent applications judge , reducing from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL the amount of the interim award to the applicants . In its judgment it observed :", "\u201c Liability :", "... after the birth [ of C. ] , as the child had been found to be suffering from [ infantile spinal amyotrophy ] , it emerged that the reason incorrect information had been given to the parents was that the results of the analyses carried out on CARDINAL patients had been switched .

That being so , [ AP - HP ] \u2019s plea that , for assessment of [ the applicants\u2019 ] right to compensation , the above - mentioned provisions of the Law of CARDINAL March CARDINAL should have been applied to the dispute constitutes a serious defence against the applicants\u2019 claim at first instance , in the amount awarded by the court below .

That information proved to have been incorrect because the results from CARDINAL patients had been transposed . The investigation showed that the switch was imputable to [ AP - HP ] , which runs ORG on whose premises the sample had been analysed . The switching of the results constituted gross negligence [ faute caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e ] for the purposes of GPE . In order to absolve itself of liability , Assistance publique - GPE can not effectively argue that , even in the absence of negligence , the diagnosis would not have been reliable because of the presence of the mother \u2019s blood in the foetal sample , since in such circumstances it was incumbent on the practitioner responsible for the analysis to inform [ the applicants ] accordingly , so that they would then have been able to have a new sample taken .

An action for damages brought by the parents of a child born disabled and by the child itself may come within the jurisdiction of either the administrative courts or the ordinary courts , depending on the identity of the defendant . If the defendant is a private doctor or a private medical laboratory , the dispute is referred to the ordinary courts . Where , on the other hand , as in the instant case , a public hospital service is involved , the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat gave judgment on DATE ( CE , Sect . , DATE , ORG hospitalier de Nice c. GPE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . PERSON , then aged DATE , had undergone an amniocentesis at her own request in order to verify the health of the foetus she was carrying . Although the result of that examination revealed no anomaly , she gave birth to a child suffering from trisomy CARDINAL , a condition detectable through the chromosome test carried out . The PERSON d\u2019Etat held in the first place that the hospital which had carried out the examination had been guilty of negligence , since PERSON had not been informed that the results of the amniocentesis might be subject to a higher margin of error than usual on account of the conditions under which the examination had taken place .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , a distinction was drawn between the disabled child \u2019s entitlement to compensation and that of its parents .", "With regard to the disabled child \u2019s right to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat ruled : \u201c In deciding that a direct causal link existed between the negligence of the hospital centre ... and the damage incurred by the child PERSON from the trisomy from which he suffers , when it is not established by the documents in the file submitted to the court which determined the merits that the infirmity from which the child suffers and which is inherent in his genetic make - up was the consequence of [ an ] amniocentesis , ORG made an error of law . \u201d", "On the other hand , with regard to the GPE right to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat noted : \u201c By asking for an amniocentesis , PERSON had clearly indicated that she wished to avoid the risk of a genetic accident to the child she had conceived , the probability of which , given her age at the time , was relatively high . \u201d It went on to say that in those conditions the hospital \u2019s negligence had \u201c wrongly led PERSON and PERSON to the certainty that the child conceived was not trisomic and that PERSON pregnancy could be carried normally to term \u201d and that \u201c this negligence , as a result of which PERSON had no reason to ask for a second amniocentesis with a view to abortion on therapeutic grounds under Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , should be regarded as the direct cause of the prejudice caused to PERSON and PERSON by their child \u2019s infirmity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat took into account , under the head of pecuniary damage , the \u201c special burdens , particularly in terms of specialist treatment and education \u201d made necessary by the child \u2019s infirmity , and awarded the parents an annuity to be paid throughout the child \u2019s life . It also ordered the hospital to pay compensation for their nonpecuniary damage and the disruption to their lives .", "CARDINAL . Thus the ORG d\u2019Etat did not accept that a disabled child was entitled to compensation on the sole ground that the disability had not been detected during the mother \u2019s pregnancy . It did accept on the other hand that the parents of a child born with a disability were entitled to compensation and made an award not only in respect of their non - pecuniary damage but also in respect of the prejudice caused by the disruption to their lives and of pecuniary damage , specifying that the latter included the special burdens which would arise for the parents from their child \u2019s infirmity ( expenditure linked to specialist treatment and education , assistance from a helper , removal to a suitable home or conversion of their present home , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment did not attract particular comment and led to a line of case - law followed thereafter by the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The case - law of the ordinary courts was laid down by ORG on DATE ( PERSON . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , DATE , ORG . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , no . CARDINAL ) in a judgment which was widely commented on ( the PERSON judgment ) . In the PERSON case a woman had been taken ill with rubella at the start of her pregnancy . Having decided to terminate the pregnancy if the foetus was affected , she took tests to establish whether she was immunised against the disease . Because of negligence on the part of both her doctor and the laboratory , she was wrongly informed that she was immunised . She therefore decided not to terminate the pregnancy and gave birth to a child who suffered from grave disabilities resulting from infection with rubella in the womb . ORG held : \u201c Since the negligence on the part of the doctor and the laboratory in performing the services for which they had been contracted by PERSON prevented her from exercising her choice of terminating her pregnancy in order not to give birth to a disabled child , the child may claim compensation for the damage resulting from that disability and caused by the negligence found . \u201d", "Thus , contrary to the ORG d\u2019Etat , ORG accepted that a child born disabled could itself claim compensation for the prejudice resulting from its disability .", "In this case , therefore , account was taken of the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage suffered by both the child and the parents , including the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life .", "CARDINAL . It thus appears that in the same circumstances both ORG and the ORG d\u2019Etat base their approach on a system of liability for negligence . However , ORG recognises a direct causal link between the medical negligence and the child \u2019s disability , and the prejudice resulting from that disability for the child itself . The ORG d\u2019Etat does not recognise that link but considers that the negligence makes the hospital liable vis - \u00e0 - vis the parents on account of the existence of a direct causal link between that negligence and the damage they have sustained .", "Both lines of case - law allow compensation to be paid in respect of the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life . However , since the ORG d\u2019Etat considers that damage to have been sustained by the parents , whereas ORG considers that it is sustained by the child , there may be significant differences in the nature and amount of such compensation , depending on whether the case - law of the former or the latter court is being followed .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE was upheld several times by ORG , which reaffirmed the principle of compensation for a child born disabled , subject to proof where appropriate that the medical conditions for a voluntary termination of pregnancy on therapeutic grounds were satisfied ( PERSON . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , CARDINAL judgments of DATE , PERSON , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; see also PERSON . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , CARDINAL judgments of DATE , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON judgment drew numerous reactions from legal theorists , but also from politicians and from associations of disabled persons and practitioners ( doctors , obstetrical gynaecologists and echographers ) . The last - mentioned group interpreted the judgment as obliging them to provide a guarantee , and the insurance companies raised medical insurance premiums .", "CARDINAL . Both the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG took as their starting - point a system of liability for negligence . In NORP law , under the general rules on the question , the right to compensation for damage can be upheld only if the conditions for liability are first satisfied . That means that there must be prejudice ( or damage ) , negligence and a causal link between the damage and the negligence .", "More particularly , with regard to the liability of a public authority , for compensation to be payable the prejudice , which is for the victim to prove , must be certain . Loss of opportunity constitutes certain prejudice , provided that the opportunity was a serious one .", "In the present case the prejudice resulted from a lack of information , or inadequate or incorrect information , about the results of an examination or analysis . In such a case , before LAW was enacted , negligence falling short of gross negligence was sufficient . As to the relation between cause and effect , a direct causal link was established between the hospital \u2019s negligence and the GPE prejudice ( see the above - mentioned PERSON judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . Still in the sphere of administrative law , the amount of compensation is governed by the general principle of full compensation for damage ( neither impoverishment nor enrichment of the victim ) . Compensation may take the form of a capital sum or an annuity . According to the principle of the equal validity of claims for all heads of damage , both pecuniary damage and non - pecuniary damage confer entitlement to compensation .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE put an end to the position established by the case - law mentioned above , of both the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG alike . Its relevant parts provide as follows :", "\u201c I. No one may claim to have suffered damage by the mere fact of his or her birth .", "A person born with a disability on account of medical negligence may obtain compensation for damage where the negligent act directly caused the disability or aggravated it or prevented steps from being taken to attenuate it .", "Where the liability of a health - care professional or establishment is established vis - \u00e0 - vis the parents of a child born with a disability not detected during pregnancy by reason of gross negligence [ faute caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e ] , the parents may claim compensation in respect of their damage only . That damage can not include the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the life of the child . Compensation for the latter is a matter for national solidarity .", "The provisions of the present paragraph I shall be applicable to proceedings in progress , except for those in which an irrevocable decision has been taken on the principle of compensation .", "II . Every disabled person shall be entitled , whatever the cause of his or her disability , to the solidarity of the national community as a whole .", "III .

Admittedly , they bar inclusion of the damage consisting in the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life in the damage for which the parents can obtain compensation , and provide that such damage is to be made good through reliance on national solidarity . But the very terms of the PERSON , interpreted with the aid of its drafting history , show that ORG intended to exclude compensation for that head of damage on the ground that , although there was a causal link between negligence and damage , that link was not such as to justify making the person who committed the negligent act liable for the resulting damage . In providing that this type of damage should be made good by reliance on national solidarity , ORG did not therefore make implementation of the rules on liability for negligence which it had introduced subject to the enactment of subsequent legislation laying down the conditions under which national solidarity would be mobilised to assist disabled persons .", "It follows that , since the PERSON does not contain provisions for the deferred entry into force of section CARDINAL , and since in addition ORG \u2019s intention , as revealed by the PERSON \u2019s drafting history , was to make it applicable immediately , the provisions of LAW came into force under the conditions of ordinary law following the PERSON \u2019s publication in ORG of GPE .", "III .

It prevents children born with a disability which , on account of medical negligence , was not detected during pregnancy from obtaining from the person responsible for the negligent act compensation for the damage consisting in the special burdens arising from the disability throughout their lives , whereas such compensation had previously been possible under the case - law of the ordinary courts .
