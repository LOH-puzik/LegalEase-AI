NORP The applicant companies have their seat in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company PERSON has been publishing PERSON magazine since DATE . The magazine publishes DATE information about natural ORG taxable income and assets . This information is public according to NORP law . Several other publications and media companies also publish such information . The editor - in - chief of the magazine lodged an application with the ORG in DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the magazine appeared CARDINAL times and each issue concentrated on a certain geographical area of the country . Data on CARDINAL ORG taxable income and assets was published , which constituted at TIME all taxable persons in GPE . The magazine also published taxrelated articles and announcements .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company PERSON has worked in cooperation with the second applicant company , PERSON . The companies are owned by the same persons . In DATE the second applicant company , together with a telephone operator , started an ORG . By sending a person \u2019s name to a service number , taxation information concerning that person could be obtained if information was available in the database . The database was created using data already published in the magazine . Since DATE the second applicant company has also been publishing PERSON magazine .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG ( tietosuojavaltuutettu , dataombudsmannen ) contacted the applicant companies and advised them to stop publishing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE . Collecting data which was not to be published was not forbidden . The companies declined because they felt that this request violated their freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the ORG Ombudsman requested ORG ( tietosuojalautakunta , datasekretessn\u00e4mnden ) to order that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and to pass such data to an SMS - service . He claimed that , under LAW , the companies had no right to establish such personal data registers and that the derogation provided by the LAW concerning journalism did not apply to the present case . The collecting of taxation information and the passing of such information to third parties was not journalism but processing of personal data which the applicant companies had had no right to do .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request of ORG . It found that the derogation provided by LAW concerning journalism applied to the present case . As concerned the SMS - service , the data used in the service had already been published in PERSON magazine and the Act did not therefore apply to it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating his request that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation information in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and to pass such data to the SMS - service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that the derogation provided by LAW concerning journalism , which had its origins in Directive PERSON , should not be interpreted too strictly as it would then favour protection of privacy over freedom of expression . The court considered that PERSON magazine had a journalistic purpose and that it was also in the public interest to publish such data . The court emphasised , in particular , that the published data was public . The derogation provided by LAW concerning journalism thus applied to the present case . As concerned the SMS - service , the court agreed with ORG that , as the information had already been published in the magazine , the LAW did not apply to it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE ORG appealed further to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to request a preliminary ruling from ORG of ORG on the interpretation of Directive PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting in a ORG composition , gave its judgment ( see Case CCARDINAL/CARDINAL Tietosuojavaltuutettu v. PERSON and PERSON , judgment of DATE ( ORG ) ) . It found first of all that the activities in question constituted \u201c processing of personal data \u201d to which the Directive applied . Moreover , activities involving the processing of personal data such as that relating to personal data files which contained solely , and in unaltered form , material that had already been published in the media , also fell within the scope of the Directive . In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society , it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom , such as journalism , broadly . However , in order to achieve a balance between the CARDINAL fundamental rights , the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the Directive had to apply only in so far as was strictly necessary . In conclusion , activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings , relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under national legislation , could be classified as \u201c journalistic activities \u201d if their object was to disclose to the public information , opinions or ideas , irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them . They were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profitmaking purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the previous decisions and referred the case back to ORG . It requested ORG to forbid the processing of taxation data in the manner and to the extent carried out in DATE . The court noted first that the term \u201c journalism \u201d was not defined in Directive PERSON but that , according to ORG of ORG , it was necessary to interpret notions relating to freedom of expression , such as journalism , broadly . However , when balanced against the right to privacy , any derogations to the latter were to be kept only to what was strictly necessary . When balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy , the ORG had found that the decisive factor was to assess whether a publication contributed to a public debate or was solely intended to satisfy the curiosity of readers . ORG found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purposes could not be regarded as journalistic activity . The public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent seen in the present case , in particular as the derogation in LAW was to be interpreted strictly . The same applied also to the SMS - service .", "CARDINAL . The SMS - service was shut down after the decision of ORG was served on the applicant companies . The magazine continued publishing taxation data in DATE when its content was CARDINAL of the previous content . Since then the magazine has not appeared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and to forward this information to an ORG . The second applicant company was forbidden to collect , save or forward to an SMS - service any information received from the first applicant company \u2019s registers and published in PERSON magazine .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , after ORG had made its decision , ORG asked the applicant companies to indicate what measure they were envisaging to take in view of the ORG \u2019s decision . In their reply , the applicant companies asked ORG view on the conditions under which they could continue publishing public taxation data at least to a certain extent . In his reply ORG stated that , according to ORG decision , the applicant companies lacked the legal right to maintain their taxation database and to publish it , and reminded them of his duty to report any breach of LAW to the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant companies appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG which transferred the case to ORG . They complained that the decision violated the prohibition of censorship guaranteed by LAW as well as their freedom of expression . LAW provided better protection than the international human rights treaties as the latter did not prohibit censorship fully . According to the domestic law , it was not possible to prevent publication of information on the basis of the amount of information to be published or of the means used for its publication . Nor was it possible to use \u201c public interest \u201d as a criterion for preventing publication when preventive restriction of freedom of expression was concerned . Accepting that would mean that the authorities would be able to prevent publication , if they thought that the publication did not promote discussion of a topic of public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant ORG appeal . It found that , as far as the matter had been decided by ORG in its decision of DATE , it could not take a stand on the issue . In the latter decision ORG had stated that the case was not about the public nature of the taxation documents , nor about the right to publish such information . As the court was now examining only the decision rendered by ORG which was issued as a result of ORG decision of DATE , it could not examine the issues which ORG had excluded from the scope of its decision . As the ORG \u2019s decision corresponded to the content of ORG decision , there was no reason to change it .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant companies appealed further to ORG , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG . They noted in particular that the decision issued by ORG had prohibited the processing of taxation information for publishing purposes as well as requiring that the internal registers of the first applicant company be protected in a manner required by LAW . In practice the companies were prevented from collecting information for publishing purposes , which meant that there was an interdiction to publish such information . The companies noted that LAW also prohibited indirect preventive censorship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . It found that the case was not about the right to publish taxation information as such , nor about preventive censorship . On these grounds and the grounds mentioned in ORG reasoning , the court found that there was no reason to change the latter \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
