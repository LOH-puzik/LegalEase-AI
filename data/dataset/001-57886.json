ORG In DATE the applicant was convicted of the murder of a woman whom he had violently assaulted . He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment . At that time the doctor who examined him found no signs of mental illness or abnormality . In DATE he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the applicant killed a DATE woman who was placing flowers on a family grave in a GPE cemetery . He cut her throat with a knife . In DATE he pleaded not guilty to murder , but guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility . This plea was accepted by the court and in DATE a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The trial judge considered that a life sentence was appropriate in view of the extreme danger to the public which the applicant represented . The court , at the same time , revoked his life licence under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ; see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The applicant claims that he was informed in DATE by prison officers at FAC that he was subject to the regime for discretionary life sentences .", "CARDINAL .

By letter dated DATE to the applicant \u2019s Member of ORG , ORG gave the following information :", "\" In accordance with paragraph CARDINAL [ of LAW of LAW ] , the trial judge and Lord Chief Justice were consulted in DATE . In the light of their views , it was decided that [ the applicant \u2019s ] case should be referred to the local review committee , as the first stage in a formal review by ORG , in DATE .", "The local review committee considered the case at that time [ DATE ] and ORG considered it in DATE . ORG did not feel able to recommend [ the applicant \u2019s ] release and recommended instead that it should be referred to the local review committee ( as the first stage in a further formal review ) in DATE . This recommendation was accepted and [ the applicant ] was informed accordingly . He should have been told in DATE , but owing to an oversight at Gartree I am afraid that he was not informed until DATE . You will appreciate that I can not forecast what the outcome of the next review will be or say when [ the applicant ] might be released . When ORG consider [ the applicant \u2019s ] case in DATE the tariff will have been satisfied and the question of risk will be the overriding consideration . Indeed , ORG will have borne the question of risk in mind in making their recommendation as to the date of the next review . As you know , the safety of the public is paramount and no life sentence prisoner will be released if the assessment of risk is unsatisfactory , no matter how long he has been detained . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG He subsequently learned that the \" tariff \" period fixed by the trial judge in respect of his second offence expired in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below as regards the \" tariff \" period ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a ORG memorandum dated DATE the applicant was informed that the \" tariff \" in respect of his conviction in DATE had now been served and that his continued detention was based on the risk he represented .", "CARDINAL . ORG Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under ORG DATE . A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge . Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside ( see , in this connection , GPE PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no .

DATE , paras . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Prior to DATE , in respect of both mandatory and discretionary life sentences , the Secretary of ORG would receive the views of the judiciary ( the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice ) on the period deemed necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence ( \" the tariff period \" ) and of ORG on the question of risk . The Secretary of ORG would decide when , if at all , it was appropriate to release the prisoner on life licence .", "He accepted the views of the judiciary , in discretionary life sentence cases , as to the length of the tariff period .

CARDINAL , paras . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following the judgment of ORG in the case of GPE , PERSON and PERSON ( loc . cit . ) changes to the procedures for the release of discretionary life prisoners were introduced by LAW DATE ( \" the CARDINAL LAW ) . ORG decided , however , not to extend these changes to mandatory life sentences . Under LAW of this Act discretionary life prisoners are now informed by the trial judge , in open court , of the tariff period appropriate for the offence . After the expiry of that period , the prisoner has a right to be released on life licence if and when ORG decides that it is safe to do so . They are entitled to appear before the ORG in person , to see all the reports placed before it , and to call witnesses and submit documentary evidence . When the ORG decides that a prisoner should be released the Secretary of ORG is under a duty to do so ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of the DATE Act specifically excludes from eligibility for review under the new procedures a discretionary life prisoner who is also serving a mandatory life sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the debate in ORG on DATE concerning this legislation , the Minister of ORG for ORG made the following statement concerning the differences between mandatory and discretionary life sentences :", "\" Mandatory life sentence cases ... raise quite different issues and the Government do not agree that it is appropriate to extend a similar procedure to these cases . In a discretionary case , the decision on release is based purely on whether the offender continues to be a risk to the public . The presumption is that once the period that is appropriate to punishment has passed , the prisoner should be released if it is safe to do so .", "The nature of the mandatory sentence is different . The element of risk is not the decisive factor in handing down a life sentence . According to the judicial process , the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the ORG for the rest of DATE . If necessary , he can be detained for life without the necessity for a subsequent judicial intervention .", "The presumption is , therefore , that the offender should remain in custody until and unless the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner \u2019s release than by his continued detention . In exercising his continued discretion in this respect , the Home Secretary must take account not just of the question of risk , but of how society as a whole would view the prisoner \u2019s release at that juncture . The Home Secretary takes account of the judicial recommendation , but the final decision is his . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In relation to mandatory life prisoners , the Secretary of ORG continues to decide the length of the tariff after considering advice from the judiciary and any representations which the prisoner wishes to make . After the expiry of that period , he has power to release the prisoner on life licence if recommended to do so by ORG . The decision on whether to release is for him alone .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Secretary of ORG made a statement in ORG explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners .

ORG In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing review of mandatory life sentences , the LANGUAGE courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is , like the discretionary sentence , composed of both a punitive period ( the \" tariff \" ) and a security period . As regards the latter , detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner \u2019s risk to the public following the expiry of the \" tariff \" ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Bradley ( ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. ORG , ex parte ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v.

Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , ORG observed that , in contrast with the position as regards discretionary life sentences , the theory and the practice in respect of mandatory life sentences were out of tune .", "In his speech , with which the other Law Lords agreed , Lord PERSON explained that the policy whereby murder was treated as an offence so grave that the proper penal element of the sentence was detention for life was inconsistent with the practice adopted by successive Secretaries of State that a mandatory life sentence included a \" tariff \" period to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence . A mandatory life prisoner knew that once he had served the penal element of his sentence the penal consequences of his crime had been exhausted .", "Nevertheless , the Secretary of ORG was not obliged to adopt the judicial view of the \" tariff \" period and it was he who was entrusted with the task of deciding on the prisoner \u2019s release . He was entitled to depart from the judge \u2019s advice and to have regard to broader considerations of a public character than those which applied to an ordinary sentencing function . He added ( loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) :", "\" The discretionary and mandatory life sentences , having in the past grown apart , may now be converging . Nevertheless , on the statutory framework , the underlying theory and the current practice there remains a substantial gap between them . It may be - I express no opinion - that the time is approaching when the effect of the CARDINAL types of life sentence should be further assimilated . But this is a task for ORG , and I think it quite impossible for the courts to introduce a fundamental change in the relationship between the convicted murderer and the ORG , through the medium of judicial review . \"", "Lord PERSON considered that , having regard to the rights which discretionary prisoners had , the Secretary of ORG was required to comply with the following requirements of procedural fairness when fixing the penal element in a mandatory life sentence : the Secretary of ORG must inform such a prisoner of the judicial advice on the length of the \" tariff \" , and give him the opportunity to make written representations on that subject before he decides on the appropriate term of DATE . If the Secretary of ORG departs from the judicial advice , he must give reasons for doing so ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
