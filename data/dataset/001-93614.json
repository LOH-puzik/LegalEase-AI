After he left his office , the police , who had been informed about the event in advance , searched him and found the money .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments and noted that his conduct immediately after he accepted the bribe did not suggest an intention to report the matter to the police . Referring to the statements made by the witnesses at the trial , the court concluded that the applicant had not taken any steps to return the money to PERSON or to inform anyone . In support of its findings , it referred to the statement made by Mr. NORP , to whom the applicant had also failed to report the bribe . The court also found that the police had waited to see whether the applicant would report the bribe and had acted when there had been no reaction on his part . The penalty was determined on the basis of , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s behaviour at the trial , the fact that he had previously performed his duties in accordance with the regulations and his lack of a criminal record .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the whole incident had been planned in advance and that he had been incited to commit the offence by the police and PERSON , and , accordingly , had been the victim of entrapment . He complained that the trial court had not taken into consideration the statements of the QUANTITY witnesses who worked at the restaurant , who denied that anyone other than the applicant and PERSON had been present when the money had changed hands . The testimony of PERSON , who in addition to being PERSON business partner was also a relative , was therefore false .

The applicant further argued that the trial court had misinterpreted Mr D. \u2019s statement concerning his behaviour after he left the restaurant . In that connection , he requested that another person , Mr O. , be heard as a witness on the issue whether he had gone directly to his car or to his office after leaving the restaurant .

At a hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the trial court \u2019s verdict . It found that the trial court had correctly established the facts and applied the law . It had given sufficient reasons for its findings and these had been substantiated by the relevant evidence it had taken into consideration . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been entrapped by an agent provocateur ( PERSON ) and that he had not intended to keep the money , but to report the matter to the police . It noted that the applicant had told PERSON A. that he was changing his working methods and that instead of paying the examination fees to the laboratory , he could pay them directly to the applicant . It also held :", "\u201c ... if the applicant had had no intention of taking and keeping the money , he should have reacted immediately . On the contrary , in PERSON presence , he put the money in his pocket and said that it \u2018 ORG only the current shipment and that they would agree upon further shipments . After PERSON had left the restaurant , the applicant did not report the matter to the police or to anyone else . Indeed , he returned to his office and failed to inform Mr D. , his colleague , about the gift received from PERSON After TIME , he left the office and was arrested by the police . If his intention was not to keep the money , he could have made that clear by reacting in the restaurant , especially as there were restaurant employees present . Instead , he went to his office and failed to inform Mr NORP about the money ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the alleged presence of PERSON in the restaurant when the money was given to the applicant , ORG held :", "\u201c ... Whether Mr P. was in the restaurant during the conversation between the applicant and PERSON is irrelevant , as he had known about the earlier discussion between them and about the applicant \u2019s statement that they would find a new way of dealing with matters concerning the imports and samples . PERSON presence in the restaurant at the material time is irrelevant ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the written statements of the witnesses and the applicant \u2019s request for a further witness , Mr O. , to be examined , ORG held that the written statements had been examined by the trial court and were irrelevant to the final conclusion .", "CARDINAL .

In the requests , the applicant complained , inter alia , that the lower courts had based their decisions on evidence which should not have been taken into consideration , as it had been obtained as a result of the police incitement to commit the offence and PERSON role as an agent provocateur .", "CARDINAL . In a letter which was also sent by registered mail and received by the trial court on DATE , the applicant supplemented his extraordinary request , arguing that the facts as established by ORG contradicted the findings of the trial court , and that its finding that Mr O. had already been examined by the trial court was erroneous . He also alleged that ORG had not examined his appeal in full , in particular concerning the role of PERSON as an agent provocateur and the role of the police .", "CARDINAL .
