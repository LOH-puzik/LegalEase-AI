At the time of the events the applicant worked for the association \u201c GPE in Not \u201d , which offers legal and social support to asylum seekers and refugees .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , an amendment to a number of laws concerning the status of foreigners and of asylum seekers and concerning relevant proceedings ( Fremdenrechtspaket DATE ) was drafted and adopted by ORG . The amendments entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then Federal Minister for ORG , ORG , died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published a statement on the association \u2019s website entitled \u201c One less . What \u2019s coming now ? \u201d ( \u201c Eine weniger . Was kommt danach ? \u201d ) . It continued : \u201c The good news for DATE , Minister for torture and deportation , is dead . \u201d ( \u201c PERSON GPE : ORG , ORG f\u00fcr PERSON , ist tot \u201d ) After referring to some specific individual stories of asylum seekers , the text stated further that \u201c PERSON was a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country : completely desensitised , indifferent to the consequences of their laws and regulations , the compliant instrument of a bureaucracy contaminated with racism . No decent human is shedding tears over her death . \u201d ( \u201c L.P. war eine GPE , wie es viele gab in der grausamen Geschichte dieses Landes ; v\u00f6llig abgestumpft , gleichg\u00fcltig gegen die NORP ihrer Gesetze und GPE , ein willf\u00e4higes PERSON rassistisch verseuchten PERSON . PERSON anst\u00e4ndiger PERSON weint ihr eine Tr\u00e4ne nach . \u201d ) . The applicant concluded the text by suggesting that their goal for the New Year was to fight for a new minister who would make good the damage done by ORG so that GPE could return to being a country welcoming asylum seekers and a place where human rights were respected .", "CARDINAL . G.P. , the late Minister \u2019s husband , filed a private prosecution ( Privatanklage ) for defamation against the applicant and the association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) convicted the applicant of defamation in respect of the above - quoted passages of the statement and sentenced him to a fine in the amount of LAW . CARDINAL of the fine was suspended for DATE . It dismissed ORG \u2019s request for recognition of the association \u2019s liability for its employee \u2019s actions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that the average reader would understand the relevant passages of the statement to mean that ORG had ordered or tolerated the torture pending expulsion or the deportation of detainees and had violated human rights . The word \u201c torture \u201d , in particular , implied the intentional infliction of physical or psychological suffering . An average reader would also place the word \u201c deportation \u201d ( PERSON ) in the context of the historical events under the national - socialist regime which forcefully deported segregated groups of people to ghettos and camps to subject them to forced labour or extermination . The statement in question suggested that ORG exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way , that she was indifferent to officials\u2019 criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seekers and that her actions were motivated by racist , sadistic , xenophobic and national - socialist attitudes . The publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the media and the public . The applicant had been criticised as tactless and disrespectful . In response thereto , on DATE , the applicant published in a DATE newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comments had been directed solely towards ORG and he apologised to her family members , who were not responsible for the late Minister \u2019s inhumane policies .", "CARDINAL . ORG acknowledged that a criminal charge of defamation was at odds with the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Convention . It found that the voicing of opinions by refugee associations criticising politicians and their legislative projects represented an important corrective element and that the limits of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case . However , in the court \u2019s opinion , the published statement overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism . The legislative background to the amendment of the laws governing foreigners and asylum seekers and the fact that criticism was allowed to be shocking , still could not justify positioning ORG in a national - socialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical ill - treatment of detainees pending expulsion or \u201c deportations \u201d . Such accusations against the then only recently passed away PERSON \u2013 together with the acclamation of her death and the call on \u201c decent \u201d people not to mourn her passing DATE clearly went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism in a NORP society . Moreover , the allegations made by the applicant had not been proven to be true , nor had he shown any journalistic diligence in that regard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal on points of law and fact , and also appealed against the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Wien ) dismissed his appeal . Referring to the reasoning of the first - instance court , it conceded that the word \u201c deportation \u201d nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of \u201c expulsion or removal \u201d and was not only used in the context of the national - socialist regime , but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigners . However , the context of the word in which it had been used ( \u201c a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country \u201d ) acted as a reminder of the national - socialist history of the country . Therefore , even though the statements at issue were political value judgments ( \u201c politische Wertungen \u201d ) , the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegations . The applicant had further argued that , following the case - law of ORG and of the domestic courts with regard to LAW , the impugned statement was covered by freedom of expression . ORG , however , found that even such case - law did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparisons with the national - socialist regime without any factual basis .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for the renewal of the criminal proceedings ( \u201c PERSON des GPE ) pursuant to LAW with the aim of having the proceedings re - opened and the conviction set aside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request . It stated that the admittedly broad limits of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgments without any factual basis . Statements made in even heated political conflicts needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation . In the present case ORG found that the evaluation by the courts had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression . The value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of ORG had no factual basis . The courts had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy . However , the applicant \u2019s statements had not contributed to that public discussion , since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late Minister . The court further noted that the sanction imposed was , in view of the disrespectful statements and their temporal proximity to ORG \u2019s death , appropriate and even moderate .", "CARDINAL .
