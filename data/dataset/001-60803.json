In DATE the ORG took possession of the property , allegedly under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on nationalisation . The applicant was never informed of the grounds or legal basis for that deprivation of property .

R.P. appealed against that decision . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the appeal , quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and dismissed the applicant 's claim on the ground that the house had become ORG property pursuant to Decree no . ORG and that the courts did not have jurisdiction to review whether the decree had been properly applied to her . The court added that provision as to redress for any wrongful seizure of property by the ORG would have to be made in new legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested PERSON of GPE to lodge an application to have that final judgment set aside , submitting that it was unfair because the court had refused to examine whether Decree no .

On DATE the applicant lodged an application for restitution of the house with the administrative board established to deal with applications lodged in Ploie\u015fti pursuant to Law no .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG vested ownership of the flat rented by the applicant in her and awarded her financial compensation for the rest of the house and the land . Having regard to LAW no .

In a judgment of DATE the court dismissed the action on the ground that , by deciding to bring administrative proceedings , the applicant had acknowledged that the property had been nationalised with valid legal title and was consequently debarred from bringing an action for recovery of possession .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She stressed that she had consistently argued before ORG that her house had been wrongfully nationalised and that she had brought administrative proceedings under PERSON no . NORP because ORG had refused to examine her first action for recovery of possession . ORG dismissed her claim on DATE on the same ground as ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed her appeal in a final decision . It noted that the applicant had applied concurrently to ORG and the courts for restitution of the house and noted that the administrative proceedings had been adjourned . It concluded that the applicant , having chosen the remedy provided for in PERSON no . LANGUAGE , was now debarred from bringing an action for recovery of possession in the ordinary courts because that choice amounted to an implicit acknowledgment on her part that the nationalisation had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the applicant applied for the judgment of ORG to be set aside on the ground that ORG had denied her access to a tribunal for the determination of her action for recovery of possession . Her application was dismissed on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic legislation and case - law are set out in the ORG v. GPE judgment ( [ ORG ] , no .
