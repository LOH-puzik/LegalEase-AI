The reasons for the deterioration of the [ first applicant \u2019s ] health and the complications in the development of [ his ] disease were as follows : the delayed application of [ the first applicant ] to [ FAC ] for specific medical assistance ( since DATE ) , the seriousness of the main disease ( Aids ) , and the irregularities in his antiretroviral treatment ( there were refusals [ on his part ] to take the medication ) .", "CARDINAL .
