Fearing their intentions were hostile , the applicant had attempted to steer his bicycle away but had been struck by a taxi . He and his son had fallen to the ground . At that moment one of the CARDINAL men had started to shoot at him .

Following that attack the applicant was forced to sell his business because there was no one left in his family to manage the kiosk .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant alleged that he and his uncle had been shot because of their involvement in the distribution of the newspaper PERSON .

To support that claim , the applicant referred to the following incidents .", "CARDINAL . Publication of the \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem had ceased in DATE as a result of a wave of prosecutions brought against it by the ORG . Since first appearing in DATE , the newspaper had been the subject of several prosecutions , confiscation orders and temporary closure orders .

The Government maintained that there was no evidence to support the applicant \u2019s contention that members of the security forces were responsible for the attacks on the applicant and his uncle . In addition , they denied all allegations of ill - treatment by the ORG authorities . They said that the applicant had never officially complained to the relevant authorities that his attackers were agents of the ORG . Moreover , there was no evidence to support the applicant \u2019s allegation that a police officer had told him that it was in fact he who had been the target of his uncle \u2019s killers .", "CARDINAL . The Government refuted any allegation that there had been official intimidation of persons in any way connected with the sale of newspapers . They said that such newspapers were sold in CARDINAL of kiosks and were freely available throughout GPE . The Government acknowledged that on certain occasions particular editions of those newspapers had been confiscated ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the measures , which were neither arbitrary nor repressive , were always made on the basis of judicial decisions .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the allegations were of a width and character that would not be easily amenable to clarification from oral testimony , the ORG decided , after consulting the parties , to examine the allegations on the basis of the written materials submitted by the parties . The findings of the ORG can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that the facts at the heart of the application were not disputed . The applicant was shot at and seriously injured in an attack by CARDINAL men on DATE . His uncle , ORG , was shot and killed by a gunman on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that there was no evidence before it that proved beyond reasonable doubt that agents of the security forces or police were involved in the shooting of either the applicant or his uncle . It also found that the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning police obstruction at the hospital and ill - treatment in custody following his uncle \u2019s funeral had not been substantiated . However , having regard to \u201c appeals made for protection and protests made by Mr PERSON , [ a ] journalist and [ the ] owner of ORG , at ministerial level and to the considerable number of attacks on persons connected with that newspaper \u201d , the ORG found that the ORG had or ought to have been aware that those involved in its publication and distribution feared that they were falling victim to a concerted campaign tolerated , if not approved , by ORG agents ( see paragraph ORG report ) .", "CARDINAL . According to a police report dated DATE the shooting took place at TIME in NORP Street . CARDINAL empty cartridges and two bullet shells were taken for forensic examination , and a plan of the scene was drawn up . On DATE of the shooting the police recovered the applicant \u2019s pistol from his kiosk . They arrested LOC at the kiosk and CARDINAL taxi drivers , CARDINAL being the driver to whom the applicant had entrusted the pistol and the other being the driver who had taken it to the kiosk ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The police had then taken detailed statements from them .", "CARDINAL . In response to an enquiry of DATE from the security police , the hospital doctor recorded the following injuries to the applicant : CARDINAL bullet entry to the left gluteal region , CARDINAL bullet entry and exit to the middle left forearm , CARDINAL bullet scratch to the left index finger , CARDINAL bullet entry and exit on the middle front upper right arm between the elbow and axillary region and a bullet track slightly below the skin tissue , surfacing under the arm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the presence of his lawyer , the applicant had given a statement to the police in which he had described the attack . He stated that the assailants had intended to murder him because he ran a newspaper kiosk that mainly sold left - wing newspapers . He explained that , as there had been previous attacks on newsagents selling such papers , he had bought the pistol and had been carrying it with him for DATE before the attack ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A summary incident report dated DATE on the shooting , entitled \u201c crime record no . CARDINAL/C-CARDINAL \u201d , referred to the applicant as an injured suspect and stated that the other ( unidentified ) suspects were at large .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the ORG public prosecutor had requested the relevant security branch to investigate the attack on the applicant and to apprehend the suspects . On DATE the public prosecutor had also requested that ORG be kept informed of the progress of the inquiries DATE until the end of the statutory prescription period , namely DATE .", "CARDINAL . An expert ballistics report from the ORG regional criminal police laboratory dated DATE indicated that the cartridges found by the police at the scene of the shooting showed traces and marks identical to those in the shooting of CARDINAL other people in GPE on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . A preliminary investigation file no . DATE had been opened into the killing of FAC . According to an autopsy report dated DATE , CARDINAL bullet entry wounds had been found on ORG body , CARDINAL of which were fatal .", "CARDINAL . Following the shooting , the police had prepared a sketch of the scene of the incident and had taken statements on DATE from CARDINAL witnesses . According to PERSON , after hearing the shots , he had seen someone , whom he was unable to identify , running behind the people gathering in the street . PERSON , who ran a stall in the street , had heard but not seen the shooting . On reaching the scene , he had helped ORG , who was lying on the ground , get into a taxi so that he could be taken to hospital .", "CARDINAL . The record made by the police on questioning ORG son had indicated that although the boy had seen the assailant he had not recognised him . He said that the assailant \u2013 aged DATE and QUANTITY tall \u2013 had continued to fire at his father even though the latter had fallen to the ground after the first shot . The attacker had then made his escape .", "CARDINAL . An expert ballistics report dated DATE indicated that the bullet shells retrieved from the scene were too deformed for useful examination .", "CARDINAL . No other information concerning any investigative measures taken in relation to those incidents was included with the documents from the investigation file provided to the ORG . However , appended to the Government \u2019s written observations before the ORG was a letter which the public prosecutor attached to ORG had sent on DATE to the Minister of ORG in which he said :", "\u201c [ The ] allegation ... is wholly untrue . There are no gunmen working for the ORG in south - east GPE . In [ that ] region there are armed conflicts between armed organisations and conflicts arising out of the settling of scores within such organisations . The allegation that these incidents are attributable to the ORG and gunmen acting on its behalf is outrageous ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG , the applicant has produced a copy of a recent report by ORG within the Prime Minister \u2019s office . That confidential report ( \u201c the GPE report \u201d ) was initially intended to be only for the Prime Minister , who had commissioned it on DATE . After receiving the report in DATE , it would appear that the Prime Minister then made it available to the public , although CARDINAL pages from the body of the report and its appendices were withheld . The report continued to be the centre of attention in GPE while the ORG was considering the case .", "The introduction states that the report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigative report . It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events that had occurred mainly in south - east GPE which tended to confirm the existence of a tripartite relation involving unlawful dealings between political figures , government institutions and clandestine groups .", "The report analyses a series of events , such as murders carried out under orders , the killings of well - known figures or supporters of the NORP and deliberate acts by a group of \u201c informants \u201d supposedly serving the ORG and concludes that there is a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that had been formed as a result , particularly in the drug - trafficking sphere . The passages from the report that concern certain matters affecting radical periodicals distributed in the region are reproduced below .", "\u201c ... In his confession to ORG , ... PERSON ... had stated that PERSON ( page CARDINAL ) would say from time to time that he had planned and procured the murder of PERSON and other partisans from the mafia and the ORG who had been killed in the same way ... The murder of ... PERSON had also been planned and carried out by PERSON ( page CARDINAL ) .", "...", "Summary information on the antecedents of PERSON , who was of NORP origin , are set out below ( page CARDINAL ) .", "...", "As of DATE he was CARDINAL of the financiers of the newspaper PERSON . ... Although it was obvious who PERSON was and what he did , the ORG was unable to cope with him . Because legal remedies were inadequate the PERSON was blown up with plastic explosives and when PERSON started to set up a new undertaking , when he was expected to submit to the ORG , ORG decided that he should be killed and that decision was carried out ( page CARDINAL ) .", "...", "All the relevant ORG bodies were aware of these activities and operations . ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined , the difference between those NORP supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter presented in economic terms . ... The sole disagreement we have with what was done relates to the form of the procedure and its results . It has been established that there was regret at the murder of PERSON , even among those who approved of all the incidents . It is said that PERSON was not involved in any armed action , that he was more concerned with the philosophy of the matter and that the effect created by his murder exceeded his own real influence and that the decision to murder him was a mistake . ( Information about these people is to be found in Appendix CARDINAL ) . Other journalists have also been murdered ( page CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . The authorities\u2019 obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Offences may be reported to the authorities or members of the security forces as well as to the public ORG offices . The complaint may be made in writing or orally . If it is made orally , the authority must make a record of it ( LAW .", "If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes , members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge ( Article CARDINAL ) .

If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of DATE on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local ORG ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of the state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph DATE above ) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor \u2019s authority .", "CARDINAL .

Under these rules , the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL .
