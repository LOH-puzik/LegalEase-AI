He also submitted that prior to lodging this claim he had talked to the applicant over the telephone and had informed her of his intention to bring divorce proceedings . He had invited her to submit in writing any pecuniary claims she might have in relation to their common property ; however , the applicant had refused to discuss this issue . GPE also alleged that the applicant \u2019s last known place of residence had been their apartment in GPE and that , owing to their disagreements , he could not find out where the court summons should be sent to . Accordingly , GPE suggested that the applicant should be summoned to the hearing by a notice in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE District Court summoned the applicant to a divorce hearing by sending summons to her previous place of residence in GPE \u2013 the apartment in which she used to live with her husband GPE Upon receiving the information from post authorities that the applicant did not live at the above address , on DATE the applicant was summoned to the hearing scheduled for DATE with a notice in ORG . PERSON hearing was postponed at GPE \u2019s legal representative \u2019s request in order to present additional evidence . With a notice in ORG the applicant was summoned to a divorce hearing scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE GPE established that the applicant had been summoned to the hearing in accordance with the requirements of LAW . Therefore , it ruled that the adjudication of the case could take place in her absence . Owing to his poor health , GPE was represented by a lawyer who stated , inter alia , that ORG and the applicant \u2019s children lived in GPE . After hearing testimony from CARDINAL witnesses , who stated that they had not seen the applicant since DATE , the court granted the divorce . No appeal was brought against this judgment and it came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE married A.A. \u2013 one of the witnesses who had testified in the divorce proceedings .

The Government did not dispute this fact .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the applicant of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the PERSON and GPE of GPE ( ORG ) on DATE delivered a declaratory decision ( Feststellungsbescheid ) stating that the requirements for legal recognition of the judgment of GPE had not been met , as the divorced spouse had not been afforded an opportunity to present her case in the divorce proceedings . On the basis of the information before it , ORG established that GPE had been aware of the applicant \u2019s address in GPE . Notably , GPE had maintained contact with this address in general correspondence and in correspondence concerning the pension he had been receiving from GPE and the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following a prior request by the applicant , on DATE , the President of ORG submitted an application for supervisory review ( protests ) to the ORG of ORG asking for the judgment of GPE to be set aside and for the case to be adjudicated anew . He argued that the first - instance court had overlooked some evidence concerning the applicant \u2019s domicile and had erred in its application of the procedural rules when summoning the applicant to the hearings . In accordance with LAW have placed a notice about the proceedings in a newspaper in GPE , where the applicant resided . Besides , as GPE had been the applicant \u2019s registered place of residence , she should have been summoned to the proceedings via ORG .

On DATE the ORG of ORG , sitting in an extended composition , with a final judgment dismissed the supervisory review application and upheld the judgment of GPE . The ORG of ORG concluded that , since GPE \u2019s claim had not contained a reference to the applicant \u2019s address and since GPE had therefore been unaware of her whereabouts , its actions had been compatible with the procedural requirements of LAW . LAW imposed no obligation on the court ; it only gave the plaintiff a right to publish the court \u2019s summonses in other newspapers at his or her own expense . The ORG of ORG also stated that in the circumstances of the present case a reference to LAW could not serve as grounds for setting aside the judgment of the firstinstance court . It reasoned :", "\u201c The aim of the application for supervisory review \u2013 a fresh adjudication of the case permitting the defendant to exercise her procedural rights DATE can no longer be achieved because the plaintiff , [ GPE ] , passed away on DATE , a fact which excludes any further proceedings .", "Besides , one should bear in mind that following his divorce form PERSON [ GPE ] concluded a new marriage , which , according to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , could not be declared null and void , irrespective of whether the judgment of DATE of GPE would be quashed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties differ on whether GPE had been aware of the applicant \u2019s place of residence and on whether the applicant had been aware of the divorce proceedings . In relation to the first issue the applicant maintained that she had been residing in the couple \u2019s previous place of residence in GPE and that the landline telephone there had been used for their telephone conversations . Furthermore , GPE \u2019s retirement pension and health insurance had been transferred to their shared bank account , as well as to their place of residence in GPE . The Government , in turn , relied on the information GPE had submitted to GPE and also emphasised that no other evidence had been at the court \u2019s disposal .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s knowledge of the divorce proceedings the ORG pointed to PERSON \u2019s submissions before the ORG of ORG . In particular , PERSON had alleged that the applicant had been informed of the divorce proceedings over the telephone . The applicant maintained that even though she had been aware of ORG desire to dissolve their marriage , she had only learned of the divorce proceedings following the death of GPE", "CARDINAL .
