In deciding the appropriate sentences to impose , the judge also took into account CARDINAL other offences which Mr. PERSON had admitted to but which did not proceed to trial . At his trial , Mr. PERSON was represented by solicitors and counsel , under a legal aid order .", "CARDINAL . ORG The counsel who had represented Mr. PERSON at the trial advised him in a written opinion dated DATE that \" no prospect whatsoever exists of appealing the conviction successfully \" . Counsel came to a similar conclusion regarding an appeal against sentence . In counsel \u2019s view , \" the offences were serious and the property unrecovered . He had a substantial criminal record and had served several prison sentences for offences of dishonesty . A further prison sentence was inevitable and the length of sentence passed was equally inevitable \" .", "Notwithstanding this advice , Mr. PERSON went ahead and lodged an application seeking leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence . His application was signed by him on DATE and received by ORG on DATE . The gravamen of his application was premised on his view that witnesses who should have been called in his defence were not called . In his application , he acknowledged that he had read ORG , which is given to every prisoner contemplating an appeal to ORG and which states :", "\" Advice on appeal", "Loss of Time", "...", "If you are thinking about an appeal you should get advice . Your solicitors and counsel at the trial are best able to give it . If they advise that there are grounds of appeal and these grounds are settled and signed by counsel ORG will know that you had reasons to apply . It is useless to apply without grounds , or to try to invent them if there are none . Reasons are required - not a form of words .", "So it is important to get advice . If you can not get it , and put in an application without it , you should say why ... before setting out your own grounds . You may , if you wish , ask ORG to help you to get advice . But if your solicitor or counsel has advised against an appeal the ORG will not give you another solicitor for that reason only .", "If you apply without real grounds you might lose by it . Your application may go first to a single Judge who might refuse it and direct that part of the time in custody after putting in the notice of application shall not count towards your sentence . If you then abandoned the application that time would be lost , but only that time . If , however , you renewed the application to a ORG they might direct that you lost more time .

ORG also invited the solicitors to comment on the allegation made by Mr. PERSON in his application that a certain individual should have been called as a witness at his trial . In response , the solicitors forwarded a copy of counsel \u2019s adverse written advice and described their attempts to trace a large number of witnesses whom Mr. PERSON had initially intended to call in his defence . They explained that Mr. PERSON had later decided against calling most of the witnesses they had succeeded in tracing .", "The new solicitors sought legal aid in order , inter alia , to investigate the possibility of applying for a retrial because of additional evidence that could be obtained .

The judge allowed the request that the application be heard although it had been lodged out of time but refused leave to appeal and various ancillary applications made ( for legal aid , bail , leave to be present and leave to call witnesses ) . The judge gave the following written reasons , dated DATE , for his refusal :", "\" You were convicted by the jury upon ample evidence after a full and correct summing up by the judge .

When a person , in the light of advice of that kind and clearly without any ground whatsoever for challenging a conviction properly passed , wastes the time of the court by pressing on with his applications for leave to appeal as this applicant has done , it is right that the ORG should consider whether or not his time in prison should be extended .

The application for leave to appeal was received by ORG on DATE . The principal ground advanced by Mr. PERSON for arguing that the conviction was unsafe was that damaging statements had been obtained from him under duress whilst he was suffering from withdrawal from drugs .

In practice , leave for a person in custody to be present at the hearing of an application for leave to appeal will only be given in exceptional circumstances , and rarely where the application is being considered by a single judge .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Prior to DATE , the law had been that the time during which an unsuccessful application for leave to appeal was pursued was not in principle reckoned as part of the sentence but the applicant did not lose DATE unless ORG ordered otherwise . The ORG retained an overriding discretion to order that no time , or more or less time , should be lost in any particular case . In practice , the ORG rarely gave a special direction and the prisoner thus almost invariably lost DATE by operation of the relevant statute .", "The present rule was introduced in DATE - being re - enacted in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE - in implementation of recommendations made in DATE in a report prepared by an ORG on ORG Paper Cmnd DATE ) .

On DATE , the Lord Chief Justice ( Lord PERSON ) issued a Practice Direction drawing attention to the fact that the sheer volume of applications was leading to unacceptable delays which could not be tolerated in respect of applications which had merit ( DATE All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . He therefore announced that because facilities for advice on appeals were available to appellants , almost without exception , under the legal aid scheme , the single judge should have no reason to refrain from directing that time should be lost if he thought it right so to The stated aim of the exercise of the ORG \u2019s power in this manner was \" to enable prompt attention to be given to meritorious cases by deterring the unmeritorious applications which stand in their way \" . Within DATE the number of applications fell by MONEY to CARDINAL cases per month .", "CARDINAL .
