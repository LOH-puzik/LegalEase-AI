GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE PERSON , PERSON ( GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Until DATE the applicant was the executive president ( PERSON ) of a public limited company , PERSON , which collapsed in DATE . When ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of breach of trust and falsification of a balance sheet , the applicant left GPE and moved to GPE . During the criminal proceedings , the applicant was interrogated on DATE by the consular service ( konsularische GPE ) of ORG in GPE . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against him . During these proceedings the applicant had been represented by a lawyer , W , practising in GPE .", "On DATE a creditor company brought a civil action for damages against the applicant personally before ORG , claiming damages of CARDINAL ORG .", "On DATE ORG lodged a request to serve the writ on the applicant through the NORP diplomatic service ( GPE i m LAW ) .", "On DATE ORG made an attempt to serve the writ directly on the applicant following his interrogation in the criminal proceedings . According to the ORG the applicant refused to permit his lawyer W to accept the writ . According to the applicant , only W was informed of the writ , but the lawyer declined to accept it and consequently the applicant was not aware of the writ .", "Subsequently , the ORG referred the request to the NORP authorities for action , but the latter did not execute the request for service .", "On DATE the plaintiff requested ORG to serve the writ by public notification ( \u00f6ffentliche PERSON ) referring to information from the ORG according to which attempts to serve documents in GPE usually failed because the NORP authorities remained inactive .", "As it was not possible to have the writ served by the NORP authorities , on DATE ORG ordered service of the writ by public notification in the Federal Bulletin and on the court \u2019s notice board . It fixed a DATE time - limit for entering a notice of defence .", "On DATE the writ was published in ORG . Between DATE and DATE it was posted on the court \u2019s notice board .", "On DATE the DATE time - limit set by ORG for entering a notice of defence elapsed without any reaction from the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant by way of default judgment to pay the plaintiff damages amounting to CARDINAL ORG and fixed a DATE time - limit for filing objections ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the judgment was served by public notification on the court \u2019s notice board . It became final on DATE . The DATE time - limit fixed by ORG for filing objections elapsed on DATE .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer W asked the plaintiff \u2019s lawyer about the civil proceedings . On DATE he was informed that the civil proceedings had ended DATE with the default judgment .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against the default judgment before ORG and requested reinstatement of the proceedings . The applicant argued that ORG had no right to serve the judgment by public notification within the meaning of Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . As ORG knew his address it should have served the judgment by postal service in terms of LAW . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer PERSON stated that he did not wish to challenge the validity of the public notification of the writ , which in his view had been erroneous but valid ( er wende sich \u201c nicht gegen die obschon fehlerhafte , aber trotzdem wirksame \u00f6ffentliche GPE der GPE \u201d ) . His complaint was limited to a challenge to the validity of the public notification of the default judgment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection on the ground that the judgment had been validly notified ( by public notification ) , and that the public notification itself had been valid . ORG found that there had been no entitlement to postal service according to LAW as it was for the court , in its discretion , to select the method of service ( pflichtgem\u00e4\u00dfes PERSON ) once the conditions set out in LAW of LAW had DATE as in the applicant \u2019s case - been satisfied . It opted for service by public notification because postal service was disadvantageous to the applicant . Thus , LAW sentence CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that the relevant time - limit started to run from DATE on which the judgment had been posted . It was therefore likely that the time - limit for lodging an objection would have elapsed before the applicant received the default judgment . Moreover , postal service would be invalid if it transpired that the defendant \u2019s address had been incorrect . In such a case the court would have to re - serve by way of postal service , which was neither in the plaintiff \u2019s interest nor in the interest of legal certainty .", "At the same time , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for reinstatement because the applicant had failed to comply with Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure as he had lodged his application for reinstatement only on DATE , which was far more than one year after the expiry of the time - limit for objections on CARDINAL DATE . Moreover , the applicant had failed to comply with the DATE time - limit to lodge his request for reinstatement ( PERSON ) within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The court noted that on DATE W had been informed that the civil proceedings had ended DATE with the default judgment . Therefore , the applicant should have lodged his request for reinstatement in DATE .", "Finally , ORG pointed out that the applicant had missed the time - limits through his own fault . It considered that the applicant had been aware of the civil proceedings and the default judgment . Thus , ORG had tried to hand the writ over to the applicant at the end of his interrogation in ORG during the criminal proceeding , but he had refused to accept it himself and had forbidden to serve it on his lawyer PERSON if only W was informed of the writ on DATE , as submitted by the applicant , W was known to the court as a very diligent lawyer who would have informed the applicant about the existence of the civil proceedings even if he had only been mandated for the criminal proceedings . Therefore the applicant failed to comply with the requirement of Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure to appoint a person for service ( ORG ) to ensure the receipt of his mail .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal for the following reasons :", "First , the conditions for public notification in terms of Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure had been satisfied , given in particular that service abroad had proved to be impossible due to the NORP authorities\u2019 lack of cooperation in dealing with requests for service of judicial documents . In this respect ORG referred to the unsuccessful attempt of ORG to serve the writ on the applicant through the diplomatic service and to ORG communication of DATE which confirmed that requests to serve documents were often not executed by the NORP authorities .", "Secondly , it found that ORG had reasonably exercised its discretion to decide upon the type of service by striking a fair balance between the competing interests of legal certainty and the plaintiff \u2019s right to have justice administered ( Justizgew\u00e4hrungsanspruch ) , on the one hand , and the applicant \u2019s right to fair trial , on the other hand . Thus , postal service would have excluded the application of LAW of LAW and , hence , the possibility to apply a longer time - limit to lodge objections against the default judgment than the DATE time - limit provided for by LAW . Both service by public notification and postal service contained an assumption that the documents had been duly served ( Zustellungsfiktion ) . However , postal service entailed the additional risks for the plaintiff that the defendant \u2019s address was incorrect or that the latter had changed his residence . In circumstances as in the present case where the defendant deliberately left GPE and moved to a country which did not cooperate with GPE in judicial matters , it would be unfair to burden the plaintiff , who had no opportunity to verify the correctness of the defendant \u2019s address , with that risk .", "Thirdly , ORG relied on the ORG \u2019s information according to which the applicant had refused to permit his lawyer W to accept the writ . Thus , the applicant had been aware of the civil proceedings and could have participated in them . Moreover , ORG emphasized that the applicant produced the difficult situation himself by moving to a non - cooperative country without complying with his procedural obligation under LAW of LAW to appoint a person for service and , hence , to ensure the receipt of his legal documents .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal . It argued that the applicant could not invoke a violation of his right to be heard because he had explicitly accepted the validity of the writ \u2019s service by letter of CARDINAL DATE . In doing so he must be treated as if he had had the opportunity to appoint a person for service in terms of LAW of LAW .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving any reasons .", "Sections CARDINAL et seq . of ORG as in force at the material time governed the service of legal documents . Pursuant to LAW of LAW parties residing abroad were required to designate a person for service if they had no authorised legal representative who resided within the judicial district of the trial court . If the party failed to do so , the document could be served by post . In that case LAW sentence CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that the document was deemed to have been served at the moment in which it was delivered to the post office . According to the case law of ORG ( see decision of DATE , no . VI ZR CARDINAL ) the presumption of service ( Zustellungsfiktion ) did not apply in cases where the address of the recipient had been incorrect or incomplete .", "Section CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Civil Procedure as in force at the material time governed the service of documents abroad . As a general rule a court \u2019s request for service abroad of a judicial document should be effected either directly by the competent authority of the state addressed or through the diplomatic channel . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provided for that the document might be served by public notification ( \u00f6ffentliche PERSON ) if the service abroad had either proved impossible or was unlikely to be successful . Instead of ordering service by public notification , the domestic courts could , acting within their discretion , decide to serve the document by postal service pursuant to LAW of LAW . According to LAW a writ was considered to have been served DATE after the public notification in the Federal Bulletin ; a judgment was deemed to have been served DATE after the notification on the court \u2019s notice board .", "Section CARDINAL et seq . of LAW govern the reinstatement of proceedings . Section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the reinstatement of the proceedings is granted where persons , through no fault of their own , are prevented from complying with inter alia the time - limit for lodging an objection against a default judgment or for requesting the reinstatement of the proceedings . Pursuant to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure the application for reinstatement of the proceedings must be made within DATE from the moment in which the party becomes aware or should have become aware of the non - compliance with the respective time - limit . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure precludes applications for reinstatements which are made DATE after the relevant time - limit , such as the time - limit for lodging objections , had elapsed .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the DATE time - limit for lodging objections against default judgments starts to run with the service of the judgment . According to LAW the court fixes a time - limit for lodging objections if the service has to be effected abroad or by public notification .", "GPE is not a party to LAW , nor is there any bilateral agreement on the service of judicial documents between GPE and GPE . In the absence of any such agreement , requests for legal assistance from GPE are executed on the basis of reciprocity in GPE .", "The NORP administrative rules on mutual assistance in civil and commercial matters ( PERSON GPE ) provide guidelines for the domestic courts on how to deal with requests for mutual legal assistance . They also contain a country section which reports on the specific situation in the different GPE , including GPE .", "According to these rules , a NORP court which wishes to serve a document on a party in GPE may send a request through the diplomatic channel . Such request shall be sent to ORG in GPE which will refer the request to the NORP authorities for action . Members of ORG are allowed to serve documents directly , i.e. without the involvement of the NORP authorities , either on persons who reside in GPE or on persons residing outside the capital if the service may be effected on a representative ( Vertrauensperson ) . The administrative rules also allude to the long periods of time needed for the execution of such requests in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
