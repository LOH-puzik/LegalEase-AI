LAW that a complaint must be filed against a current and continuing interference by public authorities with the plaintiff \u2019s fundamental rights . This view is based on the fact that a complaint [ to ORG ] plays an important preventive role , namely as an effective remedy preventing an interference with fundamental rights and , in cases where such an interference has occurred , its role is to put an end to a violation of such rights .", "Therefore , in cases where it is obvious that no further delays can occur in proceedings at the moment when a complaint is filed with ORG ( even in cases where no final decision has been given ) , such a complaint can be rejected as being manifestly ill - founded . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides , inter alia , that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay .", "Prior to DATE there was no \u201c effective remedy \u201d within the ORG meaning in GPE as regards this right ( see , mutatis mutandis , NORP v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . MONEY , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "With effect from DATE , the LAW has been amended in that , inter alia , natural and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to LAW . Under this provision , ORG has the power , in the event that it finds a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay . It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional rights have been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings ( for further details see , e.g. , ORG and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , PERSON , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ) .", "It has been ORG practice to entertain complaints about excessive length of proceedings only where the proceedings complained of were pending at the moment when such complaints were lodged ( see , for example , decisions file nos . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL or ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "In proceedings file number I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined an individual complaint under LAW of delays in enforcement proceedings concerning a minor \u2019s claim for maintenance . The enforcement commenced in DATE in GPE ORG and , from DATE , continued in GPE I ORG where it was still pending . In a judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before both ORG and awarded the minor complainant non - pecuniary damages to be paid by both courts .", "In proceedings file number I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined a complaint by an individual under LAW of delays in proceedings in his civil action of DATE . The action was partially granted at first instance in DATE . That judgment was however quashed on appeal in DATE and the matter was remitted to the first instance court where it was still pending . In a judgment of DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before the first instance court and awarded the complainant non - pecuniary damages . ORG also examined the phase of the proceedings before the court of appeal but found no unjustified delays . A similar approach was adopted in proceedings number ORG .", "In proceedings file number III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined a complaint by an individual under LAW of delays in proceedings in a civil action against him . The action was lodged in DATE with ORG which , shortly after , transferred it to a ORG for reasons of jurisdiction . The action was then pending before ORG until DATE when ORG ruled that it should be determined at first instance by ORG . The action was eventually withdrawn and the proceedings were consequently discontinued by a final decision of DATE . In a judgment of DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings both before ORG and ORG . The complainant was awarded non - pecuniary damage to be paid by both courts .", "In proceedings file number PERSON . \u00daS PERSON ( decision of DATE ) , ORG took a different approach . The plaintiff complained to ORG , inter alia , about the length of proceedings concerning her maintenance . The action was originally filed with the PERSON ORG in DATE . The question arose whether the first instance and the second instance court judges were impartial . On DATE ORG decided that the question of impartiality of the judges at the first instance would be determined by ORG . The latter decided on DATE that the action would be examined at first instance by ORG which determined it on DATE . On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment . In her complaint to ORG of DATE the plaintiff alleged that the ordinary courts had violated her right to a hearing without undue delay . ORG declared this complaint manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated that , insofar as the complaint related to the part of the proceedings leading to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , it had been filed out of time since , at the moment of the introduction of the constitutional complaint , the relevant part of the proceedings was no longer pending . For similar reason ORG rejected the complaint in respect of the subsequent proceedings before ORG which had ended on DATE . As to the appellate proceedings before ORG , ORG noted that they had lasted DATE and found that this period was not excessive ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
