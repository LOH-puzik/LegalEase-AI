He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG opened a trial against the applicant and others , as members of a joint criminal enterprise , on charges of having induced a number of people to lodge falsified asylum applications in CARDINAL cases . After a dispute as to jurisdiction between ORG and ORG , on DATE ORG ordered ORG to carry on with the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG , ORG ( ORG ) sitting as a ORG ( ORG ) and presided over by Judge PERSON , who had been appointed to ORG DATE , convicted PERSON and R , CARDINAL NORP co - accused of the applicant , of having helped people in CARDINAL cases to lodge falsified asylum applications , S .- S. as a member of a joint criminal enterprise comprising , notably , the applicant . The proceedings against the co - accused had been severed after they had confessed to the offences . The applicant , who had been summoned as a witness in these proceedings , had refused to give evidence . The judgment contained references to the applicant \u2019s role in the offences . The main passages in this respect read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON had the idea of helping asylum seekers , against payment of a considerable fee , to increase their prospects of success by submitting false statements . ... PERSON had told the accused , LAW , about a secret organisation called \u2018 the NORP Movement\u2019 ( \u2018 the ASM\u2019 ) , founded in GPE , but also active in GPE and other NORP countries . According to PERSON , he was a high - ranking member of this organisation . ... The accused , S .- S. , did not doubt the truth of PERSON \u2019s story and assumed that the ASM actually existed ... The chamber did not investigate whether the ORG really existed or whether it was just a sham organisation . According to PERSON , the prospects of success of an application for asylum could be increased if the applicant referred to his or her membership of the ORG , as well as to the holding of senior office within it . ... According to PERSON \u2019s plan , membership certificates , as well as documentation regarding the holding of senior office , should be submitted in the asylum proceedings by the accused , NORP , on stationery seemingly from the ASM and signed by him [ PERSON ] , PERSON , who is also being prosecuted , and the accused , PERSON ... According to PERSON \u2019s plan , the applicants would pay fees of MONEY for such assistance in the asylum proceedings . ... First of all , a counselling interview was arranged with each applicant . During this interview , in which PERSON , and , in some cases , the accused , PERSON , took part , the applicant seeking help was informed about the requirements of a successful application for asylum . ... In all the cases which are the subject of the verdict , PERSON and the accused , PERSON , invented posts in senior positions within the ASM which were allegedly held by the asylum seekers . In order to prove the alleged position of the applicants to the administrative authority or the administrative court PERSON , using a computer , developed a standard form . ... This statement was then stamped \u2018 NORP Movement\u2019 . This stamp had been designed by PERSON , who had also had it made . The statements were usually signed by PERSON . ... Furthermore , PERSON created another statement [ donation receipt ] . ... This statement was signed either by the accused , LAW , as secretary general or , once PERSON no longer held this position , by ORG as secretary general and by PERSON , who is also being prosecuted ... In DATE , at the request of ORG , the accused , R , agreed to handle the applications of the members of the ASM . ... When further enquiries needed to be made , the accused , NORP , contacted PERSON and PERSON rather than the asylum seekers . \u201d", "In the subsequent summaries of the different cases of falsified asylum applications the applicant was generally referred to as \u201c the separately prosecuted \u201d ( der gesondert Verfolgte ) . Regarding the criminal liability of the accused S .- S. ORG found that she had acted as a member of a joint criminal enterprise and had conspired with the separately prosecuted GPE and PERSON to commit such crimes in the future . Regarding the sentence of GPE the trial court took into consideration , inter alia , that together with the other members of the joint criminal enterprise she had \u201c taken advantage of the vulnerable situation of the asylum seekers \u201d .", "The judgment did not include an assessment of evidence because it had become final and could therefore be abridged by virtue of LAW ( see \u201c B. Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . From the circumstances , which were found to be decisive in assessing the penalty , it follows , however , that both co - accused had confessed to the offences with which they had been charged .", "On DATE the trial against the applicant continued before a ORG sitting as a ORG and Judge PERSON presiding . Throughout the proceedings , the applicant lodged numerous applications for the removal of ORG and other judges of ORG from sitting in the case on grounds of bias : DATE he submitted CARDINAL such applications . Inter alia , on DATE he alleged that PERSON had already determined the extent of the applicant \u2019s involvement in the offence ( PERSON ) with the judgment against the co - accused so as to be able to convict him more easily . ORG , including PERSON , dismissed the application on DATE as inadmissible , finding that it contained no evidence of bias . In his application dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant challenged Judge PERSON , inter alia , because he had participated in the proceedings against the CARDINAL co - accused . On DATE this application was dismissed as having been lodged late ( versp\u00e4tet ) .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of participating in a joint criminal enterprise to induce asylum seekers to lodge falsified asylum applications in CARDINAL cases and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . CARDINAL of these cases had also led to the conviction of the co - accused . The applicant \u2019s conviction was based , in particular , on the testimony of the former co - accused LAW , the witness statements of the individual asylum seekers and relevant documents . The applicant had exercised his right not to testify . The judgment comprised CARDINAL pages and contained a detailed assessment of the evidence before the court , in particular also regarding the credibility of ORG statements . As regards the description of the circumstances of the offence , the statement of facts contained similar and partly identical wording to the statement of facts in the judgment against the co - accused .", "The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG in which he submitted , inter alia , that PERSON should have been excluded from sitting in the case by operation of law , namely by application of LAW ( see \u201c B. Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) mutatis mutandis , since he had sat on the bench trying the case against the co - accused . In its reply ORG office pointed out that LAW could not be applied mutatis mutandis in this situation . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill founded .", "In the constitutional complaint dated DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer gave an account of the preliminary investigation proceedings and the trial against his client . Regarding the merits he firstly maintained that the criminal provisions the conviction was based on were unconstitutional . He further alleged that PERSON had been appointed to ORG specifically for the trial against the applicant . Also , after having presided over the trial of the co - accused PERSON should have been excluded from the applicant \u2019s trial by operation of law . It was further submitted that PERSON had lacked the necessary impartiality . At the trial against the co - accused , which was linked to the applicant \u2019s trial , PERSON had determined the extent of the applicant \u2019s participation in the offences . Because the CARDINAL proceedings dealt with the same offences and the same offenders the applicant alleged that F. could not view him with the necessary neutrality , objectivity and distance . He finally submitted that", "\u201c a realistic examination of the procedural provisions concerning exclusion of judges ipso jure , taking into consideration the values of LAW and established knowledge in the area of psychology , leads to the conclusion that it is no longer appropriate that LAW of Procedure assumes that an issue of bias will not generally arise if a trial judge has previously participated in a decision related to the proceedings at hand . \u201d", "The applicant submitted that ORG \u2019s bias was evidenced in particular by the dismissal of all of his applications for the removal of judges from sitting in the case as inadmissible .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It held that the applicant had not sufficiently substantiated the complaint that ORG should have been legally barred from adjudicating on his case because he had been involved in criminal proceedings directly related to it . By claiming that PERSON had participated in the proceedings against him contrary to LAW ( see \u201c B. Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) he had simply reiterated the submissions he had made before ORG . ORG further reasoned :", "\u201c ... the applicant failed to demonstrate that the decision not to consider the presiding judge to be legally barred from sitting in his case DATE thus applying a narrow interpretation of LAW had been arbitrary , i.e. based on an interpretation and application of LAW which was not legally arguable under any aspect of the provision . \u201d", "On DATE the second set of proceedings ( opened in DATE before ORG ) against the applicant for having induced a number of people to lodge falsified asylum applications in CARDINAL more cases were provisionally stayed in accordance with LAW of LAW ( see \u201c B. Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) in view of the prior conviction of the applicant .", "From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when the arrest warrant was quashed and the applicant released , the applicant was placed in pre - trial detention for the first time on suspicion of having committed the asylum related offences with which he had been charged in the first set of proceedings . On DATE ORG found that the applicant \u2019s prolonged detention , as ordered by ORG on DATE , had violated his right to liberty .", "On DATE ORG , having consulted CARDINAL doctors , ordered the applicant \u2019s second arrest and detention , finding that he had intentionally rendered himself unfit to plead by taking an overdose of analgesics . On DATE the ORG quashed the arrest warrant and the applicant was released . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s right to liberty , having regard to the overall length of his detention , now prevailed over the ORG \u2019s interest in securing the proper continuation of the proceedings . On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant .", "On DATE by which date the applicant had still not appeared for trial \u2013 ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest on the ground that he might attempt to flee and confirmed this arrest warrant when delivering a judgment on DATE . On DATE ORG quashed the arrest warrant .", "On DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant in respect of the other offences with which the applicant had been charged in the second set of proceedings . It argued that he was likely to flee if released owing to the considerable sentence he risked being given if convicted and considering that he had already tried to evade trial by deliberately rendering himself unfit to plead and by fleeing to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested when re - entering GPE and detained for a third time .", "On DATE , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , ORG upheld the arrest warrant of DATE . On CARDINAL May and DATE ORG declined to consider constitutional complaints lodged by the applicant in this regard .", "On DATE ORG quashed the arrest warrant of DATE .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A judge who has participated in a decision which has been contested on appeal shall be barred by law from participating in the decision of a higher level of jurisdiction .", "( CARDINAL ) A judge who has participated in a decision contested by an application for reopening of the proceedings shall be barred by law from participating in decisions in the proceedings to reopen the case . If the contested decision has been given at a higher level of jurisdiction , a judge who has participated in an original decision at a lower level shall be barred . The first and second sentences shall apply mutatis mutandis to the participation in decisions to prepare the reopening of the proceedings . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A judge may be challenged both where he is barred by law from exercising judicial office and on grounds of bias .", "( CARDINAL ) A challenge on grounds of bias shall be justified if there is reason to doubt the impartiality of a judge . ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A challenge to a judge shall be rejected by the court as being inadmissible if :", "CARDINAL . the challenge is not made in time ;", "CARDINAL . there is no disclosure of the ground for the challenge or of the means by which the challenge could be substantiated ...", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall give its decision rejecting the challenge pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL without the judge in question being excluded from the bench . ... \u201d", "\u201c ...", "( CARDINAL ) Once proceedings have been instituted , the court may provisionally stay them at any stage at the request of ORG .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) If the proceedings have been provisionally terminated on account of a penalty or measure of reform and prevention which is to be expected for another offence , the proceedings may be resumed , unless barred by limitation in the meantime , within DATE after the judgment imposed for the other offence has entered into force .", "( CARDINAL ) If the court has provisionally terminated the proceedings , a court order is required for their resumption . \u201d", "\u201c ...", "( CARDINAL ) If all parties entitled to lodge an appeal waive their right of appeal or if no appeal is lodged within a certain time - limit , the proven facts establishing the statutory elements of the criminal offence and the criminal provision applied must be indicated ; ...
