The Government disputed these assertions .", "CARDINAL . At DATE a process of democratisation commenced in GPE . Soon thereafter some NORP believers and activists of the NORP religion in the country sought to replace the leadership of their religious organisation .

Following these events Mr GPE , who claimed that he remained Chief Mufti of NORP , challenged the decision of DATE before ORG . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal . The court found that the decision of ORG was not subject to judicial appeal . The ensuing petition for review , submitted by PERSON against ORG decision , was examined by a CARDINAL - member ORG . On DATE the ORG dismissed the petition . While confirming the rejection of Mr PERSON 's appeal , the ORG also discussed the merits of the appeal . It found , inter alia , that the ORG 's decision to declare Mr LANGUAGE 's election null and void had been within its competence . In so far as the impugned decision had also proclaimed \u201c the removal \u201d of PERSON LANGUAGE from his position of Chief PERSON , this had been ultra vires . However , it was unnecessary to annul this part of the ORG 's decision as in any event it had no legal consequences .", "CARDINAL .

It elected Mr PERSON ( the first applicant ) as Chief Mufti of NORP and also approved a new LAW in GPE ( \u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u044e\u0441\u044e\u043b\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432 GPE ) . On DATE ORG registered the statute and the new leadership in accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . While the leadership dispute between Mr NORP and PERSON continued , the official position of ORG , throughout DATE and DATE , remained that the first applicant was the legitimate Chief Mufti of NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to PERSON urging him to organise a national conference of all NORP to solve certain problems arising from irregularities in the election of local religious leaders . The irregularities in question apparently concerned alleged inconsistencies with the internal statute of the NORP religious organisation , and not breaches of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supporters of PERSON held a national conference . The conference proclaimed itself the legitimate representative of NORP believers , elected an alternative leadership and adopted a statute . Mr PERSON was elected President of ORG . After the conference the newly elected leaders applied to ORG for registration as the legitimate leadership of NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG presided over by the first applicant decided to convene a national conference on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , parliamentary elections took place in GPE . ORG ( ORG ) obtained a majority in ORG and formed a new government , which took office in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to the first applicant in his capacity of Chief Mufti urging him to postpone the conference . The letter stated , inter alia :", "\u201c As ORG was concerned with [ the ] irregularities [ as regards the election of local muftis ] as early as DATE , it repeatedly ... urged the rapid resolution of the problems ... Unfortunately no specific measures were undertaken ... As a result the conflicts in the religious community deepened , and discontent among NORP increased , leading to the holding of an extraordinary national conference on DATE . This brought to light a new problem , related to the shortcomings of the statute of the NORP religious community ... [ The statute ] does not clarify the procedure for convening a national conference ... Issues concerning the participants , and the manner in which they are chosen ... , are not regulated .", "Therefore , for the executive branch of the ORG it becomes legally impossible to decide whether the national conference is in conformity with the statute [ of the NORP religion ] and , accordingly , whether its decisions are valid . These decisions , quite understandably , could be challenged by some of the NORP in GPE . Any other national conference , except one organised by a joint committee [ of the rival leaderships ] , would raise the same problem . Moreover , the decision of DATE of ORG to hold an extraordinary national conference on DATE is signed CARDINAL legitimate members of ORG ... [ and ] ... can not be regarded as being in conformity with the statute .", "ORG can not disregard the findings of the [ Chamber of the ] ORG in its decision of CARDINAL [ DATE . It is mentioned therein that the ORG had acted ultra vires when removing Mr LANGUAGE from his position of Chief PERSON and that the decision of ORG DATE could not have legal consequences .", "Extremely worried as regards the current situation and deeply concerned over the well - being of the NORP in GPE , ORG supports the opinion of the Chief Mufti [ the first applicant ] that it is not advisable to rush ahead with the holding of an extraordinary conference before overcoming the conflicts in the religious community ...", "Firmly convinced that the disputed questions in the religious community should not be decided by administrative means by the executive branch of the ORG ... the ORG appeals to you to show good will and reach a consensus for the holding of a united conference ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG presided over by PERSON announced that it had postponed the national conference until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , Deputy Prime Minister of GPE , issued Decree R-CARDINAL , which reads as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with Decree KV-CARDINAL of DATE of ORG read in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW , I approve the statute of the NORP religion in GPE , based in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The statute of the NORP religion in GPE mentioned in the decree was apparently the one adopted at the rival national conference , organised by PERSON and held on DATE . Decree KV-CARDINAL , referred to in Decree R-CARDINAL , determined that Deputy Prime Minister PERSON should be in charge of supervising the activity of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision which stated that , in accordance with sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of LAW and Decree RCARDINAL of the Deputy Prime Minister , it had registered a new leadership of the NORP community . The leadership thus registered included Mr LANGUAGE as President of ORG and , apparently , those elected at the conference of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Neither Decree R-CARDINAL nor the decision of ORG gave any reasons or any explanation regarding the procedure followed . The decisions were not formally served on PERSON , who learned about them from the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newly registered leadership of the NORP community accompanied by private security guards entered the premises of the Chief Mufti 's Office in GPE , forcibly evicted the staff working there , and occupied the building . The applicants submit that the police , who arrived after the surprise action , immediately stepped in to protect the new occupants of the building . Following the action of DATE the new leadership took over all documents and assets belonging to the religious organisation of NORP in GPE and , in DATE which followed , in various other towns in the country . ORG allegedly sent letters to the banks where the NORP religious organisation had its accounts , informing them of the change of leadership . In DATE several municipalities , allegedly upon the instructions of the ORG , registered new regional muftis . Also , the staff of the Chief ORG and CARDINAL NORP teachers , the second applicant among them , were allegedly dismissed de facto as they were prevented from continuing their work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately after the take - over , the first applicant submitted to ORG ( ORG \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 ) a request for assistance , stating that there had been an unlawful mob action and that the persons who had occupied the building of the Chief Mufti 's Office were squatters who had to be evicted . By decisions of CARDINAL and DATE the prosecuting authorities refused to take action . They found , inter alia , that the new occupants of the building had legal grounds to stay there as they were duly registered by ORG and represented the religious leadership of the NORP community in the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , apparently in reply to a request from the first applicant , ORG sent him , in his capacity as a private person , a letter which stated , inter alia :", "\u201c The NORP religious community in GPE ... has , in DATE , repeatedly changed its statute as concerns its organisational structure ... , but never as regards its religious foundation . Decree R-CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ... sanctions an [ organisational ] change , which the religious community itself wished to undertake ... \u201d", "This letter was apparently the first document originating from the competent ORG bodies which implied clearly that the statute of the NORP religious community approved by Decree R-CARDINAL had replaced the previous statute and that the new registered leadership had replaced the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , acting on behalf of the Chief ORG which he headed , lodged an appeal against Decree R-CARDINAL with ORG . He stated that , on the face of it , Decree R-CARDINAL stipulated nothing more than the registration of a new religious organisation . However , from the decisions and the letter of ORG which had followed , it had become clear that what had taken place was the replacement of the statute and the leadership of an existing religious denomination . Furthermore , it transpired that the motivation behind this act had been the understanding that the NORP religion in GPE could have only one leadership and CARDINAL statute . The ORG did not have the right to impose such a view on NORP , multiple religious organisations of one and the same religion being normal in other countries , as in GPE . Therefore ORG had acted beyond its powers . The resulting interference in the internal disputes of the NORP religious community was unlawful . At the oral hearing held by ORG the first applicant also stated that there had been an unlawful interference with NORP ' religious liberties , as enshrined in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also submitted that the conference of DATE had been organised by people outside the NORP religious organisation over which he presided . Accordingly , they could register their own religious organisation but could not claim to replace the leadership of another . The second applicant asked ORG either to declare Decree R-CARDINAL null and void as being against the law , or to declare that it constituted the registration of a new religious community , the existing NORP organisation being unaffected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court stated that under LAW enjoyed full discretion in its decision as to whether or not to register the statute of a given religion . ORG jurisdiction was therefore limited to an examination of whether the impugned decision had been issued by the competent administrative organ and whether the procedural requirements had been complied with . In that respect Decree R-CARDINAL was lawful . As regards the request for interpretation of Decree R-CARDINAL , it was not open to ORG , in the framework of those particular proceedings , to state its opinion as to whether it had the effect of creating a new legal person , or introducing changes , and whether after this decision there existed CARDINAL parallel NORP religious organisations .", "CARDINAL . NORP The national conference of NORP in GPE organised by Mr PERSON took place as planned on DATE . TIME of the conference establish that it was attended by CARDINAL persons , of whom CARDINAL were official delegates with voting rights . These were representatives of CARDINAL local chapters and of the central leadership . The conference adopted some amendments of the statute of the NORP community and elected its leadership . The first applicant was re - elected Chief Mufti .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , acting as Chief PERSON , submitted a petition to ORG requesting the registration of the new statute and leadership of NORP in GPE , as adopted by the conference of DATE . On DATE he repeated the request . However , there was no response from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first applicant appealed to ORG against the tacit refusal of ORG to register the decisions of the DATE conference .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It noted that in DATE the Chief ORG as represented by PERSON had been duly registered as a religious denomination under LAW and had thus obtained legal personality of which it had not been subsequently deprived . Therefore ORG was under an obligation , pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , to examine a request for registration of a new statute or of changes in the leadership in the existing religious denomination . Accordingly , ORG ruled that the tacit refusal of ORG had been unlawful and ordered the transmission of the file to ORG , which was required to examine it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Deputy Prime Minister PERSON refused to register the DATE statute and leadership of the Chief ORG as represented by PERSON . He sent him a letter stating , inter alia , that ORG had already registered a leadership of the NORP community in GPE , which was that elected by the DATE conference with Mr GPE as President of ORG . The Deputy Prime Minister concluded that the first applicant 's request \u201c [ could not ] be granted as it [ was ] clearly contrary to the provisions of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , acting as Chief Mufti , appealed to ORG against the refusal of the Deputy Prime Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that refusal on the ground that it was unlawful and contrary to LAW . The refusal constituted \u201c an unlawful administrative intervention into the internal organisation of [ a ] religious community \u201d . ORG again ordered the transmission of the file to ORG for registration .", "CARDINAL . Despite ORG judgments ORG did not grant registration to the religious leadership headed by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the government of ORG stepped down and an interim cabinet was appointed . At the general elections which followed in DATE ORG obtained a majority in ORG and formed a new government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant again requested ORG to register the DATE statute and leadership . There followed informal contacts between the NORP leadership of PERSON and representatives of the government . The applicants were allegedly told that the government would only agree to register a new leadership of the NORP if it was elected at a unification conference .", "CARDINAL . ORG urged the CARDINAL rival leaderships of PERSON and of PERSON to negotiate a solution . On DATE the leadership headed by PERSON decided to accept the holding of a unification conference under certain conditions . A CARDINAL - member contact group was appointed to hold negotiations . On DATE representatives of the CARDINAL rival leaderships signed an agreement to convene a national conference of all NORP believers on DATE . The agreement , which was also signed by Deputy Prime Minister PERSON and ORG , provided , inter alia , that the parties would not obstruct the unification process , failing which the ORG would take appropriate administrative measures . In addition , the leadership of PERSON PERSON undertook not to dispose of any NORP property or assets before the conference .", "CARDINAL . ORG took an active part in organising the national conference . The mayors in many localities distributed to the local chapters forms bearing the seal of the ORG . These forms were filled out at the meetings of the local chapters which elected delegates to the national conference and were certified by the mayors ' signatures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL delegates attended the conference . Only delegates whose election had been certified by the mayors were allowed to participate . The conference adopted a new statute of the NORP denomination in GPE and elected a new leadership comprising members of the leadership of PERSON and others . PERSON apparently attended the conference and approved of the new leadership . CARDINAL leaders of the group led by him were elected to the new ORG . PERSON was not among them . On DATE the government registered the newly elected leadership .", "CARDINAL . Although the religious community which accepted Mr PERSON 's authority was involved in the unification process , Mr PERSON himself and some of his supporters did not sign the agreement of DATE and did not attend the conference , considering that it was manipulated by the ORG . The conference voted a resolution authorising the new leadership to conduct an audit and seek the prosecution of PERSON for alleged unlawful transactions .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , who claimed that he remained the Chief Mufti , appealed to ORG ( NORP \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) against the government 's decision to register the new leadership . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the appeal as being inadmissible . It found that the Chief Mufti 's Office of Mr Gendzhev had no locus standi to lodge an appeal as it had never been validly registered . Decree R-CARDINAL of DATE had been signed by Deputy Prime Minister PERSON , who had not been duly authorised by ORG . Decree KV-CARDINAL did not contain an express authorisation for the Deputy Prime Minister to approve the statutes of religious denominations . As a result the Chief ORG of Mr Gendzhev had never legally existed and all its acts DATE were null and void .", "CARDINAL .

An assessment as to whether there is such a case may also be undertaken at the time of registration of a religious community or institution .", "CARDINAL .

The Act also lays down rules regarding the activities of a religious denomination , imposes requirements as regards its clergy and gives ORG certain supervisory functions . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG , while agreeing that certain provisions of LAW were clearly unconstitutional , found that it was not its task to repeal legal provisions adopted prior to the entry into force of LAW , the ordinary courts being competent to declare them inapplicable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contended that as a consequence of the provisions of section CARDINAL of the LAW , and since there is no public register for recognised religious denominations , in practice a religious community can establish its existence as a legal entity only by producing a copy of a letter or a decision to that effect issued by ORG . The same applies to the leader of a religious denomination when he needs to provide accreditation .", "CARDINAL . Under Decree no .
