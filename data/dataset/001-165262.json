CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Entry and Residence of Aliens and Right of Asylum Code provides , by way of exception to the cases where a foreign national may be placed in detention , the possibility of ordering a measure of restricted residence ( assignation \u00e0 r\u00e9sidence ) if the alien can present guarantees to allay the risk of non - compliance with his or her obligation to leave GPE . Under provision CARDINAL of part II of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the same LAW , such risk must in particular be regarded as established , save in specific circumstances , in cases where the alien has already evaded the execution of a removal measure . The finding by the administrative authority of facts falling within provision CARDINAL of part II of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL , while it is such as to create a presumption of a risk that the alien might fail to comply with his or her obligation to leave GPE , does not dispense that authority , before any decision to place him or her in detention , parents of minor children and who do not have sufficient guarantees of compliance , such aliens being provided for by LAW , and in accordance with the aims of LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC , recourse to placement in detention can only constitute an exceptional measure in cases where the alien does not have a stable place of abode at the time when the prefectoral authority takes the necessary measures to prepare for the removal .", "CARDINAL .

The measure may be extended by ORG under the same conditions as the extension of the administrative detention provided for in chapter II of title V of the present book.\u2019", "CARDINAL .

It does not appear from the decision appealed against that the prefect had considered , having regard to the presence of a child , whether a less coercive measure than detention was possible for the necessarily short duration of the removal procedure . In those conditions , his decision was vitiated by an error of law and had for that reason to be declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the foregoing that , without there being any need to examine the other arguments in the application , Mr [ A.B. ] is justified in submitting that the judge appointed by the President of ORG , in the judgment appealed against , had been wrong to reject his request for the annulment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE placing him in administrative detention . \u201d", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
