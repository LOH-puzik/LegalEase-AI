They complain of consolidation measures ( PERSON ) taken in respect of their land since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON , \" ORG \" ) opened the Hacking land consolidation proceedings , pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE DATE ( ORG , \" LAW \" ) . The measures concerned CARDINAL landownersand covered QUANTITY , including the applicants\u2019 property at GPE .", "On DATE Mr and PERSON made a \" declaration of wishes \" ( PERSON ) , expressing their wish to receive parcels situated near their farmhouse . On CARDINAL DATE ORG adopted the land valuation schedule , against which the ORG did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the provisional transfer of compensatory plots ( ORG ) on the basis of a draft consolidation scheme ( ORG ) , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants had agreed to this plan , which provided them with a parcel of QUANTITY near their farm , and did not contest the transfer decision . While they lost the ownership of land formerly belonging to them ( including the CARDINAL plots mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which passed to the association of landowners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they acquired the provisional ownership of certain plots subject to a condition subsequent , namely that they would be dispossessed of them under the final consolidation scheme , if it did not confirm the allocation thereof to the applicants ( section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal council of GPE had adopted an area zoning plan ( GPE ; see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , which was approved on DATE by the government of the Land . The ORG property , which was covered by the consolidation scheme , retained its designation as agricultural land , although certain adjoining plots had been redesignated as building land in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the new ( provisional ) owners , the municipal council amended the area zoning plan on DATE . It classified as building land CARDINAL plots covering a surface of QUANTITY which had previously belonged to the applicants . On DATE the Land government approved the decision , which became final on DATE", "Subsequently the CARDINAL plots were divided into parcels and sold to several persons who were granted building permits in respect of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr and PERSON asked ORG to return to them the CARDINAL plots by withdrawing them from the consolidation scheme . In their view the plots in question were now to be regarded as land of special value which under the relevant legislation was in principle to be left to the previous owners . In the alternative , they asked to be allocated building land or to be accorded financial compensation ( Geldwertentsch\u00e4digung ) . They also sought compensation ( ORG ) on account of loss of interest ( PERSON ) arising from the fact that they had not themselves been able to sell the CARDINAL plots after the amendment of the area zoning plan ; they estimated this amount at QUANTITY on the basis of a price of QUANTITY at an interest rate of PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . ORG replied by a letter of CARDINAL DATE . It referred to ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , which had replaced LAW , and drew their attention to the fact that claims for compensation had to be submitted within DATE on which the consolidation scheme became final ( section CARDINAL ) ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It therefore requested the applicants to await the publication of the scheme which was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON took the view that ORG had failed to resolve within the statutory time - limit of DATE the questions which they had raised with it and , on DATE , filed with ORG ( ORG , \" ORG \" ) an application for a ruling on the matter ( section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "ORG gave its decision on DATE . It dismissed the request for the CARDINAL plots to be withdrawn from the consolidation scheme . It considered that , in order to attain its objective , the scheme had to include the land in question and the fact that the plots were now building land made no difference in this respect . It found that ORG refusal to rule on the applicants\u2019 other claims was justified since the merits of such claims could not be determined until the consolidation scheme had become final . ORG ordered ORG not to approve or authorise any further division into parcels of the land in question or to allow any further conversion into building land or any further issue of building permits .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to ORG ( ORG , \" ORG \" ) , which declared their appeal inadmissible on DATE . Its decision was upheld on DATE by ORG ) and on DATE by ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . Previously , on DATE , the applicants had contested ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) directly in ORG , which gave its decision on DATE . It upheld the impugned decision in so far as ORG had refused to return the CARDINAL plots to the applicants , but at the same time declared the appeal well - founded on the other points . As ORG had not ruled within the statutory period of DATE on the alternative claims filed by the applicants , ORG ought to have decided them itself .", "CARDINAL . In new proceedings before it , ORG gave its decision on DATE . In its view it was not possible under LAW to afford compensation for the alleged damage . The LAW provided that the owners of plots of special value covered by a consolidation scheme should in principle be compensated by the allocation of land of the same type . As regards the building land claimed by the ORG , ORG noted that the provisional transfer of the plots precluded altering their allocation for the time being . However , the provisional transfer did not prejudge the consolidation scheme which would determine definitively the question of land of special value . Furthermore , the building plots were referred to only in the area zoning plan for GPE and there was therefore an inseparable link between that plan and the question of statutory compensation for land of special value . Accordingly , the area zoning , which was the responsibility of the municipal authorities and not the agricultural authorities , was a precondition . The municipal council of GPE had announced that it proposed to convert into building land certain of the compensatory plots allocated to the applicants , but their area and location had not yet been fixed . ORG concluded that it could not rule on the merits of the question until an appeal had been filed concerning the consolidation scheme , once the latter had been adopted and published .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON then appealed to ORG , which on DATE refused to entertain their appeal as the case did not raise any specific questions of constitutional law . It remitted the case to ORG , in accordance with the ORG alternative plea .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It noted in the first place that the applicants had themselves obtained the plots which they had wished and whose designation as agricultural land had not been changed . They had thus suffered no temporary disadvantage for which they could claim financial compensation . It was true that the area zoning plan had reclassified a part of their former land after its provisional transfer . However , the consolidation scheme , which was to fix the statutory compensation , would have to take into account any changes in the value of the land occurring in the course of the proceedings , for example following a new area zoning plan as in this instance . Consequently , the contested decision was not unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Relying on section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( PERSON , \" the DATE LAW \" ) , according to which the consolidation scheme is to be published not DATE after the final decision on the provisional transfer of plots , the ORG asked ORG on DATE to take jurisdiction over the case in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE the ORG refused . It considered that it was empowered to adopt the consolidation scheme only if the failure to comply with the statutory time - limit of DATE was exclusively the fault of ORG . This was not the case .", "Since the provisional transfer ORG had made every effort to draw up the consolidation scheme . Its work had been delayed on account , in particular , of the proposed route for a new major road and its link roads across the area in question , which made it necessary to revise the position of CARDINAL owners . Furthermore , a substantial part of the file had had to remain for DATE with ORG in connection with appeal proceedings instituted by a landowner ; likewise , the ORG application of CARDINAL DATE had required the file to be sent to ORG , then to ORG and to ORG , and had therefore prevented a decision from being taken during this period . ORG could have adopted and published the consolidation scheme in DATE if further consideration , inquiries and interviews had not been necessary following the alteration to the GPE area zoning plan . With a view to expediting the final adoption of the area zoning plan , it had held discussions with the municipal council DATE , and then with the authorities with competence in the field of land development on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "As the area zoning plan had still not been settled , it had not been possible to adopt the consolidation scheme , because ORG could not yet determine whether the allocation of land provided the applicants with sufficient compensation , thereby satisfying the statutory criteria . It was , moreover , contrary to the principles of efficient administration to finalise the consolidation scheme before the adoption of the area zoning plan . The conduct of ORG had thus been justified . Under section CARDINAL of ORG , it was possible to stay ( aussetzen ) proceedings pending a definitive decision on a preliminary question which was the subject of other proceedings . In this case the area zoning constituted a preliminary question for the consolidation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG , which dismissed their appeal on DATE .", "It began by upholding ORG decision that the latter had competence to adopt a consolidation scheme solely where the failure to comply with the statutory time - limit of DATE was exclusively the fault of ORG . According to the established case - law of ORG , there was no such fault where the delay resulted from the conduct of CARDINAL of the parties or from an insurmountable obstacle . In the present case it had not been suggested that the applicants\u2019 conduct had been in any way reprehensible , nor could the failure to comply with the statutory DATE time - limit be blamed on ORG . Throughout the consolidation proceedings , it had to take account of the area zoning plans and any amendments thereto . It was therefore impossible , and indeed contrary to the principles of efficient administration , to adopt a consolidation scheme where no final land - development plan or area zoning plan existed , and where negotiations for the adoption of such plan were in progress . Even before the ORG appeal had been filed , the competent authority had conducted further inspections of the land and had had contacts with the GPE municipal council , which was considering the possibility of converting some of the plots allocated to them into building land . In those circumstances , there was no justification for adopting a consolidation scheme which would probably have been defective as from its adoption , if the municipal authority subsequently fixed an amended area zoning plan . The finalisation of such a plan in fact constituted a precondition for the adoption of the consolidation scheme . For all these reasons , ORG had been right to stay the proceedings pending the final decision of the municipal council and was not responsible for the delay in the consolidation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON contested this decision before ORG , which , on DATE , refused to entertain their appeal on the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It remitted the case to ORG in accordance with the ORG alternative plea .", "ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on DATE . It found , inter alia , that ORG refusal to assume jurisdiction had been justified , since the failure to comply with the statutory time - limit was not exclusively attributable to ORG . Furthermore , the applicants\u2019 claims concerning the nature and extent of the compensatory plots related to the question of the statutory compensation , which would be dealt with by the consolidation scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG published the consolidation scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; it returned to the Wiesingers QUANTITY of their former land and allocated to them plots covering an area of QUANTITY classified as a zone capable of being redesignated as building land ( Bauerwartungsland ) . It pointed out that the applicants had already received monetary compensation , in DATE , for certain plots that they had had to give up in connection with the construction of the new major road . It dismissed their claim for compensation for the increased value of their former land following its reclassification , because that had been taken into consideration when the compensatory plots were allocated definitively . Finally , ORG found that the applicants had not suffered any temporary damage and were not entitled to any financial reparation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contested the scheme before ORG . They argued that the land which they had ultimately received was of a lower value than their former land ; they had , they claimed , sustained a loss of CARDINAL schillings .", "CARDINAL . The different agricultural authorities attempted first to secure a friendly settlement of the dispute : ORG , between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , during which period CARDINAL meetings were held , and ORG , DATE and QUANTITY DATE , at eignteen meetings with the parties concerned , the local authorities , the highways department and the land designation supervisory authority . In the course of these meetings ORG invited the municipal authorities in question to redesignate a particular plot which they were proposing to allocate to the applicants as building land .", "However , the authorities\u2019 efforts were in vain .", "CARDINAL . After the attempts to reach a friendly settlement had failed , ORG held a hearing on DATE .", "On DATE it allowed in part the ORG appeal . It awarded to them a part of their former land , now reclassified , and other plots converted or to be converted into industrial sites . On the other hand , it dismissed once again their claim for financial compensation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against this decision to ORG , which dismissed their appeal on DATE .", "After having examined in detail the ORG objections , ORG concluded that they had received compensatory plots of a value equivalent to that of their former land , as was required under LAW . Accordingly , the impugned decision did not infringe their statutory rights . Furthermore , according to ORG , if the new situation of agriculture in the area was compared to the old one , it could be said that the consolidation scheme had been a success and had achieved its goals .", "In the meantime the applicants had appealed to ORG , which has not yet ruled .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the adoption of the consolidation scheme , the ORG applied to the civil courts for an order directing the cessation of the construction work which had begun on their former land .", "On DATE ORG ( GPE ) found that it lacked jurisdiction . Its decision was overturned on CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , but on DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) confirmed that the civil courts were not competent to decide the matter . ORG declined , on account of the exclusive powers vested in ORG under NORP law ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to follow its previous case - law , although it concerned similar facts .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also requested authorisation to construct CARDINAL animal feed silos on their compensatory plots near their farm . However , the authorities refused on the ground that they were only provisionally owners of the land in question .", "CARDINAL . The basic rules applying to the consolidation of agricultural land are embodied in ORG ( Flurverfassungs - Grundsatzgesetz DATE ) , as amended in DATE . The ORG have regulated the matters for which they are made responsible under LAW in provincial agricultural land planning Acts ( ORG ) .", "In GPE , consolidation is governed by ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . This replaced an Act of DATE , which had itself replaced an LAW that had been brought into force again in DATE . The proceedings in the present case were instituted under LAW , on the basis of which the provisional transfer was ordered . However , the subsequent proceedings were governed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of consolidation is to improve the infrastructure and the pattern of agricultural holdings in a given area ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . It comprises communal measures and facilities and redistribution of land . The operation takes place in the following stages :", "- the initial proceedings ;", "- ascertainment of the occupiers of the land in question and assessment of its value ;", "- planning of communal measures and facilities ;", "- provisional transfer of land , where appropriate ;", "- adoption of the consolidation plan .", "None of these stages may begin until the previous stage has been terminated with a final decision .", "CARDINAL . The initial proceedings , which are instituted of the authorities\u2019 own motion , serve to determine the consolidation area , which , in addition to farmland and forest , may include land voluntarily offered for consolidation and land required for communal facilities ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Land which is not needed for the purposes of consolidation may subsequently be withdrawn from the area ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The owners form an association ( ORG ) , which is a corporate body governed by public law .", "The institution of proceedings means that land use is restricted until the proceedings are concluded ; any change in use must be approved by the appropriate agricultural authority . This authority has exclusive jurisdiction , inter alia , over disputes concerning ownership and tenure of land in the consolidation area ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Once the decision to open proceedings has become final , the agricultural authority ascertains who are the occupiers of the land and assesses its value ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . Its decision ( PERSON ) determines the value of the land in accordance with precise statutory criteria ( LAW CARDINAL ) . Each of the landowners involved may challenge the valuation not only of his own land but also of the land of the others . Once the agricultural authority \u2019s decision has become final , however , it is binding on all of them .", "CARDINAL . Communal measures ( e.g. soil improvement , alterations to terrain or landscape ) and communal facilities ( e.g. private roads , bridges , ditches , drainage and irrigation ) are ordered , where they are needed , in a specific decision by the relevant authority ( Plan der gemeinsamen ORG ) , which must also settle the question of costs , these usually being shared by the landowners .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL , in both the DATE and LAW , land may be provisionally transferred before the adoption of the consolidation scheme , even if some owners object .", "Decisions by the competent authorities ordering provisional transfers are not appealable ; but section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( ORG , as amended in DATE , \" the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW \" ) provides that the final decision shall lie with ORG , except in cases where an appeal lies to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The main purpose of provisional transfer is to ensure that the consolidation area is rationally cultivated during the interim period . The land transferred becomes the property of the transferees subject to a condition subsequent : ownership of it reverts to the original owner if the allocation is not confirmed in the final consolidation plan ( NORP unter aufl\u00f6sender PERSON , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . This provisional , conditional ownership is , as a rule , not entered in the land register , since it is subject to a resolutive condition and it is possible that the parties concerned may be allotted other parcels once the proceedings are completed . ORG has to authorise any entry in the land register ( sections CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the proceedings , the agricultural authority adopts the consolidation scheme ( ORG , section CARDINAL ) . Since DATE this has to be published within DATE of the final decision provisionally to transfer parcels of land ( section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ) , failing which the person concerned may request the higher authority to assume jurisdiction . The adoption of the plan is an administrative act which is supported by maps and other technical data , and whose main function is to determine the compensation due to the landowners who are parties to the proceedings . LAW includes the following regulations on this matter :", "- when compensatory parcels are being determined , regard shall be had to the wishes of the parties directly concerned in so far as this can be done without infringing statutory provisions or interfering with important public interests served by the consolidation scheme ;", "- any landowner whose land is included in the consolidation scheme shall be entitled to compensation in the form of other land of equal value included in the same scheme or , if that is not possible , to be reallocated his previous parcels , including building land ( section DATE ) ;", "- changes in the value of land which come about in the course of the proceedings , including those occurring after the provisional transfer , must be taken into account in the final allocation under the consolidation scheme ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) ;", "- claims for compensation have to be submitted within DATE from the date on which the consolidation scheme becomes final ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The provincial legislation does not provide for any financial compensation for damage suffered , before a final consolidation plan comes into force , by landowners who successfully challenge the lawfulness of compensation received in the form of land .", "CARDINAL .

If the latter authority fails to give a decision within the statutory time - limit , jurisdiction passes - on an application by the interested party - to ORG ( Article CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , area zoning planning is governed by ORG ( Raumordnungsgesetz ) .", "In NORP law area zoning plans and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees ( ORG ) , even if they only concern CARDINAL individual \u2019s property . Accordingly , the proceedings in which they are issued are not normal administrative proceedings and the persons affected are not parties to them .", "However , the competent local authorities ( NORP ) must take into consideration planning proceedings of neighbouring local authorities and other public law corporations , as well as regionally significant measures of other planning organisations ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , including the planning projects of the agricultural authorities .", "CARDINAL . The lawfulness of decrees can be challenged before ORG under LAW . However , case - law has established that area zoning plans can not be directly challenged in proceedings under LAW by the individuals affected if it is possible to institute administrative proceedings .", "This is the case , in particular , where the area zoning plan is the basis for the granting or withholding of building permits . The persons affected are expected to assert their rights in administrative proceedings concerning the building permit , in which they can allege that the underlying area zoning plan has no legal basis or is contrary to the applicable legislation . Ultimately this question can be brought before ORG by a constitutional complaint under LAW or by a request made by ORG under LAW para . CARDINAL and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The decisions of land reform boards can be challenged in ORG .
