The court considered that the applicant had denied beating the victim 's head against the pavement in an attempt to mitigate his responsibility .", "CARDINAL .

Another witness , a member of the ambulance team who had examined the victim at the scene of the accident and taken him to hospital , testified that the victim N. had appeared to be in a state of inebriation . The court found that those statements were unreliable as there was no other corroborating evidence , for example blood - test results .", "CARDINAL .

He claimed that he had acted in self - defence and in defence of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the judgment on appeal . It heard submissions from the applicant and his counsel , the victim 's wife PERSON and the prosecutor . It stated , in particular , that the statements by witness PERSON , who was born in DATE , had been read out at the trial in accordance with LAW , since the trial court had lawfully found , on the basis of witness PERSON 's letter in which she referred to her age and poor health , that her appearance at the trial had been impossible . The trial court had taken account of the fact that PERSON and PERSON , previously unknown to each other , had consistently asserted that the defendant had beaten the victim 's head against the pavement more than once . Their statements had been corroborated by the conclusions of the forensic medical examination , and the fact that the victim PERSON had injuries to his face which , as the expert report confirmed , could not have been caused solely by falling and could have occurred before the fracture of the parietal bones . ORG held that in those circumstances the judgment had been correctly based on the statements by PERSON and PERSON , which were corroborated by the expert 's conclusions .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent applications lodged by the applicant for supervisory review proceedings to be initiated were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL .
