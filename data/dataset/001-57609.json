ORG In DATE , the applicants sought compensation from the GPE of GPE for the damage caused by the noise and air pollution resulting from the operation of the airport ; Mr. PERSON claimed a lump sum of CARDINAL GPE and Mr. PERSON a lump sum of CARDINAL GPE . Having been unable to arrive at a settlement with them , the LOC applied on DATE for assessment proceedings to be opened CARDINAL of LAW of DATE . The case was referred to ORG having jurisdiction in the matter , namely ORG for the Tenth District ; on this occasion it was presided over by a judge of ORG and also comprised an architect , an engineer and the registrar of that court ( sections CARDINAL et seq . of the above - mentioned LAW of DATE on ORG and Order of CARDINAL DATE on LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the ORG claims by a decision of DATE , which was served on them on DATE . It recognised that under NORP case - law and legal theory tenants could in principle rely on the law of nuisance ( voisinage ) set out in LAW ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ; however , it considered that the applicants were alleging non - pecuniary damage and not damage to property , whereas only the latter fell to be taken into account under LAW .", "CARDINAL .

ORG The applicants\u2019 lawyer wrote to ORG on DATE to enquire about the state of the proceedings . It replied , on DATE , that it had not yet been able to deal with the case because of its excessive workload , but hoped to be able to give a decision during DATE . ORG enclosed with its letter a copy of the observations filed by the GPE of GPE .", "The applicants reverted to the matter on DATE .

On DATE , the judge acting as rapporteur , whilst expressing his regrets about the delay in examining the case , replied that judgment would be delivered after the court vacation .", "CARDINAL . ORG The First Public - Law Chamber of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE .", "Its judgment , which was CARDINAL pages in length , began by analysing the situation of residential and agricultural tenants in the event of expropriation . It went on to observe that when - in DATE and DATE respectively - the applicants signed their leases , which were renewable DATE , they were aware of the nuisance to which they would be subjected ; they had not established that it had grown noticeably worse in the meantime ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the statistics supplied by the Government , from DATE to DATE the total number of appeals rose from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , that is an increase of PERCENT . The rate of growth was PERCENT for public - law appeals ( CARDINAL against CARDINAL ) and PERCENT for administrative - law appeals ( CARDINAL against CARDINAL ) .", "As early as DATE , ORG decided to increase the number of members of ORG from CARDINAL and the number of substitute judges from CARDINAL to CARDINAL ; thereafter LAW had CARDINAL members instead of CARDINAL .", "In its report for DATE , published on DATE , ORG drew attention to a build - up in the volume of litigation ; it stated that \" despite the increase , in DATE , in the number of judges \" , it would \" already have to consider at an early date the measures to be taken to deal with the growth in the quantity of cases \" .", "In DATE , ORG submitted to ORG a number of urgent proposals designed to reduce this excessive workload ; at the same time it suggested that a thorough review be undertaken of the whole organisation of the Federal courts , especially in public- and administrative - law matters , as regards its objectives and its relationship with the administration of the Cantonal courts .", "In its message of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , ORG put forward draft texts designed , on the one hand , to modify LAW as regards LAW of ORG and , on the other hand , to amend LAW fixing the number of registrars and secretaries ; it proposed that the number of judges be increased from CARDINAL to CARDINAL and the number of registrars and secretaries from CARDINAL to CARDINAL . In its preliminary observations , ORG stated :", "\" The cases coming before LAW of ORG constitute a task which , for DATE , has been growing continuously and threatening to become an excessive workload of a permanent nature ; in the long term and having regard to the ORG \u2019s present organisation , it will not be possible to keep abreast of this task without there being detrimental effects on the quality of the handling of cases and , at DATE , on protection under the law . \"", "However , ORG itself requested that these reforms be deferred , pending a full - scale revision of LAW ; this revision has not yet been effected ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its report for DATE , dated DATE , ORG recorded that there had been no diminution in the growth of its caseload , above all in the area of public and administrative law . It attributed this not only to the extension of the ORG \u2019s powers in administrative matters but also to the fact that citizens were having increased resort to the guarantees which the law afforded to them vis - \u00e0 - vis the public authorities .", "On DATE , ORG had recommended to the ORG urgent measures similar to those it had sought in DATE . As a result , in DATE ORG took a first series of decisions . It increased the number of Federal judges from CARDINAL to CARDINAL and , with effect from DATE , the number of registrars and secretaries from CARDINAL to CARDINAL . It also decided to split LAW into CARDINAL LAW .", "ORG , for its part , adopted on DATE revised Rules of Procedure which also came into force on DATE . Public - law and administrative - law cases are now distributed , according to their subject - matter , amongst the different Divisions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG These reforms were to prove insufficient . In its management report for DATE , dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG recorded that CARDINAL cases had been brought and CARDINAL disposed of during DATE ; however , it had been necessary to carry over to DATE the examination of CARDINAL cases that is CARDINAL of those registered in DATE . ORG observed that the vast majority ( PERCENT ) of the cases remaining on its list concerned public and administrative law and stated :", "\" In these areas , if no immediate solution is found , a litigant will in future have to wait for DATE before the ORG rules on his case . In a ORG governed by the rule of law , such a situation is incompatible with the role that should be played by ORG . \"", "ORG therefore proposed in their message of CARDINAL DATE to ORG that the number of registrars and secretaries be increased from CARDINAL . It should be noted that these are not junior administrative staff but highly - qualified lawyers who play an essential role in the functioning of ORG ( Rule CARDINAL of ORG , dated DATE ) ; indeed they act in a consultative capacity during deliberations ( Rule CARDINAL , second paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its management report for DATE , dated DATE , ORG pointed out that the situation was still serious . It regretted that the CARDINAL legislative ORG had not yet been able to adopt the Government \u2019s proposals and added :", "\" Owing to its overwhelming workload , the ORG is now no longer able , in certain areas , to fulfil its role as guardian of the law , even though for its part it is doing everything possible , as regards internal organisation , to keep abreast of its obligations . \"", "On DATE , ORG adopted a Decree raising from CARDINAL the posts for registrars and secretaries of ORG and also increasing its administrative staff .", "These measures led to some improvement : in its report for DATE , dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that for the first time since DATE it had succeeded in disposing of almost as many cases ( CARDINAL ) as had been registered ( CARDINAL ) ; however , it had been obliged to adjourn CARDINAL . It concluded from this that \" for DATE more it will remain burdened by an excessive workload and will therefore not be able to decide cases within a time which would , having regard to their nature , appear reasonable in terms of the LAW and the LAW \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG Quite apart from these decisions intended to cater for the immediate problem , the Federal committee of experts preparing a full - scale revision of LAW of DATE , designed to reduce ORG workload and accelerate its proceedings , completed its work at DATE . Recently , ORG and Police submitted a preliminary draft text to the Government , with a view to setting in motion a consultation procedure which should be terminated in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has itself taken practical steps aimed at coping with its backlog of pending business . Believing that to process cases in chronological order would give rise to serious injustices , it has , in particular , utilised a system , known as \" sorting \" , based on the degree of urgency and the human implications of each case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
