POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG , in proceedings concerning a claim for division of marital property of the applicant and his former wife , PERSON , changed a decision of the lower court given in the case . The court established the value of the property as being PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and reduced the payment to be made by the applicant to PERSON from PLZ MONEY to PLZ CARDINAL .", "The applicant , considering that the court had committed errors in the calculation of the value of various components of the property , requested the Minister of ORG to lodge an extraordinary appeal against this judgment . The applicant also paid to PERSON the sums fixed by the judgment .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG lodged an extraordinary appeal with ORG . The Minister argued that the courts had wrongly calculated the value of the property , in that the value of certain parts of the property had been calculated twice , once as regards their book - keeping value ( i.e. the price to be paid for replacement property items ) and then as regards their market value , and these amounts had been erroneously added . As a result , the applicant was ordered to pay amounts which exceeded by CARDINAL of old zlotys ( PLZ ) the real value of the part of the property for which his former wife had to be reimbursed .", "On DATE ORG allowed the extraordinary appeal . As a result , the court quashed the second - instance decision of CARDINAL DATE and amended the decision of the lower court by establishing the value of the property as being approximately PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , fixing the share of each spouse at PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and reducing the amount that the applicant should have paid to GPE from PLZ MONEY to PLZ CARDINAL . The court considered that the Minister \u2019s extraordinary appeal was correct in pointing out the calculation errors committed by the lower courts .", "The court went on to state that as a result of these errors the applicant \u2019s obligations had been increased in a manner which was obviously not justified . The contested decisions constituted a miscarriage of justice since they had granted substantial compensation involving MONEY without there being any legal or factual basis therefor . Consequently , they also breached the interests of the Republic and the decisions had to be rectified .", "The applicant subsequently claimed that PERSON should pay back to him the amounts she had received on the basis of the judgment of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG gave a judgment by which PERSON was obliged to pay these amounts to the applicant . This judgment was not appealed against and became final and enforceable .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request to have enforcement proceedings instituted in respect of this judgment . As he did not pay a fee for the launching of the enforcement proceedings , he was summoned to do so . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested the bailiff to return the enforcement order to him . This was done on DATE . As no fee had been paid , the bailiff did not institute enforcement proceedings .", "In DATE the applicant requested ORG to take steps in order to have the damage he had sustained as a result of the erroneous judicial decision compensated . He reiterated his request on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to the President of ORG , requesting that the damage he had suffered as a result of the erroneous judicial decision be compensated .", "In a reply of DATE , he was informed that the liability of ORG , provided for by LAW , arose only if the fault of the ORG agent was confirmed by a criminal or disciplinary decision . In the light thereof , his request could not be granted .", "By a letter of DATE the applicant informed ORG that his efforts to have the damage compensated had proved unsuccessful . He referred to the letter of the President of ORG , relying on LAW . He reiterated that ORG had found that the contested judicial decisions \u201c constituted a miscarriage of justice since they had granted substantial compensation involving MONEY without there being any legal or factual basis therefor \u201d . Consequently , they also breached the interests of the Republic and the decisions had to be rectified . He requested that steps be taken in order to have the damage he had suffered compensated .", "This letter apparently remained unanswered .", "In a letter of DATE the applicant again requested ORG to take steps in order to satisfy his claims for compensation in respect of the damage which he had sustained , having paid to PERSON the sums fixed by the judgment of DATE , which had subsequently been quashed by ORG as being in manifest breach of law .", "In reply of DATE the ORG stated that the judgment of ORG did not give rise to any compensation claims against ORG . If the applicant so wished , he could raise his claims in civil proceedings . It would be for the court alone to rule on his claim .", "On DATE the applicant reiterated his request to ORG . In a reply of DATE the Ministry referred to its reply of DATE .", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of ORG ( ORG cywilny ) of DATE provide for the ORG \u2019s liability in tort . In the version applicable until DATE , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a ORG official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him . \u201d", "According to the old case - law of ORG , a plaintiff seeking damages under LAW of LAW had to show that the act in question was unlawful and that the ORG agent had committed a fault ( ORG judgments : No . I PR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished , No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , unpublished and No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "Under the former LAW , if damage was caused by the ORG official as a result of his / her giving a decision or other official act , ORG was liable only if the giving of the said decision amounted to an infringement of the law which was punishable under criminal law or under any disciplinary regulations , and if the fault of the perpetrator had been confirmed by a judgment of a criminal court or of a competent disciplinary authority , or was otherwise recognised by a superior authority .", "Under LAW , everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by unlawful acts of a public authority . Pursuant to LAW of the same LAW , a statute shall not bar access to court to persons seeking redress for any breach of their rights or freedoms .", "LAW provides that everyone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his / her case , without undue delay , before a competent impartial and independent court .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG ruled on the compatibility of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW with LAW . It ruled that LAW was compatible with LAW , if it was so construed as to mean that ORG was liable for damage caused by unlawful acts of public officials in carrying out his / her duties .", "In the same judgment the ORG held that LAW was incompatible with LAW in that it placed undue restrictions on access to a court in cases in which the civil liability of the ORG was claimed for acts carried out in the exercise of the ORG powers , other than de facto acts , which were covered by the general principle of LAW ( published in ORG ) , Dz . U. Nr CARDINAL , poz . DATE ) .", "The judgment of DATE took effect on DATE . As a result , Article CARDINAL was repealed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
