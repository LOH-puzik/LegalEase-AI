The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG . At the material time the applicant was a journalist and editor - in - chief of the ORG newspaper , published by the FAC PERSON limited company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s newspaper published his article \u201c Tied in the system , or , Why are the generals waiting for TIME ? \u201d ( \u201c \u0412 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b , \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0436\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 ORG \u0427 GPE ? \u201d ) . The article was signed by his pen name PERSON . The article told the readers about a criminal investigation opened by the regional prosecutor \u2019s office into the activities of CARDINAL ( out of CARDINAL ) officers from the regional anti - narcotics unit ( ORG \u0423\u0412\u0414 PERSON \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) . It was alleged that on several occasions the officers of the unit had unlawfully discontinued the criminal prosecution of drug - dealers who had agreed to \u201c co - operate \u201d with them and to share the profits from drug sales .", "CARDINAL . The article featured an interview with a former drug dealer , PERSON , who sold drugs under the unidentified ORG \u201c cover \u201d for DATE , until they \u201c betrayed \u201d her and she was arrested :", "\u201c They apprehended me at a market when I was purchasing opium , [ they ] wrote down my contact details ... Like many others , I had been paying them , and , \u2018 as a gesture of thanks\u2019 , they at first overlooked my buying and consuming drugs , [ and ] later my selling them ... They said : here is a new drug , try it and describe the effect to us . It was heroin ... I assure you that the police know every single [ sale - purchase ] point and every single dealer \u2013 in this sense they work very well [ because ] it brings them profit ... I had to remember all of their birthdays \u2013 theirs , their wives\u2019 and children \u2019s . All of them expected presents . Also , they needed money all the time : once [ they asked for money ] to buy petrol for the police car ... They set me up ... Now I am in prison . There are only my kind here , because we can not pay them off \u2013 our income from drug - dealing is barely sufficient for a \u2018 pay - off\u2019 and our own dose . As to the dealers ... I bear witness that all of them left the pre - trial detention facility ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article described the alleged wrongdoings of the anti - narcotics unit in general terms , without identifying any officers by name or rank :", "\u201c The persons who are charged DATE do not admit their guilt . They claim that they have been slandered by drug addicts and are being avenged by the regional prosecutor \u2019s office for the drug - related arrest of the prosecutor \u2019s son in the past ... Nevertheless , it is for the court to determine the matter \u2013 this is why I do not name any of the police officers . But CARDINAL fact is indisputable : the extent to which drugs have spread in LOC is such that there is probably no way out . Taking into account that the duties of various state authorities are clearly demarcated , no matter what subterfuges you use , it is the police in particular who are responsible for the prosperity of drug - dealers in ORG and , more specifically , the anti - narcotics unit . The anti - narcotics unit is also to be blamed for the deaths of CARDINAL persons who died DATE by overdose and for the easy access to drugs of each school student in ORG . And also for the fact that drug - dealers are still at liberty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article further stated that the officers charged had used drugs to pay for \u201c information and services \u201d :", "\u201c The investigation found that , as a matter of course , some officers in the unit used drugs to pay for services and information . Question : where does a police officer get drugs from ? Answer : part [ of the drugs ] seized from drug addicts and drug dealers was retained , in contravention of all laws and regulations , for the needs of the police . And when such a dreadful weapon ends up in the hands of people who are not entirely morally upright , one can expect anything : drugs become a means of payment , a means of blackmail , and a threat to life ... A police officer becomes a criminal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The concluding paragraphs of the article explained its headline . A high - ranking general in the NORP security service once allegedly stated that the police knew all criminals and only waited for TIME when the order would come to exterminate them . The article doubted the general \u2019s illusion of omnipotence and expressed concern for the future of LOC .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date all CARDINAL officers of the LOC anti - narcotics unit , including the CARDINAL charged with drug - related offences , filed a civil defamation action . Without mentioning specific parts of the article , the officers asserted that the publication had damaged their honour , dignity and professional reputation and claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage .

On an unspecified date the staff lawyer of the applicant \u2019s newspaper commissioned a linguistic examination of the publication , which was carried out by a professor from ORG who had a degree in language studies . His report pointed out that the publication had not referred to any police officer by name or otherwise and the blame had been placed on the state authorities as a whole and the ORG anti - narcotics unit in particular . The expert concluded that none of the quoted extracts could be considered as damaging the honour or dignity of any specific person as an individual .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG delivered the judgment in the defamation action against the editor \u2019s office of the ORG newspaper and the FAC Novostey company . The assessment of the damaging nature of the extracts was solely based on the statements by the plaintiffs and their relatives who claimed that the publication had been a cause of psychological anxiety . The court did not address the issue of whether the publication had targeted the plaintiffs . Nor did it distinguish between the author \u2019s speech and the statements quoted as having been made by PERSON in an interview .

In the statement of appeal , counsel for the FAC Novostey company submitted that ORG had not given proper assessment to the fact that the publication had concerned a structural police unit rather than named individuals , that a criminal case was pending against several police officers , that other officers had been disciplined after the publication and that the director of the regional police had negatively appraised the performance of the anti - narcotics unit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal and heard oral submissions by the applicant as the editor - in - chief , and counsel for the FAC Novostey company . It found as follows :", "\u201c The [ article in question ] was published in DATE , that is , before the criminal case , including the indictment bill , was submitted for trial . As of DATE , there has still been no conviction in the criminal case against [ CARDINAL plaintiffs ] . The first - instance court has therefore correctly concluded that there was no proof of the truthfulness of the information contained in the publication and contested by the plaintiffs ...", "The court considers that the negative appraisal of the performance of the anti - narcotics unit by the ORG Regional police department , which followed publication of the article , can not be a proof of the truthfulness of the information contested by the plaintiffs because in the present case the only such proof would be a court judgment .", "With regard to the foregoing , the court considers that ... the appellant \u2019s argument that the contested publication did not contain information on specific individuals , but only referred to a structural unit of the police , is not a valid ground to quash the judgment . Under LAW of LAW , a judgment that is correct in substance need not be quashed merely because of formal defects . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the judgment of DATE in substance .
