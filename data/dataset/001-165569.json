During their stay there , ORG was colloquially referred to as FAC ( ORG ) . It appears that the group was evicted from ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality of GPE offered temporary shelter to the original members of the group \u201c We Are Here \u201d who had been staying in ORG since DATE .

Apart from the fact that , for reasons found imputable to him , the applicant did not hold any identity or travel documents , he was found to have given inconsistent , contradictory , vague and summary statements to the immigration authorities . In DATE he was released from immigration detention ( vreemdelingendetentie ) because , according to the applicant who has not provided any further details , an effective removal to his country of origin proved not possible . As a rejected asylum - seeker who had failed to leave the country within the voluntary return grace period of DATE , the applicant was no longer entitled to ORG - sponsored accommodation and care in one of the reception centres for asylum - seekers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , having joined the group \u201c We Are Here \u201d , took shelter in LOC in GPE together with CARDINAL other irregular migrants . It appears that he lived in LOC until DATE . Meanwhile , the applicant instituted the proceedings set out in paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below .", "CARDINAL .

He further submitted that he had applied for shelter in LOC but that , unlike other irregular migrants from ORG in a similar situation , he had not been admitted to LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the living conditions in LOC were poor . Housing CARDINAL persons , it was overcrowded . A limited , insufficient number of toilets was available and there were no washing facilities . Electricity was not always available . The irregular migrants staying in the garage were dependent on volunteers for food and the atmosphere between them was tense , regularly resulting in confrontations which were sometimes violent . The applicant himself had once been threatened and assaulted by a co - resident in the garage . He had sustained a light stab wound . He had reported that incident to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor and Aldermen ( college PERSON ) of the municipality of GPE , treating the applicant \u2019s request as an application for access to community shelter services ( maatschappelijke opvang ) under LAW ( PERSON ) , rejected it as the applicant was neither a NORP national nor did he hold a residence permit as required by the aforementioned act . An exception to that rule could apply when the right to respect for physical or psychological integrity flowing from LAW was at stake , in particular if the person concerned was a minor or vulnerable because of a medical emergency . However , as the applicant had not provided any medical information \u2013 even though he claimed that he required medical care DATE he was considered as not falling within the category of vulnerable persons .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the fact that the applicant had been denied access to LOC , the Mayor and Aldermen held that accommodation at that location had been offered to the original members of the group \u201c We Are Here \u201d who had stayed in FAC for an uninterrupted period of time and who were willing to cooperate with the municipality and other institutions in the organisation of their return to the country of origin .

In such centres the focus is on departure from GPE of the person concerned , meaning that reception facilities are provided on condition that the person concerned cooperates in the organisation of his or her departure to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against the decision of DATE which was dismissed by the Mayor and Aldermen on CARDINAL DATE , in accordance with an advice drawn up by the objections committee ( ORG ) on DATE and on the same grounds as those on which the initial decision had been based . The applicant lodged an appeal ( beroep ) with ORG ( rechtbank ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the Mayor and Aldermen \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . Proceeding to decide on the matter itself , ORG considered that the ORG \u2019s decisions of DATE , in which the ORG had found violations of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , could not be overlooked notwithstanding the fact that they were not binding for the State Parties to the LAW . Accordingly , ORG considered that the denial of shelter , food and clothing to irregular migrants touched upon the right to respect for human dignity in such a way as to preclude a person \u2019s enjoyment of private life within the meaning of LAW . It concluded that the ORG was under a positive obligation to provide the applicant with shelter , food and clothing and that that provision should not be made conditional on the applicant \u2019s cooperation in the organisation of his departure from the GPE . It was noted , however , that the municipality of GPE , simultaneously with other municipalities in major cities of the GPE , had established the Bed , ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , providing , as of DATE , basic accommodation to irregular migrants including night shelter with shower facilities , breakfast and dinner . As far as the applicant had argued that the Bed , ORG was insufficient , he had failed to substantiate that argument with any prima facie evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant had obtained a residence permit on DATE as a consequence of which he was already entitled to ORG - sponsored social benefits . The applicant \u2019s argument that his right to emergency social assistance should nevertheless be acknowledged retroactively and that he should be granted living allowances ( leefgeld ) by way of compensation was dismissed . ORG held that although such a right to emergency social benefits should be acknowledged retroactively , that is from DATE , there was no legal basis on which to conclude that this right included a right to living allowances . It was open to the applicant to claim compensation for damage in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the Mayor and Aldermen lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal but accepted the Mayor and Aldermen \u2019s appeal and quashed ORG judgment . ORG found that the Mayor and Aldermen \u2019s rejection of the applicant \u2019s request for shelter under LAW was justified as the applicant had the possibility of receiving shelter at a centre where his liberty would be restricted . Unlike ORG , it agreed with the Mayor and Aldermen that irregular migrants may be denied access to such a centre if they refuse to cooperate in the organisation of their return to their country of origin , unless there existed exceptional circumstances . Such exceptional circumstances could exist when the person concerned had demonstrated that he or she was unable to foresee the consequences of his or her actions or omissions due to his or her psychiatric state of mind . It was , however , incumbent upon the irregular migrant to claim that such exceptional circumstances pertained .", "CARDINAL . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had also requested the Deputy Minister of Security and ORG to grant him , either in cooperation with the municipality of GPE or independently , ORG - sponsored care and accommodation , in particular to offer him shelter as well as ( allowances for ) food and clothing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s request , considering that he could apply for admission in a centre run by the Repatriation and Departure Service where his liberty would be restricted and where he would have to cooperate in the organisation of his departure from the GPE . The applicant was reminded of the fact that he was already under a statutory obligation to leave the GPE pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW CARDINAL as his asylum request had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an objection against this decision , which was dismissed by the Deputy Minister on DATE .", "CARDINAL . An appeal lodged by the applicant was declared inadmissible by ORG of GPE on DATE , which considered that the applicant no longer had any interest in challenging the impugned decision in view of the provisional measure issued by ORG on DATE , pursuant to which the municipality of GPE had been ordered to provide TIME shelter , breakfast and dinner to irregular migrants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
