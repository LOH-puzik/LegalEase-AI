ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Luzius Wildhaber", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which created ORG and required regional governments , inter alia , to adopt appropriate measures for the prevention , screening and treatment of disabilities , ORG enacted Regional Law no . CARDINAL ( \u201c LAW ) . LAW authorised local public health services ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c USLs \u201d ) to grant allowances for DATE after its entry into force to families caring for disabled members of their household directly in their own homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Comitato di gestione ) of ORG no . CARDINAL , applying LAW , decided that CARDINAL persons , including the applicant 's son , satisfied the conditions entitling their families to payment of the allowance . The decision authorised only distribution to qualifying beneficiaries , depending on the date when they had been recognised as PERCENT disabled , of the sum of MONEY ( ITL ) for DATE ; the applicant received ITL CARDINAL in respect of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a notice to pay served on DATE , the applicant asked ORG no . CARDINAL to grant him the allowance . He pointed out that the placing of his son 's name on the list of persons who satisfied the conditions required by LAW for entitlement to the allowance had not been followed by the payment provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG did not reply , the applicant brought proceedings against it in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE . Relying on LAW , he sought a declaration that the lack of an answer from the USL \u2013 amounting to a refusal \u2013 had been unlawful and that he was entitled to the allowance in question for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that a date be fixed for the hearing . On DATE he submitted an urgent request for a hearing date to be fixed , observing , inter alia , that the USLs were to be restructured on CARDINAL DATE and that NORP legislation made no provision for financial continuity between the old entities and the new ones . He was therefore asking for his case to be set down because after DATE he would no longer be able to obtain the allowance he sought .", "In a pleading filed on a date which has not been specified , ORG no . CARDINAL submitted , among other arguments , that it did not have capacity to defend the action ( legittimazione passiva ) , on the ground that only the LOC was required to make available the financial resources needed for payment of the allowance . It maintained that the applicant , who had received the allowance for DATE , within the limits of the budgetary appropriations , should have challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE , but as he had not done so it had become final and the amount paid could no longer be called into question .", "CARDINAL . NORP The case was heard on DATE . In a judgment of DATE and DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on DATE , the ORG observed in the first place that the applicant was not required to challenge the decision in issue as it did not contain a refusal to pay the full amount of the allowance . On the contrary , there had been CARDINAL valid alternative ways of interpreting the ORG 's conduct . For example , the applicant could have thought the ORG was making a payment on account , while reserving final determination of the amount to be paid for a later assessment , or that it had decided to pay a larger sum with an initial instalment to be followed by others . On the merits , the ORG held that , once it had been verified that the statutory conditions for entitlement to the allowance had been satisfied , it should be paid in the quantum provided for in LAW . The administrative authority thus had no discretionary power and its role should have been restricted to making a purely arithmetical calculation . The applicant had duly established that he was the father of a PERCENT disabled civilian living with his family ; moreover , his son 's name was the CARDINALth in the list included in the decision of DATE . The ORG should therefore have ruled on his application . However , as ORG had stated when determining a dispute over jurisdiction ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , the applicant could not claim to have a \u201c personal right \u201d ( diritto soggettivo perfetto ) but only a \u201c legitimate interest \u201d ( interesse legittimo ) , that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest , which would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid . The ORG therefore dismissed the applicant 's action in so far as it concerned recognition of his entitlement to the allowance in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively ORG no . CARDINAL and ORG appealed to the Consiglio di Stato . By a decision of DATE the PERSON stayed execution of the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( LOC ) , the body which had taken the place of the FAC , approved the text of a friendly settlement reached on DATE between the administrative authority and the applicant , among others . Noting that in numerous similar cases the competent courts had nearly always recognised that the plaintiffs were entitled to the allowance for DATE , further noting that the settlement had been signed after it had been verified that the conditions required by LAW had been satisfied , and having regard to the fact that the settlement was about to put an end to a high - profile case which would in all probability have gone against the administrative authority , given the line the courts had taken on the question , so that the public purse would be saved MONEY , the Director - General ordered payment of the allowance . By a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on DATE , the PERSON took formal note of the friendly settlement the parties had reached and struck the case out of its list .", "CARDINAL . The allowance for the families of disabled civilians is governed by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , the relevant parts of which provide :", "\u201c For DATE after the entry into force of the present PERSON , local public health services shall be authorised to grant an allowance to families who undertake to provide direct care for persons suffering from mental or physical disabilities who are incapable of attending to their own primary needs and require constant assistance .", "The allowance shall be granted in pursuance of the following objectives :", "( a ) returning to their families disabled people formerly in full - time institutional care ;", "( b ) encouraging the practice of caring for disabled children within the family ... ;", "( c ) socialising the disabled person and improving his relations with those around him ;", "( d ) improving the lives of the families of disabled persons ;", "( e ) creating a favourable environment for the life of the disabled person ;", "...", "The amount of the family carers ' allowance shall be PERCENT of the DATE charge for attendance on persons hospitalised full - time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has given a number of rulings on the carers ' allowance in connection with appeals on points of law concerning disputes over jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . For example , in judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE it held that , where the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts had been recognised in a decision which had become final , disputes concerning LAW fell into the category of disputes over mandatory assistance , which came within the jurisdiction of the magistrate 's court , sitting as an employment tribunal .", "In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE it held that the administrative courts had jurisdiction over disputes about entitlement to the allowance , ruling that the beneficiary could not claim to have a personal right but only a legitimate interest , that is to say an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest , and that this would remain the case until such time as the administrative authority adopted a decision to award the allowance and specified the total amount to be paid .", "The appellants in these CARDINAL cases were in a similar situation to Mr Mennitto , but had applied to the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG has upheld on many occasions the claims of other persons caring for disabled relatives .", "In its judgment no . CARDINAL , deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , it ruled :", "\u201c [ The ORG ] declares that the claimant is entitled to receive the allowance provided for in LAW ] ... ;", "Orders the respondent authority to pay the sum in question ... \u201d", "In that decision and in others ( such as judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and judgments ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE and DATE ) the ORG gave the following reasons for its ruling :", "\u201c [ LAW ] makes adoption of the decision to grant the allowance subject , among other requirements , to verification that beneficiaries satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions . When such verification had been made , determination of the amount to be paid should have required no more than a simple arithmetical calculation ...", "In the light of these principles ... , exercise of the discretionary power pleaded by the ORG has no bearing on the case , since otherwise it would be possible for an administrative decision to replace an assessment already ineluctably made by the legislature ... \u201d", "After finding that PERSON ( the relative of the claimant in that case ) was PERCENT disabled and required constant assistance , which was why , following tests carried out by the respondent authority , his name had been placed on the list of qualifying beneficiaries , the ORG ruled that there was an obligation to pay the allowance .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON , ruling on the question of determination of the amount of the allowance , held that the Region could not be absolved from the obligation to make available to each ORG a sum earmarked for families providing direct care to disabled persons and sufficiently large to ensure that each of these families would be able to receive the amount of allowance prescribed by law ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "In its judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON ruled that the amount of the allowance for families caring directly for disabled persons , in so far as it was fixed by law , could not suffer any reduction by the administrative authority , which in this matter had no discretion whatever with regard to quantum , and that that conclusion was not in contradiction with the nature of the legitimate interest of the disabled person 's family ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
