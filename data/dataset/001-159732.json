The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case as submitted by the parties can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE tax authorities ( ORG [ ORG ] in GPE ) discovered \u2013 primarily from a complaint lodged by a former employee of the ORG bank in GPE responsible for asset management for the bank \u2019s private NORP DATE that CARDINAL of GPE taxpayers held ORG bank accounts which had not been declared to their national authorities or else held economic rights in respect of such accounts .", "Owing to the role which it had apparently played in that connection , the bank faced a risk of criminal prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deferred prosecution agreement ( ORG ) was concluded between ORG and ORG ( ORG ) . In this document the bank acknowledged that it had , in particular , allowed GPE taxpayers to use off - shore accounts to conceal their assets and income from the GPE tax authorities and had met with and provided on - the - spot advice , in GPE , to customers who had not declared their accounts to the ORG . It was agreed that proceedings could be dropped in return for a settlement amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG brought a civil action ( a so - called \u201c PERSON summons \u201d [ PERSON ] ) requesting a formal order to ORG to reveal the identities of its CARDINAL NORP customers and to communicate data on their bank accounts .", "CARDINAL . GPE was concerned that the dispute between the GPE authorities and ORG might give rise to a conflict between NORP and GPE law should the ORG obtain that information , and the civil proceedings were therefore suspended pending extra - judicial reconciliation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with a view to identifying the taxpayers in question , ORG ) of ORG and GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) concluded an \u201c Agreement concerning the request by ORG of GPE relating to the NORP company ORG \u201d ( \u201c Agreement CARDINAL \u201d ) ...", "Under DATE CARDINAL GPE undertook to deal with the GPE request for mutual assistance concerning ORG NORP customers in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Appendix to that Agreement and , moreover , in conformity with LAW between GPE and GPE on double taxation ( ORG - US CARDINAL ) ...", "Drawing on those criteria , the parties to Agreement DATE considered that the request for mutual assistance concerned \u201c CARDINAL open or closed accounts \u201d .", "GPE further undertook to set up a \u201c special task force \u201d enabling ORG ( ORG ) to reach its final decisions in the framework of the mutual assistance request within a specific timescale .", "In return , the Agreement provided that GPE and ORG would submit to ORG for LOC of GPE a joint request for the discontinuance of the request for enforcement of the \u201c PERSON Summons \u201d ( see LAW DATE ) ...", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted a mutual assistance request to the ORG with a view to obtaining information on GPE taxpayers who , DATE and DATE , had had \u201c authority to sign or other access rights to \u201d bank accounts \u201c held , supervised or maintained by a section of ORG or by CARDINAL of its branches or subsidiaries in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered ORG to provide information for the purposes of the CARDINAL DATE Order concerning ORG October CARDINAL on double taxation ( ORG - US CARDINAL ) ... The ORG decided to instigate a mutual assistance procedure and requested that ORG provide , in particular , complete files on the customers mentioned in LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ( A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ( ORG ) accepted an appeal against a decision taken by the ORG which concerned , in the framework of LAW DATE , a challenge falling within the category defined in paragraph CARDINAL/A / b . In its reasoning , the ORG held that :", "\u2013 Agreement DATE was a mutual agreement which should remain within the framework set out by the convention on which it depended , ORG - US CARDINAL ;", "\u2013 under the terms of the aforementioned convention , mutual assistance was granted in cases of tax fraud , but not in cases of tax evasion ( that is to say the mere failure to declare a bank account to the tax authorities ; regarding this distinction under NORP tax law ... ;", "\u2013 accordingly ORG - US CARDINAL only facilitated exchange of information in cases of \u201c fraud or a similar offence \u201d for the purposes of NORP law , that is to say tax swindle ( tax evasion by dint of \u201c creative accountancy \u201d ) or document forgery ;", "\u2013 having regard to the obligations which it imposed on GPE , that agreement should have taken the form of an international treaty ratified by ORG and been put to an \u201c optional referendum \u201d ;", "\u2013 accordingly , the form of a mere friendly agreement concluded by ORG on its own had been insufficient .", "Consequently , ORG voided the decisions given by the ORG on the basis of Agreement DATE .", "CARDINAL . The entry into force of that ORG judgment of DATE called into question the application of Agreement DATE .", "Indeed , out of the CARDINAL individual cases covered by that agreement CARDINAL concerned situations of long - term tax evasion of enormous proportions . ORG considered that an inability to provide mutual aid in such cases could create major difficulties for GPE in its bilateral relations with GPE . ORG deemed likely that GPE would impose compensatory measures , and that the minimum they could expect was that the GPE would reactivate the enforcement procedure in respect of the ORG customers through mutual assistance channels . ORG were concerned that an NORP court might then order ORG to provide the ORG with the data in question and force the judgment through by dint of extremely high coercive fines .", "On DATE , in order to prevent such a development , after fresh negotiations with GPE , ORG concluded a \u201c LAW amending the Agreement between GPE and GPE concerning the ORG \u2019s request for information on the Swiss company ORG , signed in GPE on DATE \u201d , referred to as \u201c LAW \u201d .", "The provisions of that protocol were incorporated into LAW . They became provisionally applicable on DATE of its signature by the parties .", "CARDINAL . By Federal Decree of DATE \u201c approving the Agreement between GPE and GPE concerning the request for information regarding ORG , as well as the LAW amending that LAW , ORG ( ORG ) approved Agreement DATE and LAW , and gave ORG leave to ratify them .", "The consolidated version of Agreement DATE as amended under LAW is sometimes referred to as \u201c LAW \u201d ...", "The aforementioned Federal Decree stated that the optional referendum mentioned in LAW in respect of certain international treaties concluded by GPE ... was not available in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered judgment in a pilot case ( A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the validity of LAW . In that judgment the ORG ruled that :", "\u2013 Convention CARDINAL was fully binding on it within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the LAW ... ;", "\u2013 there was no substantive hierarchy in international law ( apart from the pre - eminence of jus cogens ) ; accordingly , Convention CARDINAL held the same status as ORG - US CARDINAL ;", "\u2013 as ORG - US CARDINAL , like the Convention ( for ORG ) and LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , had been adopted prior to LAW , its provisions were only applicable insofar as they were compatible with the rules of DATE , because LAW took precedence by virtue of its posteriority .", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted the applicant \u2019s file to the ORG on DATE .", "In its final decision of DATE , the ORG ruled that all the conditions had been met for granting mutual assistance to the ORG and ordering the communication to it of the documents published by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against that decision .", "By judgment of DATE , without assessing the actual lawfulness of the decision of DATE , the court set it aside , noting that the applicant \u2019s right to a hearing had been flouted . Consequently , it referred the case back to the ORG , inviting it to allow the applicant to submit his observations and to give a fresh decision on affording the GPE authorities mutual assistance in his case .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE the ORG notified a deadline of DATE for the applicant to forward any observations before the issuing of a fresh decision .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a statement of his position on the matter .", "In its final decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG once again held that all the requisite conditions were fulfilled for granting the ORG mutual assistance and ordering ORG to communicate the requested documents to the GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . He complained , in substance , of a lack of any legal basis for the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , as well as of the violation of the LAW and other international treaties , owing , in particular , to noncompliance with the prohibition of the retroactivity of laws and non - respect for his right to respect for his private life , the presumption of innocence , the principle of equality and non - discrimination , and his right to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . Determining as the final domestic instance , ORG delivered judgment on DATE .", "It first of all held , in substance , that Convention CARDINAL was binding on the NORP authorities , considering that they did not have to verify its conformity with Federal law and previous conventions .", "Secondly , with reference to the pilot case A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG set out the following reasoning :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning ORG does not relate to the grant of mutual assistance . It is merely a decision whereby the lower - level authority requested information from ORG for the purposes of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG - US CARDINAL . Therefore , it may be accepted that Agreement DATE , in relation with the aforementioned provision , constituted a sufficient legal basis for the ORG to take a decision against ORG , requiring , in particular , the handover of the complete files of customers covered by LAW DATE . That being the case , the appellant \u2019s complaint is ill - founded .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . In the pilot case A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE this court found that LAW was binding on the NORP authorities . No derogation to it was possible under domestic law or in the authorities\u2019 domestic practice . It was stated that Article CARDINAL [ of the LAW ] required the authorities to apply international law , which includes LAW , and that \u2013 in any event \u2013 the conformity of international law with LAW legislation could not be assessed where the international law in question was more recent . ORG thus accepted that LAW should be applied , even if it was contrary to LAW see ORG judgment ACARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL and the references therein ; see also ORG judgments A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and the references therein , A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , point CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and ORG DATE , point CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL With particular regard to the relationship between the different conventions ( Convention CARDINAL , ORG - US CARDINAL [ in particular LAW thereof ] , the ORG [ in particular LAW thereof ] and LAW [ in particular LAW thereof ] ) , the court pointed out that that relationship was established pursuant solely to the rules set out in LAW on GPE of DATE ( ORG ) and that there was no substantive hierarchy in international law ( apart from the pre - eminence of jus cogens ) . This court therefore considered that the rules of LAW took precedence over the other provisions of international law , including LAW and LAW , as the latter CARDINAL provisions did not comprise jus cogens . It did , however , find that even if LAW were applicable , the conditions set out in LAW , which permits restrictions on the right to respect for private and family life , were fulfilled . Convention CARDINAL was indeed a sufficient legal basis under the case - law of ORG . Furthermore , GPE \u2019s major interests and the interest of being able to honour the country \u2019s international commitments took precedence over the individual interests of the persons concerned by the mutual assistance agreement to keep their pecuniary situation secret ...", "CARDINAL This court also stated , in judgment A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL cited above , that LAW ( no punishment without law ) was not relevant to mutual assistance procedures . That provision was , exceptionally , applicable in the framework of NORP mutual assistance procedure if the person concerned by the assistance was threatened , in the requesting ORG , with proceedings in breach of LAW ... That was not the situation in the present case ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL This court has also held that the parties to an international agreement are free to provide expressly or implicitly for the retroactive application of such agreement ... Moreover , procedural rules could be applied retroactively to previous events , because the prohibition of non - retroactivity only applied to substantive criminal law , not to procedural law , which included provisions on mutual assistance ... Furthermore , the parties to LAW had wished to characterise differently the facts which had occurred prior to the signature of Agreement DATE , which was commonly referred to as \u2018 retroactive effect\u2019 . That wish to apply Agreement DATE which had become Convention DATE with retroactive effect transpired clearly from the criteria for granting mutual assistance as set out in LAW . Even though the parties had specified , in LAW , that that instrument would come into force on the date of its signature , they had wished that retroactive effect to prevail ...", "CARDINAL . In the present case it should be noted , in the light of the aforementioned judgments , that the following objections as to the validity and applicability of LAW can be discarded without further ado : incompatibility with the ORG and other international treaties , violation of the principle of the prohibition of the retroactivity of laws ( see LAW and LAW ) , and violation of the right to respect for private life ( see LAW ) . Furthermore , contrary to the appellant \u2019s opinion , LAW is in fact a sufficient legal basis for granting mutual assistance , notwithstanding the failure to put it to a referendum ( which is optional ) . Finally , even though GPE was unable \u2013 in this specific case DATE to obtain the same information under its own legislation , it is still bound by its international commitments and must grant mutual assistance where the requisite conditions have been met .", "CARDINAL . The appellant further submitted that LAW breached the principles of equality and non - discrimination by solely penalising CARDINAL specific category of persons , that is to say ORG customers . He claimed that LAW only applied to ORG customers and not to those of other banks . The appellant relied on LAW , LAW , LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of DATE on ORG I ; ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) and LAW and CARDINAL of UN Covenant II .", "As stated above , this court can not verify the conformity of LAW with LAW and Federal legislation . That legislation , moreover , overrides any previous international agreements to the contrary ( see point CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL above ) . Therefore , LAW must be applied even if it establishes different legal regulations for ORG customers as compared with the customers of other banks ( see ORG judgment A-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On those grounds , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a public - law appeal with ORG , submitting that the considerations set out in the judgment challenged solely concerned mutual assistance in criminal matters and were not relevant to administrative mutual assistance .", "By judgment of DATE that court declared the appeal inadmissible , mainly with reference to a judgment of DATE ( ATF CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) , which had found that appeals against ORG decisions given pursuant to ORG and subsequent agreements concluded with GPE fell within the scope of administrative mutual assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the banking data concerning the applicant were transmitted to the GPE tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE , the ORG invited the applicant to inform it of the subsequent developments in the case , and , in particular , to give a brief summary of any consequences or any criminal penalties imposed personally and effectively on him in GPE following the disclosure of his banking data as ordered by ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated that he was not currently in a position to respond to the ORG \u2019s request .", "By letter of DATE the applicant pointed out that the GPE authorities were still conducting their tax inspection and that he had not yet been charged with any criminal offence .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
