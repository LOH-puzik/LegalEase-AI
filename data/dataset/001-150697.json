He was working as a fisherman off his home village of GPE , which is located on the seafront at the north - westernmost point of GPE , close to the border with GPE .", "CARDINAL . Early in DATE ORG in GPE ( \u201c the RBS \u201d ) registered numerous incursions into NORP waters in LOC by NORP fishermen \u2019s vessels . In all cases it informed the NORP border authorities , and the problem was discussed during a bilateral meeting on DATE .

As this did not make the \u00d6mer Reis-CARDINAL stop , and seeing that its crew continued behaving aggressively , attempting to puncture and sink the coastguard boat , Chief Inspector PERSON ordered his officers to board the fishing vessel .", "CARDINAL . The coastguards were wearing armoured life jackets , which did not permit them to also wear holsters . That is why , upon boarding the \u00d6mer Reis-CARDINAL , they attached their weapons , Scorpio sub - machine guns , to special metal rings on their jackets . As ordered by Chief Inspector PERSON , the guns had their safety catches on . None of the guards had a gun in their hand .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON was the first one to board the fishing vessel , followed by Officer PERSON Their task was to immobilise and handcuff PERSON .

Finally , Officer PERSON managed to immobilise PERSON and handcuff him . By that time another officer , ORG , had immobilised PERSON , and Officer PERSON was struggling with PERSON at the helm , attempting to stop the vessel . Chief Inspector PERSON had remained in the coastguard boat . At this point Chief Inspector PERSON received information that the CARDINAL boats were about to enter NORP territorial waters , and ordered his men to release the fishermen .", "CARDINAL . While Officer PERSON was removing PERSON handcuffs , the latter made sudden abrupt movements , pushing the officer back on to the fishing nets . PERSON immediately jumped forward . At the exact moment when he put his hands on PERSON , CARDINAL gunshots were heard . Officer PERSON heard PERSON groan and looked at his gun . It was between his legs ( he was kneeling ) , entangled in the fishing nets , its muzzle pointing towards PERSON \u2019s back . He took it and saw that it was set at automatic fire .

Officer PERSON stated that before boarding the fishing vessel he had been hit by one of the fishermen with a boathook . He had not heard the shots which had injured PERSON because at that moment he had been wrestling with PERSON \u2019s brother PERSON . He explained that he and his colleagues had been trained to respond to similar situations . Lastly , he said that he was very familiar with Scorpio sub - machine guns .", "CARDINAL . The group \u2019s commander , Chief Inspector PERSON , said that he had judged Scorpio sub - machine guns the most appropriate weapons to take for the operation because of their versatility .

Zayim and LOC were interviewed on DATE . They stated that they had not obeyed the coastguards\u2019 order to stop because they believed that they were still in NORP territorial waters .", "CARDINAL . They were interviewed again on DATE . PERSON stated that he and his brother PERSON had not attempted to resist arrest . ORG said once again that he believed that the vessel had not left NORP territorial waters . Once the coastguard boat had approached , he had aimed to prevent a clash with it .

The CARDINAL officers who had been on duty at the observation station in GPE in TIME of DATE were interviewed on DATE . They explained that they had observed the PERSON movements , and had kept Chief Inspector PERSON informed of them .

A post - mortem examination of PERSON body was carried out on DATE . It found CARDINAL gunshot wounds , situated close to each other , in the middle part of the back . The bullets had touched the heart , the liver , the lungs and the small intestines , thus causing death . There was another wound on PERSON head , caused by a hard object , which was unrelated to the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . Zayim and LOC were examined by a doctor on DATE . He observed a number of small bruises on their bodies . In addition , PERSON had a black eye and a small cut close to the left eyebrow .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON was examined on DATE . Both his hands were bruised and swollen .", "CARDINAL . A ballistics report was drawn up on DATE . It confirmed that the shots which had fatally wounded PERSON had been fired by the gun used by Officer PERSON , and concluded that they had been fired at a distance of CARDINAL . A combined medico - ballistic expert report dated DATE showed in addition that at the moment of the fatal shots PERSON had been lying on his right side , with the upper part of his body bent forwards . The report concluded further that the lethal shots had been fired within a very short time frame .", "CARDINAL . Several reconstructions of the scene of the incident staged on board the \u00d6mer Reis-CARDINAL showed that Officer PERSON \u2019s gun could have fired a shot without anyone touching the trigger , if it was entangled in the fishing nets and at the moment when Officer PERSON was thrusting his body abruptly forwards . It was also shown to be possible , when the gun was being rubbed against a human body , for its switch to move to automatic mode . Lastly , it was shown that a shot could also be fired when the participant playing the role of the victim in the reconstruction attempted to grab the gun with his left arm stretched behind his back .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case brought charges against Officer PERSON for causing death through negligence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings , considering that Officer PERSON had not committed any offence and that PERSON death had been a fortuitous event .

The first and third applicants ( PERSON wife and mother ) , with the assistance of their legal representative in GPE , lodged an appeal . They argued that Officer PERSON had acted with criminal negligence . Upon their appeal , on DATE the decision of the prosecution was upheld by ORG .

The prosecutor resumed the investigation of the case and in a new decision of CARDINAL DATE discontinued the criminal proceedings . On the basis of the evidence described above he concluded that Officer PERSON had not himself pulled the trigger of his gun , and that the lethal shots had been fired when PERSON had touched it while wrestling with the officer during his repeated attempts to take hold of the gun , or after the trigger had become entangled in the fishing nets . Either way , PERSON death had been a fortuitous event , which Officer PERSON could not have foreseen or prevented . He had abided by the relevant safety rules , most notably by switching the gun \u2019s safety catch on before boarding the PERSON . It was also significant that PERSON and his brothers had violently resisted arrest .", "CARDINAL . The first and third applicants appealed , contesting in particular the conclusion that PERSON could have pulled the trigger himself . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decision , finding that it was not sufficiently reasoned , and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the prosecution against ORG decision , on CARDINAL DATE ORG finally upheld the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings . It found that the prosecutor \u2019s decision was well reasoned and that there was no indication that Officer PERSON had committed an offence . It also dismissed the first and third applicants\u2019 argument that Officer PERSON had been negligent because he had not been wearing a holster and , while struggling with PERSON , had left his gun hanging in front of him . It pointed out that Officer PERSON \u2019s health and life were in danger at the material time . Furthermore , he could not be held responsible for the fact that his gun had become unfastened from the ring on his jacket . The main responsibility for the incident was to be borne by PERSON , who had failed to obey the coastguards\u2019 lawful orders .", "CARDINAL . The bringing of charges against Officer PERSON on DATE sparked a wave of protests by NORP , who called the prosecutor in charge of the case \u201c a traitor \u201d and Officer PERSON \u201c a hero \u201d . Journalists in GPE created an \u201c initiative committee \u201d in defence of the officer and adopted a declaration , stating that the bringing of charges against him \u201c would have a demotivating effect \u201d on the border police . On unspecified dates in DATE this declaration was sent to ORG , the President of the Republic , the Speaker of ORG , and other bodies . The \u201c initiative committee \u201d also started collecting signatures in support of Officer PERSON According to reports in the local media CARDINAL people signed the petition .
