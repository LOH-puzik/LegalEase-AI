However , he was informed that he could not vote because he was not on the list of eligible voters . The applicant did not inquire further .", "In DATE the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to vote in the parliamentary elections . He was informed by a member of the electoral commission that he had been deprived of his civic rights pursuant to a court decision . The applicant wrote to ORG and ORG requesting an explanation for the refusal to allow him to vote . He received no reply .", "In DATE the applicant again unsuccessfully attempted to vote in the referendum on GPE \u2019s accession to the ORG . The applicant complained to ORG . He also lodged an electoral complaint ( protest wyborczy ) with ORG , claiming that he had been unlawfully deprived of the right to vote in the referendum . On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint . He also filed a criminal complaint with ORG , but the criminal proceedings were discontinued on an unspecified date .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought an action in LOC against the president of that court . He sought compensation in the amount of PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL for damage sustained in connection with the unjustified refusal to allow him to vote in the DATE presidential elections , the DATE parliamentary elections and the DATE referendum . The applicant submitted that on DATE the additional penalty of deprivation of his civic rights had come to an end . Nevertheless , as a result of an error committed by the ORG clerk his name had been put on the list of persons who had not been eligible to vote . The applicant claimed to have sustained damage because he could not exercise his constitutional rights and actively participate in elections .", "As regards the factual background to the applicant \u2019s claim , the court established that on CARDINAL DATE ORG had sentenced him to a term of imprisonment and an additional penalty of CARDINAL years\u2019 deprivation of his civic rights . The applicant finished serving the sentence of imprisonment on DATE . On DATE Elbl\u0105g Prison notified ORG that the applicant had been released . Subsequently , the period of deprivation of civic rights began to run . The relevant period came to an end on DATE . Despite this fact , and as a result of the error committed by the court clerk , the applicant \u2019s name was put on the list of disenfranchised persons in respect of the elections mentioned above . ORG adopted as its own the findings of the prosecution service , which found that the above error had resulted from negligence in the duty to duly verify the situation of each person who had been put on the list of disenfranchised persons .", "On DATE ORG awarded the applicant LAW ( approximately LAW ) and dismissed the remainder of his claim . It found that the applicant had been unjustifiably deprived of the right to vote in respect of all CARDINAL elections .", "ORG noted that the applicant had not claimed to have sustained any pecuniary damage in this respect . On the other hand , he was seeking some financial compensation in connection with the infringement of his personal rights .", "The court found that the right to vote could be considered as one of the personal rights protected under LAW . It held that that personal right had been unlawfully violated in the applicant \u2019s case ( \u201c ... dobro osobiste zosta\u0142o naruszone dzia\u0142aniem bezprawnym . ORG ta w niniejszej sprawie jest spe\u0142niona . \u201d ) . Having regard to the above , the court decided , contrary to the defendant \u2019s submission , that the applicant should be awarded non - pecuniary damages under LAW . However , it observed that the degree of intensity of the harm was very much a subjective question . When assessing the amount to be awarded for the infringement of his personal rights , it took into account the fact that the applicant was not active or interested in politics , and that accordingly his subjective feelings of harm could not have been particularly intense . The case would have been different had it involved a politician who had been deprived of the right to vote . The court further observed that the wrong had not been done intentionally and that the damage caused to the applicant had not been significant . It further noted that the consequences of the violation of the right to vote were limited to the emotional sphere . Having regard to all the relevant circumstances and , in particular , the nature of the right that had been violated and the fact that compensation for non - pecuniary damage should not lead to enrichment of the claimant , the court considered it reasonable to award the applicant LAW . It found the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claim for damages excessive .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against the first - instance judgment and contested the insufficient amount of the award . He further claimed that ORG had considered his right to vote to be of lesser importance when compared with the similar right of politicians .", "On DATE the ORG upheld ORG judgment . It endorsed for the most part the lower court \u2019s findings in respect of the amount of compensation awarded to the applicant and considered it proportionate to the damage sustained by the applicant . ORG noted that the amount awarded was higher than the minimum monthly salary ( PLN CARDINAL ) and the amount of unemployment benefit ( PLN MONEY ) . It found that when assessing the extent of harm ORG had correctly relied on the applicant \u2019s limited involvement in politics . Furthermore , the applicant had not established that his involvement in politics had been higher than average .", "ORG disagreed with ORG only in CARDINAL respect . It held , referring to LAW , that the fact that the breach of the applicant \u2019s rights had been unintentional was not relevant for the assessment of the defendant \u2019s liability . However , that shortcoming did not alter ORG decision .", "The applicant intended to lodge a cassation appeal with ORG . ORG appointed him a legal - aid lawyer to that end . However , on DATE his legal - aid lawyer informed the applicant in writing that he had found no grounds on which such an appeal could be based .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
