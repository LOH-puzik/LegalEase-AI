This was the applicant \u2019s situation , in that he was already charged with a murder and being accused of the second murder made a sentence of life imprisonment a possibility ... The ORG considers that the legal representation of the applicant during the period in question was required in the interests of justice .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ... t , if not solely , on these selfincriminating statements . The statements did not in fact contain any information which was not already known to the investigators ( in contrast to the case of the kidnapping and murder of PERSON , in which the applicant showed the police where the corpse had been hidden ) and had been received in unclear circumstances and in clear violation of the applicant \u2019s right to defence . \u201d ( PERSON , cited above )", "CARDINAL .

The lawyer made submissions to the court and a written summary of his remarks was submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the summary , after reiterating that the applicant \u2019s confessions and the reconstruction reports should be ruled inadmissible , the lawyer presented his analysis of the remaining evidence in the file . He dealt with the question of the evidence of the applicant \u2019s involvement in the attack on PERSON , seeking to show that it was either inadmissible or unreliable . In particular , he made the following arguments :", "( i ) the psychiatric report , in so far as it provided a record of the applicant \u2019s alleged statements about PERSON \u2019s murder , was unspecific and constituted a judgment by the experts about the applicant \u2019s statements which the experts had been unqualified to make , as opposed to an accurate record of those statements . In any case , it was improper to use that report since the psychiatrists had never been examined by the defence . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s supposed statements to the experts were inadmissible because they were marred by the same problems as the confessions that had been obtained in breach of his Convention rights ;", "( ii ) as to the other evidence , in particular the crime scene examination report and the witness evidence , it only had evidentiary value as corroboration for the applicant \u2019s statements , but as those statements had to be ruled inadmissible to give effect to the first PERSON judgment ( cited above ) , the other witness evidence could also not be used to support a finding of the applicant \u2019s guilt ;", "( iii ) certain circumstances , such as the fact that no traces of the applicant \u2019s presence had been found in PERSON \u2019s flat , pointed to the applicant being innocent of the murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its decision . It excluded the applicant \u2019s original confessions from the body of evidence . However , it found that the rest of the evidence in the case file was sufficient to support the trial court \u2019s finding that the applicant had murdered PERSON while trying to cover up an attempted robbery .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG approved of the trial court \u2019s reliance on : ( i ) evidence from the expert that it could not be ruled out that the victim \u2019s injuries had been caused by the knife found at the applicant \u2019s home , and ( ii ) the statements of the witnesses PERSON , GPE and \u201c others \u201d concerning the applicant \u2019s supposed motive for the murder ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of its findings ORG also referred to material and circumstances on which the trial court had not explicitly relied : ( i ) the fact that \u201c in the course of psychiatric assessment [ the applicant ] , told the experts about [ PERSON \u2019s murder ] under the circumstances established by the [ trial ] court \u201d ; ( ii ) the applicant \u2019s admission in court that he had visited the victim \u2019s flat ; and ( iii ) the testimony of PERSON , the victim \u2019s neighbour , that she had seen the applicant in the victim \u2019s block of flats .", "ORG concluded that , other than the breaches which led to the exclusion of the applicant \u2019s original confessions \u2019s conclusions were based on admissible and sufficient evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
