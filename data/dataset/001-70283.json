The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a member of ORG . The other CARDINAL applicants were his clients at the relevant time ( \u201c the client applicants \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police conducted a search \u2013 it is not entirely clear of which premises \u2013 based on the suspicion that the first applicant 's clients X and Y ( not client applicants before the ORG ) had committed aggravated debtor 's fraud . In the course of that search X managed to destroy the original of a promissory note which the police had attempted to seize and which may have been relevant to the financial arrangements underlying the suspected offence .", "CARDINAL . At the time the first applicant 's status in the investigation had been that of a witness . On DATE the police requested him to attend for questioning in this capacity . This request was apparently cancelled before he had taken any action thereon .", "CARDINAL . A police officer in charge of the criminal investigations granted a search warrant and on DATE CARDINAL officers of ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) , assisted by a tax inspector and an enforcement official ( ulosottomies , utm\u00e4tningsman ) , searched the first applicant 's law office , flat and vehicles . This search warrant was likewise based on the suspicion that NORP and Y had committed aggravated debtor 's fraud but the first applicant was now indicated as a suspect , namely that he had aided and abetted the offences by drafting certain documents .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of the warrant the search aimed at examining \u201c the documents , computers and archives of the law office \u201d as well as the first applicant 's flat and vehicles \u201c so as to investigate the share transactions by the limited liability company [ H. ] in DATE and to find material relating to those transactions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . During the search of his law office all of the first applicant 's client files were allegedly perused . The police also examined all floppy disks and examined his note books pertaining to his meetings with clients . In addition , the hard disks in the office computers were copied : CARDINAL were copied on the spot and CARDINAL computers , including the CARDINAL used by the first applicant himself , were seized for later disk - copying on police premises . Those computers were returned on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's computer also contained software for electronic mail , including his private and professional messages .", "CARDINAL . A fellow member of the Bar assisted the first applicant during part of the search .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE to revoke the seizure as being unlawful . On DATE the court nevertheless maintained it , noting that the first applicant was suspected of aiding and abetting aggravated debtor 's dishonesty .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of ORG upheld ORG decision and on DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the first applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police certified the return of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL hard disks and that they had destroyed any copies thereof . They stated however that they would retain a copy of the fourth hard disk until the lawfulness of the seizure had been finally decided or until the material could be destroyed for any other reason .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL of the applicants ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL) requested ORG to revoke the seizure of the copy of the fourth hard disk ( which contained material relating to their instructions to the first applicant ) and to order the police to compensate their costs . They argued that the seizure had been unlawful from the outset . At any rate , the copy in question was of no relevance to the pre - trial investigation concerning NORP and Y.", "CARDINAL . In its rejoinder ORG referred to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE in which the seizure had been found lawful . Moreover , the hard disks had only been subjected to a targeted search and they were able to search information concerning only relevant companies and individuals . Only the potentially relevant client files in the law office had been perused . The search and seizure had thus not been of wholesale nature . The tax and enforcement officials who had witnessed the search had been DATE and remained DATE under a duty to keep secret any information thereby obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG agreed with the CARDINAL client applicants and ordered that the copy of the fourth hard disk be returned . It rejected , as not being based on law , the applicants ' claim for compensation in respect of their costs . The applicants appealed on this point , whereas the police appealed against the revocation order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its submissions to ORG the National Bureau of Investigation listed the contents of the copied hard disk . For example , specific mention was made of what appears to have been the promissory note which the police had been looking for ( and had found ) . The submissions indicated the debtor 's and the creditor 's names as well as the amount of the debt . ORG furthermore explained that the material on the relevant hard disk had been copied to a so - called optical disk which could in any case not be returned as it also contained internal police data . The submissions by the ORG were apparently not ordered to be kept confidential .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to examine the parties ' appeals , considering that the matter had been resolved res judicata in the first set of proceedings ending with ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG granted leave to appeal to the CARDINAL client applicants in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor charged , among others , X and Y with aggravated debtor 's dishonesty but decided to press no charges against the first applicant , having found no evidence of any crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that although a final decision had already been rendered in respect of another appellant , it did not prevent the courts from examining similar appeals filed by other parties . The case was referred back to ORG which , on DATE , revoked ORG decision on the basis that the seizure had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL client applicants in question were again granted leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE it revoked the seizure in so far as it pertained to information which those applicants had given to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG found it undisputed that the copied hard disk contained information relating to the CARDINAL client applicants ' instructions to the first applicant . It had not been argued that this information was not protected by counsel 's secrecy obligation under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure . Nor did the information in question pertain to any suspicion that the first applicant or any one else had committed a crime .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that the police had been entitled by LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngsmedelslagen TIME ) to seize the first applicant 's hard disk and make a copy thereof . Technical reasons and practical needs ( the fact that the police had been obliged at the time of the search to copy the whole hard disk ) did not however permit any deviation from the prohibition on seizure of privileged material . The police should therefore have returned the computer files immediately or destroyed them . The appellants were awarded reasonable compensation for their costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Deputy Chancellor of ORG ( valtioneuvoston apulaisoikeuskansleri , justitiekansleradjointen i statsr\u00e5det ) issued his decision in response to a petition by ORG concerning , inter alia , the alleged unlawfulness of the coercive measures against the first applicant . He found it established that the tax inspector and the enforcement official had attended the search in their respective capacity as a witness and expert . He nevertheless concluded , inter alia , that from the point of view of foreseeability of domestic law , as required by LAW , the relationship between LAW ( LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) , LAW ( LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) and LAW ( section CARDINAL c ) was somewhat unclear and permitted very diverging interpretations as to the extent to which privileged material could be subject to search and seizure . The Deputy Chancellor therefore requested ORG to consider whether there was a need to amend the relevant legislation .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( GPE the police may conduct a search , inter alia , if there is reason to suspect that an offence has been committed and provided the maximum sentence applicable exceeds DATE imprisonment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .

In order for an object to qualify for seizure there must be a reason to presume that it may serve as evidence in the criminal proceedings , that it may have been removed from someone by a criminal offence or that the court may order its forfeiture ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A sealed letter or other private document which has been seized may only be opened by the head of investigation , by the prosecutor or by the court . In addition , only the investigators of the offence in question may examine such a document more closely . However , an expert or other person whose assistance is used in investigating the offence or who is otherwise heard in the case may examine the material , as directed by the head of investigation , by the prosecutor or by the court ( LAW , section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Whenever possible , the officer in charge shall call a witness to attend the search . If deemed necessary , the officer may also seek the assistance of an expert or other person ( LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The officer in charge may allow a complainant or his representative to attend a search in order to provide necessary information . The responsible officer must nonetheless ensure that a complainant or representative does not obtain any more information than necessary through the search ( LAW , DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Pre - trial LAW , only such evidence as may be considered relevant in the case shall be placed on record .", "CARDINAL . As regards other evidence , it is the respondent Government 's view that a police officer is under an obligation to respect the confidentiality requirement stipulated by LAW ( valtion virkamieslaki , statstj\u00e4nstemannalagen CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

In their book \u201c ORG - trial investigation and coercive measures \u201d ( ORG pakkokeinot , GPE , DATE ) PERSON , PERSON and PERSON state ( at page CARDINAL ) that in the legal literature and in police practice a principle has been consistently followed whereby a search may not be performed in order for investigators to obtain documents that are subject to a seizure prohibition .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of Justice appointed a ORG on ORG ( tietoverkkorikosty\u00f6ryhm\u00e4 , arbetsgruppen f\u00f6r IT brottslighet ) which also considered the question of searches and seizures of computer files and computers by the police .

Recommendation ( DATE ) CARDINAL of ORG to member states on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer provides , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Principle I - General principles on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer", "... CARDINAL . All necessary measures should be taken to ensure the respect of the confidentiality of the lawyer - client relationship . Exceptions to this principle should be allowed only if compatible with the rule of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Finlands Advokatf\u00f6rbund , LOC ) noted that the case did not meet a single criterion for the lawful execution of search and seizure as set out in the case law of ORG . Further , under NORP legislation , there are no provisions affording a legal remedy against a search warrant issued by the police . A search may be carried out on the premises of a person to whom a confidentiality obligation applies provided that the object to be seized may be found there . The threshold for the execution of a search is low in the extreme and the execution of a search in and of itself interferes with the right and obligation of secrecy of a person to whom a confidentiality obligation applies .", "CARDINAL . The wording of the instructions pertaining to the search in the present case was rather expansive and no attempt was made to attend to the advocate 's confidentiality obligation . Disregard of this obligation is particularly manifest in the participation of a tax inspector and an enforcement official in the search . The confidentiality obligation of advocates was also disregarded in respect of the seizures executed in connection with the search . The hard disks of the law office 's computers , floppy disks and several notebooks pertaining to meetings with clients were seized in connection with the latter search , in addition to which data on the office secretary 's computer was copied . Subsequent to the seizure , the material was not e.g. sealed and consigned for safekeeping until a court could rule on the lawfulness of the seizure .", "CARDINAL . NORP In terms of the confidentiality obligation , the possibility of submitting the issue of a seizure to the court for review as provided for in LAW had in this case remained a dead letter . All the information deemed confidential by the advocate and his clients had been disclosed prior to the court proceedings , as the authorities examined the seized material without waiting for a court to rule on the issue .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further maintained that the police could have availed themselves of the procedure provided for in LAW , wherein the searched material would have been examined by an outside advocate who would have determined which material was related to the pre - trial investigation being conducted by the police and which was not . This procedure would have allowed for the upholding of the advocate 's confidentiality obligation as well as the client 's right to confidentiality ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
