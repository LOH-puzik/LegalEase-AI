According to the applicant , in DATE employees of the ORG approached him with oral demands to give up his house and , in compensation , to accept an occupancy voucher ( ya\u015fay\u0131\u015f orderi ) for a new CARDINAL - room flat measuring QUANTITY m under construction on LOC , an area previously occupied by a relocated cemetery . When the applicant asked to be shown the lawful basis for the demands , he was told that it was a \u201c Government instruction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant refused , stating that he had no intention of relinquishing his house . He noted that , in any event , for this to be possible he would require prior monetary compensation equal to the market value of the house and the plot of land underneath the house .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , his neighbours faced the same situation and many of them gave in to the ORG \u2019s pressure . They moved out and accepted the occupancy vouchers offered to them . Soon the authorities began demolishing their houses . With large - scale demolition works in the neighbourhood ( including the destruction of some walls and fences adjacent or immediately next to the applicant \u2019s house ) , accompanied by power cuts and the accumulation of debris around his house , the applicant and his family no longer found it possible to stay in it and had to leave the house in DATE . However , the applicant \u2019s mother remained in the house .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE the ORG evicted his mother and began demolishing his house . The house was demolished over an unspecified number of DATE , together with the applicant \u2019s belongings that remained inside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a court action with ORG against the ORG . The applicant asked the court to stop the defendant from breaching his right to enjoy his private property , to order the restoration of the property to its previous condition or , if that was no longer possible , to order the defendant to pay him CARDINAL NORP manats ( AZN ) for pecuniary damage , AZN CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage , and AZN CARDINAL DATE for damages in respect of lost opportunity from DATE until the date of execution of the judgment . Subsequently , the ORG , ORG and PERSON were joined to the case as co - defendants together with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its reply to the applicant \u2019s lawsuit , the ORG responded that the relocation of the residents from the applicant \u2019s neighbourhood was being conducted in connection with \u201c the important ORG project \u201d approved by the ORG order of DATE . As a legal basis for that order the ORG indicated the old DATE LAW which had been in effect until DATE ( on that date it was replaced by the new Housing Code ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the court to order an expert evaluation of the market value of the applicant \u2019s house ( which had already been demolished ) and the CARDINAL - room flat offered to the applicant in compensation . The applicant opposed this request , noting , inter alia , that the determination of the new flat \u2019s market value was irrelevant since he had refused to accept it as lawful compensation and since the subject of his claim was the unlawfulness of the interference with his private property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an order for an expert evaluation . The applicant challenged this order , relying on various grounds . After a series of appeals , the order was quashed pursuant to a ORG decision of DATE and a ORG of Appeal decision of DATE , on the ground that the first - instance court had designated an incorrect category of expert for the evaluation requested . No further expert evaluations were ordered .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . In the legal analysis part of the judgment the court first confirmed that the house had been in the applicant \u2019s private ownership . It noted , however , that the applicant had not formalised his ownership rights over the plot of land and therefore could not make any claims in respect of the land .", "CARDINAL . The court also took note of the ORG order of DATE . It further noted that DATE the ORG and ORG had corresponded with each other concerning \u201c problems \u201d in relocating the residents of \u201c old , hostel - type houses and squatter houses \u201d in the applicant \u2019s neighbourhood and that on DATE the ORG had decided to contract a private company ( PERSON ) to construct new residential buildings for those residents in a vacant area previously occupied by a relocated cemetery . The court noted that the applicant had been \u201c given \u201d a CARDINAL - room flat in CARDINAL of these new buildings , under an occupancy voucher issued in his name on DATE pursuant to the ORG order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court cited LAW concerning the expropriation of private property for ORG needs , although it attempted neither to establish the applicability of that provision to the applicant \u2019s situation nor to determine whether the applicant had been deprived of his house in compliance with its requirements .", "CARDINAL . The court further relied on various provisions of the old DATE LAW , which had been in effect until DATE . The court noted that the DATE LAW was still in force at the time when the applicant had been issued with an occupancy voucher on DATE . In particular , the court cited Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , QUANTITY , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , concerning the rules on the provision to citizens of accommodation in residential buildings belonging to \u201c the ORG housing fund \u201d or \u201c the public housing fund \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the ORG order of DATE was \u201c in force \u201d and that the issuance of an occupancy voucher in the applicant \u2019s name for a CARDINAL - room flat in a newly constructed building constituted \u201c compensation in kind \u201d for his house within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . For these reasons , the court found that the applicant \u2019s claim that the GPE actions had been unlawful was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , although the order of CARDINAL DATE for an expert evaluation had been quashed , the ORG had nevertheless procured and presented to the court an \u201c expert report \u201d which estimated the market value of the new flat proposed to the applicant as being higher than that of his old house . The court considered that the compensation given to the applicant was fair because the new flat , with a total surface area of CARDINAL sq . m , was larger than the applicant \u2019s house and had a higher market value . Therefore , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage , seeking payment of the market value of his house in cash , was also unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The court then proceeded to reject the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damage , finding that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had suffered any moral damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , raising , inter alia , the following arguments :", "( a ) although the first - instance court had based its decision on the premise that the applicant \u2019s house had been expropriated for public needs , it did not address the fact that this \u201c expropriation \u201d had not complied with the applicable requirements of the LAW and the relevant provisions of LAW ( in particular , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ;", "( b ) the de facto deprivation of property had been unlawful as there had been no expropriation order issued in accordance with the procedure specified by law ; in particular , the reasons for the expropriation given by the defendants in the court proceedings did not fall under any of the lawful grounds for expropriation specified by the law and there had been no expropriation order issued by ORG as required by the law ; in such circumstances , the applicant had been arbitrarily deprived of his property ;", "( c ) the first - instance court had incorrectly relied on various provisions of the old DATE LAW which had no longer been in force at the time of the interference ( which , according to the applicant , had taken place in DATE , at the time of the demolition of the house ) ; and", "( d ) the part of the judgment concerning the dismissal of his claim to the plot of land was unlawful , as the right of ownership over the plots of land underneath privately owned houses had been granted to their respective owners by the regulations approved by LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; therefore , he was the lawful owner of the plot of land by virtue of his ownership of the house , even though he had not formally registered his ownership rights over it .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions to ORG , the ORG noted among other things that , because the applicant had refused to accept the CARDINAL - room flat offered to him as compensation , the ORG had issued him with occupancy vouchers for CARDINAL other flats ( a CARDINAL - room flat and a CARDINAL - room flat ) in the same newly constructed building . However , for unexplained reasons , these CARDINAL occupancy vouchers were both dated DATE , DATE as the date of issuance of the voucher for the CARDINAL - room flat that had originally been proposed ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG essentially repeated ORG reasoning and upheld that court \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , with the exception of the part of the judgment rejecting the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage . In that part , ORG quashed the judgment and ordered that the applicant be given the CARDINAL new flats on A.M. Cuma Street ( the CARDINAL - room flat and the CARDINAL - room flat , instead of the single CARDINAL - room flat offered earlier ) as \u201c compensation for pecuniary damage \u201d , and instructed the ORG to deal with the formalities of transferring the flats to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , reiterating the points of his previous appeal and further elaborating on them . In particular , he argued as follows :", "( a ) although his claim specifically sought only to establish the unlawfulness of the destruction of his house within the meaning of the applicable law , as well as to secure payment of monetary compensation for that unlawful action , the courts had ignored his claim and failed to assess the lawfulness of the interference with his property rights ; instead , they had forced him to accept as \u201c compensation \u201d the flats given to him by the defendants ( first the CARDINAL - room flat , then the CARDINAL - room and CARDINAL - room flats ) , which he had repeatedly and lawfully refused to accept as lawful compensation ;", "( b ) the interference with his property had taken place in DATE and therefore LAW was not applicable to his situation ; in any event , even the provisions of that Code cited by the courts had been misapplied , as those provisions concerned accommodation in \u201c the ORG and public housing funds \u201d and not privately owned houses and flats ;", "( c ) the courts had also misapplied ORG decision of DATE , because that decision concerned the local executive authorities\u2019 and municipalities\u2019 competence in respect of buildings constructed on plots of land occupied without authorisation ; however , in the applicant \u2019s case , the land comprising the yard attached to the house was lawfully his to use by virtue of his ownership of the house ; moreover , he had been entitled to acquire private ownership of the land free of charge in accordance with the applicable legislation ;", "( d ) the courts\u2019 reliance on an \u201c expert report \u201d presented by the ORG was unacceptable , as that document had been written not by a qualified expert but by an unqualified person with no relevant credentials , was not based on relevant property valuation standards , used arbitrary figures and contained numerous mistakes ;", "( e ) NORP under the relevant legislation , privately owned property could be lawfully alienated in favour of the State by way of ( i ) expropriation for ORG needs , subject to prior payment of compensation as required by LAW \u00a7 IV of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; or ( ii ) purchase of the property by the ORG , with the owner \u2019s consent , in accordance with ORG DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) ; or ( iii ) other specific situations provided for in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; however , none of the above procedures had been complied with and the courts had failed to provide any legal or factual assessment in that regard ;", "( f ) the interference with his property rights had also been in breach of , inter alia , LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant insisted that he had been unlawfully deprived of his house and that , despite his consistent and lawful refusals to accept as compensation any new flats that he did not want , the lower courts had essentially forced him to accept this unlawful compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE , reiterating that judgment \u2019s reasoning . ORG decision did not address any of the applicant \u2019s arguments in detail ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
