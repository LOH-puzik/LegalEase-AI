{"ITEMID": "001-68707", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "JARVI-ERISTYS OY v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP limited liability company . Before the ORG it was represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant bought QUANTITY of copper in GPE and paid for it in cash with GPE dollars . During the customs clearance the NORP customs authorities found that the information noted in a bill of consignment was false insofar as the identity of the seller company and the buyer company were concerned . Furthermore , a certain other company was mentioned in the false documents as a forwarding company . The signature of FAC , operational manager of that company , had been forged in those documents . None of these companies had anything to do with the freight . It also appeared that the seller did not have a licence to sell the copper even though such a licence was obligatory when exporting copper from GPE .", "The NORP customs issued a prohibition of transfer of the copper and reported the case to the police . It appears that in DATE the NORP authorities announced that the copper had been stolen in GPE . The owner of the applicant company was suspected of aggravated concealment of illegally obtained goods and of having forged the bill of consignment .", "On DATE the NORP customs authorities informed the NORP police that the NORP company which purported to sell the copper to the applicant did not exist . The NORP managing director who had supposedly signed the contract and the company from which the NORP seller had purported to buy the copper did not exist , either . As the copper had not been sold legally in GPE and as it had been illegally exported to GPE , the NORP authorities claimed that GPE was its legal owner and that it had to be returned to GPE .", "By a letter of DATE , Inspector PERSON from LOC informed the NORP customs that according to the pre - trial investigation carried out into the matter , and on the basis of reports obtained from GPE concerning the identification of the copper , GPE was the legal owner of the copper . He stated that there were no obstacles on the part of the police to returning the copper to its legal owner . The applicant argued that the letter had the character of a decision . The Government argued that the purpose of the letter was to communicate information to the custom authorities .", "On DATE , after the pre - trial investigation had been completed , the matter was transferred to a public prosecutor for consideration of charges . On DATE the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the owner of the applicant company as there was no evidence supporting the allegations that the copper had been stolen or that he had known that the bill of consignment had been forged .", "Meanwhile , in DATE and DATE the applicant company instituted civil proceedings before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) against ORG and GPE , respectively , requesting that the prohibition of transfer be revoked and that ORG confirm that the applicant company was the legal owner of the copper . In its decision of DATE ORG found that it was not competent to examine the request that the prohibition of transfer be revoked . As to the ownership issue ORG considered , taking into account that no one had ever claimed that ORG was the legal owner of the copper , that it could not be considered a party to the proceedings . Thus , the claims made against ORG could not be examined . Insofar as GPE had claimed the ownership of the copper but had not made any submissions to ORG , the court found that it had no competence to examine an issue concerning a foreign ORG 's ownership rights , being prevented by the international principles concerning the foreign sovereign states ' immunities . It appears that the applicant company appealed and that on DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the decision .", "Meanwhile on DATE , the applicant company requested that the customs authorities hand over the copper . DATE the forwarding agency informed the applicant company that the copper had been sold on to a NORP company by GPE in co - operation with the NORP customs .", "On DATE , the applicant company instituted civil proceedings for public - sector liability for damages under LAW ( vahingonkorvauslaki ; skadest\u00e5ndslagen ; CARDINAL ) against ORG , claiming the amount of MONEY ( equivalent to ORG CARDINAL ) as compensation for the lost copper . It argued that the ORG was liable for the damage as a police officer , PERSON , when acting as public authority , had overstepped his powers in ordering that the copper be returned to GPE even though there was no proof that it had been stolen .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant 's claims , finding that the police officer in question had been entitled to agree with the findings of the NORP authorities that the copper had been stolen , having regard to the fact that the bill of consignment was forged , that the purchase price amounted to CARDINAL of the copper 's real value and was paid in cash , that the company 's representative did not know the identity of the seller 's representatives , that the driver had been instructed to visit the customs authorities at a precise time and that the applicant company 's representatives had not contacted the seller to sort things out following the prohibition of transfer . These circumstances warranted the conclusion that there was something shady and secret about the purchase . The wording of the police officer 's communication to the customs indicating that there was no obstacle to returning the copper to GPE did not , however , decide the question of the ownership of the copper . As the copper had most probably been stolen in GPE , the applicant company had , in accordance with LAW ( rikoslain voimaanpanemisesta annettu asetus , f\u00f6rordningen om inf\u00f6rande av strafflagen ) , been obliged to return the copper to its legal owner without compensation . In accordance with the said provision , the applicant was entitled to seek compensation from the seller of the copper or from the person who had stolen it . Insofar as the ORG had argued that the applicant company , prior to commencing an action for compensation , should have appealed against the customs ' decision with a view to minimising any possible damage , ORG noted that the applicant had no interest in demanding a written decision as to the refusal to customs clear the copper delivery and to appeal against such a decision , as the company had considered that the customs ' actions so far had been justified .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c If a dispute arises concerning an item that has been stolen , ... from its previous holder , and if the one who has become the holder of the item proves that he received it in good faith , the holder of the item in dispute shall be obliged to hand it over without compensation and may seek compensation from the person he received the item from or from the person through whose offence he received it . \u201d", "According to the amended section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; as in force at the relevant time ) of LAW ( tullilaki , tullagen ) , a decision of the district customs office could be appealed against to ORG . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , unless otherwise provided , a decision of ORG may be appealed against to ORG in accordance with the provisions of ORG ( muutoksenhausta hallintoasioissa annettu laki , lagen om \u00e4ndringss\u00f6kande i f\u00f6rvaltnings\u00e4renden ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time .", "According to section CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW ) , as in force at the time , a person had the right of possession of goods if he was their importer , exporter or owner or otherwise had possession or control over the goods .", "According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; tulliasetus , tullf\u00f6rordningen ) , as in force at the time , the customs authorities had to ensure , to the extent possible , that the goods were delivered to the person who has a lawful right of possession in respect of them .", "According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW a person , who has suffered injury or damage owing to an erroneous decision by a state or municipal authority and without an acceptable reason has failed to appeal against the said decision , shall not be entitled to damages from the state or the municipality for injury or damage that could have been avoided by appealing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
