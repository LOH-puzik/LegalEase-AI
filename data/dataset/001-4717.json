{"ITEMID": "001-4717", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "VERNON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and resides in GPE . He is represented by PERSON , Solicitors , from GPE .", "In DATE , the applicant witnessed the tragic death by drowning of his CARDINAL young children when the car they were in , being driven by their nanny , went into a river . The applicant had previously experienced some psychological instability in his life , but , following the accident , he began to manifest symptoms of ORG . From being a successful businessman , he became unemployable , and the relationship with his wife broke down . In DATE , they were divorced .", "In DATE , a writ was issued in an action for damages for personal injury against the driver of the vehicle . The action was set down for trial on the application of the Defence in DATE . The initial estimate for the length of the trial was DATE . The trial began on DATE . After DATE , the applicant as plaintiff was still giving evidence . He was in the witness box for DATE overall . Due to his mental condition , the process of questions and answers was very lengthy , and the estimate for the trial length was revised . There were additionally conflicts with the judge 's timetable which required lengthy breaks in the trial , and a move in the venue from GPE to GPE .", "An application was made by the applicant 's representatives in DATE to impose time - limits in respect of cross - examination of the applicant . This was refused on the basis that the defence must have every opportunity to present their case , subject to the normal controls . In DATE , the applicant \u2019s expert witnesses , PERSON and Mr M , gave evidence , essentially stating that the prognosis was not very good , and that the applicant was unlikely ever to be able to work again . On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON imposed time - limits for the hearing of the remaining witnesses and to ensure the trial finished in time . The evidence in the trial , which lasted DATE , concluded on DATE . Counsel made their final submissions on DATE and DATE . The judge , Mr Justice PERSON , did not give his judgment until DATE , which judgment ran to CARDINAL pages , giving judgment for the applicant in the sum of over ORG . Following further submissions of the parties on aspects of social security benefits , interest , costs , stay of execution , time for appeal and the form of order , Mr Justice PERSON gave a further judgment on DATE .", "In DATE , the applicant had applied for a residence order under LAW DATE in respect of his remaining children . The expert doctors who had given evidence in the personal injury trial were instructed by the applicant to give their views of the state of the applicant 's mental health for the purpose of these proceedings . They produced draft reports which gave a more positive prognosis . Mr M \u2019s report went so far as to suggest that the applicant was no longer suffering mental health problems . It was sent to the solicitors of the applicant \u2019s wife by mistake . The applicant \u2019s counsel , on his instructions , applied to the judge in the family matter for the report to be returned on the basis that it had been disclosed without the applicant \u2019s authority and that the applicant did not wish to rely on it . The judge ruled that the report was to be admitted in evidence . The applicant states that as a result he was obliged to call Mr M as a witness . Mr M produced a revised version of his draft report . PERSON in his oral evidence stated that he would have to alter the prognosis given previously as the applicant had remained free of depression and his medication had been reduced , such that it was now appropriate to see if it could be further reduced or even stopped . He stated that he had not foreseen this improvement earlier though it was premature to be optimistic . In the applicant \u2019s evidence in the family proceedings , he said in a statement of CARDINAL DATE that his psychiatric situation had improved dramatically and , in his oral evidence , he did not resile from his descriptions of his improved mental health . On DATE , the Judge in the family matter , Judge PERSON , rejected the applicant \u2019s claim for a residence order , though subsequently , the applicant \u2019s ex - wife agreed that he should have custody of the youngest child .", "Concerns had arisen as to the relevance of the medical reports to the imminent decision of Mr Justice PERSON in the personal injury action . The applicant sought the opinion of his Queen 's Counsel as to whether the documents needed to be disclosed . He was advised on DATE that as the reports were subject to professional privilege they need not be .", "The defendants in the personal injury action appealed against the decision of Mr Justice PERSON , and the appeal was heard over DATE in DATE and DATE . A draft judgment of ORG was produced on DATE . It reduced the award of damages to \u00a3 CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL with interest and costs . Part of the interest awarded by Mr Justice PERSON was deducted ( DATE ) on the basis of the applicant \u2019s inordinate delay in the case . When the draft judgments were handed down , however , issues were raised by the parties as to the correct calculation of past and future loss of earnings . These matters were adjourned in the hope that the parties could agree , failing agreement the matter was to be re - argued on those points .", "On DATE , leading counsel for the defendants received anonymously through the post copies of the reports prepared by the applicant \u2019s doctors in the Children Act proceedings . On DATE , the defendants applied to ORG for the appeal to be listed for rehearing , for discovery and inspection of the medical reports and evidence given in the family proceedings . After initially resisting the application for disclosure , on DATE , the applicant waived any privilege covering the documents in the light of the decision of ORG of ORG , In re L ( A Minor)(Police investigation : privilege ) judgment of DATE [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL , and in the hope of shortening the proceedings . The reports and transcripts of evidence were placed before ORG , which sat on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . ORG agreed to the defendant \u2019s application for further evidence to be heard and for PERSON to be heard as a witness . The applicant called Mr M as a witness .", "The applicant also applied to be allowed to give evidence himself as to his current mental condition , and to call another witness as to the same matter . He asked to be able to produce further evidence from an employment expert regarding loss of earnings , based on ORG findings as to his mental state . ORG refused both these applications , giving the following explanation at page CARDINAL of its judgment :", "\u201c So far as the Plaintiff is concerned we know what he was saying about his health in DATE ; we also had PERSON clinical notes recording the < applicant \u2019s > condition at fairly regular intervals since then . The Judge found the < applicant > to be an unsatisfactory and unreliable witness who was compulsively manipulative . There is also abundant evidence from his pre - accident job applications that he was untruthful when it suited his convenience . If < the applicant > had given further evidence it would only have invited further lengthy cross - examinations to show this ORG what the Judge had already concluded . We did not think further evidence from him would assist the ORG .", "As to further evidence from an employment expert , no doubt to be countered by such a person called on behalf of the Defendant and which would in any event have occasioned further delay and expense in this far too protracted litigation , again we did not think this would assist the ORG . Such evidence would be unlikely to be sufficiently precise and would be likely to be discursive and speculative depending on the findings of this ORG . In my judgment the ORG must adopt a broad - brush approach to the question doing the best we can with the material at our disposal . \u201d", "Judgment was given on DATE , and the decision of the ORG , by a majority , was to reduce the award of damages made in favour of the applicant to the sum of just over \uf02cCARDINAL,CARDINAL . This involved a further reduction in Mr Justice PERSON \u2019s award of \u00a3 MONEY from the sum of future loss of earnings , the sum of general damages was reduced by a further \u00a3 MONEY , and sums for future domestic help and future gardener / handyman reduced from \u00a3 MONEY and \u00a3 MONEY respectively to nothing . This decision was made on the basis of the finding by ORG that the applicant had made a substantial recovery since DATE . While it found that his recovery was not complete and that he would require low level medication and supportive therapy for the foreseeable future , it considered that this did not prevent him functioning normally . As regards the issues arising from the disclosure of materials from the family proceedings , CARDINAL of the appeal court judges observed that \u201c it is simply unconscionable for a litigant to run contradictory cases in simultaneous proceedings in the hope of gaining advantage in each \u201d and another appeal judge noted that , if it was correct that the evidence falsified the assumptions previously made by the trial judge and themselves in the civil proceedings , it would be inequitable and an affront to common sense and justice not to admit it .", "The award was however less than the \u00a3 MONEY paid into court by the defendants , and thus the applicant became liable to pay a substantial amount of costs .", "The applicant petitioned for leave to appeal to ORG , which petition was refused on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
