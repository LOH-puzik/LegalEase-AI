She was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their agents , PERSON and PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In ORG of DATE ORG published a notice for a competition based on performance appraisal for CARDINAL posts of judge at several administrative courts ( \u201c the competition \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL candidates applied for the vacant posts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application to take part in the competition for the vacant posts at ORG and ORG . There were CARDINAL vacant posts in the former and CARDINAL in the latter .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the applicant and all the other candidates were subjected to performance appraisals by ORG committee on proposals and performance appraisals of judges ( \u201c the committee \u201d ) . Some of these were carried out in the context of a separate competition .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the committee \u2019s recommendation , on DATE the ORG determined an overall rating for each candidate in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE . All but CARDINAL of the candidates obtained the rating \u201c very good \u201d , the highest possible rating . The applicant was CARDINAL of the CARDINAL candidates in that category .", "CARDINAL . At its session on DATE , under item QUANTITY of the agenda , the ORG then proceeded to rank the candidates in accordance with section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , on a proposal from the committee \u2019s chairman , and listed them in order of merit , grade and length of service . The list contained CARDINAL candidates and the applicant was ranked eighteenth on the list . Out of the CARDINAL candidates ranked higher than the applicant , CARDINAL had applied for the same posts for which she had applied .", "CARDINAL . Finally , under item QUANTITY of the agenda , ORG , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , took a vote in respect of each candidate in order to decide whether or not to promote him or her to the post of judge at the relevant administrative court , until all the vacant posts had been filled .", "CARDINAL . The voting , which was conducted in secret , followed the order in which candidates were ranked on the list and continued until all the vacant posts were filled .", "CARDINAL . According to the full text of TIME of the ORG \u2019s session , the first CARDINAL candidates did not obtain the requisite majority of CARDINAL votes and their applications were therefore rejected . Candidate number CARDINAL obtained one of the CARDINAL vacant posts at ORG . The voting then continued . The applicant , who was eighteenth on the list , obtained CARDINAL votes in her favour for the posts in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL courts for which she had applied and CARDINAL votes in her favour for the post in the other court . As the minimum number of votes required were QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , her applications were rejected ( items CARDINAL and CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL on the agenda ) . The voting then continued . As regards the posts for which the applicant had applied , the candidate ranked CARDINAL obtained CARDINAL votes in her favour and was appointed to the post of judge at ORG , and the candidate ranked fortyseventh obtained CARDINAL votes and was appointed to the second vacant post at ORG ( items CARDINAL . and CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . on the agenda ) . As all the vacant posts had been filled at that point , no voting took place with regard to the remaining CARDINAL candidates .", "CARDINAL . Other than the number of votes for and against each candidate and the number of abstentions , no further information or reasons were given in TIME of the session as to why , on what basis and in application of what criteria the ORG had voted the way it did for each candidate and why certain judges had been promoted or transferred to the vacant posts while others had not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the decisions of the ORG adopted under item CARDINAL of the agenda of its session of DATE ( \u201c the appeal \u201d ) . She argued that the decisions had been adopted in contravention of the applicable legislation , since the ORG was required under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE to fill the vacant posts by following the order in which the successful candidates were ranked . She considered that her rights had been violated when , instead of her , the ORG had promoted to the vacant posts CARDINAL persons ranked below her in the list , in CARDINAL and DATE place . She further considered that the whole competition procedure had been violated because , in comparison with her , those persons were on lower grades and had a shorter period of service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG officially informed the applicant , by way of an extract from the minutes of the session of DATE , of its vote of that date by which it had decided not to promote her to the vacant posts . Apart from the number of votes for and against her promotion , no further information or reasons were given as to why the ORG had voted the way it had .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and DATE the applicant supplemented her appeal with the extract from TIME sent to her on DATE , together with proof of her grade , length of service and performance appraisal and copies of her employment and insurance records .", "CARDINAL .
