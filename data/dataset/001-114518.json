But on the request of the victim she stated the money should be paid to the agency and then the money should then be transferred to her uncle \u2019s account who in turn would send the money back to GPE . This agreement was made in order to hide from the authorities the fact that the victim did not have a national insurance number . If money was paid to her then she would have had to pay tax and her false identity would have come to the notice of the tax office and then to the [ ORG ] . This would then lead to her arrest and eviction from the GPE ...", "... There is no evidence to show that this female is / was a victim of slavery or forced labour .
