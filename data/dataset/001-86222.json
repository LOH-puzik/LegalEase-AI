Counsel for the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the conviction but relieved the applicant from punishment by virtue of LAW of DATE ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a criminal case was opened against the applicant on suspicion of his having stolen , in DATE , car parts valued at MONEY ( RUB , less than CARDINAL euros ) . The prosecutor preferred the charge of theft aggravated by repetition and substantial damage , an offence under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s retrieval and arrest for the following reasons :", "\u201c On DATE [ the applicant ] received a copy of the bill of indictment in this criminal case . He was summoned , by a phone call , to the court hearing at TIME on DATE , but he did not appear at that time .", "Due to [ the applicant \u2019s ] absence the examination of the case was adjourned until TIME on DATE to find out whether there had been any valid reasons for his absence . At TIME on DATE [ the applicant \u2019s ] mother called the court on the phone and said that she and her son had been advised belatedly by her relatives DATE who had taken the phone call \u2013 about the court hearing on DATE , and that was the reason why her son had not appeared at the court . [ The applicant \u2019s ] mother also told [ the registry ] that [ the applicant ] had no illness preventing him from appearing before the court and no medical certificate . During that conversation [ the applicant \u2019s ] mother was informed that the court hearing was scheduled for TIME on DATE .", "At the court hearing at TIME on DATE [ the applicant ] failed to appear once again . The case was rescheduled for TIME on DATE . At TIME [ the applicant \u2019s ] mother again telephoned the court and said that , although she and her son had known about the scheduled court hearing , he would not appear before the court unless the summons was sent by mail . Under these circumstances the court has reasons to believe that [ the applicant ] is absconding from justice , that he refuses to appear before a court and interferes with timely examination of the case . In this connection the court considers it necessary to order retrieval of [ the applicant ] and vary the measure of restraint to that of placement in custody . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . Counsel retained by the applicant \u2019s mother asked ORG to commission an expert examination of the applicant \u2019s mental health and to release him pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held as follows :", "\u201c According to the available case file materials , [ the applicant ] was repeatedly , on CARDINAL occasions DATE , summoned to a court hearing and failed to appear without a valid reason . [ The applicant ] is charged with an offence which is classified as a serious crime , and in such cases a custodial measure may be imposed for the sole reason of the dangerousness of the committed offence . [ The applicant \u2019s ] explanation that he did not appear in court because his mother had asked him not to is without substance because [ the applicant ] is an adult who should have been aware of the consequences of a violation of the undertaking given by him , as well as of the fact that liability for his failure to appear would be his and not his mother \u2019s . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court remanded the applicant in custody sine die and ordered a psychiatric examination . It appears that the decision was not appealed against . The following hearing in the case was fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant asked ORG to vary the legal characterisation of the applicant \u2019s act , to prefer a lesser charge of non - aggravated theft and to discontinue proceedings on the basis of LAW of DATE .

However , on DATE PERSON was convicted of that offence ... and , by the appeal decision of DATE ... was relieved from punishment . Thus , the acts of Mr Gusev lack the constituent element of repetition .", "It has not been shown that PERSON caused substantial damage to the victim P. because he is charged with theft of a car PERSON and a pump valued at MONEY . It does not appear that the small amount of MONEY was important for the victim and there is no information about his income or dependants . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having thus established that the aggravating circumstances had ceased to exist or had not been made out , ORG characterised the applicant \u2019s act as non - aggravated theft under LAW and discontinued the second criminal case against him on the basis of LAW of DATE . However , ORG held that the applicant should remain in custody on the basis of the arrest warrant of DATE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the arrest warrant was approved by a deputy prosecutor of LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant lodged a complaint against the detention order of DATE . He submitted that the order had been unlawful and unjustified because it had referred to the \u201c gravity \u201d rather than the \u201c dangerous nature \u201d of the offence charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel lodged a further complaint . He claimed , in particular , that LAW ( c ) of the Convention did not provide for such a ground for pre - trial detention as the \u201c gravity of the offence \u201d and that the prosecutor \u2019s statements about the applicant \u2019s intention to abscond or obstruct the establishment of the truth were not substantiated . He further pointed out that a copy of the order had not been served on the applicant and the procedure for lodging an appeal had not been explained to him .

However , [ the applicant ] refused to sign that document , and [ the investigator PERSON ] , lacking professional experience , omitted to make an appropriate note thereof . At present the periods of preliminary investigation and pre - trial detention of [ the applicant ] have been extended in accordance with the law .", "[ The applicant ] is charged with a serious crime and its dangerousness alone may be , pursuant to LAW , the ground for ... holding him in custody . In these circumstances , dangerousness of the crime to which the law refers is in itself sufficient to anticipate undesirable conduct on the part of the accused , including continuation of criminal activities and absconding upon commission of a crime , in other words the reference in the law to the dangerous nature of a crime enables the investigative authorities to anticipate these very events to which the [ NORP ] Convention refers .", "No information showing that [ the applicant ] can not remain in the investigative ward was provided to the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE GPE dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the third criminal case against the applicant and his co - defendants was submitted for trial by ORG .

A supplementary appeal on points of law was lodged by his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE dismissed the appeals , finding the extension order had been lawful and justified because \u201c the arguments set out in the appeals had been known to the trial court which [ had ] had due regard to them \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
