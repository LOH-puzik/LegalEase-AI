POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON are NORP nationals who were born in DATE respectively and live in PERSON . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz .", "In DATE the applicants agreed with the local branch of the ORG - run electricity supply company ( \u201c the company \u201d ) that they would finance and build on their land an electricity installation connecting their properties to the general electricity network operated by that company ( high voltage transformer and cables ) . They had such an installation built and financed it from their own resources , paying PLZ CARDINAL in pre - denomination currency \u2013 the equivalent of ORG ( approximately EUR CARDINAL DATE ) .", "In DATE , when the installation was ready , a disagreement arose between the applicants and the electricity supply company as to the reimbursement of the costs the applicants had incurred . The company refused to reimburse the costs . As a result , the installation became operational and the company took it over , connected it to the electricity network and started normal exploitation . In DATE the applicants refused to sign documents confirming that ownership of the high - voltage transformer , the essential part of the installation , had been taken over by the company ex lege . They only signed documents confirming the transfer of ownership of the cables to the company . In DATE they submitted a letter to the company informing it that they refused to acknowledge the transfer of ownership .", "In DATE , from DATE at the earliest , the company connected CARDINAL new electricity users to the network built by the applicants ( after the applicants had sold their land to these persons on unspecified dates ) , charged each of them for this service and for a part of the costs borne in connection with building the installation and operated the service normally , providing electricity to them at normal prices , using the installation built by the applicants .", "The applicants apparently repeatedly tried to obtain reimbursement of the costs they had incurred in the amount of ORG CARDINAL , but received oral refusals . In DATE the applicants requested the company in writing to reimburse the costs of the construction they had borne in DATE as well as the amounts the company had charged the CARDINAL users for connecting them to the network . They claimed ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL DATE ) . The company refused , stating that ownership of the network had been transferred to it in DATE .", "In a letter of DATE the ORG , in reply to the ORG request to intervene in their case , informed them that their case was of a civil - law character and could , as such , be pursued before the civil courts . The ORG also summarised a judgment of ORG of DATE ( see Relevant domestic law below ) and emphasised that after this judgment had been given , ORG had repeatedly stated in its judgments that the practice of the ORG - run electricity supply company amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position . The applicants were also informed that there had been judgments of ORG to the effect that in cases in which contracts concluded as a result of an abuse of a dominant market position were declared null and void , wronged consumers could claim unjust enrichment under the provisions of LAW on liability in tort .", "In DATE the applicants lodged an action against the company with ORG . They sought payment of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , seeking a judgment on the principle of their claim , and argued that they had never given their agreement to the company taking over ownership and using the installation which they had built and financed themselves .", "On DATE the court dismissed the claim . It established that the applicants had built the installation and financed the building works from their own resources on the basis of technical documentation given to them by the electricity supply company . Upon completion of the installation they had refused to sign a document confirming the transfer of ownership of the main part of the installation to the company .", "The court further noted that at the relevant time , the DATE LAW had been in force . The principles governing the settlement of any accounts between the ORG - run electricity supply company and landowners who had financed the construction of installations necessary to connect their properties to the electricity network were provided for in a DATE Ordinance . LAW provided that all electricity installations were the property of the ORG . Consequently , this LAW allowed for all the costs arising from the construction of electricity installations to be borne by individual owners , without any corresponding obligation on the part of the electricity company to reimburse them . Hence , the applicants were to bear these costs . At the time of the construction they had been aware of this as the position of the company had been set out in technical documents which they had received from the company .", "The applicants appealed , submitting that the defendant company had enriched itself at their expense since it had acquired ownership of the installation and had been exploiting it without having to compensate them in return .", "The appellate court upheld the judgment by a decision of DATE . It observed that the first - instance court had correctly found that the applicants had been aware that under the DATE Ordinance the connection of the installation to the electricity network had depended on the transfer of ownership of the installation to the company . However , the lower court had erred in law in that it had overlooked a judgment of ORG given in DATE . In that judgment that court had observed that the DATE Ordinance could no longer be applied after LAW had entered into force , because it had been passed ultra vires on the basis of the DATE LAW . Hence , the DATE Ordinance could not constitute the legal basis for the automatic transfer of ownership of the electricity installation to the electricity company . ORG had indicated that the provisions of LAW should apply to such a situation .", "In that connection , ORG observed that under LAW , electricity supply facilities did not constitute parts of land or a building if they were a part of an enterprise , including an electricity supply enterprise . Hence , such installations were not to be considered part of the applicants\u2019 property and were to become the property of the defendant company .", "On the other hand , the provisions of LAW on the obligation of an owner of property to reimburse expenditure incurred by a person in possession in order to improve the condition of this property or increase its value were not applicable to the applicants\u2019 situation . This was because at the time when the applicants had borne the expenditure for the construction of the electricity installation , they had been the owners of the properties concerned . Hence , they were not users within the meaning of the relevant provisions of LAW : they had incurred expenditure on their own property , not somebody else \u2019s and , consequently , had no claim to reimbursement .", "The court finally observed that the applicants had known , when they incurred the expenditure for the construction of the electricity supply installation in DATE , that under the laws applicable at that time ownership of the installation would eventually be transferred to the electricity supply company . Hence , the company could not be said to have obtained unjust enrichment at the expense of the applicants . Further , it was the company which was obliged to operate and maintain these installations . Accordingly , it was fair that the company should take over their ownership .", "On DATE LAW entered into force . Article CARDINAL introduced the legal protection of private ownership . It reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone shall have the right to ownership , other property rights and the right of succession .", "CARDINAL . Everyone , on an equal basis , shall receive legal protection regarding ownership , other property rights and the right of succession .", "CARDINAL . The right of ownership may only be limited by means of a statute and only to the extent that it does not violate the substance of such right . \u201d", "Under LAW , public authorities shall protect consumers , customers , lessors or lessees against activities threatening their health , privacy and safety , as well as against dishonest market practices . The scope of such protection shall be specified by statute .", "In DATE the ORG requested ORG to issue a binding interpretation of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW in so far as it empowered ORG to issue ordinances concerning the technical conditions on which individually built and financed electricity supply installations could be connected to the general electricity supply network . At that time , the LAW adopted in DATE was in force .", "In a resolution of CARDINAL DATE ( W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG observed that the DATE Ordinance , including LAW passed on the basis of LAW , could no longer be applied after LAW had entered into force . It further noted that in any event the ordinance had been passed ultra vires on the basis of the DATE LAW .", "The court observed further that relations between the electricity supply company and owners of property were to be considered in the light of LAW . As to the ownership of electricity supply installations situated on individual properties , LAW made it clear that they did not constitute a part of such properties if they were a part of an enterprise , including an electricity supply enterprise . Hence , such installations were to become the property of that enterprise .", "Further , the provisions of LAW on the obligation of an owner of property to reimburse expenditure incurred by a person in possession in order to improve the condition of this property or increase its value were not applicable to the situation of owners who had financed the construction of electricity supply installations . This was so because at the time of the financing and construction of such installations the owners were constructing them on their own properties . Hence , they could not have recourse to claims normally available to persons in possession against owners .", "Lastly , the court considered that the civil - law provisions on unjust enrichment could not be applied to the settlement of accounts between the owners and the electricity supply company . Owners who built and financed electricity supply installations on their properties knew and accepted in advance that after these installations were connected to the general electricity network they were to become the property of the company .", "The court was of the view that such an automatic transfer of ownership to the electricity supply company could not be said to run counter to \u201c principles of community life \u201d within the meaning of LAW . This was because the connection of the installations to the electricity supply network was in the interest of owners . Moreover , after the electricity supply company had become the owner of the installations , it was obliged to operate them and to maintain them in proper technical condition ; hence the fact that it had taken them over without being obliged to make any reimbursement was compatible with these principles .", "In a number of judgments given after DATE ORG followed the reasoning based on the judgment of ORG and dismissed claims for reimbursement of costs borne by owners to finance electricity supply installations , holding that upon their connection to the network the installation had become the property of the electricity supply company ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , I CKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; resolution III CZP DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "However , in a judgment of DATE ( II CKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that if the recipient of the electricity had financed elements of the installation necessary for the property to be connected to the network , he or she was entitled , on the basis of the provisions of civil law on unjust enrichment , to seek from the electricity company a reimbursement of the costs incurred .", "Subsequently , in judgments given in DATE and DATE , ORG held that Article CARDINAL of LAW could not be interpreted to mean that the physical connection of such an installation , financed by a private party , to the electricity supply network automatically entailed a transfer of ownership of that installation to the electricity company ( ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; III SK CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG gave a resolution ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) purporting to clarify the discrepancies which had arisen in the case - law concerning the relationship between the electricity supply company and owners who had financed electricity supply installations situated on their land . It reiterated the history of the relevant case - law and observed that a transfer of ownership could only originate in legal events , not in factual ones . It observed that the only function of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to establish the limits of operation of the principle superficies solo cedit , not to determine the financial relationship between the owner of the installation and the owner of the electricity network . Hence , the mere fact that an installation was connected to the network operated by the electricity supply company was not , of itself , sufficient to conclude that a transfer of ownership to the company automatically followed . The issue of ownership and of any settlement of accounts between the company and individual owners should be determined by contract , specifically addressing related issues .", "In DATE LAW was repealed and replaced by a new LAW . No provisions producing the same effect as LAW are currently in force . The question of ownership of electricity supply installations and of the settlement of accounts arising out of the building and financing by private parties of electricity supply installations is now left to the parties , to be freely negotiated between the owners and the ORG - run electricity supply company .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that water , electricity , power and similar installations do not constitute a part of land or buildings if they are a part of an enterprise .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family \u2019s standard of living ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
