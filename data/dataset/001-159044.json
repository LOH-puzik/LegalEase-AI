He argued that the prosecution authorities had failed to establish the circumstances of his brother \u2019s death . He submitted that witnesses had given different versions of the events .

On DATE the district prosecutor replied to the applicant \u2019s complaint about the excessive length of the proceedings and found the complaint ill - founded . The prosecutor informed the applicant that prosecutors were independent in their work and it was up to them to make a decision about when the evidence had been collected and at which point the investigation should be closed .

On DATE the applicant complained to the Chief of ORG in GPE about the actions taken by the local police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE district prosecutor discontinued the investigation , finding that no offence had been committed . According to the prosecutor \u2019s findings , on TIME of the accident at TIME of the bus drivers , ORG , heard a man screaming and calling for help . The man ran into the drivers\u2019 room ; his clothes were on fire . ORG extinguished the fire using a shower and called an ambulance and the police . The ambulance arrived first and subsequently , at TIME , the police arrived at the scene . The officers concentrated on helping PERSON They spoke to him about the incident and then he was taken to hospital . The detective , who arrived later , examined the room with the help of the company \u2019s health and safety inspector , S.S. The prosecutor referred to the applicant \u2019s arguments that the scene of the accident had not been properly secured ; she stated that since the incident had not resulted in any fatalities , the police officers had not been required to secure the scene in any particular way .", "The prosecutor concluded that the police officers had not failed to properly perform their professional duties and that all the relevant procedural rules had been followed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision . He maintained that the detective had arrived at the scene TIME after the accident . In addition , he questioned the fact that the detective had been assisted by ORG , who was an employee of the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and returned the case to the prosecutor . In particular , it instructed the prosecutor to obtain evidence from FAC and another witness , GPE , and to verify the actions taken by the police in view of the applicable procedures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE district prosecutor again discontinued the investigation into the alleged failure of police officers to comply with their duties . The prosecutor had heard evidence from FAC and GPE She repeated the reasons given in the decision of DATE and considered that the police actions had complied with the applicable procedures and that no offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and returned the case to the district prosecutor to continue the investigation . He considered that the district prosecutor had failed to comply with the court \u2019s instructions of CARDINAL DATE and had failed to analyse whether all officers involved , including the one who had taken the call notifying them of the incident and all the officers who had been present at the scene of the accident , had followed the applicable procedures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor heard evidence from GPE \u2013 one of the police officers who had intervened on DATE in the presence of the applicant . The applicant asked the witness questions but the witness did not remember much of the incident in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor discontinued the investigation . In an extensive reasoning of his decision the prosecutor referred to testimonies given by CARDINAL witnesses and to cross - examination of further QUANTITY witnesses , FAC and GPE The prosecutor also relied on the report of the examination of the scene of the accident and on the case file . He concluded that no offence had been committed as regards the alleged breach of professional conduct on the part of the police officers and that there was not enough evidence to substantiate the allegations that the police officers had falsified any evidence .", "The CARDINAL policemen , GPE and GPE , who arrived at the scene at TIME and who spoke to the applicant \u2019s brother , submitted that they had spoken to the victim directly after the incident ; he had been conscious and informed them that he had fallen asleep and when he had woken up his clothes had been already burning .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations that the electric heater had been secured TIME after the arrival of the police officers , the court found that ( although this had not been not confirmed by any of the witnesses ) the heater might have been moved before it was secured because several other persons had been in the room where the accident had happened before the arrival of the police . However , even if it had been moved , there were no grounds to suspect that this had been done in order to deflect suspicion onto any particular person . Here the court again relied on the victim \u2019s statements that he had caught fire as a result of his own negligence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed again . He maintained that the prosecutor had failed to properly establish the facts and hear all the necessary evidence . He demanded that witnesses DATE , S.S. and GPE be cross - examined in order to clarify discrepancies between their statements . He also restated that the policemen who had conducted the investigation had failed to follow the relevant procedures , and in particular that the scene of the accident had not been properly secured . He lastly submitted that \u201c his brother had been blamed for the accident \u201d whereas in fact the real reason was that he had suffered a diabetic shock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s findings sufficiently to make a decision on the merits . As regards the applicant \u2019s request for cross - examination of certain witnesses the court submitted that the request had already been granted in part because FAC and GPE had been cross - examined . As regards the contradictions in the testimonies given by TIME , the court considered that they had been sufficiently cleared up by DATE herself when she had given evidence for the second time and there had been no contradictions between her statements and the remaining evidence , so further examination would only lead to an unnecessary extension of the proceedings . As regards the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the failure on the part of the policemen to follow the relevant procedures , the court found that the procedures relied on by the applicant had to be followed only in a case where there was a suspicion that a crime had been committed : in the present case there had been no evidence that any third person might have been involved in PERSON \u2019s death . The court further held that the same applied to the requirement to secure the scene of the accident ; the applicant \u2019s brother , who had been interviewed after the accident , admitted that his clothes had caught fire because of his carelessness ( w wyniku nieuwagi ) . This also demonstrated that the suspicion that a crime had been committed had been ill - founded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
