{"ITEMID": "001-78427", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF BURDEN AND BURDEN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 14+P1-1", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are unmarried sisters , born on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively . They have lived together all their lives ; for DATE in a house built on land inherited from their parents in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The house is owned by the applicants in their joint names . According to an expert valuation dated DATE , the property was worth GBP CARDINAL , or GBP CARDINAL if sold together with the adjoining land . The sisters also jointly own CARDINAL other properties , worth GBP CARDINAL in total . In addition , each sister owns in her sole name shares and other investments worth MONEY . Each has made a will leaving all her property to the other .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that the value of their jointly - owned property had increased to the point that each sister 's CARDINAL share was worth more than the current exemption threshold for inheritance tax ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and that the survivor might have to sell the house in order to pay the tax .", "CARDINAL . NORP By sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , inheritance tax is charged at PERCENT on the value of a person 's property , including his or her share of anything owned jointly , passing on his or her death , and on lifetime transfers made within DATE of death . The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP CARDINAL for transfers DATE and DATE ; GBP CARDINAL for transfers during DATE ; and GBP CARDINAL for DATE ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Interest is charged , currently at PERCENT , on any tax not paid within DATE after DATE in which the death occurred , no matter what caused the delay in payment . Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid , at the tax - payer 's election , in CARDINAL equal DATE instalments , unless the property is sold , in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately ( DATE Act , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)-(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge . With effect from DATE , this exemption was extended to a deceased 's \u201c civil partner \u201d ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of LAW was to provide same - sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships , and to confer on them , as far as possible , the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage .", "CARDINAL . A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are ( i ) of the same sex ; ( ii ) not already married or in a civil partnership ; ( iii ) over DATE ; ( iv ) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship .", "CARDINAL . A civil partnership is , like marriage , indeterminate in nature and can end only on death , dissolution or annulment . LAW created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation , covering inter alia pensions , tax , social security , inheritance and immigration . The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners ' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage .", "CARDINAL . When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through ORG , an amendment to it was passed in ORG by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership , and the associated inheritance tax concession , to family members within the \u201c prohibited degrees of relationship \u201d , if ( i ) they were DATE ; ( ii ) they had co - habited for DATE ; and ( iii ) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person . The amendment was reversed when the PERSON returned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the course of the debate in ORG , Lord PERSON , a ORG , stated :", "\u201c I have great sympathy with the noble ORG , PERSON [ ORG who proposed the amendment ] , when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative . Indeed , she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times \u2014 at Second Reading and in ORG DATE and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue . There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with , but this is not the PERSON in which to do it . This PERSON is about same - sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings . \u201d", "During the same debate , Lord PERSON , ORG , stated :", "\u201c There is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties . But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument . This PERSON is inappropriate for dealing with that issue . \u201d", "During the course of the debate in ORG , PERSON MP , Deputy Minister for Women and ORG , stated :", "\u201c As I suggested on Second Reading , we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill \u2014 granting legal recognition to same - sex couples , ensuring that CARDINAL of couples living together in long - term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law , with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings .", "We heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that LAW is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives , not because those concerns are not important , but because the PERSON is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act entered into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c So far as it is possible to do so , primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides ( so far as relevant ) :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right .", "( CARDINAL ) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right , it may make a declaration of that incompatibility . ...", "( CARDINAL ) A declaration under this section ... -", "( a ) does not affect the validity , continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given ; and", "( b ) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right .", "( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) does not apply to an act if -", "( a ) as a result of CARDINAL or more provisions of primary legislation , the authority could not have acted any differently ; or", "( b ) in the case of CARDINAL or more provisions of ... primary legislation which can not be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights , the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions . ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies if \u2013", "( a ) a provision of legislation has been declared under LAW to be incompatible with a LAW right and , if an appeal lies \u2013", "( i ) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so ; or", "( ii ) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time ; or", "( iii ) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned ; or", "( b ) it appears to a Minister of the ORG or Her Majesty in ORG that , having regard to a finding of ORG made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against GPE , a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of GPE arising from the Convention .", "( CARDINAL ) If a Minister of the ORG considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section , he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the objective of giving the national courts the power under section CARDINAL had been to provide a formal means for notifying the ORG and ORG about a situation in which legislation was found not to comply with the ORG , and to provide a mechanism for speedily correcting the defect . Once a declaration had been made ( or once ORG had found a violation based on a provision of domestic law ) , there were CARDINAL alternative avenues for putting right the problem : either primary legislation could be introduced in ORG , or the Minister concerned could exercise his summary power of amendment under LAW .", "CARDINAL . When LAW passed through ORG on DATE , the Lord Chancellor explained that :", "\u201c we expect that the government and ORG will in all cases almost certainly be prompted to change the law following a declaration of incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL of the Ministers with responsibility for LAW explained to ORG on DATE that :", "\u201c Our proposals [ for remedial orders ] safeguard parliamentary procedures and sovereignty , ensure proper supervision of our laws and ensure that we can begin to get the ability both to enforce human rights law and to create a human rights culture . They also ensure that we can do it in the context of not having to worry that if something is decided by the GPE court or by our courts that creates an incompatibility , we do not have a mechanism to deal with it in the quick and efficient way that may be necessary . \u201d", "The most recent report of ORG , published on DATE , showed that declarations of incompatibility had been made in CARDINAL cases DATE . In CARDINAL of these cases the declaration had been overturned on appeal , or the judgment on appeal was pending . In CARDINAL cases the offending legislation had been amended or repealed ( in CARDINAL case by a remedial order ) , and in the remaining CARDINAL cases , amendments to the offending legislation were pending or under consideration ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
