These poems were written by CARDINAL NORP poets , namely the author himself , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , by the NORP writer PERSON and by PERSON .", "As the first edition had sold out as soon as it was placed on sale , the book was republished in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted criminal proceedings against Mr GPE , the author of the book , and the applicant , its publisher .

On DATE , at the request of the public prosecutor , a single judge of ORG made an interim order for the seizure of the copies of the second edition . According to the file , CARDINAL copies were seized as a result , including CARDINAL at the applicant \u2019s publishing house .", "On DATE the applicant asked the judge to reconsider the above order ; this appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating communist propaganda in breach of former LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and of inciting the people to hatred and hostility on the basis of a distinction between social classes , an offence under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Referring to PERSON antecedents , the public prosecutor emphasised that at the head of ORG , a terrorist organisation , he had carried out armed raids with a view to overthrowing the constitutional order of the ORG in order to set up a communist regime .", "In support of his submissions the public prosecutor first drew attention to the description of ORG father given on the second page of the book : \u201c He was a worker who could not accept that life should flow by in that way , and that sweat , energy and labour should be exploited like that . He was dissatisfied with this state of affairs and wanted that forlorn world to change \u201d . The public prosecutor argued that by equating the status quo with a spoliatory regime this sentence undoubtedly praised communism .", "The public prosecutor went on to cite the following poems .", "\u201c ... Ambushes guide me towards my people , vital force of the guerilla war ; resistance is a terrible and noble passion , but that is not all ; like a mistress , it is in addition hesitant , docile , delicate , deft ; we who are masters of patriotism , hope is hidden within us , the immortal standard is red and streams out in the wind ... \u201d", "( ( p . CARDINAL ) PERSON , published in DATE in the DATE publication ORG )", "According to the public prosecutor , this poem was to be interpreted in the light of the actions of PERSON . Seen from that point of view , it insinuated that terrorist acts enabled their perpetrators to draw closer to the people and recruit active terrorists from among them and that it was necessary to struggle patiently to establish a communist regime . In his submission , that amounted to illegal communist propaganda .", "\u201c To our dead comrades PERSON , who gave your lives for our people ; You , who gave everything in this fight ; You , who gave the colour red To the battle standard Which flies proudly in our hearts ; You , who died for our immortal people ; You , the sublime sons of our people , Rest now with pride and patience , Your comrades are carrying on the fight ... \u201d", "( ( p . CARDINAL ) PERSON )", "The public prosecutor observed that this text honoured the memory of the dead terrorists who had sought to undermine the ORG \u2019s constitutional regime by force of arms and was intended , particularly in its last phrase , to stir up hatred and hostility .", "\u201c ... The only light That awoke us Was the light of the world ! I went into their houses Where they sat round the table After returning from their work ; They laughed or wept And each resembled the others ; They turned their faces towards the light , Seeking their way ... \u201d", "( ( p . CARDINAL ) PERSON )", "The public prosecutor argued that this poem constituted communist propaganda because it held up communism as the only source of light for proletarians .", "\u201c ... They carried out the death sentence ; They spattered with blood The blue mist of the mountains and The newly woken TIME breeze ; Then they came [ and put down their ] weapons . Carefully feeling our chests , They examined us , Searching everywhere ... \u201d", "( ( p . DATE , \u201c Your absence made me wear out chains \u201d , DATE )", "The public prosecutor contended that these phrases were contemptuous of the security forces who had to stand against the terrorists and thus incited the people to show hatred and hostility towards them .", "Lastly , he noted that the expression \u201c May their virtue be our guide and their memory a light on our way \u201d , which appeared on the very last page of the book , referred to PERSON and the other terrorists .", "Consequently , the public prosecutor argued that the enthusiastic eulogy of the personality and acts of the rebel PERSON in the book in issue justified both PERSON conviction as the publisher responsible within the meaning of section DATE ) of LAW ( Law no . DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and confiscation of the copies of the book pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before ORG the applicant contested the charges , submitting that he had published the book because he considered that there was nothing in it which could justify repressive measures . In addition , his lawyers argued in particular that the passages in issue , reproduced in the indictment , could not by any means be taken for separatist propaganda and that even supposing that they could be regarded as a criticism of the ORG as constituted at that time , it was the right of every citizen to make such a criticism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged .", "In its judgment , after stating that it was satisfied \u201c that there [ was ] no need to ask experts to examine the book , given that its content [ could ] be understood by anyone on the first reading ... \u201d , ORG accepted that the passages cited in the indictment did indeed praise the aim and the armed raids of the TKP - ML and its leader and accordingly that the public prosecutor was fully justified in interpreting them as open incitement of the people to hatred and hostility . However , observing that it had considered the content of the book as a whole \u2013 in accordance with the case - law of ORG \u2013 ORG dismissed the defence arguments relating precisely to the alleged lack of relevance of an assessment based on this or that isolated extract from the book .", "Considering that it was not necessary to reproduce in the operative provisions of the judgment the passages judged to be in breach of the law , ORG held :", "\u201c All things considered , the book is intended to glorify and venerate both communism and the terrorist PERSON ... who was a supporter of communism , and to defend his actions ... Moreover , [ the book ] expressly incites the people to hatred and hostility on the basis of a distinction between regions , social classes and races . \u201d", "ORG sentenced PERSON to fines of CARDINAL and MONEY ( TRL ) under LAW and LAW respectively ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) and ordered the book \u2019s confiscation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared an appeal by the applicant on points of law inadmissible as regards his conviction under LAW , on the ground that no appeal lay against it in view of the amount of the fine ordered for the offence concerned . However , it set aside the verdict under LAW on the ground that it was unlawful to establish the accused \u2019s guilt merely by referring to the indictment without stating , with reasons , how and in what parts the book was an apologia of communism . It remitted the case on this point to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid the fine of TRL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment it delivered on DATE ORG , basing its decision on an expert report on the content of the book , confirmed the sentence it had imposed under LAW ; it also upheld its order for the confiscation of the book .", "However , on DATE this judgment was likewise quashed by ORG , on the ground that the report on which it was based had not been written by experts who had taken the oath . The case was then once again remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before ORG the public prosecutor called for PERSON acquittal on the charge of disseminating communist propaganda . He submitted that LAW , on which the conviction in question had been based , had been repealed by LAW ( Law no . ORG ) , which had come into force on DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG accepted the public prosecutor \u2019s submissions . However , observing that the judgment delivered on DATE had become final with regard to the conviction under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it noted that the confiscation order remained operative .", "It appears from the file that CARDINAL confiscated copies of the book were destroyed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , that is before the date of PERSON initial conviction ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the public prosecutor charged the book \u2019s author , Mr N. Behram , then living in GPE . The indictment filed for that purpose was essentially a copy of the one which had set in motion the proceedings against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , given in the defendant \u2019s absence , ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges of whom one had also tried the case of PERSON , observed firstly that the court was not required to rule on application of LAW , which had been repealed in the meantime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , then acquitted Mr GPE on the basis of an expert report , in which CARDINAL professors of criminal law maintained that there was nothing in the book which might be held to constitute the offence defined in LAW .", "In its judgment ORG , emphasising the book \u2019s documentary nature , confined itself to an endorsement of the conclusions of the above - mentioned expert report .", "CARDINAL . This judgment became final , no appeal on points of law having been lodged .", "CARDINAL .

In support of his application the applicant pleaded the contradiction between the judgment given against him and the judgment given in respect of the author , whereas both of them had been tried on account of the same book .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE , by order of the Minister of ORG , ORG at ORG ( \u201c ORG Counsel \u201d ) appealed against the judgment delivered on DATE in the applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , pleading the lack of an explicit decision on what was to be done about the confiscation order .", "After ORG dismissal of the appeal on DATE the applicant applied for a second time to the Minister of Justice , submitting that ORG had appealed on the wrong grounds .", "The Minister of ORG allowed this application and instructed ORG to argue that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was bad in so far as the author himself had subsequently been acquitted of charges identical to those which had led to Mr \u00d6zt\u00fcrk \u2019s conviction for incitement of the people to hatred and hostility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the ground of appeal submitted by ORG , ruling as follows :", "\u201c The defendant was charged with the offences contemplated in LAW and DATE and LAW and QUANTITY of LAW . The constituent elements of those offences were different . The acquittal of another accused tried for the same offence can not be taken as justified and unshakeable evidence that the defendant should also have been acquitted . [ In addition ] the CARDINAL accused were tried separately and the judgment acquitting PERSON [ GPE ] became final without any appeal on points of law being lodged . Lastly , there is no evidence that the assessment of the content of the book A testimony to life \u2013 Diary of a death under torture made in the judgment at first instance is bad and must be invalidated ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
