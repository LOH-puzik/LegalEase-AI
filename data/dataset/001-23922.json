AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr J. Unterweger , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the PERSON company , i.e. a big NORP steel company , was taken over by the A. holding . On DATE , in the course of the negotiations preceding the take - over , PERSON , a businessman and president of the executive board of the A. holding , gave a written assurance that there would be no reduction in personnel at the NORP site of the PERSON company within DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the assurance was repeated in the records of a meeting between GPE , the executive manager of the PERSON company , staff representatives and representatives of several banks .", "On DATE the ORG company announced staff cuts of CARDINAL employees , including CARDINAL dismissals to be carried out at the company 's NORP site .", "On DATE the applicant , in his capacity as a member of parliament , namely as spokesperson for social affairs of ORG , issued a press release under the heading :", "\u201c Massive Staff Cuts in GPE Alarming \u201d ( \u201c Massive PERSON in GPE bedenklich \u201d )", "The press release included the following statement :", "\u201c ORG 's plans which include staff cuts and the shut down of ORG 's NORP site constitute a clear breach of [ his ] promise given in public on the occasion of the takeover . \u201d", "The above statement was reported in a number of DATE newspapers .", "Thereupon , ORG brought injunction proceedings under LAW ) against the applicant with ORG ( ORG ) . He requested that the latter be prohibited from stating or repeating that he \u201c had broken his word with regard to his policy of no staff cuts as announced in DATE \u201d . He also requested that the statement be retracted and that this retraction be published in specified NORP DATE newspapers .", "On DATE ORG granted the injunction . It ordered the applicant not to repeat the impugned statement and to publish a retraction in the newspapers requested at his own cost . The court found that , contrary to the applicant 's assertion , his statement was not a valuejudgment made in a political context , but a statement of fact , which jeopardised ORG 's reputation as a business man . In this respect , the court also noted that PERSON was not a politician and that , according to the written statement of DATE , the latter had only promised to make no staff cuts for DATE . Given the lack of precision regarding the time - frame it could not be assumed that the promise to make no staff cuts covered DATE . Thus , the allegation that ORG had broken his word , by announcing in DATE that he intended to dismiss employees , was not supported by evidence .", "The applicant appealed against the injunction . He submitted that ORG had not assessed the relevant facts against the background of the economic development of the PERSON company and that the impugned statement constituted a value - judgment .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the appeal . It considered that ORG had correctly assessed the relevant facts . Observing in particular that the applicant had himself failed to make any reference to the economic situation of the PERSON company in the material press release , it found , with reference to that text , that the only question at stake was whether PERSON , by announcing staff cuts , had broken his word . In this respect , ORG confirmed ORG view that the impugned statement was a statement of fact . Referring to the written statement of DATE , according to which there would be no reduction in manpower for DATE , it considered that the claimant 's \u201c guarantee \u201d had lasted until DATE at the very most and concluded that the applicant had failed to prove his allegation .", "On DATE the applicant introduced an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentliche Revision ) against ORG decision .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) declared the extraordinary appeal inadmissible as it found that the qualification of the statement at issue as a statement of fact was in accordance with its previous case - law . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Everyone who has suffered material damage or loss of profit because of an insulting statement may claim compensation .", "( CARDINAL ) The same applies if anyone disseminates statements of fact which jeopardise another person 's credit , gain or livelihood and if the untruth of the statement was known or must have been known to him . In such a case the retraction of the statement and the publication thereof may also be requested ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
