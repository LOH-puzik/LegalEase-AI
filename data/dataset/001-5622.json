SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant companies are NORP commercial companies whose registered offices are in GPE ( GPE ) . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the applicant companies , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant companies operate gaming concerns equipped , in particular , with fruit machines . They are consequently required to pay duty DATE known as \u201c gaming duty \u201d \u2013 in the form of an annual lump sum on each fruit machine . The amount is reviewed DATE in GPE \u2019s DATE budget .", "In the present case , the amount of duty payable on each fruit machine for DATE was set at MONEY ( ESP ) by LAW of DATE . However , an additional increase for DATE , raising the DATE duty for each fruit machine to ESP CARDINAL , was imposed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE on the adoption of urgent budgetary measures .", "The first applicant company paid the ORG ESP CARDINAL in duty for DATE , and the second ESP CARDINAL .", "The applicant companies , who did not accept the additional increase and had unsuccessfully attempted to obtain its reimbursement by the ORG , brought applications for judicial review in ORG of ORG maintaining , inter alia , that there had been a violation of the principle that increased penalties should not be applied with retrospective effect , a failure to ensure legal certainty and a breach of the principle that rates of duty should be consistent with those imposed on other gaming activities . To that end , they invited the court to refer the issue whether section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was compatible with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW to ORG before deciding their application for judicial review .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG refused to refer the constitutionality issue to ORG and dismissed the application on the merits . As regards its refusal to make a referral , it cited a decision of DATE in which ORG had held that a statute of DATE imposing an additional increase in duty on fruit machines was not unconstitutional ; it observed , too , that ORG had decided that the LAW did not preclude retrospective effect being given to tax legislation .", "The applicant company lodged an amparo appeal against that judgment with ORG . It contended that the refusal of ORG to make a constitutionality referral regarding section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL infringed its right to the protection of the courts and to a fair hearing ( LAW ) . It complained , too , that it had been the victim of discriminatory treatment when compared to other firms engaged in the gaming sector ( LAW ) . It also argued that another NORP court , ORG , had decided to refer to ORG the issue of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in the context of an application for judicial review lodged by another gaming company . In the light of that referral , ORG decided to adjourn consideration of the applicant company \u2019s appeal until it had decided the issue that had been referred to it by ORG . In the latter proceedings ORG declared section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL unconstitutional and therefore null and void as its effect was to cause an unforeseeable and insufficiently justified increase in tax liability that amounted to a violation of the principle of legal certainty .", "Notwithstanding that decision , ORG , sitting as a full court , decided on DATE , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , to dismiss the applicant company \u2019s amparo appeal .", "The complaint regarding the failure to observe the non - discrimination principle was rejected by ORG , inter alia , on the ground that a finding that section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was unconstitutional could not be founded on the basis of the principle of equality stated in LAW but on objectively established factors showing inequality contrary to LAW . While any such inequality could be remedied by other constitutional procedures \u2013 such as an appeal or a referral of a constitutionality issue \u2013 it could not be remedied through an amparo appeal .", "As to the complaint under LAW , ORG reiterated that under its settled case - law it was solely for trial courts to decide whether to make a constitutionality referral and their decision was final . Consequently , a refusal to make a referral did not in principle entail a violation of any fundamental right , even if other courts had decided to make a referral regarding the constitutionality of the same provision of PERSON no . CARDINAL . In the instant case , ORG observed that the applicant company had been in a position to put to ORG of Justice all the arguments it considered appropriate in support of its case that the relevant provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL were unconstitutional and that that court had carried out a reasoned analysis of the merits of those arguments before rejecting them . As regards the argument that ORG itself had in the meantime declared section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL unconstitutional , it held that the fact that a specific provision had been declared unconstitutional could not be used by itself in amparo appeals since the scope of such appeals was restricted by the LAW to certain fundamental rights and freedoms . It added that where a decision on an amparo appeal came after another decision , in proceedings regarding constitutionality , ORG was not always able to refer to the earlier decision in deciding the amparo appeal even where both sets of proceedings concerned the same statutory provision ; that applied especially where , as in the instant case , the decision on the constitutionality issue was based on LAW ( principles of legal certainty and of the rule of law ) , since that provision was not included in the rights and freedoms that were covered by amparo appeals . ORG added that , as no reduction of a sentence or penalty was at stake , a subsequent declaration that a statutory provision was unconstitutional could not have any effect on proceedings that had ended in a final judgment . It concluded by saying that ORG had applied the impuned provision of PERSON no . CARDINAL after finding that it was consistent with the LAW and , accordingly , that there was no point in making a constitutionality referral to ORG .", "The applicant company submitted that , unlike other firms in the gaming sector , it had been prevented by that decision from claiming reimbursement of the increases in duty it had paid on its fruit machines pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG refused to refer the constitutionality issue to ORG and dismissed the second applicant company \u2019s application on the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the first applicant company \u2019s case .", "The second applicant company lodged an amparo appeal against that judgment with ORG . It contended that the refusal of ORG to make a referral regarding the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had infringed its rights to the protection of the courts and to a fair hearing ( LAW ) . It complained , too , that it had been the victim of discriminatory treatment when compared to firms engaged in other areas of the gaming sector ( LAW ) .", "In a decision ( auto ) of DATE ORG decided to dismiss the second applicant company \u2019s appeal and in so doing referred to the grounds set out in its decision of DATE on the first applicant company \u2019s appeal .", "The second applicant company submitted that , unlike other firms in the gaming sector , it had been prevented by that decision from claiming reimbursement of the increases in duty it had paid on its fruit machines pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no .
