Within the new programme , the NORP \u2013 PERSON \u2013 NORP - NORP route was grouped together with CARDINAL other routes . Another public tender took place , and the applicant companies submitted a tender for the group . They subsequently received licences to operate public transportation services for the CARDINAL routes in the group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the CARDINAL companies which lost their licence for the NORP \u2013 PERSON \u2013 NORP - NORP route asked the courts to annul ORG decision of DATE , and to oblige the local authorities to adopt a new decision in which the route in question could again be considered as an individual route .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company requested ( and was granted ) leave to intervene in the proceedings in order to defend its own interests . Through its submissions , the applicant company argued that the decision adopted by the council on DATE was in accordance with the law , and asked ORG to dismiss the action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that , by grouping routes together , the county council had acted arbitrarily and had limited access for other competitors in the public transport market . The court considered that the routes had been grouped together without any economic or geographical considerations . The court therefore ordered the county council to re - analyse route no .

The first applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against this judgment , arguing that the plaintiff had not proved the existence of a legitimate interest for its request , and that the partial annulment of a public tender would be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law with final effect . The court explained that there were preconditions imposed by law which had to be fulfilled before a decision to group together certain transport routes could be taken by a local authority . Bearing in mind that in the current case those requirements had not been observed , the lower court had correctly annulled the administrative decision in question in the context of the request before it , namely in respect of route no . CARDINAL . ORG explained that the lower court had ordered the county council to conduct an analysis of whether or not route no . CARDINAL might be grouped together with other routes , in compliance with the legal provisions in force . Lastly , the court held that non - compliance with those obligations would give those whose interests had been negatively affected the right to request reparation for any consequent damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a new decision ; modifying the programme of public transport for the period DATE by putting out to public tender all CARDINAL routes from group no . CARDINAL as individual routes . Consequently , on DATE the applicant companies received a letter from ORG ( PERSON ) informing them that they had to hand over their licences for the entire group of CARDINAL routes within DATE of the final decision in a new public tender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new public tender was organised for the CARDINAL routes in question . The applicant companies did not participate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant companies lodged administrative proceedings requesting the annulment of the decision made by ORG on DATE . They argued that ORG , by its judgment of DATE , had ordered the analysis as an individual route of CARDINAL route out of the group of CARDINAL . They further alleged that , by withdrawing their licences for the remaining CARDINAL routes and organising a new public tender for all of the routes in the group , the authorities had acted unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant ORG complaint . The court held that the contested decision had been adopted in accordance with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , but also in compliance with new regulations adopted by ORG ; regulations which no longer provided for the possibility of grouping routes together for economic or geographic purposes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant ORG appeal on points of law against that judgment was rejected with final effect by ORG on DATE . ORG considered that the lower court had made a correct analysis of the facts .", "CARDINAL . The president of the panel of CARDINAL judges added a separate dissenting opinion to the judgment on the appeal on points of law . He considered that , by adopting the decision of DATE , ORG had not properly enforced the judgment of DATE , and had therefore breached the applicant companies\u2019 right to property guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . The judge explained that the applicant companies had participated in a public tender , and had won the right to exploit the group of CARDINAL routes in question . Although the county council had been ordered by final judgment to reanalyse only one of the routes above as an individual route , they had adopted without any legal basis a new decision which considered all of the routes individually .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant company requested before the administrative court the annulment of ORG decision of DATE to withdraw its licences for the entire group of routes . The first applicant company also requested that the enforcement of that decision be suspended pending the delivery of a final judgment in the case .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company argued that the contested decision prevented it and its associate ( the second applicant company ) from participating in the next public tender for the same route . The applicant companies further argued that the withdrawal of their licences had not been in compliance with LAW no . DATE , which set out the grounds on which licences could be withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the action as submitted by the first applicant company . The court held that the applicant had not proved the alleged damage caused by the decision of ORG , since it could participate in the new tender . In addition , there was no proof that the applicant company would be prevented from participating in the new tender . The court further explained that , should the applicant company consider itself prejudiced by the administrative act which was in dispute , it could request damages from those responsible for any consequent loss .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment . It alleged that the licences for the entire group of routes could not be lawfully withdrawn , since not all of them had been annulled by a court judgment . The first applicant company argued that , in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , a company whose licence for a certain route had been withdrawn could not participate in a new tender for the same route .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG decided to allow the first applicant company \u2019s request , and partially annulled the decision of ORG , which was upheld only in respect of the licence for route no . CARDINAL . ORG considered that the licences held by the applicant company for the other CARDINAL routes of offer CARDINAL , group no . CARDINAL constituted \u201c possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , and that there was no reason to order their remittal through an administrative act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
