His co - workers expressed a wish to hold a public assembly on DATE on DATE and the applicant , in his capacity as trade union leader , decided to help them . According to him , such help was \u201c an indirect expression of his own opinion \u201d . The applicant distributed banners and explained that it would be more practicable to stage solo demonstrations . To avoid prosecution for holding a public assembly without notifying the authorities in advance , the applicant suggested that his co - workers position themselves at some distance from each other , for instance on different streets . At the time , there was no federal or regional statutory requirement concerning the minimum distance between simultaneous solo demonstrations ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

However , there had been a separate \u201c target object \u201d for each solo demonstrator ; the demonstrators had been positioned at a considerable distance from each other ( for instance , QUANTITY for QUANTITY of them ) ; thus , he could not be lawfully considered as an organiser of a group event .", "CARDINAL .
