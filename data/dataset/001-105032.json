They argued that they had become coowners of the CARDINAL storeys constructed after the expropriation , as only parts of the building had been expropriated from their ancestors . As their ancestors had never consented to another person constructing and becoming owner of the QUANTITY new storeys , the ORG could not have acquired the entire property .", "The claim was examined at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction and dismissed in a final judgment of ORG of DATE . The domestic courts found that the CARDINAL additional storeys could not be subject to restitution under the denationalisation legislation , because they had never been expropriated . Furthermore , even if the applicants\u2019 ancestors had remained co - owners of the property , parts of which had been expropriated , and had thus become co - owners of the QUANTITY additional storeys , their rights had been extinguished and the ORG had acquired full ownership of these storeys through adverse possession , once the applicable DATE statutory period had expired . The provisions of the restitution legislation , relied on by DATE applicants , stating that the rules on adverse possession did not apply to expropriated property , were not applicable in the case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
