{"ITEMID": "001-71432", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SVK", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "NOVOTKA v. SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant , as a member of the public , took part in a public hearing which was held before ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) in an unrelated matter . For his private use , the applicant intended to make an audio recording of the hearing . He was however forbidden to do so by the President of the ORG and subsequently lodged a complaint of the prohibition with ORG .", "In a letter of DATE , in response to the applicant \u2019s complaint , the President of ORG observed that the applicant had had the chance of taking part in the hearing and thus of receiving information about the case . In his view the prohibition on recording had not injured the applicant \u2019s right to receive and impart information .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a petition ( podnet ) under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . He challenged the prohibition on recording and the response to his complaint about it and argued that they constituted a violation of his right to seek , receive and impart information guaranteed under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . The applicant also invoked LAW of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s above rights . In its finding ORG expressed the view that the right to seek , receive and impart information afforded legal protection also to the possibility of obtaining information actively . It was for each individual to decide how he would exercise the said right and whether , in exercising it , he would apply technical means of audio or video recording in order to store , process and disseminate the information obtained .", "On the one hand it was true that taking measures in order to secure the orderly conduct of court proceedings was within the discretionary power of the president of the court \u2019s chamber . However , on the other hand , to forbid recording which did not disturb the course of the hearing would exceed such discretion . In the present case there was no indication or allegation that the applicant \u2019s intended recording would disturb the hearing . There was therefore a violation of LAW .", "As to LAW , the Constitutional Court observed that its application in respect of recording court hearings had not yet been tested . The lacking Convention standard had therefore to be substituted by a domestic standard . ORG was of the view that there was accordingly a violation of LAW as well .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG in the Bratislava I ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) . On DATE the applicant provided further and better particulars through the intermediary of a lawyer who represented him from then on throughout the proceedings .", "In reliance on ORG finding the applicant argued that the prohibition of recording was wrongful . He maintained that it had caused him nonpecuniary damage and claimed an amount of money by way of just satisfaction . The applicant based the claim alternatively on LAW ( Law no . PERSON . ) and on the provisions of LAW concerning protection of personal integrity . In the latter case the applicant also claimed an apology .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG dismissed the action . In so far as the applicant invoked LAW , it was held that it guaranteed no right to compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage . As no pecuniary damage had been asserted , the relevant part of the action was unfounded . It was further held that liability for damage caused by erroneous official conduct was governed exclusively by LAW as the lex specialis . LAW as the lex generalis did not apply to it and the State did not have the standing to be sued under its provisions .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) upheld the part of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerning the dismissal of the action in so far as it had been based on LAW . It concurred with ORG view that the said legislation provided for no right to compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage . ORG however quashed the contested judgment as being premature and lacking adequate reasoning in so far as it concerned the applicant \u2019s claim under LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered that ORG apologise to the applicant for the violation of his rights found by ORG . It was held that the ORG , in the person of ORG , had the standing to be sued in the case . The prohibition of the recording constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s personal integrity within the meaning of LAW , in particular with an element of his personal liberty . As found by ORG the prohibition was wrongful , and directly causally linked to the interference with the applicant\u2019 \u2019s wishes . In view of these considerations and the fact that the applicant was involved as a private citizen and not as for example a journalist , the gravity of the interference was diminished . The applicant challenged the judgment by an appeal disputing the interpretation of the relevant legal rules by ORG . In particular , he maintained that his entitlement to financial compensation was sui generis , and that it was based on the violation of his fundamental right as such and that the requirement of \u201c diminishment of dignity or position in society \u201d therefore did not apply to his case .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE fully endorsing its legal reasoning . No appeal lay against ORG judgment and it became final and binding on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant who was represented by a lawyer lodged a complaint under LAW with ORG . He argued that he had not received a fair trial in the proceedings in his action of DATE in that the courts had failed to assess his claim for financial compensation in the light of all the relevant evidence . They consequently drew incorrect conclusions and arbitrarily dismissed the claim while failing to support the dismissal by an adequate reasoning .", "On DATE the ORG sitting in camera pursuant to LAW of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG . , as amended ) held a preliminary examination of the complaint following which it declared it inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . It was observed that the applicant was in fact challenging legal conclusions of general courts which did not correspond to his wishes and which ORG had no jurisdiction to review unless contrary to constitutional principles . No such contradiction had however been established ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
