They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants owned a flat in ORG in which they lived until DATE . The flat is located on the first floor of a block of flats . On DATE the applicants and their neighbours participated in a ORG meeting . It was decided that the communal boiler room be dismantled and that each of the residents would provide for their own heating .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants\u2019 neighbour from the second floor , Mr S ( \u201c S \u201d ) , installed a central heating stove in his cellar and connected it to the chimney running through the applicants\u2019 flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to the building and fire inspectors to report that their ORG central heating stove had been installed without the necessary building permit and was causing carbon monoxide pollution in their flat . On DATE the fire inspector carried out an inspection of the chimney in the applicants and their ORG flats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC ordered S to dismantle the central heating stove . The Inspector established that the heating system had been installed without the building permit and that the exhaust tube was not wide enough . In consequence , the smoke from the coal burned in the stove had been coming out through the leaking ventilation system into the applicants\u2019 kitchen . The Inspector underlined that such smoke normally contained carbon monoxide , which constituted a danger to the applicants\u2019 health . S appealed unsuccessfully .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant repeatedly complained to the Inspector that his decision had not been enforced by S. On DATE ORG fined S for non - compliance with the decision to dismantle the stove .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Building Inspector carried out an inspection of the venue and informed the Mayor that the decision to dismantle the stove had been enforced . Another inspection was carried out on DATE . It confirmed that the heating installation had been dismantled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant complained to GPE about air pollution in her flat . On DATE the Sanitary Inspector confirmed that the nuisance caused in the applicants\u2019 flat by the smoke coming out of the chimney was due to the heating stove used by S. He further informed the applicants that it was the responsibility of the Mayor to ensure that the heating installation of their neighbours complied with the relevant building regulations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicants that the use of the central heating stove did not pose any danger to their life or health . According to the tests carried out by the sanitary authorities on DATE the concentration of carbon monoxide in their flat was below the permissible level .", "CARDINAL . On DATE applied to the GPE District Mayor ( \u201c the Mayor \u201d ; PERSON ) for a building permit to install a heating system in his cellar . The proceedings were instituted on DATE . On DATE the Mayor rejected the application on the grounds that S had not complied with ORG earlier decision to dismantle the heating system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE made a new application for a building permit . On DATE the Mayor granted it , having regard to the fact that the decision to dismantle the stove had been enforced . On DATE the PERSON Governor quashed the impugned decision . The subsequent Mayor \u2019s decision granting a building permit was again quashed on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor dismissed S \u2019s application for a building permit for lack of all the required documents . S appealed against the decision and on DATE the PERSON Governor quashed it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor stayed the proceedings for a building permit because their outcome depended on the conclusion of a related set of proceedings instituted by ORG ( see point CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor resumed the proceedings for a building permit at the ORG request . An inspection of the chimney in LOC \u2019s apartment revealed no defects . On DATE the Mayor discontinued the proceedings for a building permit as devoid of purpose , finding that S had complied with the conditions imposed by ORG and had been allowed to use the stove ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . On DATE the PERSON Governor quashed the decision since the applicants had not been given an opportunity to defend their position in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor again discontinued the proceedings . That decision was upheld by the Podlaski Governor on DATE following an inspection . The Governor found that the proceedings for the building permit were devoid of purpose because the applicants\u2019 neighbours had already installed the heating system . The applicants lodged a complaint with ORG which appears to have been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants informed ORG that S had been unlawfully using his heating stove .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG issued a decision aimed at regularising the heating installation and ordered S to prepare an expert opinion on its suitability . He observed that in accordance with LAW the installation at issue could not be subject to a demolition order . ORG established that there had been no causal link between the installation and the alleged air pollution and the fissures in the applicants\u2019 flat . In the light of various opinions submitted by the parties he expressed a preliminary view that the heating installation had complied with the relevant regulations .", "CARDINAL . The decision became final on DATE since the applicants did not appeal against it . Subsequently , they unsuccessfully requested the building authorities to declare it null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE submitted the opinion of an authorised expert on the suitability for use of their heating system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC carried out an inspection of the heating system which confirmed that S had fulfilled the conditions indicated in the above expert opinion . FAC informed the Mayor that his decision of DATE had been complied with and that S had been allowed to use the central heating stove .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Building Inspector re - opened ex officio the proceedings , having regard to ORG judgment of DATE which , in his opinion , concerned the same subject - matter ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the Building Inspector revoked his earlier decision of CARDINAL DATE and discontinued the proceedings for installation of the heating system by S , having regard to the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE . He found that the proceedings should not have been discontinued because the ORG heating stove had been still illegally connected to a chimney . ORG had also regard to a decision on interpretation of the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE applied to ORG for permission to use the stove . On DATE ORG issued a decision which formally confirmed that the neighbours had complied with the obligations imposed on them . The applicants appealed . Following a round of various decisions , ORG eventually concluded that ORG should have ordered an expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . ORG complied and an opinion prepared by an independent expert , Z.M was submitted on DATE . The opinion was based on the inspection of the heating installation , chimney and ventilation duct and on the analysis of relevant building regulations and various previous opinions . It evaluated in a very comprehensive manner the conditions of the use of the heating installation . The expert concluded that the chimney was impermeable and that the installation was compatible with the relevant regulations . The only technical shortcoming concerned the diameter of the tube in the chimney which should be increased . In respect of the stains in the applicants\u2019 flat , the expert found that they originated from the lack of correct ventilation of the flat due to a defective ventilation duct , and recommended the insulation of the duct with a view to resolving the issue . He excluded as entirely unproven the proposition put forward by the applicants and the opinion of expert PERSON submitted in the second set of civil proceedings that the tarry substances could have penetrated into the applicants\u2019 flat ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants contested that opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC ordered the neighbours to carry out some works in accordance with the expert opinion . That decision was subsequently quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG revoked his decision of DATE and ordered S to carry out the works recommended by the expert in his opinion of DATE . Following their unsuccessful appeal to ORG , the applicants filed a complaint with the administrative court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed their complaint as ill - founded . It thoroughly examined the opinion of expert PERSON and held that the opinion had clearly indicated that it was possible to make the installation conform to the relevant regulations . It further noted that the proposed solution was also aimed at elimination of neighbourly conflicts . The applicants appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeal . It concurred with the findings of the lower court and found no shortcomings in the expert opinion . The court emphasised that the solution concerning the regularisation of the installed heating system had not violated the law or the rights of third parties , including the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a civil action against S in which she sought restitution of a legal situation and abstention from infringements of law . She further sought MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly allowed her action in that it ordered the defendant to stop the infringements of the first applicant \u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of the possession by the use of the central heating stove . It held that the first applicant \u2019s claim for removal of the GPE heating system was too far - reaching and found it sufficient to have the applicants\u2019 kitchen restored to its original state . The court dismissed her claim for pecuniary damage as unsubstantiated . It established that the defendants had connected the heating system to a chimney which was not technically adapted to such a function . In consequence soot and tarry substances had been penetrating the ORG flat . The first applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected on formal grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer instituted enforcement proceedings . At a court hearing held on CARDINAL DATE the debtor stated that the creditor had not allowed him to enter the apartment in order to execute the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the enforcement proceedings at the first applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a decision on interpretation of its judgment of DATE . It held that the objective of its judgment was to prevent the defendants from causing nuisance to the applicants occasioned by the discharge of soot and tarry substances , however the fact that the stove had been connected to a chimney could not be seen per se in breach of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court discontinued the enforcement proceedings in the absence of a request from the creditor to resume the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted a new set of civil proceedings against S , in which they sought an order to dismantle the heating system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment in which it allowed the applicants\u2019 action , referring to the opinion of expert PERSON The court established that in spite of works undertaken by S , the negative effect on the applicants\u2019 flat , as found in its previous judgment of DATE , still existed . In particular , a wall in their kitchen had become stained as a result of the reaction of steam and soot which were penetrating through the leaky tube and chimney . The court thus ordered S to permanently disconnect the central heating stove and to brick up the entrance to the chimney .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer instituted enforcement proceedings . On CARDINAL DATE the court stayed the enforcement proceedings following the ORG request of CARDINAL DATE . Their request was related to the pending administrative proceedings . On DATE the court discontinued the enforcement proceedings as the applicants had not requested that they be resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant informed the police that an offence had been committed and requested them to initiate criminal proceedings against PERSON After initial discontinuation of the investigation , in DATE ORG indicted S before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court convicted S of a breach of building law and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The court found him guilty of installing the central heating stove in DATE without the required permits , of using it afterwards , and of reconnecting it in DATE in spite of the decisions of ORG ordering him to stop use of the stove . By using his central heating stove S had caused smoke containing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as well as tarry substances to penetrate into the applicants\u2019 flat which exposed the applicants to imminent danger to their life and health . The second applicant appealed against the judgment , arguing that the penalty imposed on S was too lenient . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . Subsequently , S served his prison term .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the prosecution service , apparently at the ORG request , instituted a second set of criminal proceedings against PERSON DATE the ORG gave a summary judgment in which it found S guilty of reconnecting the stove and using it DATE . The court sentenced him to DATE of restriction of liberty together with the obligation to perform TIME of unpaid work per month . The judgment became final and enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a third set of criminal proceedings was instituted against S. On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation , having regard , inter alia , to the results of the examination of the applicants\u2019 apartment by the sanitary authorities on DATE . The applicants appealed unsuccessfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants bought another flat in GPE , for which they obtained a mortgage . It appears that in DATE they moved out of the flat in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
