POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE . She is a student residing in ORG .", "A.", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s father opened on her behalf a special housing savings account in ORG in GPE , with the purpose of financing a future purchase of a house or apartment for the applicant after her coming of age . Until DATE he effected DATE payments to the account .", "On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s request , the ORG branch of ORG informed her that her savings accumulated on the account amounted to a sum of CARDINAL of new NORP zlotys ( PLZ ) , including a housing award , in case she was entitled to it .", "In a letter to the Director of the ORG branch of ORG , the applicant submitted that the then real value of a house in ORG was equivalent to CARDINAL PLZ . Thus , there must have been an error in the calculation of her savings , as the terms of the housing savings account guaranteed her that at the closing of the account the monies deposited on it would be reassessed so as to maintain their purchasing power to the level of price of QUANTITY of an individual house . She pointed out that the sum she had on her account was not in reasonable proportion to the current price of housing . She therefore requested that the error be rectified .", "In his reply of DATE , the Director informed the applicant that the calculation of her savings , and in particular of sums due to her as housing award , had been correct . Under the applicable regulations contained in the Ordinance of ORG DATE , concerning the manner of calculation and payment of housing award and on clearing of accounts between ORG and ORG , the following factors were taken into account in the calculation of the award : the length of the period of saving , the sums deposited by the client , the sums paid DATE , the average price of housing and the interest rate applicable throughout the relevant period . It was further stressed that the owner of the account was entitled to the housing award calculated on the basis of sums paid in DATE during which the average price of QUANTITY of housing had been rising more quickly than the interest rate to be paid on the sums deposited on the housing savings account . In conclusion , the calculation of the sums accumulated on the applicant \u2019s savings account which had been effected according to the formula set forth in the GPE , was correct .", "In a letter to the Minister of Finance of DATE , the applicant submitted that the sums as calculated by the bank would cover the price of QUANTITY of housing at current market prices . Therefore , contrary to the terms of the housing savings account , guaranteed by the ORG , she would not be able to purchase a house . She complained that this amounted to fraud , which should not be countenanced by the ORG . She requested that her savings be reassessed .", "In a letter of DATE ORG of ORG informed the applicant that the savings accumulated on the housing savings accounts were subject to CARDINAL forms of reassessment with the purpose of offsetting the effects of inflation . The first one was the privileged interest rate which , since DATE , was equal to that applicable in respect of long - term savings accounts . Secondly , the owners of the accounts could be awarded housing awards paid directly from the ORG budget . These awards were designed to compensate the reduction of value of sums accumulated on the housing savings accounts caused by inflation and by augmentation of prices of housing resulting therefrom . However , the sums of awards due to individual clients were to be calculated on the basis of the savings accumulated by the client . It was further stressed that , in practice , most often the owners of such accounts accumulated sums equivalent to CARDINAL per cent of the necessary minimum contribution to be paid to housing co - operatives in order to become a full member ( \u201c wk\u0142ad \u201d ) . The expectation that the housing award would cover in full the difference between this sum and the actual full costs of building of a house was not justified . The applicant was further informed that it was only the bank at which the account had been opened which was competent to reassess the sums of savings deposited on the account .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG about her situation .", "In reply of DATE the ORG informed the applicant that he had repeatedly drawn the attention of various ORG authorities , including the Prime Minister , ORG , the Minister of Construction and Planning , to the issues raised by her . These problems arose out of the fact that the persons who had been saving , frequently for DATE , on the housing savings accounts , were often not in a position to pay the entire price of housing . This was , in part , due to the fact that the issues relating to housing awards , the interest rate applicable to housing savings accounts and the reassessment of the sums deposited on these accounts so as to offset in full the results of inflation had not been comprehensively resolved by the legislator in a manner which would be entirely compatible with the initial obligations of the ORG . Regrettably , the ORG did not have at his disposal any effective means which would enable him to oblige the legislative and executive authorities to take any steps to solve the problems of persons in the applicant \u2019s situation , who had expected that they would be able to finance their housing under the scheme put in place by the DATE legislation . Consequently , he could take no further action in the applicant \u2019s case .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Pursuant to the terms of the housing savings account , as set out in the Ordinance of the President of ORG of DATE , the ORG guaranteed that the monies accumulated on the housing savings account in ORG were to be reassessed so as to maintain their purchasing power . This guaranty covered only sums up to the costs of construction of either QUANTITY at an individual family house or QUANTITY of an apartment built by a housing co - operative . This guarantee was to be paid in the form of a housing award . The owner of the account was entitled to obtain the housing award if , in DATE in which he or she wished to close his or her account and allocate the monies accumulated on it to finance the purchase of a house or apartment , the average price of QUANTITY of housing was higher than it had been in DATE , and this increase had been higher than the increase of the interest rate applicable to the monies deposited on the housing savings account .", "Under ORG the persons who have accumulated savings on the housing savings accounts in ORG opened before DATE , which had remained opened for not DATE , were entitled to housing award if they had bought or built a house or apartment , or adapted non - housing space to housing purposes and had paid for it from their own resources . It was ORG which financed those payments and technically they were to be carried out by ORG .", "In its resolution of DATE ORG decided that under the provisions of LAW as amended in DATE , the housing savings were not subject to reassessment by ORG which would offset the results of inflation in full . In taking this decision the ORG had regard to the provisions of LAW pertaining to a possibility of reassessment of pecuniary obligations in view of inflation . These provisions expressly excluded such a possibility in respect of sums deposited on bank accounts .", "As regards the housing savings awards , ORG further decided that those awards were not subject to reassessment either . The ORG observed , inter alia , that the problem concerned CARDINAL citizens who had accumulated housing savings . A reassessment of the housing awards for all the persons concerned by ORG would not be economically feasible as it would put an undue burden on the ORG budget . The ORG further observed that , in any event , ORG DATE provided for a partial reassessment of such awards in the circumstances and on the conditions set forth therein ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
