The decision was identical to the one issued on DATE , save for CARDINAL paragraphs , in which the investigator restated the results of an additional medical examination of the applicant performed on DATE and cited the report of the applicant \u2019s questioning on DATE . It appears from the investigator \u2019s decision that during the questioning on DATE the applicant refuted his previous statement given to the police officers on DATE and insisted that he had been beaten up at the police station after his arrest .

According to PERSON , the applicant had told him that he had hit his head against a bookshelf a number of times during the interrogation , and had broken a tap in a lavatory in the police station and had poured water on his clothes . The commission concluded that the applicant \u2019s head injury had resulted from his own careless actions and that his statements about the beatings should be treated with caution as they had been merely revenge for his arrest and the subsequent institution of criminal proceedings against him . The commission also noted that it had been impossible to establish the cause of the bruises on his back and chest .
