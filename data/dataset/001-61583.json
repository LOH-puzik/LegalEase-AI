In addition , the applicant was charged with possession of a forged passport .

In this connection , the prosecutor referred to medical opinions , which stated that the applicant was neither mentally ill nor retarded and that his detention would not cause any risk to his health and life .

Furthermore , the court pointed out that the investigation of the case would have to be continued in order to clarify the applicant \u2019s role in the commission of the criminal offences and to identify individuals who would be charged with receiving stolen goods from the applicant . Finally , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s case did not disclose any of the grounds for release from detention listed in LAW of LAW , i.e. danger to the detainee \u2019s life or health and extreme hardship caused to either the detainee or his family .

On DATE the applicant asked ORG to release him from detention . On DATE the court dismissed his request . It considered that the evidence collected in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against the applicant . As the charges could lead to a severe prison sentence , there was a risk of absconding .

On DATE the Vice - President of ORG informed ORG and the applicant that the applicant \u2019s case did not disclose that the proceedings had taken unreasonably long .

Furthermore , the ORG observed that the first hearing had been cancelled because CARDINAL of the defendants had been ill .

In addition , the appellate court considered that the trial court \u2019s statement on the applicant \u2019s intention to abscond was not precise enough . As the applicant \u2019s detention had already lasted DATE and as he was not charged with a serious offence , the mere reference to the possibility that the applicant could abscond because of the prospect of a severe penalty was not sufficient . The appellate court also observed that the trial court had not considered whether another preventive measure could replace the applicant \u2019s detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL applications for release submitted in DATE and DATE . The court considered that the charges against the applicant were sufficiently supported by the evidence . Moreover , the difficulties in finding the applicant \u2019s place of residence during the investigative stage of the proceedings and the prospect of a severe penalty showed that he could go into hiding if released from detention . The court further noted that the applicant could not be released on bail as he had stated that he had no funds to pay it .

The appellate court observed that the applicant \u2019s release would delay the proceedings , as his cohabitee lived in Opole .

It considered that the factual and legal circumstances concerning the applicant \u2019s detention had not changed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG request and extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE . It considered that the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention was justified by the evidence , the possibility that he could go into hiding and the complexity of the case . It also observed that the delay in the proceedings was caused by the behaviour of defendants who had failed to attend hearings .", "ORG further reflected on the legality of the applicant \u2019s detention DATE . The relevant part of the court \u2019s reasoning may be summarised as follows :", "ORG , noting that the application was filed on DATE but posted as late as DATE , first considered what was the proper date of \u2018 ORG such an application for the purposes of LAW .", "ORG next observed that , depending on the answer to this question , it would have to determine the legal consequences of a potential failure on the part of ORG to respect the rule laid down in DATE a ) LAW of DATE , which stated that in cases where no request for a further prolongation of detention on remand had been \u2018 lodged\u2019 , the detention on remand had to be lifted and the person concerned released not later than on DATE .", "ORG considered that it should also deal with the question of whether it was competent to rule on the application if it had been \u2018 lodged\u2019 after the expiry of the term referred to in LAW ( a ) of LAW of DATE , i.e. after DATE .", "Referring to the first question , ORG held that the proper date of \u2018 ORG an application under LAW of LAW had to be deemed either the date of posting the request or the date of submitting it to the registry of ORG since to hold otherwise would mean leaving a detainee without any guarantee that ORG was properly supervising his detention . Moreover , if the requesting court was not bound by any time - limits for submitting its application , detention , the most severe among the preventive measures , might continue for an unspecified and unlimited time outside ORG supervision . In consequence , an application under LAW of LAW , a mere \u2018 proposal\u2019 to continue detention , would , for all practical purposes , transform into a basis for continuing detention . Clearly , that was not the intention of the legislator .", "ORG therefore concluded that since in the applicant \u2019s case no application for a further prolongation of his detention was \u2018 lodged\u2019 DATE , the applicant \u2019s ( and his GPE ) detention from DATE to the date of its present decision lacked any legal basis and was , accordingly , unlawful .", "It went on to find that it was , nevertheless , competent to deal with the application lodged outside the relevant date . It considered that a lower court \u2019s obligation to release a detainee in case of its failure properly to lodge an application under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure was CARDINAL thing , but its right to make such an application at any time was another . In ORG opinion , the application in question should be deemed a \u201c fresh application \u201d and be examined as such .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that his complaints about his unjustified detention on remand were unsubstantiated .
