He lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was involved in a road accident . The Brussels Crown prosecutor , who was informed of the accident by the police officers called to the scene , ordered the applicant \u2019s driving licence to be immediately withdrawn on the ground that he was presumed to have been driving with a blood - alcohol level of QUANTITY , which was the prescribed limit in GPE at the material time . That presumption was , however , disputed by the applicant . As the applicant was unable to perform a breath test at the scene of the accident , a blood test was carried out at TIME on DATE . The applicant was informed of the result in DATE . It revealed an alcohol level of QUANTITY of blood , which , to allow for the time which had elapsed , was adjusted to QUANTITY at the time of the accident .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had not been carrying his driving licence on DATE , the police came to seize it at his house DATE pursuant to the order for its immediate withdrawal . It was handed to them by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a registered letter to the ORG prosecutor asking for his driving licence to be returned to him . In a letter of DATE he was invited to collect it , which he did .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after receiving the result of the test which had been taken to determine the level of alcohol in his blood ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant requested a second test from a different medical laboratory . He informed the ORG prosecutor DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was served with a bailiff \u2019s writ in which he was summoned by the ORG prosecutor to appear on DATE before the police court in GPE on charges of unintentionally causing bodily injury ( charge A ) , driving a vehicle whilst drunk or in a similar condition ( charge B ) , driving a vehicle with an alcohol level of QUANTITY of blood ( charge C ) , failing to give way to traffic coming from the right ( charge D ) and failing to maintain constant control of a vehicle driven by him ( charge E ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police court in GPE sentenced the applicant to a fine of MONEY ( BEF ) and disqualified him from driving for DATE , less DATE for which his driving licence had already been withdrawn . The court also made the reinstatement of his right to drive conditional on his being medically certified fit to drive . It gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As regards charges A , D and E", "It appears from the criminal investigation and the evidence adduced at the hearing that these CARDINAL charges have been made out .", "At TIME on DATE in ORG the defendant , who was driving a ORG , came out of FAC onto the crossroads between that main road and FAC and should have given way to a ORG being driven by PERSON , who was coming from the right out of FAC and heading towards FAC .", "The plan accepted by the defendant shows that the collision between the CARDINAL vehicles occurred in the middle of the crossroads . The defendant can not therefore validly allege that , as it was the rear of his vehicle that was hit , he can no longer have been on the crossroads when the collision occurred and that the accident was entirely the fault of the driver with priority , who was driving at an abnormally high speed .", "It would appear , on the contrary , that it was the defendant who , in addition to failing to give way to the driver with priority , lost control of his vehicle , since after colliding at the crossroads with ORG \u2019s ORG , far from managing to stop , he continued his course , mounting the pavement of the ORG beyond the crossroads , and crashing successively into the front of CARDINAL buildings and into the right - hand side of a number of legally parked vehicles .", "As luck would have it , there were no pedestrians on the pavement in front of the buildings . If there had been , the consequences of the defendant \u2019s manner of driving would have been catastrophic .", "Nonetheless , the accident caused by the defendant resulted in injuries to the CARDINAL passengers in the ORG car .", "CARDINAL . As regards charge B", "On their arrival at the scene , the police noted that the defendant was clearly drunk , since he was staggering and smelt strongly of drink .", "The defendant was incapable of blowing , so a breath test could not be taken .", "On the defendant \u2019s arrival at the police station , the police sergeant also observed that he was staggering and that his breath smelt of drink . He noted that Doctor PERSON , who had been called out TIME after the accident , had concluded in his report that although the defendant exhibited no outward signs of drunkenness , the symptoms he had noted were due to the consumption of alcohol and that the defendant must have been under the influence of drink , since he claimed not even to have been involved in any accident .", "On being interviewed TIME after the accident , at TIME ( after being detained ) , at which time the result of the breath test was known to be negative , the defendant stated :", "( i ) that a vehicle he had not seen approaching had crashed into him ;", "( ii ) that he could remember nothing after the crash , even though he was neither injured nor bruised ;", "( iii ) that he had drunk CARDINAL alcohol - free beers at home , which he then corrected to CARDINAL \u2018 Tourtel\u2019 , and taken morphine - type medicines for his cancer .", "It follows that Mr Escoubet must have been driving his vehicle on the public highway whilst drunk or in a similar condition caused by drugs or hallucinogenic substances , inferences being capable of standing as proof ( see PERSON . [ Court of Cassation ] CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , PERSON . [ Pasicrisie ] DATE , I , CARDINAL ) .", "The defendant must have known that he could not drive if he was taking medicine such as morphine at the same time as drinking beer , even ORG .", "Such a mixture inevitably affected his driving , since he did not even know where the driver with priority had appeared from and continued his course for QUANTITY along the pavement beyond the spot at which the collision had occurred , without making any attempt whatsoever to stop .", "Charge B has therefore been made out .", "CARDINAL . As regards charge C", "Despite the fact that Professor PERSON concluded that the level of alcohol in the defendant \u2019s blood was QUANTITY , adjusted to QUANTITY to allow for the time which had elapsed since the accident , and that the second expert opinion DATE requested within the prescribed time , and carried out by PERSON , a laboratory analyst \u2013 showed there to have been QUANTITY of ethanol per litre of blood , which is well over the prescribed limit , the ORG , having regard to the rights of the defence and to the fact that the criminal law must be narrowly construed , considers that in the instant case the result of the blood test can not be taken into consideration .", "It appears from the criminal case file that Doctor PERSON , who performed the blood test at TIME , had to use his own equipment , as CARDINAL blood collection tubes were necessary .", "PERSON , the laboratory analyst , noted that the blood sample had not been submitted to him in the statutory collection tube and had not been labelled with the defendant \u2019s name .", "LAW of DATE requires the authority requesting a blood test to supply the doctor with a collection tube and disinfectant in aqueous solution containing sodium fluoride and LAW tube to be labelled with the first name and surname of the person from whom the blood sample was taken .", "Blood tests carried out in breach of the strict rules laid down by LAW of DATE can not be admitted in evidence ( see ORG [ Editor \u2019s note : the capital of water consumption ] CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . PERSON . GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) ; likewise , a blood test taken with a syringe instead of a tube is inadmissible and the ORG can not take the result into consideration ( see ORG , CARDINAL , PERSON . GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "LAW of DATE requires the relevant authority to provide the doctor taking a blood sample with a collection tube that complies with the conditions laid down in that LAW and in a ministerial decree ( of CARDINAL DATE ) . A tube so supplied is deemed , subject to contrary evidence , to comply with the legal requirements , whereas an analysis of a blood sample taken with a tube which has not been supplied to the doctor by the said authority has no probative value unless it can be established that it satisfied the said legal requirements ( see PERSON . , CARDINAL , Pas . DATE , I , CARDINAL ) .", "Thus , in the instant case , for the reasons set out above , as Doctor PERSON had to use his own equipment , and no further details as to the type of equipment have been given , charge C has not been made out .", "...", "Charges A , B , D and E all arise out of the same criminal act .", "It is therefore appropriate to impose a single penalty , namely the heaviest one applicable , being that attracted by charge B.", "Having regard therefore to the fact that Mr LOC has no criminal record and that , according to his counsel , he is suffering from throat cancer , this ORG will dispose of the case by sentencing the defendant only to the fine stipulated hereafter and , under charge B , to disqualification from driving any motor vehicle ( for a period which takes account , in particular , of the above - mentioned factors ) and the obligation to undergo only the medical examination to determine whether or not he can be permitted to drive again ( LAW of LAW of DATE ) since Mr Escoubet was personally responsible for the offence and , moreover , admitted that he had been driving whilst under the influence of morphine - type medicines . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which held that charges A , D and E had been made out , but not charge B. It gave the following grounds for its decision :", "\u201c The police officers did indeed observe that after the accident the defendant was staggering and smelt strongly of alcohol ; however , unsteadiness after an accident can be caused by the shock suffered at the time of the collision . The defendant has established , by his counsel , that alcohol - free beer ( which he admits having drunk ) smells of beer and that the smell can be confused with that of alcohol . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the court sentenced the applicant to a fine of BEF CARDINAL,CARDINAL and disqualified him from driving for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Immediate withdrawal of driving licences was introduced in GPE by section CARDINAL of the Law of CARDINAL DATE . The explanatory memorandum of that PERSON states that \u201c immediately withdrawing a driver \u2019s or learner driver \u2019s licence will take a dangerous driver off the roads pending a court \u2019s decision in his or her case and will also encourage drivers to obey the regulations \u201d ( PERSON .

The various legal provisions governing road traffic have been grouped together under the consolidated Acts of CARDINAL DATE on the policing of road traffic , which constitute a separate criminal statute . Part I of those consolidated Acts , entitled \u201c Regulations \u201d , lays down , inter alia , powers for controlling traffic on the various public highways , powers to authorise sporting events and competitions on the public highways and provides for the possibility of setting up advisory boards to deal with traffic and parking issues . Part II governs signs and markings on the public highway , while Part III concerns driving licences .

Chapter VIII of the consolidated Acts of CARDINAL DATE , contained in Part IV , is entitled \u201c Immediate withdrawal of a driver \u2019s or learner driver \u2019s licence \u201d .

Section CARDINAL of the consolidated Acts of DATE was amended by LAW DATE . Section CARDINAL , thus amended , came into force on DATE . The amendment concerned point CARDINAL : the provision \u201c \u2026 if the driver or person accompanying a learner driver is obviously drunk or exhibits visible signs of being drunk ; \u201d has been replaced by \u201c \u2026 in the cases referred to under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ; \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG has ruled that tribunals of fact do not have jurisdiction to assess whether the immediate withdrawal of a driving licence pursuant to sections CARDINAL et seq . of ORG is compatible with the Convention because it is not the role of the courts to criticise the use made by the ORG prosecutor of his powers ( PERSON . , CARDINAL DATE ) . In a judgment of DATE that court specified that \u201c the withdrawal of a driving licence under LAW of the Law of DATE on the policing of road traffic is not a penalty , but a preventive measure designed to take a dangerous driver off the roads for a specific period of time \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
