DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mr PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "From DATE until DATE the applicant was employed , notably as a passenger assistant by a NORP shipping company , henceforth called PERSON ( NORP Seaways ) , and he was a member of a trade union , henceforth called GPE ( ORG ) .", "In his employment the applicant had no responsibility for the primary operation of the ship but as a crewmember he was involved with the safety on board . At the relevant time he worked in shifts of DATE at work on board followed by DATE of leave on land .", "ORG had issued a circular on DATE laying down that all staff on board had to submit to an alcohol test if so required by the authorities or the shipping company / shipmaster .", "On DATE ORG issued a new set of regulations concerning its staff policy on alcohol and drugs which inter alia stated that when on duty on board the employees were allowed a blood alcohol level of QUANTITY and when on leave on board CARDINAL per mille . When on board the employees were not allowed to be in possession of or use drugs or any other intoxicating substances or have any remains thereof in their bodies traceable by a urine test . A passage headlined \u201c control \u201d stated :", "\u201c By request of authorities , the ORG or ORG all employees are under an obligation to submit to tests for alcohol , drugs or any other intoxicating substances . The employees can expect to undergo such a test without notice at least once a year . \u201d", "A passage headlined \u201c violation of these regulations \u201d stated inter alia :", "\u201c A violation of these regulations will be regarded as a considerable breach of the conditions of employment and can lead to immediate dismissal ... \u201d", "A copy of the regulations was distributed to the employees who were requested to sign it thereby confirming that they have read and understood it .", "In DATE ORG introduced random mandatory alcohol and drug test requiring the person concerned to provide a sample of urine .", "In letters of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and another trade union henceforth called ORG ( PERSON ) informed PERSON that they could not approve of the new set of regulations . Thus , a conciliation meeting was held on DATE between the employer and the said trade union , but the parties failed to reach an agreement .", "On DATE the applicant , allegedly without any kind of suspicion , was requested to provide an urine sample behind a screen in a room in which a person from a NORP company called Medscreen , hired for this purpose , was present . It appears that no trace of alcohol or drugs was found .", "ORG and ORG instituted civil proceedings against ORG before ORG claiming that ORG should acknowledge that the control procedure introduced by the regulations of DATE was wrong and that accordingly , despite any given signature the employees could not be obliged to provide a urine sample . Among other arguments they claimed that the random urine tests were in breach of LAW . On DATE ORG found for ORG . In its decision the ORG stated :", "\u201c Since a majority could not be obtained amongst the arbitrators the case will be decided by the president who states :", "Pursuant to case law and practises in labour market matters the right of management encompasses the right to issue regulations justified by operational considerations . Likewise , the management have a right to introduce measures of control justified by operational considerations if such measures have a reasonable purpose , do not offend the employees\u2019 dignity , and do not cause any loss or appreciable inconvenience for the employees .", "It is undisputed that alcohol is a legal stimulant and drugs are not , though in GPE the possession of hashish for ones own consumption is seen as a minor offence . The presence of drugs on board might in certain countries lead to the detention of the ship or to other sanctions against the ship , which is CARDINAL of the reasons why the merchant navy prohibits any possession of drugs on board .", "The past regulations [ of DATE ] issued by ORG solely authorised a control measure with regard to the employees\u2019 alcohol consumption . It appears that the past regulations were not objected to and , as the case has been presented before the ORG , it is mainly the test introduced [ in DATE ] for drugs and other intoxicating substances that caused the present dispute .", "It is undisputed that on CARDINAL occasions within DATE CARDINAL employees have been in possession of and used drugs . The testimonies heard before the court substantiate that some employees on board have used drugs as a stimulant , which must be considered a serious problem . Therefore , PERSON do have a justified reason for introducing measures of control suitable and contributing to solve this problem .", "The consumption of alcohol will usually be traceable by the smell or by using a breathalyser . This is not the case when it comes to drugs or any other intoxicating substances . Taking a blood sample would require the consent of the person concerned . It is indeed very difficult simply by observation to ascertain whether a person has used drugs and a clinical test does not with sufficient certainty provide an indication of the employee \u2019s ability to perform his or her duty . Thus , providing a urine sample is a possible measure of control .", "There is no substantiation for assuming that ORG uses the test for any other purposes than to control the employees\u2019 consumption of alcohol and drugs . No information is provided as to whether the samples are stored , and in the affirmative how , but any extension of the test , be it on the basis of a sample already submitted or of future tests , do require that the employees are informed . Also such an extension may be brought before a Court of Arbitration for review .", "The employees do not suffer any loss as the test is submitted to during TIME .", "The control measure introduced by ORG applies to all employees on board including the Captain . X testified that the test is performed in a room in private . Thereafter the urine sample is handed over . In this way the test can not be considered to expose the individual \u2019s decency . In addition , since everybody is obliged to submit to the test the individual \u2019s honour can not be considered infringed .", "The plaintiff has submitted that the test infringes the employees\u2019 spare time , as it will reveal which activities the employees have been involved in . However , an employer must be entitled to demand that an employee coming to work is capable of performing his or her duties . Accordingly , this entails some limits on the employees\u2019 spare time before coming to work . However , having regard to the fact that the consumption of alcohol and the use of drugs , unless taken on a regularly basis , do not leave traces for CARDINAL or two days , the ORG does not find that the measure in question infringes the right to respect for private life to such an extent that random tests thereby should be excluded . The employees\u2019 rotation system whereby a leave on board is followed by a leave off board does not reverse this finding .", "ORG ) has stated that besides from reducing learning and memory , using hashish might reduce one \u2019s psychomotor functions up till TIME when doing complex tasks . Perhaps no problems will occur when doing the daily tasks that the plaintiff \u2019s members perform . Nevertheless , as all crew members are part of the safety crew , though rarely needed , it is absolutely essential that they are , in a fully adequate way at all times , able to perform functions related to the safety on board , which in case of a catastrophe might entail complex tasks . Accordingly , operational considerations do justify that the defendant introduced the control measure in question . The fact that no survey has been carried out as to the customers expectations to the safety on board does not reverse this finding since , having regard to the latest catastrophes on ships in the NORP oceans , a customer has a right to assume that the shipping company aim to have as much safety on board as possible , and that the company makes sure that its crew members can perform their safety tasks in a fully adequate way .", "The regulations in question contain a passage according to which a violation will lead to immediate dismissal . The defendant can not unilaterally by introducing such a passage change the required conditions for a dismissal , and a given signature by an employee on the regulations does not entail that such a change has been accepted . However , with regard to a possible dismissal the defendant did in fact express in the pleading that the burden of proof falls upon the shipping company . \u201d", "Below is a general description of the NORP industrial relations system , also known as the \u201c Danish Model \u201d .", "The struggle at DATE between on the CARDINAL side employees and their unions ( notably what is DATE called the ORG , i.e. ORG ) and on the other side the employers and their federations ( mainly the central organisation DA , i.e. ORG ) resulted in the so - called DATE Agreement from DATE between the ORG and the ORG .

By tradition the NORP legislature plays a minor role as regards governing wages , salaries and employment conditions . Accordingly , rights imposed by statute in other countries have in GPE been obtained by agreements between the labour market partners . It is thus characteristic of NORP law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements ( collective and individuals ) , labour law principles and general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes .", "Thus , according to the \u201c Danish Model \u201d the content and scope of an employer \u2019s managerial right or his right to carry out control measures depend on labour law principles in so far as it is not governed by any agreements or by statutes or rules laid down in pursuance of statutes .

The control measure may not be unnecessary , but must serve a sensible purpose .", "CARDINAL . The form of it may not be humiliating for the employees .", "CARDINAL . It may not cause any loss or significant inconvenience .", "CARDINAL . It must be possible to submit the justification of the measure to industrial arbitration .", "CARDINAL . When a control measure has proved expedient and has been practised on the majority of the company employees , it can be extended to cover the rest of the staff .", "CARDINAL . The employer should notify his staff as early as possible of any contemplated control measure .", "CARDINAL . Employees shall - at least in so far , cf . point CARDINAL above - observe the employer \u2019s requirement of introduction of a control measure , and the trade union may be held responsible if it supports any resistance .", "CARDINAL . The collective agreement need not include any authority for the introduction of control measures . If a regular scheme has been laid down in the collective agreement , the employees may reject changes during the term of the agreement if they have a legitimate interest in raising such objections .", "CARDINAL . Normally there is no obligation to compensate the time spent in connection with a control measure because such obligations only exist if the measure results in \u201c undue delay \u201d to the employees .", "CARDINAL .

Other stimulants than alcohol may be involved .", "Such examinations fall outside the scope of the bill to the extent the individual measure is not also intended to procure data on diseases or the risk of developing or contracting a disease .
