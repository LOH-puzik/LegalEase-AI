On DATE the Audiencia provincial formally noted that notice of appeal had been given ( \u201c se tiene por preparado el recurso \u201d ) and on DATE it summoned the parties to appear before ORG to enter the appeal within DATE time - limit laid down by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

In its decision ( auto ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG held at the outset that , pursuant to transitional provision no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied to cases such as the one before it in which an appeal had not been entered until after that PERSON had come into force , even if notice of intention to lodge the appeal had been given beforehand . It went on to find that the DATE amount of rent payable under the lease in question was MONEY , which was less than the minimum amount ( MONEY ) required under the new legislation for an appeal to lie to ORG .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG , declining to adopt the opinion of ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s amparo appeal on DATE . It reiterated that the interpretation of transitional provisions was a matter for the ordinary courts and held that the criteria relied on by ORG in the impugned decision for declaring the appeal on points of law inadmissible were both reasoned and reasonable . That court \u2019s construction of the provisions of the new legislation was neither arbitrary nor ill - founded . The fact that in its decision it had relied on a provision that had come into force after notice of appeal had been given but before the appeal had been entered with ORG was not decisive as no constitutional provision prohibited amending the appeals procedure so long as the right to a fair hearing was protected .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) of DATE , which concerned a case similar to the instant CARDINAL , ORG laid down the principles governing the application ratione temporis of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE . It stated , in particular , that ORG interpretation of transitional provision no . CARDINAL , though justified on the facts , should not be considered the only construction possible . It also explained that the term \u201c interposici\u00f3n \u201d used in transitional provision no . CARDINAL referred to the entering of an appeal on points of law with ORG and not the giving of notice of appeal to the Audiencia provincial . Consequently , the system prior to the amendment introduced by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied to giving notice of appeal and the new system to entering an appeal . ORG also referred to its settled case - law to the effect that LAW did not afford parties to proceedings any guarantee that the appeals system established by law would not be modified , so long as the parties\u2019 right to a \u201c fair hearing \u201d was not infringed and decisions declaring appeals inadmissible were not unjustified or ill - founded . Lastly , it pointed out with regard to transitional provisions that , in accordance with LAW , it was for the ordinary courts alone to determine the applicable rule . In conclusion , ORG dismissed the amparo appeal .", "CARDINAL . Earlier , in a decision of DATE concerning amparo appeal no . CARDINAL , ORG had considered the issue of the applicability ratione temporis of the second transitional provision of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE . That provision also amended LAW but , unlike PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , provided : \u201c After the proceedings to which they refer have ended , appeals to ORG which have been entered ( interpuestos ) shall be conducted in accordance with the amendments made by this PERSON . \u201d In that case the appellants had given notice of appeal in accordance with the provisions of legislation previously in force and had then entered the appeal in accordance with the provisions of the new legislation , the substantive requirements of which were , however , no different from those of the earlier legislation . ORG held that while the word \u201c interponer \u201d appeared to refer to the formal entering of the appeal , the reference to the ending of the proceedings suggested , however , that the legislature \u2019s intention had not been to alter the rules applicable to appeals of which notice had been given but which had yet to be entered . ORG held that ORG interpretation of that transitional provision could not be regarded as unfounded , still less as unreasonable , and that the decision as to which legislation governed the entering of the appeal \u2013 in that case the legislation previously in force \u2013 had not been deficient constitutionally . ORG accordingly allowed the amparo appeal , holding that the appellants had been the victims of excessive formalism ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
