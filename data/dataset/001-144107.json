The commission started its investigation on DATE , DATE after the accident .", "CARDINAL . According to the report drafted by the commission , which was completed on DATE , the accident had occurred because of the improper organisation of the procedure for inspecting the merchandise . It stated that there were several concurrent causes which had led to the applicant \u2019s accident .", "CARDINAL . The report stated that the receipt of the wagons by company E from ORG had not been effected in accordance with the framework agreement signed on DATE by FAC and company M , or with the document entitled \u201c Declara\u021bie \u201d signed by company M , company E and ORG .

By a judgment of DATE LOC Court allowed the complaint and held that ORG should be held liable for the accident . Its reasoning was as follows : \u201c Demonstrating gross negligence , the representatives of ORG did not order the removal of the CARDINAL freight wagons to the industrial track \u201d . The industrial track was not electrified . The court continued its reasoning by stating that since ORG had agreed to transport the merchandise by presenting the necessary documents to the customs authority , it had become responsible for the operation . In accordance with decision TCARDINAL concerning the application to NORP territory of the common transit system for rail freight transport , ORG was required , among other obligations , to ensure appropriate conditions for a safe customs inspection . The court concluded that by leaving the CARDINAL freight wagons on high voltage railway tracks without informing all the persons involved in the customs inspection , ORG had failed to fulfil that obligation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The special commission also imposed a fine on the manager of company E on the ground that he had not taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the customs inspection , and that although he had accompanied the applicant to the railway station he had not made a written request for the removal of the freight wagons from the electrified railway track .", "CARDINAL .

DATE , which was located outside the railway station , and that employees of ORG should have moved the wagons from the railway station to track no . CARDINAL . It concluded that the employee of ORG who had also been present at the customs inspection , FAC , had assured the applicant that he could perform his inspection even though the wagons were on an electrified track .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the prosecutor \u2019s office to start a criminal investigation into whether the manager of company E could be held responsible for the accident . Accordingly , the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to FAC opened a preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave a statement before the prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE . He informed that he intended to claim compensation from the persons found responsible for the accident .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prosecutor decided not to initiate a criminal investigation on the ground that the accident had been caused through the applicant \u2019s own fault . That decision was upheld by the chief prosecutor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG . He contended that the investigation body had not managed to clarify the circumstances under which the accident had occurred and therefore it was necessary to hold a confrontation between all the witnesses who had given contradictory statements , and that a reconstruction of the accident scene would be useful . As to the presence of GPE , the employee of ORG , at the scene of the accident , even the statements of her own colleagues were contradictory . The applicant further maintained that without PERSON , who had accompanied them to track no . DATE , he and the manager of company E would not have been able to find the wagons to be inspected . The applicant also claimed that the warning sign on the wagons to be inspected had not been there at the time of the accident but had been placed there after the accident . In this connection , he pointed out that such a sign could not be seen in the photographs taken by the police officers who had examined the scene immediately after the accident . The sign appeared only in the photographs taken by ORG DATE after the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as unfounded . He held that the applicant alone was responsible for the accident because he had mounted the wagon while it was connected to live electricity without paying heed to the warning sign on the wagon and the framework agreement signed by ORG and the beneficiary ( company E ) . He dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegation that the warning sign had not been attached to the wagon on DATE of the accident , stating that the sign could not be seen from the angle at which the photographs had been taken on DATE . He also dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to have the witnesses reheard on the ground that their statements were not relevant in so far as they could not make any difference to the final conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG , alleging that the staff of ORG were responsible for the accident . By a judgment of DATE the court allowed the complaint and sent the file back to the prosecutor \u2019s office for an expert report to be drafted and for it to be determined whether ORG , the employee of ORG who the applicant claimed had accompanied him to the freight train , bore any responsibility . The experts were to establish whether the railway tracks had been electrified when the applicant climbed onto the freight train on DATE of accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal on points of law lodged by the prosecutor \u2019s office and quashed the judgment of DATE on the ground that on the basis of Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the first - instance court could not remit the case to the prosecutor \u2019s office for further investigation . Consequently , the file was sent back to ORG for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision not to initiate a criminal investigation . It held that none of ORG employees had been responsible for the applicant \u2019s accident . In this connection , it found that according to the statements given by PERCENT \u2019s colleagues , she had not accompanied the applicant , ORG and the manager of company E to the freight train . It also stated , however , that the customs inspection should have been carried out at track no . CARDINAL and not at track no . CARDINAL . It concluded that the applicant alone was responsible for the accident because he had not paid heed to the warning sign on the wagon and the framework agreement signed by ORG and company E.", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the manager of ORG for forgery of a document called \u201c Declara\u021bie \u201d , submitted to the special commission while it was carrying out its investigation into the accident . The document was in fact an agreement signed by ORG , company E and company M stipulating that customs inspections of merchandise should be carried out only at track no . CARDINAL ( which was not electrified ) . The applicant stated that the manager had drafted it and asked the managers of the CARDINAL other companies to sign it immediately after the applicant \u2019s accident ( on DATE ) , but had given DATE as the date of signing .", "CARDINAL . After repeated decisions not to initiate criminal proceedings delivered on DATE , DATE and DATE , on DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to LOC Court indicted the manager of ORG for abuse of office , forgery and the use of forged documents , and sent his file to LOC .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , LOC Court found the manager guilty as charged . It held that he had drafted the agreement in order to protect his company from liability for the applicant \u2019s accident . The subsequent appeal and appeal on points of law were dismissed as unfounded by ORG and ORG on CARDINAL April and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for judicial review of the criminal judgment rendered on DATE by FAC . He claimed that there were new elements which could prove the guilt of ORG in respect of the events which had led to his accident . In this connection he relied on the final decision of LOC of DATE , by which the manager of ORG had been found guilty of the forgery of the document entitled \u201c Declara\u021bie \u201d which had been used as evidence in the criminal proceedings relating to the applicant \u2019s accident . He also applied for CARDINAL new witnesses to be heard on the question of whether PERSON had been present when the accident occurred .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that that document had played a decisive role in the conclusions of the investigation commission , as well as in the decisions of the prosecutors and judges , as to liability for the accident .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the application as inadmissible as it concerned a decision in which the court had not examined the merits of the case , and as unfounded because the new evidence referred to by the applicant did not de facto affect the facts established in the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action before FAC seeking compensation in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . He claimed damages from ORG and M.M on account of their negligence in the organisation of the customs inspection . He stressed that because of the accident he had had to undergo expensive surgical interventions and had been classed as permanently disabled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an objection of res judicata raised by the defendants . It held that the criminal decision of DATE had not examined the civil liability of the defendants but only their criminal liability . The court noted that although the evidence concerning ORG presence at the scene of the accident was not conclusive , ORG employee should nevertheless be held liable because she had not fulfilled her professional duties . The court further noted that , according to CARDINAL of ORG colleagues who had occupied the same position as FAC , and to her job description ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , it had been ORG duty to handle the customs documentation for the customs agent and also to supervise the shunting of the relevant wagons in the railway station . The court also found that under the applicable law on the application of the common transit system in GPE , ORG had been obliged to be actively involved in the customs inspection of the wagons . However , the company had observed its obligations superficially through its employees . Thus , by applying the stamp to the CIM , the company employee had convinced the applicant and the manager of company E that everything was ready for inspection .", "The court partly allowed the applicant \u2019s action , held that both the applicant , ORG and FAC were equally responsible for the accident , and ordered the defendant company and FAC to pay CARDINAL the damages claimed .", "CARDINAL . The defendant company appealed and the appeal was allowed by ORG on DATE . It quashed the judgment of the first - instance court , holding that the de facto situation had already been established by a final decision of a criminal court , and had thus acquired the authority of res judicata before the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Order no . CARDINAL of DATE sets out the health and safety regulations for the rail transport industry . Article CARDINAL provides that the regulations are compulsory and that they must be communicated to the interested persons by local labour inspectorates . They are not published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Order prohibits the inspection , application of seals or carrying out of any work on the upper parts of a wagon while the train is on electrified tracks .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that all specified preventive steps must be taken when operations presenting a danger of electrocution are performed .", "CARDINAL . The CIM is a standardised document for the cross - border transport of cargo by rail , based on ORG recommendations for uniform international rules and in use in ORG ( ORG ) . CIM stands for ORG concernant le transport des Marchandises par chemin de fer , the NORP name for the LAW that governs its definitions and application .", "CARDINAL . The TCARDINAL procedure concerns the movement of non - ORG goods when customs duties or other import taxes are involved .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , which sets out a common transit procedure , a railway company which accepts goods for carriage under cover of a CIM consignment note serving as a common transit declaration shall be the principal for that operation .", "CARDINAL .
