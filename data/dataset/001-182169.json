They argued that since the composition of the trial bench had been unlawful the appellate court should have quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment in its entirety .

The second applicant alleged that Judge PERSON had lacked impartiality , referring to a statement made by him at the opening of the trial and certain passages in the reasoning showing that he had a negative attitude towards him .

In the course of the appellate proceedings , ORG referred a legal question to ORG , seeking an interpretation of the provisions of the ORG concerning the assignment of a trial court judge to a given case and the consequences of an irregularly constituted trial bench for the outcome of appellate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The legal question read as follows :", "\u201c Does the expression \u201c court improperly constituted \u201d in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG also concern a situation in which a court that ruled on a case included a judge who had been \u201c allocated \u201d to the case by some other entity than the [ one ] authorised to do so by law , i.e. the president of a court ( president of a division ) assigning a judge \u2013 LAW in the manner specified in LAW ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a ORG adopted on DATE , ORG replied as follows :", "\u201c The assignment of members of a court in breach of the rules specified in Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG constitutes a relative ground of appeal ( wzgl\u0119dna przyczyna odwo\u0142awcza ) referred to in LAW ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its legal question , ORG noted that , in consequence of a decision adopted by ORG , the president of a division in that court had issued an order assigning Judge PERSON to hear case no . VIII K CARDINAL/CARDINAL pursuant to LAW ORG . The same court also noted that the manner of assigning members of the court in that case had violated the rules specified in LAW ORG since Judge PERSON had not been on the list of judges from which a judge should have been selected , but had been \u201c transferred \u201d to DATE in order to hear case no . VIII K CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed with ORG that the rules specified in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had been violated in the case . There had been a breach of LAW ORG , which consisted of a decision not entirely \u201c independent \u201d in nature being taken by the president of a division to select Judge PERSON to hear the case , since that decision had been predetermined by an earlier decision of ORG . There had also been a violation of LAW ORG , which consisted of disregarding the list of judges of the division and assigning as a member of the court a judge who had been \u201c transferred \u201d from another division for that specific purpose , without indicating other valid reasons , as required by that provision .", "CARDINAL . ORG then examined whether the above - mentioned breach of the rules specified in GPE CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL could be regarded as the court being \u201c improperly constituted \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG . Pursuant to that provision , a finding that a court had not been properly constituted resulted in the judgment being automatically set aside on appeal . ORG noted that in previous cases the term had been applied in the following situations : where a court had been composed of a smaller or larger number of members than provided for by law ; where lay judges had sat as members of a court instead of professional judges and vice versa ; and where a member of a court had had no authority to examine a case in a given court .", "CARDINAL . ORG emphasised that a violation of the rules on the assignment of members of a court contained in CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG did not \u2013 in itself \u2013 result in a situation where a court had examined a case in a composition not provided for by law or where a member of a court had had no authority to decide in a given case . On the other hand , if a decision by a president of a court ( president of a division ) had , in breach of LAW ORG , resulted in a court with a composition unknown in the law for a given category of cases or a person not authorised to examine cases in a given court being selected , such a flaw would have to be regarded as an automatic ground of appeal within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG . However , in such a situation the procedural flaw would have to consist not only of a violation of LAW ORG , but also a violation of the provisions of the ORG concerning the composition of judicial benches and the competence of judges to examine cases in a given court . In such a situation , a violation of procedural rules would be of a qualified , double nature .", "CARDINAL . That had not occurred in the case under consideration , in which only ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had been violated . In ORG assessment , a sole violation of the above - mentioned provisions should be regarded as a relative ground of appeal . Consequently , in order to allow an appeal based on a relative ground , an appellate court had to establish , at least , a hypothetical link between the alleged procedural violation and the content of the judgment within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It quashed the first applicant \u2019s conviction in respect of the offence of failure to perform her duties and of exceeding her authority ( point LAW of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) . The reason given was that the offence had become subject to limitation on DATE , prior to the date of entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further quashed the second applicant \u2019s conviction in respect of theft of the ORG \u2019s property of a considerable value ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) . The principal reason given was the court \u2019s refusal to apply LAW to the relevant offence imputed to the second applicant . In consequence , the limitation period in respect of that offence had expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly quashed the cumulative sentences imposed on the applicants . It discontinued the part of the proceedings concerning the quashed convictions . ORG also lowered the fines imposed on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The remainder of the trial court \u2019s judgment was upheld , including the first and second applicant \u2019s convictions for misappropriation of the ORG \u2019s property of a considerable value ( points III and GPE respectively of the operative part of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG analysed the circumstances surrounding the assignment of Judge PERSON to the case . It found that the decision to assign him had simply been a consequence of ORG decision and not a sovereign act by the President of ORG in the exercise of his powers under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG . Having regard to the above , ORG found that the statutory rules on the assignment of judges set out in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had not been respected .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to ORG Resolution of DATE , ORG considered the effect of the breach of Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG on the content of the trial court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the circumstances concerning the enactment of the DATE Amendment extending limitation periods , which was relevant for some of the charges against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The bill had been introduced by a group of MPs from the opposition party , PERSON and ORG , on DATE , before the date of delivery of the trial court \u2019s judgment on DATE . The bill had made direct reference to the ORG pending case .", "CARDINAL . The intentions of the drafters had been confirmed during debates in ORG of the PERSON ( ORG of ORG ) and at the plenary session of the PERSON . CARDINAL of the supporters of the draft bill had been the member of parliament ( MP ) PERSON , who had also acted as rapporteur in the course of the parliamentary debate on the bill . Judge PERSON had been serving at that time as an advisor to ORG on his recommendation .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that a judge could be appointed a member of the Minister of ORG \u2019s ORG in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the relevant LAW . However , a judge was prevented from participating in parliamentary work on criminal law codification as an advisor chosen by an MP , parliamentary group or a political party . By doing so , a judge would in fact be acting as a lobbyist disclosing his political preferences . Such conduct was contrary to LAW and the provisions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , according to a letter from the Chancellery of the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , Judge PERSON had not been an advisor to ORG in connection with the work on the bill extending limitation periods . However , the court \u2019s analysis of some parliamentary records contradicted that assertion . It transpired from TIME of a meeting of ORG on DATE that Judge PERSON had been present during a discussion on the bill . At that meeting PERSON , after the ORG had rejected his amendment to the bill , asked Judge PERSON \u201c whether in this situation the ORG case would become time - barred \u201d . ORG also referred to TIME of the plenary session of the PERSON on DATE . At that session PERSON , replying to a question , stated that Judge PERSON had been permanent advisor to ORG and presented verbatim the judge \u2019s position on an aspect of an amendment to the bill .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the parliamentary records , established that Judge PERSON had actively sought to influence the amending legislation to the detriment of the defendants , even though at the same time he had examined their case at trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c In the present case ... on the basis of the circumstances concerning the passing of the DATE Amendment established in the course of the appellate proceedings , ORG reached the conclusion that the regulations contained in the LAW had been adopted by the legislature , in particular , so that they could be applied to the pending proceedings in a specific case indicated in the reasons for the bill , and in addition , the judge hearing the case took part in the process of amending the law as an advisor , thus showing a lack of impartiality . Having regard to the foregoing , the application of LAW to the present case would have patently violated the standards of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW concerning the right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal and would have had an obvious influence on the pertinent part of the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decided not to apply LAW to that part of the case . It therefore found that the limitation period in respect of the offence of theft of the ORG \u2019s property of a considerable value imputed to the second applicant had expired on DATE ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) . It held that his conviction in respect of that offence had to be quashed and that the relevant part of the proceedings had to be discontinued .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the foregoing , ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 arguments concerning the flaws in the assignment of Judge PERSON to the case and the efforts of the judge to amend the legislation applicable to the case in the course of the trial and at the formal examination stage of the appeal . In the appellate court \u2019s view , the applicants had rightly pointed out that by accepting the role of advisor to the proponents of the bill amending LAW ( extending limitation periods ) Judge PERSON had shown a lack of impartiality . At the same time , ORG , by failing to respect the rule of law , had encroached upon the competences of the judicial authorities and flouted the guarantees of a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal underlined that the above shortcomings had only affected part of the trial court \u2019s judgment , namely the offence imputed to the second applicant ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) , for which the limitation period had been set to expire on DATE . Only in that part did there exist a logical and irrefutable causal link between the error in the assignment of Judge PERSON and his subsequent efforts to pass legislation amending the law to the detriment of the defendants in the case examined by him .", "CARDINAL . As to the remainder of the case , ORG did not establish that the above shortcomings had influenced the content of the trial court \u2019s judgment . Accordingly , it did not accept the ORG submissions , which were aimed at having the judgment of the trial court quashed in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . With regard to certain passages in the reasoning showing that Judge PERSON had a negative attitude towards the second applicant , ORG found that many of them had been opinions based on fact and therefore could not be seen as showing a lack of impartiality towards the second applicant . However , the court agreed with the defence that the passage about the important role of the second applicant in the activities of the ORG had not been fact - based and was therefore inappropriate . Nonetheless , the statement was related to hypothetical behaviour of the second applicant which was unrelated to the charges against him and in any event had not influenced the content of the judgment . The second applicant had not substantiated either how the passage related to the financing of political parties by the ORG could show that Judge PERSON had had a negative attitude towards him , when that issue had not been examined by the trial court . With regard to the allegation raised by the second applicant of a lack of impartiality on the part of Judge PERSON in connection with his statement about the CARDINAL victims in the case , ORG found it to be groundless . It considered that the statement had to be seen in the proper context in which it was made , namely the trial court \u2019s determination to elucidate all the", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the remainder of the applicants\u2019 appeals . It examined various allegations concerning the rights of the defence and the rules of criminal procedure raised by the applicants and rejected them all as unfounded or as having no bearing on the content of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General lodged a cassation appeal against the part of ORG judgment concerning the discontinuation of the proceedings against the second applicant in respect of the charge of theft of the ORG \u2019s property of a considerable value ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) . ORG argued that ORG had erred in holding that the application of LAW to the offence in question would have breached Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW and LAW on account of the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON In his view , the appellate court \u2019s finding had resulted in the relevant part of the proceedings being unjustifiably discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also lodged cassation appeals . They challenged ORG finding that the uncontested breach of the rules concerning the assignment of Judge PERSON to their case could not have influenced the content of the trial court \u2019s judgment . In their view , the assignment of Judge PERSON in flagrant breach of NORP CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had resulted in their case not being examined by an impartial judge .", "DATE . They further challenged ORG finding that the established lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON resulting from his active involvement in the passing of LAW could only be relevant for some of the offences imputed to them . In their view , his lack of impartiality had affected the whole trial and therefore the trial court \u2019s judgment should have been quashed in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also alleged that ORG had not examined his arguments that Judge PERSON should have been removed from the case because of doubts as to his impartiality .", "CARDINAL . The applicants repeated their allegations concerning various violations of the rights of the defence and the rules of criminal procedure committed by the trial court , which had allegedly not been duly examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment . It allowed the cassation appeal of ORG and quashed the part of ORG judgment concerning the discontinuation of the proceedings against the second applicant , remitting that part of the case to it . It dismissed the cassation appeals filed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the ORG allegation that the assignment of Judge PERSON in flagrant breach of NORP CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had resulted in their case not being examined by an impartial judge . It confirmed that Judge PERSON had been assigned to the applicants\u2019 case in breach of the above provisions . However , having regard to its Resolution no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that it was necessary to examine whether the above flaw had influenced the content of the trial court \u2019s judgment . For that to be the case the judge would have to be interested in the case having a specific outcome by violating the rules of criminal procedure .", "CARDINAL . In that connection , ORG first noted that behaviour which could raise doubts about the lack of impartiality of a judge hearing a case would have to arise up until delivery of the judgment by the judge in question . Secondly , it noted that the mere determination of the court in striving to conclude the proceedings before the expiry of the limitation period was not indicative of its partiality . The lack of impartiality of a judge had to manifest itself in restrictions on the procedural rights of a party , improper gathering of evidence or the imposition of an unjust sentence . However , the applicants had not provided concrete examples of such shortcomings and had limited themselves to general allegations . They had merely referred to CARDINAL statement made by Judge PERSON about \u201c the CARDINAL victims \u201d , the passage in the reasoning of the trial court related to the financing of political parties by the ORG and the antagonism of political parties with which Judge PERSON and the second applicant respectively sympathised .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the statement about \u201c the CARDINAL victims \u201d ORG paid attention to the context in which it had been made \u2013 at the first trial hearing on DATE in which Judge PERSON , the president of the bench , had allowed journalists to disseminate images and information about the identities of the defendants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In ORG view , an analysis of the statement did not permit the conclusion that Judge PERSON had identified himself with the victims in the case under examination by him . The statement had indicated that it was society that was entitled to have images of the defendants . For ORG , the statement was another unnecessarily pompous statement by Judge PERSON which was not in itself proof of his lack of impartiality . It also noted that the defence had not reacted to this statement by requesting that he be removed from the case . Likewise , before the start of the trial the defence had not raised the issue of any of the members of the trial bench possibly having a negative attitude towards the second applicant . With regard to the passage related to the financing of political parties by the ORG , ORG noted that it did not point to a lack of impartiality on the part of Judge PERSON The judge had concluded in the reasoning that that issue had been irrelevant for the determination of the case . Having regard to the foregoing , ORG did not share the applicants\u2019 views about the alleged lack of impartiality of the trial court .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the applicants\u2019 arguments related to the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON , which had allegedly ensued from his involvement in the passage of LAW . In that connection , the court noted that the bill had been introduced on DATE and that only from that moment in time could CARDINAL talk about his alleged involvement in the process . The bill had been introduced after the trial court had finished hearing evidence in the case ( DATE ) and at a time when the trial had entered its final stages , with the closing statements by the parties . The court further noted that the parliamentary debate on the bill had effectively started in DATE , after the trial court had delivered its judgment ( DATE ) . Accordingly , it could not be said that the trial hearing had coincided with the parliamentary debate on the bill .", "DATE . Furthermore , LAW had entered into force on DATE and the limitation period with regard to CARDINAL of the offences ( point PERSON of the operative part ) had been set to expire on DATE . Accordingly , the consequences of the expiry of the limitation period and the entry into force of the law extending limitation periods had taken place in the course of the appellate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that Judge PERSON \u2019s involvement in the parliamentary debate on the bill had occurred after the trial had ended and thus could not have had any effect on the content of the judgment . It noted that ORG must have embraced a similar view on that issue since it had not decided to quash the trial court \u2019s judgment in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the above conclusion , the court noted that the principal issue before ORG and now before it was the compatibility of the CARDINAL Amendment with the LAW and the LAW , as well as the related problem of how the court should proceed in the event of a finding of incompatibility .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the constitutionality of LAW , ORG referred to the established case - law of ORG , which provided that limitation periods were not a subjective right ( prawo podmiotowe ) and therefore could be subject to change , including retrospectively . A change to a limitation period did not have a bearing on the criminalisation of a given act or the penalty that could be imposed . Rules on limitation periods did not provide guarantees for a person who committed an offence , but were established for the sake of punishment and were related to the ORG \u2019s criminal policy ( referring to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the constitutionality of the DATE Amendment related to the shortcomings of the legislative process , ORG concurred with ORG that the conduct of that process indicated that the impugned legislation had been adopted with a view to influencing the outcome of a particular case . ORG had analysed the issue from the perspective of the \u201c partiality \u201d of Judge PERSON , who had been involved in the preparation of the law partly determining the outcome of the case , but for ORG that issue had to been seen in a wider context . In fact , ORG had analysed the issue of the \u201c partiality of the legislature \u201d and understood it to mean an encroachment by the legislature on the competences of the judicial authorities by the former \u2019s involvement in the determination of a specific case by means of enacting legislation .", "CARDINAL . ORG analysed whether \u201c the partiality of the legislature \u201d had occurred in the applicants\u2019 case . It had regard to the reasons for the bill which , although very brief , had contained CARDINAL paragraphs related to the ORG case .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the parliamentary debate on the bill , both in the relevant Committee meetings and at the plenary session of the PERSON clearly indicated the existence of links between the need to enact the impugned legislation and the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 case . A statement made by PERSON during the debate on the bill in the PERSON on DATE was relevant here ( \u201c Among the CARDINAL of cases [ threatened by the expiry of the limitation period ] there is also this one , which outrages and shocks NORP public opinion the most , which ... became the instigator and final argument for the introduction of this bill , and that is ORG - gate and the real risk of the limitation period expiring in this case \u201d ) . Similarly , the statement made by PERSON MP in the same debate left no doubt as to the intentions of the proponents of the bill ( \u201c there is a legal possibility of influencing these proceedings \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG found that the involvement of the legislature , with the support of Judge PERSON , could support the allegation that the object of LAW had been to influence the outcome of the applicants\u2019 specific case . Such a situation in turn raised doubts about its conformity with LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 case , ORG held that LAW was unconstitutional and for that reason , it independently decided not to apply it in the case . However , ORG found that in that respect ORG had exceeded its competences . Instead of refusing to apply the unconstitutional legislation , it had been required to put a legal question to ORG on the constitutionality of LAW . In ORG view , ORG had the exclusive competence to declare legislation unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . For that reason , ORG quashed the part of ORG judgment concerning the discontinuation of the proceedings against the second applicant ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) and remitted that part of the case to it .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG directions , on DATE ORG put a legal question to ORG on the constitutionality of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that \u201c FOZZ - gate \u201d had been mentioned throughout the parliamentary debate on the bill . It referred to the reasons for the bill and the statements made by the MPs , advisors and representatives of ORG in the course of debates of ORG referring to the same case . In view of the above , ORG considered that LAW had not been enacted as a general instrument of criminal policy , but followed from the legislature \u2019s desire to influence the outcome of a particular case . Such a situation amounted to an encroachment by the legislature on the competences of the judicial authorities . For ORG , there were substantiated doubts about the compatibility of the DATE Amendment with ORG ( rule of law principle ) and CARDINAL ( separation of powers ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . P CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG discontinued the proceedings initiated by the legal question of ORG on the grounds of ne bis in idem . It referred to an earlier judgment it had adopted on DATE ( case no . P CARDINAL ) , which was decisive for the case at issue . In that judgment ORG held that LAW was compatible with LAW and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG had not questioned the very extension of the limitation period or the possibility of applying extended limitation periods to offences committed before the entry into force of the amending legislation which had not become time - barred under the rules formerly applicable . The allegations of ORG had instead concentrated on shortcomings in the legislative process , but without invoking any of the relevant constitutional provisions regulating that process . ORG had focused on the context and the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the impugned legislation by referring to select statements of the persons taking part in the parliamentary debate on the bill and mentioning certain passages from the reasons for the bill . However , that issue had already been addressed in ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . In that judgment , it had also underlined that the contested amendment had not influenced the judicial determination of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment .", "CARDINAL . It upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment with regard to the second applicant \u2019s conviction for theft of the ORG \u2019s property of a considerable value ( point PERSON of the operative provisions of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) . It only lowered the fine imposed on him in respect of that offence .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ruled that it could not discontinue the criminal proceedings against the second applicant with regard to the abovementioned offence on account of the expiry of the original limitation period as had been decided in its first judgment . It would not be acceptable to refuse to apply a law whose constitutionality had been confirmed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the allegations concerning the improper assignment of Judge PERSON to the case , ORG , following ORG judgment , held that that shortcoming had not affected the content of the trial court \u2019s judgment . It dismissed further arguments raised by the second applicant in his appeal against the trial court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged a cassation appeal against ORG judgment . He alleged , in particular , that ORG had violated the provisions of the substantive criminal law related to his conviction under LAW of the old LAW . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In issue no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG published an article entitled \u201c NORP PERSON \u201d about the ORG trial , including an interview with Judge PERSON The relevant part reads as follows :", "\u201c Journalists divide judges into those who have \u201c pressure on the small screen \u201d and those who consistently refuse to comment . Judge PERSON has a reputation as one of the best lawyers in GPE , but also as a \u201c media stonewaller \u201d .. In the ORG trial he [ has ] a dual role : as a main judge and as a defender of what remains of the reputation of the administration of justice . The threat of the limitation period hangs over the indictment . ...", "\u201c Journalist : Are you afraid that you will not have enough time to correct the ORG mistakes and sentence [ those who are ] guilty ?", "Judge PERSON : I will not comment on the trial . This is not a commission of inquiry .", "Q : Perhaps it does not resemble a meeting of a commission [ of inquiry ] , but do n\u2019t you have the impression that you are participating in the theatre of the absurd ? The defendants faint , pretend to be mentally ill ...", "A : I have . What \u2019s even worse [ is that ] I feel too frequently that it is not the defendant in the hands of a court , but me in the hands of the defendant and his counsel . Frequently , a team of people is working on how to use too liberal a law to block the trial . Unfortunately , we have succeeded in creating a belief among criminals that they can go unpunished .", "Q : Do you think that opportunity makes a thief ?", "A : Not an opportunity , but the lack of an inevitable and adequate punishment . Up until recently a criminal could still laugh in our faces , because even if , by a miracle , he was caught and sentenced , he could use the stolen money with impunity , and even boast about it . ...", "Q : They still brag that they transferred money to their wives and that nothing can be done to them .", "A : What we know about scandals is not even the tip of the iceberg . We already have [ the ] white - collar mafia . It is time to find efficient methods of detecting crimes and begin applying adequate punishments . ...", "Q : Even if we catch criminals more efficiently , where would we lock them up ?", "A : We will stop spending money on implementing inefficient programmes , and build more prisons . Thanks to harsh punishments and a \u2018 zero tolerance\u2019 [ policy ] even for minor crimes , it was possible to resolve the crisis in GPE .

The transcript of the relevant part reads as follows :", "\u201c Q : Minister , your deputy , Judge [ PERSON ] has been criticised by ORG judges , who found that Judge [ PERSON ] had not been impartial in the case against NORP and [ the first applicant ] .", "A : ORG judges were either misled or have been seriously mistaken because they have relied on false information .", "Q : Who could have misled them ?", "A : Perhaps the defence lawyers , who raised certain arguments , not always properly , but always in the interest of their clients . ... The facts are that , firstly , Judge [ PERSON ] was not an advisor to the PERSON and ORG [ party ] , but an advisor to the PERSON \u2019s [ ORG ] , as were many other judges , including judges of ORG . No one is alleging that because of that those judges are not impartial , and rightly so . Secondly , Judge [ PERSON ] did not take part in the debate on the provision extending limitation periods . I am the author of this provision , I conceived this provision and presented it to PERSON , and I then consulted CARDINAL law professors , with whom I cooperate , who are also members of [ advisors to ] the PERSON \u2019s committees , Professors PERSON and PERSON , I think that both of them would confirm this .", "Q : But did you rely on Judge [ A.K. ] \u2019s opinion in this case or not ?", "A : I could not have relied on Judge [ A.K. ] \u2019s opinion in this case , because in this case Judge PERSON did not give an opinion . In this case Judge [ PERSON ] was not at all an initiator of this idea . I was the author .", "Q : And you did not speak to him about this issue :", "A : No , I did not speak to Judge [ PERSON ] about this issue . In this case , I acted as PERSON , who seeing what was happening in the ORG case , concluded that limitation periods should be extended .
