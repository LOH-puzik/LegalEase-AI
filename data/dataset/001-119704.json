On dismissal , the applicant was statutorily entitled to CARDINAL months\u2019 salary for DATE and DATE during which time she was exempted from working . In addition , she was to receive severance pay amounting to CARDINAL months\u2019 salary in application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) g ) of Act no .

On DATE Parliament adopted Act no . XC of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . The LAW , which was published in ORG on DATE , introduced inter alia a new tax on certain payments for employees of the public sector whose employment was terminated . Consequently , severance pay and other payments related to the termination of employment ( such as compensation for unused leave of absence ) exceeding ORG CARDINAL became subject to a PERCENT tax . However , income tax and social security contributions already paid could be deducted from the tax . Notwithstanding the limit of ORG CARDINAL , the statutory provisions on the sum of severance pay DATE in some cases amounting to CARDINAL months\u2019 remuneration \u2013 were not modified . The bill preceding the LAW justified the tax with reference to public morals and the unfavourable budgetary situation of the country .", "CARDINAL . The Act entered into force on DATE ; however , the tax was to be applied to the relevant revenues as from DATE . Simultaneously , the LAW was also amended establishing retroactive tax liability in respect of the given tax year concerning \u201c any remuneration against good morals \u201d paid in the public sector .", "CARDINAL . The LAW was challenged before ORG within the framework of an abstract ex post facto control . This court found the relevant provisions unconstitutional in decision no . CARDINAL . ( X.CARDINAL . ) AB on DATE .", "According to ORG , revenues earned solely on the basis of relevant statutory provisions ( that is , the overwhelming majority of the revenues concerned by the disputed legislation ) could not be regarded as being against good morals , and therefore not even the constitutional amendment justified a retroactive PERCENT tax . ORG pointed out that it reviewed the rate or amount of taxes only exceptionally ; however , it held that a pecuniary burden was unconstitutional if it was of a confiscatory nature or its extent was clearly exaggerated , i.e. was disproportionate and unjustified . Considering also the \u201c MONEY rule \u201d ( GPE ) set out by ORG \u2013 according to which the overall tax load on assets must be limited to PERCENT of the yield on those assets \u2013 the court found that the PERCENT tax was excessive and punitive , yet it equally applied to severance pay earned in a fully untainted manner . The tax was levied on or deducted from the revenues concerned even if their morally doubtful origin could not be established . ORG annulled the relevant provisions retroactively , that is , from DATE of the Act \u2019s entry into force . It relied on the above arguments , rather than on considerations about the protection of property , to which its scrutiny did not extend in the case .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decision contained in particular the following considerations :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ The LAW ] applies to ... payments originating in unconditional statutory entitlements and defined by objective criteria , that is , to those ... received from any source specified in the LAW and exceeding the [ relevant ] amount .... The LAW does not apply only to budgetary institutions but to other , ORG - owned employers as well . The use of private resources depends on the ORG relatively free choices and autonomous decisions . However , decisions concerning public funds are different . [ The impugned legislation ] relates to public funds , and determines \u2013 at least indirectly \u2013 the use of public resources .", "CARDINAL . ... Depending on the circumstances , [ the ] PERCENT tax may apply to payments which derive from the obligatory application of cogent legal provisions . ... In these cases , the special tax does not function as a regulatory instrument , given its inescapable factual basis . Nor does it aim to prevent abusive payments ; its purpose is rather to levy almost the entire income [ in question ] for the central budget . ...", "The volume of public duties is considered unconstitutional if they have a confiscatory nature or amount to an evidently excessive rate of the kind which can be regarded as disproportionate and unjustified . ...", "The material case concerns a substantial punitive tax which also applies to payments which are received , by virtue of law and within the limits of the proper exercise of rights , upon the termination of employment in the public sector . The LAW would be applied also in cases where no infringement of law can be established in connection with the payments concerning the termination of a legal relation . It would deprive the taxable persons of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements . ...", "To increase budgetary revenues and secure a general and proportionate distribution of public burden is only the secondary and eventual purpose of the legislator when introducing such a tax . The direct purpose of the legislator in this case is to set a certain barrier on incomes by using the means of tax law . However , imposing a tax or other similar duty is no constitutional means to achieve such purpose . Several constitutional instruments are at the disposal of the legislator to accomplish its objective . It may reduce or even abolish some ORG allowances falling under the scope of the LAW for the future , or transform the allocation system so that in the future it should not be possible to acquire further entitlements to allowances above a certain limit . Nonetheless , the discretion of the legislator only prevails in the framework of international and NORP community law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Upon a new bill introduced on DATE as the date of ORG decision , on DATE ORG re - enacted the PERCENT tax with certain modifications , according to which this tax applied from DATE ; however , for the majority of those affected ( excluding some senior officials ) it only applied to revenues above ORG CARDINAL . The new legislation was published in ORG of DATE and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG again amended the LAW , allowing retroactive taxation going back DATE . Furthermore , ORG powers were limited : the amended articles of the LAW contained a restriction on ORG \u2019s right to review legislation on budgetary and tax issues . This restriction DATE which has also been maintained in the new LAW in force from DATE allows for constitutional review only in respect of violations of the right to life and human dignity , the protection of personal data , freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and the rights related to NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . Upon a petition for an abstract ex post facto control , on CARDINAL DATE ORG annulled \u2013 notwithstanding its limited powers \u2013 the DATE retroactive application of PERCENT tax in decision no . MONEY ( V.CARDINAL . ) ORG , relying on the right to human dignity . However , the reasoning of the decision underlined that only the taxation of revenues gathered before DATE constituted a violation of the right to human dignity . ORG did not find unconstitutional as such the Act \u2019s presumption that the relevant revenues infringed good morals ; however , it ruled that this presumption should be susceptible to a legal challenge . In view of its limited jurisdiction , it did not consider the substantive aspects of the tax .", "CARDINAL .

However , in this case the legislator interpreted the \u201c special rate \u201d as an entire withdrawal of the income , by which it overstepped its constitutional mandate and breached the amended constitutional rule of distributing public burden .", "CARDINAL .

The special tax is not a general income tax applicable to all types of income , but rather a particular tax levied on non - repetitive , non - regular payments which relate to certain factual circumstances ( i.e. the termination of a legal relation ) and which exceed a certain limit . ...", "Such a tax with ex nunc effect can not be considered to violate the right to protection of human dignity or to constitute an improper interference by the ORG with individual autonomy .
