The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is a writer and a professor of LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's parents , PERSON and the late PERSON were born in DATE and DATE respectively , in GPE , province of GPE , GPE . Their NORP civil status documents did not contain any information concerning their ethnic identity . In their marriage certificate issued by the NORP authorities in DATE , the entry for ethnicity was left blank . However , the applicant 's birth certificate issued by the NORP authorities in DATE recorded his parents as ethnic PERSON . On the applicant 's mother 's birth certificate issued by the NORP authorities in DATE the ethnicity was also left blank . Later , the applicant 's parents were recorded as ethnic PERSON on their NORP identity cards issued in DATE and DATE , in accordance with applications completed and signed by them in which NORP ethnicity was indicated . On his NORP identity card the applicant was also indicated as an ethnic GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant applied to the GPE authorities to have his old NORP identity card replaced by a NORP identity card . On the application form he wrote \u201c NORP \u201d under ethnicity . However , he was told that his application would not be accepted unless NORP ethnicity was indicated on it . The applicant complied .", "CARDINAL . Shortly thereafter the applicant wrote to the local civil registration authority and requested , inter alia , that his ethnicity entry be changed from GPE to NORP . In an answer dated DATE the applicant was informed that since his parents were not recorded as ethnic NORP in their birth and marriage certificates , it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic NORP .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant wrote to the central civil registration authority and again requested that his ethnic identity entry be changed from GPE to NORP .

The applicant wrote numerous complaints to the Prime Minister , the President of the country and other officials , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated proceedings against the ORG authority responsible for civil registration and identity papers and requested , inter alia , that his ethnicity entry and that of his parents be changed to NORP in ORG database and in his identity papers . He argued that he did not consider himself to be an ethnic GPE and that it was contrary to his right to freedom of conscience and to his personal dignity to be considered part of an ethnic group which he believed to be an artificial creation of the NORP regime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's action on the ground that he had failed to prove that his parents were of NORP ethnic identity as no such identity had been recorded in their identity papers . The applicant appealed and relied , inter alia , on the provisions of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on the same grounds , stating that the applicant had failed to prove that his parents were ethnic NORP . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law and pointed out that according to section DATE of the Law on Documents pertaining to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) it was impossible to change his parents ' ethnic identity to NORP because in none of their identity papers had NORP ethnicity been indicated .", "CARDINAL .

The ethnic identity was determined on the basis of the individual 's parents ' ethnic identities . If the parents had different ethnic identities , the individual had to opt for CARDINAL of them when receiving his first identity card at DATE . There was no possibility of subsequently changing one 's ethnic identity in identity papers or in the civil records .

NORP The NORP practice of collecting and recording ethnic data was perpetuated by the NORP authorities after independence , with the difference that no information concerning ethnic origin was inserted in the new GPE identity cards .

In practice , applications are rejected if the ethnic identity indicated in the form by the applicant is not based on that of his or her parents . It is impossible under NORP law to change one 's ethnic identity without changing the ethnic identity of one 's parents and it is impossible to change the ethnic identity of one 's parents on the basis of entries in the identity papers of one 's grandparents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
