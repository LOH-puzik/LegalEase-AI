To prevent him from organising an unauthorised meeting at FAC and to prevent the unlawful acts , he was invited to enter a police van . In response to [ these ] lawful orders to enter the police van , PERSON began to break loose . He pushed us away and shouted insults to us : \u201c Down with the police state ! \u201d , \u201c Free - for - all cops ! \u201d , attempting to cause mayhem among the citizens surrounding him .

At TIME the applicant was brought before the Justice of the FAC , who examined the charges .", "CARDINAL . In the courtroom the applicant discovered that there was no seat for him and he remained standing during the hearing , which lasted for TIME . The parties disagreed as to the reasons why the applicant had remained standing . According to the applicant , the Justice of the Peace had ordered him to stand . The Government contested that allegation and claimed that the Justice of the Peace had repeatedly asked if anyone in the audience could give their seat to the applicant , but the applicant and his counsel had objected and insisted that he remain standing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that standing throughout the trial had been humiliating and physically difficult , especially after having spent DATE in detention in poor conditions . He also alleged that it had prevented him from participating effectively in the proceedings because he could only address the judge in writing and had been obliged to write his submissions while standing up . This had further aggravated his fatigue and hampered the conduct of his defence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty and claimed that he had been detained for no reason other than political oppression . He contested the content of the police reports , in particular the statement that the police had given him a warning or an order which he could have disobeyed .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the applicant lodged a number of motions . He requested in particular that the court admit as evidence the video footage of his arrest broadcast by CARDINAL media channels .

The applicant further requested that the court call and cross - examine Police Colonel B. about the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest , which he had commented on in the media ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Justice of the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to admit the video recordings on the grounds that the provenance of the recordings was not supported by evidence . The court also refused to order that the video recording made by the police be admitted as evidence , stating that the applicant \u2019s request was not \u201c specific enough \u201d and that the applicant had failed to prove the existence of any such recordings . Lastly , the court refused to call and examine Police Colonel B. as a witness , having considered that request irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request the court called and examined CARDINAL witnesses who had been at the scene of the authorised demonstration . They testified that they had heard the applicant addressing the meeting and that after his speech he had said farewell and left ; he had not made any calls to go on to another meeting . CARDINAL of those witnesses testified that they had left the meeting at the same time as the applicant and had witnessed his arrest . They explained that the exit from the meeting had been blocked by the riot police and the crowd had begun to build up because those who wanted to leave FAC could not do so . When the applicant arrived at the cordon the police surrounded him so as to separate him from others wanting to leave the meeting , and arrested him . CARDINAL witnesses stated that the applicant had not been shouting any slogans and had not been acting against the police orders before being surrounded and arrested . CARDINAL of those witnesses , PERSON , stated that she had heard the applicant asking the riot police why the exit had been blocked . She had also heard him shouting that LAW guaranteed the freedom of assembly , but he had not shouted any calls or obscenities . The remaining witnesses had not seen the actual arrest . In particular , the applicant \u2019s daughter and her friend testified that they had been walking back to the car with the applicant and talking about the plans for New Year \u2019s eve , and when they had arrived at the police cordon they had lost sight of the applicant in the crowd ; TIME they had called him on his mobile phone and had found out that he had been arrested .", "CARDINAL . The court called and examined CARDINAL policemen , sergeant PERSON and private Y , who had signed the reports stating that they had arrested the applicant because he had disobeyed their orders . They testified that on DATE they had been on duty maintaining public order at FAC . They had seen the applicant at TIME . He had been shouting anti - government slogans and calling people around him to hold an unauthorised meeting . They had approached the applicant and requested him to stop agitating outside the authorised meeting ; they had asked him to return to the place allocated for the meeting and to speak there . The applicant had not reacted to their requests , so they had asked him to proceed to the police van . The applicant had disobeyed that order and had been arrested ; he had put up resistance while being arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Justice of the Peace found that the applicant had disobeyed the police orders to stop chanting anti - government slogans and had resisted lawful arrest . The Justice of the FAC based her findings on the witness statements of X and Y , their written reports of DATE , their written statements of the same date , the report on the administrative arrest of the same date , the notice of the public demonstration of CARDINAL DATE and the reply of DATE indicating that it had not been authorised ( it appears that this reference concerned the events described in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Justice of the FAC dismissed the applicant \u2019s testimony on the grounds that as a defendant , he would have sought to exonerate himself from administrative liability . She also dismissed the testimonies of CARDINAL eyewitnesses on the grounds that they had contradicted the policemen \u2019s testimonies and because those witnesses had been acquainted with the applicant , had taken part in the same demonstration and therefore must have been biased towards the applicant . The testimonies of the remaining QUANTITY witnesses were dismissed as irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was found guilty of having disobeyed a lawful order of the police , in breach of LAW . He was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 administrative detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote an appeal against the judgment and submitted it to the detention facility administration unit . It appears that despite his counsel \u2019s numerous attempts to lodge the appeal directly with the court , it was not accepted before DATE . On CARDINAL DATE his counsel submitted a supplement to the points of appeal .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the applicant claimed that his arrest and conviction for the administrative offence had been in breach of the domestic law and in violation of the Convention . He alleged that his right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly had been violated . He contested the findings of fact made by the first instance as regards his conduct after he had left the meeting . He challenged , in particular , the court \u2019s refusal to admit the photographic and video materials as evidence or to obtain the footage of the demonstration shot by the police . In addition , he complained about the manner in which the first - instance hearing had been conducted . In particular , he alleged that the Justice of the Peace had ordered him to stand throughout the hearing , which had been humiliating and had made it difficult to participate in the proceedings . The applicant also complained about the conditions of his detention at the police station from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tverskoy District Court examined the appeal . At the applicant \u2019s request the court kept the verbatim records of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . During the appeal hearing the applicant complained of the alleged unlawfulness of his arrest and the poor conditions of his detention at the police station . He asked the court to declare the acts of the police who had detained him for TIME before bringing him before a court unlawful .", "CARDINAL . As regards the merits of the administrative charges , the applicant reiterated before the appeal instance his requests that the court admit CARDINAL video recordings of his arrest as evidence and that it obtain the video recording made by the GPE police . He also requested that CARDINAL photographs of his arrest be admitted as evidence . He asked the court to call and examine photographers T. and PERSON as witnesses and to cross - examine police officers PERSON and Y again . The court granted the requests to admit CARDINAL video recording and CARDINAL photographs as evidence , and decided to call and examine photographer T. as a witness , but rejected all the other requests .", "CARDINAL . Photographer T. testified at the hearing that he had gone to the meeting to film it and had been waiting for the applicant at the exit from the meeting because he had wanted to interview him . When the applicant approached the exit a big group of policemen rushed over to block his way and there had been a TIME \u2019s pause when a crowd began to build up against the cordon , blocking the passage . Then CARDINAL person was arrested , and TIME later someone else , and then the applicant . T. saw the applicant \u2019s arrest as he was filming it from a distance of QUANTITY . He was separated from the applicant by several rows of people , of which CARDINAL rows consisted of policemen . The recording began TIME before the arrest and continued without any interruption until the applicant had been put in the police van . He specified that the applicant had not put up any resistance to the officers arresting him . He identified on the photograph the officer wearing a fur hat , who had arrested the applicant , and explained that that person had taken the applicant out of the crowd and then passed him on to another policeman in order to put the applicant into the police van . He also stated that the applicant had not shouted any slogans or insults . The applicant had repeated \u201c Easy , easy \u201d to the policemen while being escorted to the van . T. also testified that the applicant had been standing throughout the first - instance hearing , while his counsel had been sitting on a chair .", "CARDINAL . The court watched the video recording made by ORG However , it decided not to take cognisance of ORG \u2019s testimonies , his recording or the photograph , on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... the footage begins with the image of a large number of people gathered at CARDINAL FAC in GPE , with Mr PERSON at the centre . A policeman addresses the citizens through a loudspeaker with a request to disperse and not to block the passage , but Mr PERSON remains standing in CARDINAL place addressing the gathered citizens . The video operator is at such a distance from the applicant that he is separated from him by several rows of people , including the gathered citizens and the riot police , and it is impossible to understand what these citizens and the applicant are saying . Subsequently the recording of the applicant is interrupted as the camera points away onto the policemen putting the first arrested person , and then another one , into the police vans . Only afterwards does the video recording show the applicant being led to a police van by policemen , and he puts up no resistance at this moment of the footage .", "In this respect , and taking into account that the footage does not show Mr PERSON \u2019s actions immediately before his placement in the police van , the video and the accompanying audio do not depict Mr PERSON addressing the citizens before he was detained . The court concludes that the submitted footage does not refute the testimonies of the policemen , and [ T. \u2019s ] testimony can not refute them either because he observed only those actions of Mr PERSON that appear on the footage .", "...", "The photographs submitted during the appeal hearing that depict Mr Nemtsov surrounded by policemen , CARDINAL of whom is supporting his arm , can not be considered by the court as refuting the event of the offence or the evidence , including the testimonies of [ X and Y ] , because of the absence of information on the exact time of its taking , or on its connection with the place ... \u201d", "DATE . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . It found , in particular , on the basis of the testimonies and reports of NORP and Y , that the applicant had indeed been guilty of having disobeyed a lawful order of the police . It upheld the reasoning of the first - instance court whereby it rejected the testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses called at the applicant \u2019s request . As regards the testimonies of GPE and Y , on the other hand , it found no reason to mistrust them because they had had no personal interest in the outcome of the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . In its appeal decision the court addressed the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention pending the first - instance trial and considered that there had been no breach :", "\u201c ... after the report on the administrative offence had been drawn up , the information necessary for establishing the circumstances of the committed offence was collected , including the explanations of [ X and Y ] , the notice of the place of the public demonstration of DATE , the [ mayor \u2019s ] reply to that notice , as well as the personal characteristics of the person in relation to whom the administrative offence report had been drawn up . A ruling was made by ORG convicting the applicant of an offence under LAW . Therefore the applicant \u2019s detention during TIME was not in breach of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE , the court found that his complaints had been outside the scope of the current proceedings , holding that another type of legal action should have been brought by the applicant to challenge those acts . The court did not specify what procedure the applicant should have followed as an avenue for those complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged before ORG a complaint under LAW of LAW . He challenged his initial arrest and complained of the poor conditions of detention for TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court refused to accept the applicant \u2019s action , holding that the questions concerning the lawfulness of the police acts had to be examined in the relevant administrative proceedings , but could not be dealt with in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the refusal to accept his complaint . ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE . It relied , in particular , on Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE by ORG of GPE and held , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c ... the courts may not examine complaints lodged under LAW of the Code of Civil Procedure against acts or inaction connected with the application of LAW , LAW of which provides for the procedure for challenging them ; or acts or inaction for which LAW does not provide for a procedure by which they may be challenged . Acts or inaction that are inseparable from the administrative case may not be subject to a separate challenge ( evidence in the case , [ including ] reports on the application of precautionary measures to secure the course of justice in the administrative case ) . In this case the arguments against the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence or the application of a precautionary measure to secure the course of justice may be put forward during the hearing of the administrative case or in points of appeal against the judgment or ruling on the administrative case . However , if the proceedings in the administrative case are terminated , the acts committed in the course of these proceedings , if they entailed a breach of an individual \u2019s or a legal person \u2019s rights or freedoms , or hindered the exercise of their rights and freedoms , or imposed an obligation after the proceedings had been terminated , [ they ] may be challenged under LAW of LAW . Under the same procedure one may challenge the acts of officials if no administrative file has been opened . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also attempted to challenge the acts of the judiciary involved in his case before ORG . His attempts were , however , unsuccessful ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "13", "3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1", "5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
