THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a national of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the FRY \u201d ) born in DATE . He is currently detained in ORG in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as apparent from public information and the documents submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was indicted , together with others , by the Prosecutor of ORG for the Former GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . On DATE a judge of ORG of the ORG , finding that there was a prima facie case against the indictees , confirmed the indictment and issued a warrant for their arrest . The applicant was then the President of the FRY .", "In DATE the applicant was voted out of office . On DATE he relinquished the position of President of the FRY . He was subsequently arrested on charges brought under FRY domestic law .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE , despite an order of ORG of the FRY suspending his surrender to the ORG pending consideration of its legality .", "On DATE the applicant made an initial appearance before ORG , during which he was formally charged and invited to plead guilty or not guilty . The applicant refused to enter a plea but attempted to argue that the ORG was an unlawful institution . The presiding judge refused to hear his arguments . Noting the applicant \u2019s refusal to plead , ORG ex officio entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf . It also ordered his detention on remand .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a preliminary motion arguing , in so far as is relevant here , that the ORG was illegal .", "At a status conference on DATE , the applicant attempted to make an oral statement to the effect that the ORG lacked a legitimate basis . He was prevented from so doing by the presiding judge , who invited him to make it in writing in the form of a preliminary motion . The applicant did so .", "On DATE , the applicant having refused to be represented before a tribunal which he considered illegal , ORG appointed CARDINAL practising lawyers as amici curiae to defend the applicant \u2019s interests . On DATE the amici curiae submitted a brief supporting the applicant \u2019s preliminary motions of CARDINAL and DATE .", "On DATE , at a second status conference , ORG gave an oral decision rejecting the applicant \u2019s preliminary motions . The amici curiae made oral submissions concerning the proposed conduct of the trial . The applicant was allowed to speak uninterrupted . He alleged that ORG was biased , since she had failed to bring prosecutions in connection with the military intervention by ORG member GPE on the territory of the ORG which took place in DATE . He also complained about the conditions in which he was detained , and in particular about the lack of privacy .", "ORG decision rejecting the applicant \u2019s preliminary motions was published in writing , with reasons , on DATE .", "The indictment of CARDINAL DATE has been amended on CARDINAL occasions , and CARDINAL further indictments have been brought . The applicant has consistently refused to plead , and pleas of not guilty have been entered on his behalf .", "On DATE a hearing was held before ORG of the ORG , the purpose of which was to decide whether the various indictments should be heard in separate sets of proceedings . The applicant submitted a request for his release and promised to appear for any hearings .", "On DATE ORG of the ORG decided that the CARDINAL indictments should be heard in a single set of proceedings .", "The applicant \u2019s trial opened on DATE .", "It was reported on DATE that the applicant had repeated his request for release to ORG , and on DATE that it had been refused .", "The applicant brought summary civil proceedings ( kort geding ) against GPE before the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . He sought an order directed against the ORG for his unconditional release ; in the alternative , for him to be returned to the ORG ; in the further alternative , for the ORG to make representations to \u201c the so - called ORG \u201d ( i.e. the ORG ) and other competent international bodies and institutions for his release ; in the still further alternative , for the ORG to make representations to \u201c the alleged ORG \u201d ( again , i.e. the ORG ) and other competent international bodies and institutions for his return to the FRY . He argued , essentially , that his transfer to the ORG was illegal as a matter of the domestic law of the FRY ; that the ORG itself lacked a basis in international law , having been set up by a resolution of ORG of ORG ( to wit , resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE ) and not by a multilateral treaty ; that the ORG was the handmaiden of ORG and therefore not an independent and impartial tribunal in the sense of LAW ; that the actions of ORG and the ORG were discriminatory ; and that he was entitled to immunity as a former head of state . In view of these considerations GPE was acting unlawfully by allowing him to be detained and remain in detention on its territory ,", "A public hearing was held on DATE .", "The President of ORG gave judgment on DATE . He found that the ORG did in fact have sufficient legal basis ; that it offered sufficient procedural guarantees , as found by ORG in its GPE v. GPE decision ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) ; and that , GPE having lawfully transferred its jurisdiction over the ORG \u2019s indictees to the ORG , the courts of the GPE were not competent to consider the applicant \u2019s request for release .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment , but withdrew it again as of DATE .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering ) provides that all cases where a speedy and provisionally enforceable decision is required in the interests of the parties shall be heard in summary proceedings by the President of ORG , who shall set a hearing date on DATE .", "Article CARDINAL provides for an appeal against the President \u2019s judgment to ORG ( gerechtshof ) , and for a further appeal \u2013 on points of law \u2013to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "Article ORG provides that a provisionally enforceable decision taken in summary proceedings shall not prejudge the merits of the case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
