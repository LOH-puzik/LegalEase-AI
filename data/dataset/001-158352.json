The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The parties gave partly different descriptions of certain factual elements of the case concerning the \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d regime ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The remaining facts were not in dispute .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has a history of criminal convictions . For DATE he was sought by the law - enforcement authorities pursuant to a \u201c wanted \u201d notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an international search warrant was issued against the applicant on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed , as a member of an organised criminal group , several counts of robbery , extortion , uttering threats , causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property . Earlier , on CARDINAL DATE ORG had also ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the NORP police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was handed over to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded him in custody , relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed , as a member of an organised criminal group , several counts of robbery , extortion , uttering threats , causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property . It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant . The court also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , given the risk that he might abscond . With regard to the latter possibility , the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in GPE and that he had already been hiding from the police . Finally , the court emphasised that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that certain other members of that group were still at large , which increased the risk that the detainee , if released , might obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order , like his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all of his subsequent , numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with several counts of robbery , extortion , uttering threats , causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property . The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges against CARDINAL defendants .", "CARDINAL . During the court proceedings the authorities further extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on DATE ( to DATE ) and CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) . The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . They also found no grounds warranting the applicant \u2019s release from detention as provided for by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He was kept in detention pending his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) heard the applicant \u2019s appeal . It quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . The court also extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to DATE , repeating the grounds previously given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case file regarding the applicant \u2019s case was transmitted to ORG for re - trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the Prosecutor to complete the bill of indictment . However , on DATE ORG quashed that decision , remitted the case to ORG and ordered it to proceed with the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention to DATE , repeating the grounds previously given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to DATE . The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG decision , finding that it had been taken by a judge who should have been excluded ex lege from deciding in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a different composition , again extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to CARDINAL DATE . The court further extended the applicant \u2019s detention on CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , QUANTITY DATE ( to DATE ) , DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) and DATE ( to DATE ) . On each occasion the court repeated the grounds previously given and found no grounds warranting the applicant \u2019s release from detention as provided for by LAW . In addition , the court observed that while it appeared from medical reports that the applicant was suffering from various health problems , treatment could be provided within the penitentiary facility .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE extending the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG addressed the applicant \u2019s argument that his detention had exceeded the reasonable time requirement referred to in LAW . The court cited the relevant provisions of the LAW and held that taking into consideration the complexity of the case and the fact that the applicant had been charged with numerous and various offences committed in cooperation with other persons the detention , although considerably long , had not exceeded the \u201c reasonable time \u201d within the meaning of the LAW . The court also considered that \u201c detention was indispensable because , other , less severe preventive measures would not properly secure their aim \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s request for release and dismissed it . The court relied on the same grounds as previously albeit it additionally observed that the applicant had no permanent place of residence in GPE that he had been previously convicted and once , when he had been granted home leave during his sentence , he went into hiding abroad . In GPE he used a fake passport . The court considered that in these circumstances and taking into account that the applicant still had an outstanding sentence to be served in GPE , there was a reasonable fear that he might abscond or go into hiding . The court concluded that other preventive measure , not involving deprivation of the applicant \u2019s liberty , would not secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been serving a prison sentence imposed on him in another set of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG under LAW on complaints about a breach of the right to an investigation conducted or supervised by a prosecutor and to a trial within a reasonable time ( LOC o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki ) ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . He claimed that the proceedings had commenced in DATE and were still pending . He sought an acknowledgement that the proceedings had been lengthy and just - satisfaction in the amount of PLN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The court did not accept the applicant \u2019s view that the proceedings had lasted DATE . It examined only the course of the proceedings after DATE , stating that the applicant \u2019s complaint could only refer to the current stage of the proceedings , i.e. after ORG had remitted the case to ORG and had duly transmitted the case file . As regards the period after DATE it considered that the proceedings before the trial court had been conducted with the requisite speed , especially given the complexity of the case . In particular , the court observed that the hearings had been held frequently and at regular intervals and that only a few had been adjourned for reasons not imputable to the trial court . It further observed that at the request of the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL witnesses who had their permanent place of residence in GPE were summoned to be heard at the hearing on DATE . The CARDINAL summons were returned with notes \u201c addressee unknown \u201d . On DATE the applicant indicated a NORP address of CARDINAL of these CARDINAL witnesses . The court adjourned the hearing until DATE and summoned the witnesses again . On DATE the court heard one witness ; the remaining CARDINAL failed to appear . On DATE the applicant requested the court to hear another witness who had been deprived of his liberty in GPE . The court granted the request and decided that the witness in question be heard through the consular office . The court also observed that there had been objective difficulties in appointing expert witnesses of several specialities and that some of the expert reports obtained were incomplete and had to be returned for rectification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) classified the applicant as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d . It considered that this was necessary in view of the fact that he was charged with numerous offences against human life and health . The commission also referred to the applicant \u2019s serious lack of moral character and the fact that he was a recidivist . Finally , the commission emphasised that the applicant had already escaped twice from custody and had been hiding from the police for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Every DATE the commission reviewed , and upheld , its decision classifying the applicant as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d . The commission underlined that the initial grounds for imposing the special confinement measure were still valid .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against the decisions extending his status as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d . All his appeals were dismissed . In particular , the court gave decisions on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The authorities relied on the grounds set out in the initial decision . They laid particular emphasis on the risk posed by the seriousness of the offences and the fact that the applicant had already escaped previously from custody and had been in hiding for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of FAC ordered that the applicant be placed in solitary confinement for a period of DATE as a disciplinary punishment , after he had refused to undergo a strip - search . The applicant asked the Head of FAC to reconsider his decision . The penalty was implemented DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of FAC upheld his original decision , stating that it had been well - founded in view of the applicant \u2019s refusal to strip and his aggressive behaviour towards the prison guards who were to perform a body search . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , arguing that the impugned decision had been lawful and as such could not be contested before the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another disciplinary punishment was imposed on the applicant : he was refused permission to receive any food packages . The punishment was imposed on the applicant for allegedly aggressive behaviour prior to a full strip - search ( kontrola osobista ) on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d , the applicant was subjected to a full body search every time he entered or left his cell , which meant that he had to strip naked in front of CARDINAL prison guards and was required to carry out deep knee - bends at least twice a day .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions the applicant complained about the full stripsearches . In particular , on DATE he complained about a stripsearch of CARDINAL DATE . In reply , ORG , after verifying the circumstances of this check , confirmed that it had been carried out in accordance with the relevant procedures .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s visiting rights were also severely restricted . According to the list of visits submitted by the ORG , which was not contested by the applicant , between DATE and DATE the applicant received visits on CARDINAL occasions . However , DATE and DATE the applicant did not receive any visits . On DATE he received a visit from his defence lawyer . From DATE he was visited by his sisters , initially once DATE and subsequently , after DATE , DATE . Furthermore , the applicant could leave his cell for TIME of outdoor exercise per day in a QUANTITY by walls .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant made many requests to the prison authorities , asking them to allow him to take part in training sessions , workshops , courses or other sports activities organised for the other inmates . All those requests were rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the dangerous detainee status was lifted . The prison authorities stressed that the applicant \u2019s attitude had improved significantly and that he did not raise any security concerns .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the full strip - search , the applicant submitted that during periods when he had been detained in a cell with another inmate , the strip - search had been carried out in the cell , and consequently had occurred not only in the presence of CARDINAL prison guards , but also in the presence of the other inmate .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that the strip - searches had been performed in an adequately furnished separate room , which was monitored ; the recording could be viewed in a duty room . Any recordings from the surveillance system had been automatically deleted after DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further maintained that whenever he was outside his cell , including during his appearances at court hearings and medical visits , he had been required to wear the so - called \u201c joined shackles \u201d ( kajdany zespolone ) on his hands and feet .", "CARDINAL . However , the ORG argued that the applicant had been required to wear \u201c joined shackles \u201d only outside FAC and that inside the prison he had merely been handcuffed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the prison authorities to allow him to vote in ORG elections , in the polling station set up for that purpose within the confines of the prison . After carrying out a basic body search with a metal detector , the prison guard took the applicant to a separate room and ordered him to strip naked . As the applicant refused to do so , requesting the guard to allow him to vote without undergoing a full strip - search , he was taken back to his cell without being allowed to vote .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that he had to undergo a strip - search and that consequently he had not been allowed to vote . His complaint was referred to the Head of FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . He stated that as a \u2018 dangerous ORG the applicant was subjected to a body search every time he entered or left his cell . Since the applicant had refused to undergo a full strip - search on CARDINAL DATE while being taken to the prison polling station , the guards had to take him back to his cell . DATE the applicant was again asked whether he wished to participate in the elections but he refused , stating that he would not strip naked .", "DATE . On DATE the Head of the Lublin Remand Centre confirmed that all detainees who wished to participate in the parliamentary elections on DATE had voted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sent to ORG . From DATE he was detained in FAC . He was subsequently detained in FAC and then again in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suffers from hyperthyroidism , asthma , severe back pain , bilateral epididymal cysts and hypertension . During his detention in FAC he received pharmacological treatment . He also underwent a thyroid ultrasound ( on DATE ) and a testicular ultrasound . He also consulted specialist doctors .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions he complained about the delay in obtaining appointments with specialists . In reply , he was informed on CARDINAL DATE that the waiting time for specialist consultations had been similar to that for the population in general .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that throughout his detention he was held in conditions which fell below the basic levels of hygiene . He also alleged that his cell in FAC had had no ventilation , had little natural light , poor artificial lighting and was badly furnished .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted CARDINAL envelopes from correspondence received from his sister , bearing an illegible signature and the stamps \u201c censored on DATE \u201d , \u201c censored on DATE \u201d and \u201c censored on CARDINAL DATE \u201d respectively .
