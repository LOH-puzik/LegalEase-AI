The employees elected PERSON and the applicant .", "On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings with ORG ( PERSON ) challenging the applicant 's election as member of the works council on account of his NORP nationality .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as the labour and social court ( Arbeits- und ORG ) , deprived the applicant of his membership of the works council . It found that , as a NORP national , the applicant was not eligible to stand for election to this council , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE - verfassungsgesetz ) .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . As regards the applicant 's argument that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW amounted to a breach of LAW , ORG considered that the restriction of the right to stand for election to a works council of an enterprise did not interfere with the right to form or to join trade unions .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law . It also rejected CARDINAL procedural requests concerning a procedure before ORG Verfassungsgerichtshof ) , for the purpose of challenging part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , and a case before ORG of ORG . As regards LAW , ORG observed that freedom of association included the right to form and join associations of workers which , as compared to associations in general , pursued special aims and purposes , namely the promotion of working conditions . Trade unions are representative examples of such associations which are formed for a trade or profession ( \u201c \u00fcberbetrieblich \u201d ) . The works council , set up as a statutory organ of staff , could not be regarded as an association within the meaning of LAW . In particular , the works council was not an association formed on a voluntary and private basis , but its organisation and functions were determined by law . In that respect , ORG , referring to a decision of ORG DATE , found that it was comparable to chambers of trade . Moreover , the staff as such did not constitute an independent association within the meaning of LAW , as they were not a group of persons associated on a voluntary basis . As regards the question of discrimination between foreigners , ORG considered that the accession to ORG had required the extension of eligibility to citizens of member GPE of ORG ; and the difference in treatment between NORP nationals and foreigners was generally justified on account of the particular relationship between nationals and their home ORG . Furthermore , as the stay of foreigners other than nationals of Member States of ORG , could be limited in time , the statutory period of their membership in a works council were subject to an administrative decision .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "B.

The legal provisions on the works constitution and their application aim at balancing competing interests to the benefit of the staff and the work place , and these bodies are called upon to cooperate , inter alia , with the competent collective public - law bodies of staff or voluntary staff associations .", "Section CARDINAL provides that , in any work place with CARDINAL or more permanent members of staff eligible to vote , representative bodies should be set up : as a rule , a general works meeting ( GPE ) , group meetings of the workers and of the employees ( ORG der PERSON ) , the works council electoral committee ( PERSON f\u00fcr die Betriebsratswahl ) , the respective works councils of the workers and the employees , the works committee ( PERSON ) and the auditor ( PERSON ) .", "Section CARDINAL fixes the number of members of a works council in relation to the number of staff at the date of election : in a work place with CARDINAL employees , the works council consists of CARDINAL person , in a work place with CARDINAL employees , it consists of QUANTITY persons , in a work place with CARDINAL employees , it consists of QUANTITY persons , and in a work place with CARDINAL employees , it consists of QUANTITY persons .
