This difference in cost is not related to a commensurate difference in quality and it is not , therefore , possible to demonstrate that ORG provides value for money . The resources available for funding social care services in GPE are reducing . As a result there is a need to ensure that expenditure is contained within the reduced resources available . The impact of this , in terms of the need to actually withdraw services , can be lessened if opportunities can be found to continue to provide services to the same number of people but at a lower cost . The replacement of residential care places , run directly by the ORG , with places purchased in independent sector homes offers such an opportunity .", "ORG was built DATE and , consequently does not meet the physical space standards set out in ORG , established by legislation .

It is estimated that it would cost MONEY to make the necessary alterations . Even if no requirement is introduced , expenditure on such alterations can only be avoided if the home remains unchanged for the foreseeable future . This would mean that , in the longer term , the home would be unable to respond to the changing needs and expectations of current and future users .

The potential negative and positive outcomes of relocation investigated include changes in mortality rates , morbidity , and psychological and social changes . In this review , we found few consistent negative or positive outcomes resulting from relocation ; indeed , the majority of studies we reviewed did not identify any significant resident outcomes as a result of relocation . However , it should also be noted that we also show that many relocation studies have analytic limitations .

As to the reliability of the available literature and data on residential care home moves , he noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Turning again to the literature of the impact of relocation of older people from residential home to residential home or similar institution to similar institution : PERSON has produced a helpful and scholarly review including detailed analysis of some of the papers made available to the ORG , as well as reference to some of the work . It is important to put the published literature into context . Papers and special reports are put together and offered for publication with a view to conveying particular messages or making particular points . As PERSON points out , there are no circumstances in which older people with or without evidence of frailty would be exposed by design in a controlled experimental way to the stresses associated with closure of homes , relocation to alternative environments , and perhaps relocation back to newly refurbished accommodation . There would be no justification for such an experiment ; it would be deemed economically impracticable and ethnically unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . What we have is a selective reporting of experiences that occur when relocations are required as a consequence of unplanned tragedies such as a fire in a home , the discovery of safety problems , etc , or in response to alternative practical considerations such as the nonviability financially of a sponsoring organisation or a requirement such as that operative in the present case to improve standards , to reduce the overall beddage of a particular component of the care sector .", "CARDINAL . So materials that come into the public arena are represented as selected sample . Some are selected by authors wanting to make the point that moving old people puts them at risk and seeking to document and quantify that risk and its impact . Others wanting to make the point that despite the common understanding that moves are stressful and can cause deterioration in health and bring forward death , it is possible by taking careful thought and planning , engaging the individuals and their families and the care staff in making suitable arrangements , to minimise the adverse impact of relocations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In summary statements , PERSON reflects :", "Paragraph DATE where research has been undertaken , the evidence is equivocal ' and in paragraph PERCENT ' broadly , the epidemiological evidence suggests that , under optimal conditions , relocation from CARDINAL care setting to another does not significantly increase the risk of mortality or morbidity ' .", "My own view is that from common experience , from my clinical experience , and from an informed review of the literature , it is an inescapable truism that relocation is a stressful event and can precipitate problems of mental health , physical health , and even bring forth death . There are published examples of good practice that when every care and consideration is taken into account in planning and conducting moves , and where matters are not confounded by unplanned or unforeseen complications , the impact of this stress can be minimised . Achieving ' optimal conditions ' for individuals and groups of individuals is , in practice , very difficult to achieve and can not reasonably be guaranteed . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In addition , fragments of an understanding and the anxieties associated with that understanding or CARDINAL understanding , may come back repeatedly to haunt the individual .", "Combinations of these vulnerability factors increase the risk of adverse reactions to the relocation stress and , of course , such combinations are not uncommon amongst individuals who are living in residential care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On options available to minimise the risks to residents of a transfer , PERSON commented :", "\u201c DATE . ... The first consideration has to be to examine again whether it is necessary or inevitable that the relocation proceeds . There is little doubt that the best interests of these individuals will be served by continuing to live in the environment that they choose , have chosen and have not moved from .", "CARDINAL . The next consideration is to deal with each individual as an individual , investigating the situation carefully with them and with their families , their medical practitioner advisers , and anyone else who is relevant , so that they can be made aware as far as they are able of the proposals and their implications and the alternatives . Some will choose to move to alternative accommodation of their choice rather than remain in a situation of uncertainty and potential conflict ...", "CARDINAL . Others will choose to remain in their present care environments and to accept changes that will occur within that environment and the programme of relocation presented to them by the authorities . For these individuals , the authorities have additional responsibilities . It is clear that if individuals or groups of individuals are to move from CARDINAL environment to another , then the receiving environment must be at least as well physically attuned to their needs as the CARDINAL from which they are moving . It must be warm and comfortable and have suitable facilities , and to be accessible by friends and relatives who would wish to visit . Where it is possible for groups of friends to move together , then this has every advantage for the friendship circle will be sustaining both in anticipating the move , coping with the move , and reflecting on its aftermath . Similarly , where it is possible for staff to move as a group with their charges , there is every advantage . The familiarity of a trusted carer or nurse is extremely reassuring to the individual . Older people with multiple pathologies have multiple needs based on those pathologies as well as upon their personal preferences and styles . These are known to those who care for them and carrying that expertise from CARDINAL situation to another reduces and minimises stress . There may be advantage in brand new and special equipment but there is also advantage in carrying with CARDINAL favoured and trusted comforts , which might include a chair , table , radio , etc . It is extremely important when such relocations are being contemplated , that extremely careful arrangements are made for continuity of medical care and support . If it is possible for CARDINAL practice to continue to be the provider , that is maybe ideal . If there is to be transfer from CARDINAL practice to another , it is important that all information is conveyed from the donor practice to the receiver practice well in advance , preferably by personal contact . It is important that a receiving environment is well prepared in advance of DATE of a move . It may be possible to move all residents from CARDINAL home to another on DATE but it is a difficult logistical task . There is a requirement for staffing at both ends as well as staffing to conduct the transfer . The involvement of people 's families in the process can be very helpful . It is important not to try to do too much all in one frantic move . It may be necessary to undertake a series of moves of a modest number of individuals so that everyone 's needs can be properly attended to . There are considerations of DATE and climate . Moves during the cold of DATE are hazardous and should be avoided for cold is stressful and deaths preferentially occur in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Professor PERSON was asked by ORG PERSON to prepare a report following the death of CARDINAL elderly residents who had recently moved care home . He summarised the relevant literature as follows :", "\u201c In the scientific literature , there have been a number of reports over DATE concerning the effects of the relocation of older people , either from ORG ) continuing care wards to homes , or from CARDINAL home to another . A review by ORG , summarized the literature over DATE . The mortality of elderly residents who are moved compared to those who are not , seems to be increased by CARDINAL . It is clear from a number of studies that the people most at risk are those who are relatively immobile , need to be helped with dressing and washing , have significant physical illness and who have severe dementia . A combination of these risk factors puts a resident at greater risk . It has also been suggested by CARDINAL Inquiry into such a transfer , where CARDINAL deaths occurred within DATE of moving ( ORG , DATE ) that poor planning of the process was partly to blame \u2013 implementation and monitoring of the transfer was not carried out in sufficient detail and there was not enough time given to new staff to become familiar with the needs of transferred residents . In DATE , ORG produced guidance on the transfer of frail older people from the ORG ( ORG , DATE ) . Some studies ( for example that of ORG and Crome , DATE ) have found no increase in mortality but note that at the time of transfer a lot of attention had been paid to the organisation of the process and families , carers and staff were involved . Publications since DATE have included : PERSON ( DATE ) who concluded from his study that physical ill health and old age , rather than the trauma associated with relocation itself , explained mortality ; ORG ) who confirmed how disruptive it is for older people with dementia to move and found a death rate of CARDINAL after DATE and ; PERSON ( DATE ) who measured the physical effects of moving on levels of stress hormones in the body of older people who had taken part in a relocation and found that the move was associated with much higher levels DATE after the move .", "Thus , it has been well documented that there is an increase in mortality in older people when they move from CARDINAL setting to another . The risk factors are being frail and hav[ing ] dementia . Organising the transfer with proper care can mitigate against the negative effects of the move . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In his report , PERSON commented :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Many local authorities have revised and published policies and protocols on home closure since the DATE publication by ORG of ' Guidelines for the closure of care homes for older people : presence and content of local government procedures ' , ORG A GPE .", "CARDINAL . I have looked at a crosssection of these . Most local authority protocols and procedures now specifically address most of the issues identified in the ORG , PERSON and ORG reviews . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Reviewing previous publications and research in the field , Professor PERSON noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Such individuals are unlikely to be capable of consent or agreement to be subjects for research or agreeable to publication of their case histories , even if successfully relocated .", "CARDINAL . Most case studies have only been published because there were significant adverse outcomes for the residents . This represents a ' publication bias ' in favour of ' bad news ' rather than ' good news ' outcomes . In this context it is therefore highly significant that there are several published reports indicating ' successful ' transfer of vulnerable older people where preparation was undertaken to a high standard . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the risks of transfer , he concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL Professors GPE and PERSON have provided a fair summary of the existing evidence , albeit much of it lacks research vigour about the particular risks faced by older people moving from CARDINAL care home to another ...", "CARDINAL . As a consultant trained in both geriatric medicine and psychiatry I have seen consequences of both hasty and well planned care home transfers of CARDINAL of vulnerable older people over DATE . In broad terms I fully endorse the conclusions of Professors PERSON and PERSON , which is that older people in care homes are a vulnerable group who are at risk of deterioration with ill planned relocation . However , careful planning and preparation of individuals , following personalised care plans and maximising continuity of care , can minimise the risks such that the risk of an adverse outcome is very low . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his report , PERSON was asked to address the question whether , having regard to the reports of Professors PERSON and PERSON , it was in principle possible to transfer care home residents , in particular individuals suffering from dementia , without any increased risk of mortality . He responded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Yes , provided the vulnerability of individual residents is recognised and assessed to a high standard , with multi disciplinary and family / carer consultation and all steps ( consistent with the experience and best practice as outlined by PERSON , Jolley , ORG and in this report ) are taken to avoid unnecessary risk and trauma to individuals facing transfer . It needs to be acknowledged that in any population of frail older people with an average age in DATE there will be a small number of deaths to be expected in DATE prior and following transfer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The question of the impact of the closure of residential care homes on residents ' human rights has been brought before the domestic courts on several occasions . In R ( ORG and others ) v.

I am prepared to assume that a positive obligation of the kind suggested by [ counsel for the applicant ] was imposed on the ORG . In this case , ORG and CARDINAL are being invoked to impose positive obligations on the ORG as they themselves are not responsible for killing or torturing the claimants . The result is that the limits of the obligations are defined by proportionality . That means the obligation on the authority to take measures to protect the citizens from breaches of their LAW rights is limited in that the obligation must not impose an ' impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities ' ( PERSON v. GPE CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL [ CARDINAL ] and R ( Pretty ) v. ORG [ CARDINAL ] ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded :", "\u201c DATE . The LAW claim fails for CARDINAL reasons . First , I do not consider that there is evidence that the risk to the claimants ' lives would reach the level needed to engage LAW as explained by [ counsel for the applicant ] in the light of both the precautions and steps to be taken by the ORG . The claimants have not adduced any evidence to criticise or to comment on the steps that the ORG consider adequate . Second , in any event , even if that is wrong I consider that the ORG has met the requirements relied on by the claimant , which is , according to [ counsel for the applicant ] , to ensure that ' the state did all that could reasonably been required of it to prevent the [ claimant 's ] life being avoidably put at risk ' ( ORG v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR [ CARDINAL ] ) ... Third , as I will explain at the end of this judgment , the ORG has agreed to liaise with Professor PERSON or another consultant in the psychiatry of the old aged on the best ways of moving the claimants so as to reduce the risk to them . It was agreed that the parties would have liberty to apply if problems arose . This will ensure that the claimants ' lives will not be at risk . Fourth , if I had been in any doubt about LAW CARDINAL claim the factor to which I have just referred would have led me to the same conclusion that this Article QUANTITY challenge fails because the courts accord a broad area of discretionary judgment to a public authority in deciding what is a fair balance between the interests of an individual and of the community ... This would prevent the ORG 's decision being impugned on LAW grounds . Thus , I conclude that the claimants ' rights under LAW will not be infringed by the move . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Article CARDINAL complaint was dismissed for similar reasons .", "CARDINAL . As to the Article CARDINAL complaint , PERSON held that :", "\u201c DATE .

No cogent criticism has been made by [ counsel for the applicants ] of the proposed arrangements . It is particularly noteworthy that the ORG intends to do all that is necessary to preserve friendship groups and thus shows respect for what would be covered under LAW ) as ' family life ' . The other measures ... show the claimants ' rights to physical integrity and respect for home and family life have been safeguarded and are not infringed .

Second , the financial resources of the ORG is an important element to be considered to the balancing exercise required in the application of Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ...", "CARDINAL . A third reason why this claim based on DATE must fail is that the ORG is entitled to a substantial degree of deference relating to the way in which it allocates its resources and provides services . This is relevant as Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) requires a balancing exercise . These are matters very much within the expertise of a local authority and with which a court should only interfere where the evidence is very clear , but this is , as I have explained , not such a case . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In my judgment , having considered this material , it seems to me that at most the material establishes that in some studies a statistical increase of the sort alleged by the Claimant has been established , while in others it has not . Further , it seems to me that on proper analysis what the material shows is that different people may react to a move in different ways , and that moves which are sensitively and thoughtfully handled can be achieved without a significant increase in mortality , although there may be individuals who can not be moved however carefully the moving process is handled , though such cases will be rare . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In particular the question and answer document disclosed that the issue of risk of death to residents was raised , and canvassed during that consultation , sufficiently so that the specific question and the response to it appeared in the question and answer document . Thus as the purpose of the consultation is to enable those being consulted to raise issues for consideration by the council , plainly the consultation was sufficient for that purpose and the mere fact that an individual 's relatives may not have been aware of the risk does not in any way cast doubt on the lawfulness of the consultation process .", "CARDINAL .
