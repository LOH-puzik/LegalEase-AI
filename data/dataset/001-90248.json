The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a gynaecologist . In DATE he set up a company which prepared medical reports at his GPE request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a report entitled \u201c Civil opinion \u201d ( opinia cywilna ) on the treatment that PERSON had undergone in ORG in GPE . The opinion described , in a detailed manner , the history of PERSON medical treatment since DATE . The report was based on PERSON medical file obtained from the clinics of hepatology and dermatology where he had received treatment . The applicant also relied on the results of a recent medical examination , a biopsy , carried out at the applicant \u2019s initiative by ORG . In his report the applicant established that the patient had been receiving treatment since DATE at ORG . However , in spite of the fact that his health had deteriorated and that he had been developing symptoms of liver damage , no specialised examination , that is , a biopsy , had been carried out . A recent liver biopsy , undertaken upon the applicant \u2019s recommendation at ORG , had shown that the patient was suffering from aggressive and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis ( przewlek\u0142e agresywne zapalenie w\u0105troby z marsko\u015bci\u0105 w\u0105troby ) . The applicant considered that the damage to PERSON health , due to both his liver condition and dermatological problems , amounted to PERCENT thus making him eligible to receive the highest group of invalidity allowance . With regard to the treatment received at ORG the applicant \u2019s report stated :", "\u201c ... Despite [ the patient \u2019s ] chronic suffering , of which he had complained constantly during his regular visits , and which was confirmed by examinations indicating a chronic liver condition , the employees of the ORG had failed to take the actions [ necessary ] for the health care of [ the patient ] and his diagnosis . So , despite indications , adequate diligence while diagnosing , informing and providing health care to [ the patient ] was not displayed . \u201d", "The opinion also dealt with the treatment of PERSON dermatological problems at ORG and concluded that it had been proper and diligent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Regional Attorney for Professional Liability ( Okr\u0119gowy PERSON ) instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant . He was charged with unethical conduct , reference being made to the fact that the applicant \u2019s opinion had discredited the doctors who had been treating the patient . The Regional Attorney relied on LAW ( PERSON ) . Moreover , according to the Regional Attorney , in assessing a complicated therapy in which he did not specialise , the applicant had overstepped his professional competences . In his application of DATE lodged with ORG ( PERSON ) , in which he asked for a disciplinary punishment to be imposed on the applicant , the Attorney stated :", "\u201c In the present case the Attorney established that Dr PERSON , by preparing and giving the patient an opinion in which he included judgments on the professional conduct of other doctors ( working in ORG ) , obviously violated the well - established medical society rules of proper conduct between doctors .", "Unfavourable arguments and analysis of professional actions expressed by CARDINAL doctor in front of a patient always clearly discredit the doctor under scrutiny ... \u201d", "\u201c ORG finds that the entirety of the public behaviour of [ the applicant ] has no support in the medical profession and does not serve the rightly understood well - being of the patient . The disciplinary bodies of the ORG will assess their attitudes in detail and draw appropriate conclusions ( wyci\u0105gn\u0105 stosowne wnioski ) . ORG decided to take a position on the public activities of the above - mentioned doctors and the manner in which they have been exercising the medical profession given the exceptional departure from recognised and generally accepted rules and given the possibility of their manipulating the perceptions and the behaviour of the local community . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) held a hearing . The court was composed of CARDINAL members , all doctors . The applicant , his wife , their representative and a representative of ORG were present at the hearing . However , soon after the opening of the hearing the applicant decided to leave the courtroom , objecting to the fact that the disciplinary court had allegedly violated a time - limit for examination of a case . The hearing continued in the applicant \u2019s absence as he had not decided to return and the court regarded his absence as unjustified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of unethical conduct . ORG considered that the applicant , in his report , had expressed negative opinions of the professional conduct of doctors concerned and that he had conveyed these directly to the patient . In so doing , he had discredited the doctors in the eyes of the patient . His behaviour was therefore contrary to the principle of professional solidarity and , consequently , to the provisions of LAW . The court did not examine the truthfulness of the opinion at issue as it found that the question of whether it \u201c reflected the reality \u201d was \u201c of no importance \u201d for finding a violation of this provision of the LAW . The disciplinary court also found that the applicant had violated LAW , as he had written an opinion concerning a branch of medicine in which he was not a specialist . The court found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to a reprimand ( skazuje na kar\u0119 nagany ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged all members of the court , complaining that they had not been impartial . The applicant submitted that the independence and impartiality of the members of the disciplinary court had been open to doubt because it was possible that the ORG Governor could have put pressure on them . In addition the applicant complained about the way the hearing had been conducted , submitting that the President of the court had prevented him from putting all his questions and had dismissed his motions . On DATE ORG , sitting in a different composition , dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on DATE . He argued that a doctor had a right to express freely his own opinion in conformity with his medical knowledge and his conscience and to inform his patient if he believed that the latter had been incorrectly treated or wrongly diagnosed . The purpose of a doctor \u2019s work was the well - being of the patient and not professional solidarity with other doctors . The applicant further complained that his challenge to the members of ORG , and application to transfer the case to another town , had been dismissed . He submitted that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members of the court were senior managers of the hospitals thus susceptible to pressure from the ORG Governor \u2019s office , the latter often being criticised by the applicant \u2019s association .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s actions were highly reprehensible and harmful not only to the medical profession but also to the patient , as the opinion gave him to believe , groundlessly , that he had been the victim of an injustice . The court also firmly rejected the applicant \u2019s suggestion that his conviction had been the result of political pressure .
