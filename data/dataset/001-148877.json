The majority of the court observed that the interests of national security required that access to ORG secrets be granted only to persons whose character references precluded the risk of disclosure of ORG secrets and that in the ORG member states the threshold of eligibility for security clearance was high . They concluded that such restrictions were necessary in a NORP society and provided a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole . The majority conceded , however , that the above restrictions had to be sufficiently substantiated and that the competent authority had to assess the degree of risk in each particular case in order to decide whether to grant clearance or not .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court emphasised that the right of access to a court did not equate to a right to resolve in a court any question of importance to an individual . It further noted that even if the dispute in question was of a nature that in principle fell to be examined in the courts , the right of access to court could nevertheless be curtailed if curtailment served a legitimate aim and the means employed were reasonably proportionate to that aim . In that regard ORG held that even though ORG could not be considered to be \u201c a court \u201d for the purposes of the right of access to court , nothing in the PERSON on ORG prevented him from implementing certain procedural guarantees in the process of reviewing a refusal to issue security clearance . Furthermore , the court considered that ORG had a duty to interpret the applicable provisions in the light of the LAW and to implement such guarantees . Accordingly , ORG considered that section CARDINAL ) of the Law on State Secrets , which , in its opinion , was capable of being applied in a manner compatible with the LAW , was not contrary to LAW . CARDINAL judges dissented , considering that in practice the audiatur et altera pars principle was not applied by ORG and that in the absence of any procedural guarantees set down in the Law on State Secrets the Prosecutor General \u2019s decision making was inherently arbitrary ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
