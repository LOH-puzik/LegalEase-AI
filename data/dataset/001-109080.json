THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Mihai Poalelungi", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant reported to the police that his driving licence had been stolen in DATE . On DATE the applicant was issued with a new driving licence . He had applied for it only shortly before , i.e. in DATE .", "CARDINAL . During DATE , between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , ORG ( FAC het LANGUAGE \u2013 \u201c the NORP \u201d ) registered a total of CARDINAL motor vehicles in the applicant \u2019s name in the vehicle registration system ( kentekenregister ) , but without his consent . It would appear that these registrations were effected upon presentation of the applicant \u2019s stolen driving licence .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of these vehicles being registered in his name , the applicant received large numbers of motor vehicle tax assessments ( aanslagen motorrijtuigenbelasting / houderschapsbelasting ) , he was on many occasions prosecuted on the basis of ORG ( Wet aansprakelijkheidsverzekering motorrijtuigen ) and fined by the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) on the basis of ORG ( Wet administratiefrechtelijk handhaving verkeersvoorschriften ) in respect of offences committed with the cars . Having been ordered by the competent court to pay these fines , he was detained for failure to comply with these orders ( gijzeling ) pursuant to LAW . The applicant ended up paying fines imposed on him on the basis of these motor vehicle registrations in respect of offences not committed by him . On several occasions the applicant was held liable by ORG ( PERSON ) for damage caused by uninsured vehicles registered in his name . The applicant \u2019s welfare benefits were stopped , as his financial means were considered to be quite adequate in view of the sheer number of vehicles registered in his name .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that on DATE he requested the ORG to annul all the vehicle registrations , bar the one relating to his own car and was met with a refusal . Likewise , he alleges that he made several unsuccessful attempts in DATE to rectify the situation by , inter alia , writing complaints to ORG who had imposed fines on him . The Government state that no official record exists to support these allegations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant furthermore appealed , on DATE , to ORG ( gerechtshof ) against the refusal of ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) to prosecute those responsible for the malicious vehicle registrations in his name . In its decision of DATE , ORG considered , as relevant to the case before the ORG , that although the police could admittedly have proceeded more effectively with the investigation , too much time had passed ( the events in issue , i.e. the malicious registration of motor vehicles , had taken place DATE ) to expect any viable investigation to be conducted by the authorities concerned . ORG therefore dismissed the appeal , but it nevertheless noted that it was in favour of the course of action as advised by ORG , namely a complete remission in a single administrative act ( eenmalige sanering ) of all ( administrative ) sanctions imposed on the applicant which were an effect of the malicious registrations . According to the applicant \u2019s representative , no such remission took place . Moreover , ORG ) initially prevented the applicant from being eligible for debt rescheduling under LAW ( Wet Schuldsanering Natuurlijke Personen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested the ORG to annul , with retroactive effect , the motor vehicle registrations in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partially granted the request , cancelling CARDINAL registrations as of that date . The remaining registrations were no longer in the applicant \u2019s name at that time . The ORG expressly stated that it was unable to cancel the registrations retroactively , as had been requested by the applicant , as that would be detrimental to the reliability of the motor vehicle registration system .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection on DATE , arguing , in particular , that the motor vehicle registration system was already flawed owing to the existence of the impugned registrations ; that not granting the desired retroactive effect would have substantial financial consequences for him ; and that the ORG , in DATE , had offered to annul the stolen driving licence for purposes of motor vehicle registrations on condition that the applicant apply for a new licence , which condition the applicant had been unable to meet at that time for financial reasons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s objection was dismissed on DATE . The ORG decided that cancellation of registrations with retroactive effect would lead to legal uncertainty and would entail the ORG \u2019s interference with competencies of other authorities , e.g. ORG or ORG , in that it could affect the legality of decisions which those authorities had made or might make on the basis of the contents of the motor vehicle registration system .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG ( rechtbank ) , arguing in particular that he had , already in DATE , made a similar request to the ORG and had reported the fraudulent use of his driving licence to the police , yet to no avail . The applicant also submitted that the motor vehicle registration system , as it was at the relevant time , had been sensitive to fraud , a risk which , in the applicant \u2019s view , should not be for the general population to bear . He argued furthermore that the requirement which existed in DATE to have to apply for a new driving licence in order to disallow motor vehicle registrations with a stolen CARDINAL was unjust and discriminatory .", "CARDINAL . ORG concurred with the ORG \u2019s decision and considered that no exceptional circumstances existed warranting a deviation from the standard practice not to grant retroactive effect . It noted in that respect that , although he had lodged complaints in DATE , the applicant had allowed DATE to pass before starting the proceedings at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State \u2013 \u201c the Administrative Jurisdiction Division \u201d ) . The applicant argued , in relevant part , that his rights under LAW were being violated due to the unlawful registrations of motor vehicles in his name and that the vehicle registration system was flawed in that it allowed such large - scale fraud to occur so easily .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c As ORG has held [ in an earlier case ] , it can not be found that the ORG \u2019s policy of denying in principle retroactive effect to decisions ... to cancel the registration of a vehicle is not reasonable . The purity of the vehicle register and legal certainty of the registration of vehicles justify such a policy , as ORG has rightly held . ORG has rightly held that the ORG was not obliged to consider the applicant \u2019s submissions in this matter a ground to deviate from this policy and retroactively cancel the registration of the said motor cars with effect from the date requested by the applicant . That being so , the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG decision is incomprehensible and improperly reasoned must fail .", "As regards the [ applicant \u2019s ] argument that LAW ( Kentekenreglement ) violate , inter alia , Directive CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; hereafter : the Directive ) , ORG finds as follows . Contrary to what the [ applicant ] suggests , it can not be deduced from the fact that the guideline includes a right of correction that the processor of those personal data is obliged to do so sua sponte and unasked and might not make the desired correction dependent on a request to that effect . In addition , contrary to what the [ applicant ] suggests , the processing of personal data pursuant to the Directive is also permitted without the permission of the person concerned if such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the exercise of official authority . In the opinion of ORG , the use of a driving license involves recording the data of that driving license in a data filing system and processing them in the performance of the duty to secure compliance with legal obligations such as those here in issue . The [ applicant \u2019s ] complaint fails .", "Nor does ORG agree with the [ applicant ] that LAW violate the right to liberty and security of person , laid down in LAW . Regardless of whether these provisions can be relevant to the decision - making process based on LAW \u2013 these regulations do not , after all , provide for the deprivation of liberty referred to by the [ applicant ] \u2013 these provisions contain an exception to the right to liberty and security of person in order to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law . In this connection , ORG notes in addition that this exception is also covered by the circumstance , referred to by the [ applicant ] , that he was deprived of his liberty because he had not taken the measures needed to correct the [ registration of vehicles wrongly registered in his name ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Road Traffic Act ( Wegenverkeerswet DATE ) entered into force on DATE .
