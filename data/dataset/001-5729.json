Fredman , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "LAW ( kalastuslaki , lag om fiske ) , as amended on DATE , provides that fishing with hand - held tackle is a public right as everyone who has paid the lure - fishing fee to the ORG is allowed to fish with hand - held tackle also in privately owned water areas . Pursuant to the same amendment , fishing with hook and line as well as ice - fishing are rights guaranteed to everyone . With the amendment , the owner of a water area lost his exclusive right to control fishing , and the amount of fishing licenses , in his water area .", "According to the LAW as amended , the fees for the right to fish with a hand - held tackle are now paid to the ORG . This system replacing the earlier one , in which the owner of a water area himself received the fees paid for the fishing licenses . However , the income from the fees paid for the right to fish with a hand - held tackle are , after the ORG has deducted its expenses for collecting the fees , reimbursed to the owners of the fishing waters as compensation for the fishing with hand - held tackle in their waters . If the reimbursement for an individual owner of a water area is less than ORG CARDINAL , the amount is reimbursed to the local fishing association .", "According to the old LAW , everyone who was DATE and wanted to fish or crayfish , had to pay - in addition to the local fishing license - an DATE payment of ORG to the ORG for the maintenance of the fishing waters .", "The applicants are owners of water areas and local fishing associations . Some of the individual applicants are professional fishermen , who fear for their income as everyone is now entitled to fish in their fishing waters . Others are individuals who , due to the amendment of LAW , have lost income which they used to earn by selling fishing licenses , by renting their water areas to fishing associations , and so on . The applicant associations have lost their income by losing their right to receive payments for fishing licenses . According to the applicants , their income from the fishing licenses and related sources in DATE has been QUANTITY per year per applicant . Some of the fishing associations have , however , earned up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL per year for selling fishing licenses .", "By virtue of LAW , the individual owners of fishery waters form a fishing association . Fishing associations are members of ORG kalastusalue , fiskeomr\u00e5de ) . Activities of Fishing Areas are directed and supervised by LOC ( kalastuspiiri , fiskeridistrikt ) , which are authorities subject to ORG ( maa- ja mets\u00e4talousministeri\u00f6 , jord- och skogsbruksministeriet ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
