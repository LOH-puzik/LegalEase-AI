NORP On DATE , following a complaint from a bank , the ORG - Stare Miasto Police opened an inquiry ( dochodzenie ) into attempted fraud by PERSON They relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON - Stare Miasto District Prosecutor opened an investigation ( CARDINAL ) into the forgery of a cheque for MONEY ( ORG ) and the attempted fraudulent use of that cheque . The prosecutor relied on ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG - Stare Miasto District Prosecutor made an application to ORG for the interception and recording of the content of the applicants\u2019 telephone conversations . The prosecutor \u2019s application was made in connection with the investigation against PERSON and other persons suspected of the commission of an offence under LAW and other offences . ORG requested the court to issue a warrant authorising the interception of the content of the applicants\u2019 telephone conversations , which", "\u201c may concern the activities of an organised group involved in the putting into circulation of forged securities and aggravated fraud , or indicate planned or already committed offences \u201d .", "The prosecutor relied on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . Among the reasons for her application , the prosecutor stated as follows :", "\u201c So far it has been established that on DATE PERSON attempted to defraud the ORG in ORG of CARDINAL USD ( the equivalent of MONEY ) by using a ORG cheque issued on DATE . It is clear from the evidence obtained in the investigation that the said cheque was forged . Cheques from this bank were removed from circulation in DATE , that is , DATE after ORG acquired ORG .", "It further appears from the evidence that the said cheque originated from PERSON [ the first applicant ] , and that , in cooperation with other persons , he intends to use these documents [ cheques ] to defraud large sums of money in the near future . There exists a reasonable suspicion that PERSON possesses a large number of forged cheques ( CARDINAL ) of the same NORP bank to the value of CARDINAL ORG each ...", "In connection with the above , at the current stage of the investigation it is necessary to establish the source from which the said securities originated and PERSON contact with persons who are cooperating with him in order to put those documents into circulation with a view to defrauding large sums of money . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) granted the prosecutor \u2019s application for leave to intercept the applicants\u2019 telephone conversations for DATE . That decision was given in the proceedings against PERSON and others and in respect of the offence under LAW and other offences . The court decided to delay the serving of its decision on the applicants until the end of the investigation . It authorised QUANTITY police officers to make a transcript of the recorded conversations and another officer to read the transcript . The court ordered that the transcript be classified and transmitted to the PERSON - Stare Miasto District Prosecutor \u2019s Office .", "CARDINAL . The court gave the following reasons in its decision :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and GPE were arrested by the police at a bank in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the first applicant with CARDINAL offences . The first charge was that of putting into circulation between DATE and DATE , jointly with others , of a forged ORG cheque for CARDINAL and attempted fraudulent use of that cheque ( ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . Shortly afterwards , the second applicant was charged with the same offence . The second charge against the first applicant was that of storing and transporting on DATE a forged ORG cheque for USD MONEY ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC remanded the first applicant in custody on suspicion of the offences referred to above . His pre - trial detention was extended on a number of occasions . In a decision of DATE , ORG found that the evidence obtained in the case indicated that the first applicant had acted as part of an international criminal group involved in forging securities and putting them into circulation in GPE and abroad . On DATE the first applicant was released from detention and other , non - custodial , measures were applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC remanded the second applicant in custody on suspicion of the offence referred to above . On DATE the court released him from detention and imposed non - custodial preventive measures instead .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was taken over by ORG at ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG amended the charges against the applicants . He specified that the applicants had acted jointly with GPE and GPE The prosecutor additionally invoked LAW , which signified that the fraudulent use of the cheque involved a considerable amount of money .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE ORG informed the applicants that on the basis of ORG decision of DATE , investigative measures \u2013 namely , the interception of telephone conversations \u2013 had been carried out pursuant to LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The prosecutor further informed the applicants that the relevant decision and the results of the interception could be consulted at the secret registry of the office of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal ( za\u017calenie ) against ORG decision of DATE authorising the warrant , alleging that it had been unlawful on CARDINAL grounds .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , they argued that ORG had erroneously applied LAW ORG in authorising the interception of telephone conversations in respect of an offence which was not included in the list of offences set out in LAW . They noted that the aim of ORG decision had been to establish the source of the forged cheques . However , at the material time LAW of the ORG did not allow for the application of such measures in respect of the offence of forgery of cheques . Subparagraph CARDINAL of that provision authorised the interception of telephone conversations only in respect of the offence of counterfeiting money ( fa\u0142szowanie pieni\u0119dzy ) . They underlined that the relevant provision had been amended to include the offence of forgery of cheques , but only with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicants alleged that ORG had incorrectly applied LAW ORG in authorising a police officer and an interpreter to examine the recorded conversations . They submitted that only the court or the prosecutor , and in urgent cases the police with the agreement of the court or the prosecutor , had the right to do so . However , in their case the recordings had been examined by a police officer and a translator without the required authorisation by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the ORG appeal . The decision was served on the ORG counsel on CARDINAL DATE . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ORG finds that the present appeal is unfounded and can not be sustained .", "The appeal \u2019s main argument is the assertion that since PERSON and PERSON [ the applicants ] were charged with the commission of an offence under LAW [ putting into circulation a forged cheque ] , and since this offence was not one of the offences listed in LAW ORG at the time of issuing the decision , the interception and recording of their [ telephone ] conversations was not permitted . However , such an argument can not be upheld for the following reasons .", "The investigation carried out by the PERSON - Stare Miasto District Prosecutor did in fact relate to the putting into circulation of forged securities , but by the members of an organised [ criminal ] group , in other words , the offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG , in respect of which it was permitted to intercept and record telephone conversations at the date when the decision was issued . According to the evidence obtained before the issuing of the decision , PERSON and PERSON [ the applicants ] were indeed persons suspected of ( osoby podejrzane ) acting as part of an organised group , as indicated by the passage from the impugned decision which states :", "\u201c the content [ of those conversations ] may concern the activities of an organised group involved in the putting into circulation ... \u201d .", "It has to be reiterated that a person suspected of [ the commission of an offence ] ( which is referred to in LAW ORG ) in respect of whom it is permitted to intercept and record telephone conversations is a person \u201c who is suspected of having committed an offence , but who has not yet been formally charged . In respect of such a person there is a supposition that he / she has committed an offence ; however , there is as yet no reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence , and only such reasonable suspicion constitutes a ground to make that person a suspect ( T. Grzegorczyk , PERSON . PERSON . ORG uzupe\u0142nione ... [ Code of Criminal Procedure , Commentary , CARDINALrd revised edition ] ... ) .", "Having regard to the foregoing , it has to be stated that the charge [ of committing an offence ] under LAW laid against the applicants did not provide a ground for tapping their telephones as that was not provided for by LAW CARDINAL of the ORG ; nevertheless , the fact that at the same time they were persons suspected of membership of an organised group and of carrying out activities within the framework of such a group did constitute grounds for issuing the impugned decision on the interception and recording of telephone conversations .", "Thus , the warrant was issued in accordance with the law and consequently there are no grounds for sustaining the arguments put forward in the appeal ; moreover , the court was able to authorise a police officer to examine the recordings of the intercepted telephone conversations under LAW of the ORG . The appellant is not right in claiming that under LAW only the prosecutor has the right to examine recorded conversations , because the court has that right also , and with the permission of these CARDINAL authorities ( and not only of the prosecutor ) , so also do the police . It is further obvious that in the case of a recording in a foreign language all of the above authorities have the right ( and even a duty ) to seek the assistance of a sworn translator . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed a bill of indictment with ORG against CARDINAL accused . The applicants were charged with putting into circulation DATE and DATE , jointly with GPE and GPE , a forged ORG cheque for CARDINAL ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) and attempting to use that cheque fraudulently . The prosecutor relied on LAW in conjunction with LAW and LAW . The first applicant was also charged with storing and transporting on DATE a forged ORG cheque for MONEY ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . CARDINAL accused were charged with acting in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . The warrant authorising the telephone tapping and the transcript of the intercepted conversations was deposited in the classified section of the case file . On DATE the ORG counsel requested that ORG be served with a copy of the warrant . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel repeated his request and argued that the decision should not be treated as classified .", "CARDINAL . The trial began on an unspecified date in DATE . At a hearing held on DATE ORG refused to serve a copy of the warrant of DATE on the ORG counsel . It found that the warrant had been classified under LAW and that the circumstances justifying that decision had not ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the trial court decided that the case against the first applicant should be severed from the main proceedings . It further stayed the proceedings against him having regard to his poor medical condition .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE CARDINAL the prosecutor requested the trial court to rule that the transcript of the intercepted telephone conversations be adduced in evidence but remain confidential . At an earlier hearing on DATE , counsel for the second applicant had requested that the confidential evidence be declassified . On DATE the trial court declassified the warrant of DATE and the transcript of the intercepted conversations . That decision was necessary in order to enable the lay members of the trial court , who did not have the relevant security clearance , to hear the evidence obtained under the warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the second applicant objected to the prosecutor \u2019s request , arguing that the evidence obtained as a result of the telephone tapping was inadmissible in law . He relied on similar arguments to those made in his appeal against ORG decision of DATE . In particular , he claimed that the impugned decision had authorised the interception of telephone conversations in respect of an offence which was not included in the list of offences set out in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s representative further considered that his arguments were not undermined by ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE dismissing his appeal . ORG had justified the decision authorising the interception of the telephone conversations by the fact that the applicants were persons suspected of acting in an organised criminal group , and had relied on a passage from ORG decision of DATE ( \u201c the content [ of those conversations ] may concern the activities of an organised group involved in the putting into circulation ... \u201d ) . However , the counsel underlined that the impugned passage was nowhere to be found in the decision of ORG .", "Only if ORG assertion that the telephone tapping had been carried out in connection with the activities of an organised criminal group was DATE and there was no indication in the decision to open the inquiry or in the bill of indictment that that was the case DATE would ORG have been competent to order such a measure . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s representative argued that the trial court was not bound by any earlier decision pronounced with regard to the admissibility of evidence .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the trial court dismissed the applicants\u2019 challenge to the admissibility of the impugned evidence . It found that ORG had not indicated in the operative part of its decision the precise subparagraph of the provision listing the offences under which the interception of conversations could be authorised . However , in the reasons for its decision ORG had justified the order for the interception on the ground that some of the suspected persons were cooperating with a view to defrauding considerable sums of money . In addition , ORG had held in its decision that the content of the conversations could relate to the activities of an organised criminal group . In consequence , it could not be sustained that the evidence obtained under the warrant was inadmissible in law .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the trial court heard the intercepted telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its judgment . The second applicant and GPE were convicted of putting into circulation a forged ORG cheque for CARDINAL ( the equivalent of ORG ) , and of attempted fraudulent use of that cheque . They were sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged an appeal against the first - instance judgment . He alleged , inter alia , that the trial court had not properly reasoned its judgment . In particular , he pointed to the fact that the trial court had heard the evidence obtained as a result of the telephone tapping but had failed to refer to it in the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the firstinstance judgment in respect of the second applicant and upheld it for the remainder . It held that the second applicant \u2019s appeal was partly justified ; however none of the alleged breaches of the criminal procedure was confirmed . ORG agreed with the appellant that he could not be considered to have been an accomplice in the putting into circulation of the forged cheque . It held instead that the second applicant was guilty of aiding and abetting ORG in putting into circulation a forged ORG cheque , and fraudulent use of that cheque . Accordingly , it sentenced him to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the intercepted telephone conversations and the fact that the trial court had not relied on them as the basis for establishing the facts of the case , ORG agreed with the lower court that that evidence was not relevant to the case . ORG noted that the lack of any reference to the evidence amounted to a breach of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ; however , this shortcoming had no effect on the validity of the first - instance judgment or the possibility of having it properly reviewed .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged a cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded . In such a case ORG was not required to provide written reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the death of the first applicant , ORG discontinued the proceedings against him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided :", "\u201c Following the institution of proceedings , a court , acting at the request of a prosecutor , may order the interception and recording of telephone conversations with a view to obtaining evidence for pending proceedings or preventing the commission of a new offence . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG provided at the relevant time , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c The interception and recording of telephone conversations is permitted only when the pending proceedings , or reasonable suspicion of a new offence being committed , concern :", "CARDINAL/ manslaughter ,", "...", "CARDINAL/ the counterfeiting of money ,", "...", "CARDINAL an organised criminal group ,", "CARDINAL property of considerable value ,", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read :", "\u201c The interception and recording of telephone conversations is permitted in respect of a suspected person ( osoba podejrzana ) , an accused ( oskar\u017cony ) , a victim or other person whom an accused may contact , or a person who may be connected with a perpetrator or with an impending offence . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided :", "\u201c A court or a prosecutor has the right to play the recordings , and in cases of urgency so also do the police , with the authorisation of a court or a prosecutor . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
