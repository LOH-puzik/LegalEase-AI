The first applicant divorced the second applicant \u2019s father on DATE by means of a court - approved divorce agreement . According to the agreement , she was to exercise parental rights and the father had contact rights , the use of the family dwelling and was obliged to pay MONEY ( ORG ) DATE in child support . The child was to live with her mother , and her father could see her on DATE , for DATE during DATE , and for DATE during DATE . The agreement did not make reference to a specific address , or even a town or a city where the first applicant was supposed to live with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a request by the child \u2019s father for a change in the contact regime between him and his daughter , the first instance civil court approved another agreement between the parents , which extended the duration of the father \u2019s weekend contact by TIME . The parents also agreed that the father would collect the child from her mother \u2019s home in GPE , GPE , and would take her back to the same location ; the father could spend his time with the child at CARDINAL of CARDINAL specific addresses in GPE , located in GPE and Srednogorovo respectively . If the mother changed her address , she had to inform the father by registered mail within DATE of such a change .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant brought a claim under LAW DATE LAW before ORG , seeking the court \u2019s authorisation for the child to leave the country in the absence of her father \u2019s agreement . She submitted that she was in a committed relationship with a NORP man who lived in GPE , where he worked as a ship engineer . They intended to marry and she wished to settle in GPE , and live with him and her daughter . Notwithstanding the above , the first applicant specified that , in the event that the court did not grant her application for permission for the child to travel , she would remain in GPE to care for her as a responsible parent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s claim for the child \u2019s unrestricted travel abroad with only her mother , finding that it could not be in the child \u2019s interests . More specifically , the reasons given were that the mother could not show that she had a fixed place of residence abroad , or a secure income with which to ensure her daughter \u2019s well - being , and that the child \u2019s absence from GPE would pose an obstacle to the father \u2019s exercise of his contact rights .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the refusal to ORG . She claimed that the father showed no interest in the child and did not pay any child support . His refusal to allow the child to leave the country for any period of time prevented her from taking her on holiday abroad and residing in GPE in GPE , where she had a fianc\u00e9 and could provide her daughter with better material conditions . She and her partner intended to marry DATE , but her child \u2019s inability to leave the country with her would make this impossible .", "CARDINAL . ORG allowed her appeal on DATE . It held that she had the necessary parenting qualities , including the ability to create an emotionally comforting environment for the child and provide her with financial support . That had been decided at the time she had been granted custody of her daughter , and had not been either challenged or refuted subsequently . The first applicant \u2019s parental abilities and the care she provided to her daughter would not change as a result of her crossing the national border . In view of the strained relationship between the CARDINAL parents , the court considered that permission for the child to travel abroad with only her mother should be granted for the whole of the child \u2019s infancy , that is , until she reached majority . The court also held that the change in the mother \u2019s circumstances constituted grounds for changing the contact regime between father and child , but did not adjudicate on that matter .", "CARDINAL . Following a cassation appeal by the father , in DATE ORG suspended enforcement of the second - instance court \u2019s judgment while the issue was pending before it . On DATE , in a final judgment , it refused to allow the second applicant to travel abroad in the absence of her father \u2019s agreement .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court first observed that there was conflicting domestic jurisprudence on the question of granting unlimited permission for a minor \u2019s travel abroad in the absence of both GPE agreement . Some courts ( including the second instance one in the present case ) found that when a parent who had been granted custody ( \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 ) had the necessary parental skills , such permission could not be refused . Other courts considered that when a parental consensus was missing , granting permission for unlimited travel abroad was only going to cause further disturbance and resentment in the relationship between the parents , which was likely to result in additional disputes between them , and this was not in the interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . Examining the present case , the court relied in particular on its wellestablished and binding case - law , according to which permission for a child \u2019s unrestricted travel abroad with CARDINAL parent only could not be granted because , as a matter of principle , that could never be in the best interests of the child . More specifically , there was a risk that a parent applying for such permission could take the child to countries which were in a state of war or where there was a high risk of natural disasters , thus endangering the child \u2019s well - being and depriving the ORG of the opportunity to ensure his or her protection . Also , if the parent took the child to a country which was not a member of ORG , or with which GPE had no reciprocal agreement regarding legal assistance , the authorities would not be able to ensure that the contact rights of the other parent were enforced .", "CARDINAL . The court held that permission to travel abroad with CARDINAL parent could be granted only in respect of fixed destinations and for a limited period of time , and when this was in the interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the specific case , the court held that the first applicant had not presented any guarantees as to where the child would be taken or how the father \u2019s contact rights would be exercised . Importantly , the first applicant had not sought in court a change in the regime for contact between the child and the father with a view to her and the child moving their primary place of residence to GPE . In any event , the first applicant had presented in the proceedings before the court only her personal assertions in respect of her future in GPE , but no evidence to demonstrate the facts she claimed . She purported that she would get married ; however , this was an uncertain future occurrence which did not depend solely on her will . The situation would have been entirely different , if she had been married and had settled in good material conditions in another country . In such a case , the question of whether it would be in the child \u2019s interest to join her mother abroad would be open for discussion . However , as this was not the case , in view of the young age of the child , the court found that it was not in her interest for her mother to be granted permission to take her abroad at any time , for an unlimited duration and to unknown destinations throughout the period before the child reached majority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a little over a year after the final judgment of ORG on the issue of the child \u2019s travel , the first applicant and her partner , who was still living in the GPE , married in GPE . DATE , on DATE , the second applicant \u2019s father had explicitly agreed to her leaving the country with her mother . He signed an initial declaration for the period DATE and DATE , and has apparently been signing such declarations authorising DATE periods ever since . As a result , the applicants have been able to travel to , live and study in GPE , where they were at the time of their last correspondence with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Since leaving GPE in DATE , the child has been in regular contact with her father over the phone and ORG , and has spent time with him every summer ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
