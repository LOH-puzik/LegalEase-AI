In accordance with the immigration rules in force at the material time , Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON were refused permission to remain with or join them in that country as their husbands .

They further alleged that , contrary to LAW ) , no effective domestic remedy existed for the aforesaid claims .", "CARDINAL . The evolution of immigration controls in GPE has to be seen in the light of the history of GPE and the corresponding developments in nationality laws . Originally all persons born within or having a specified connection with GPE or the dominions owed allegiance to the ORG and were NORP subjects . A common NORP nationality was , however , difficult to reconcile with the independence of the self - governing countries of the ORG into which the ORG was transformed . As the various territories concerned became independent , they introduced their own citizenship laws but , for the purposes of GPE law , persons having the citizenship of an independent ORG country retained a special status , known as \" NORP subject \" or \" GPE citizen \" ( these terms being synonymous ) . This status was also held by \" citizens of GPE . Prior to DATE , the latter citizenship was , briefly , acquired by birth within GPE or one of its remaining dependencies , by descent from a father having that citizenship , by naturalisation or by registration ( NORP Nationality Act DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Whereas aliens have been subject to continuing strict immigration controls over a long period , the same is not true of ORG citizens . Until DATE , the latter , irrespective of their local citizenship , all had freedom to enter GPE for work and permanent residence , without any restriction . A rapid rise in the influx of immigrants , especially in DATE , and the consequent danger of the rate of immigration exceeding the country 's capacity to absorb them led to a radical change in this situation . LAW DATE , and then LAW DATE , restricted the right of entry of , and imposed immigration controls on , certain classes of GPE citizens , including citizens of GPE , who did not have close links to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The existing immigration laws were amended and replaced by LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , which came into force on DATE . CARDINAL of its main purposes was to assimilate immigration controls over incoming ORG citizens having no close links to GPE to the corresponding rules for aliens . The LAW created CARDINAL new categories of persons for immigration purposes , namely those having the right of abode in GPE ( \" patrials \" ) and those not having that right ( \" non - patrials \" ) .", "CARDINAL . \" GPE \" were to be free from immigration controls . The status of \" patrial \" was intended to designate ORG citizens who \" belonged \" to GPE and , in summary , was conferred ( by LAW ) on :", "( a ) citizens of GPE who had acquired that citizenship by birth , adoption , naturalisation or registration in GPE ( that is , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , or were the children or grandchildren of any such persons ;", "( b ) citizens of GPE who had at any time been settled in GPE for DATE ;", "( c ) other ORG citizens who were the children of a person having citizenship of GPE by virtue of birth in GPE ;", "( d ) women , being ORG citizens , who were or had been married to a man falling within any of the preceding categories .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ) of LAW , \" non - patrials \" ( whether ORG citizens or aliens ) \" may live , work and settle in GPE by permission and subject to such regulation and control of their entry into , stay in and departure from GPE as is imposed \" by LAW .", "Subject to certain exceptions not relevant to the present case , a \" non - patrial \" shall not enter the GPE unless given leave to do so ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . He may be given such leave ( or , if he is already in the country , leave to remain ) either for a limited or for an indefinite period ; in the former case , the leave may be subject to conditions restricting employment or requiring registration with the police or both ( ibid . ) . Where limited leave to enter or remain is granted , it may subsequently be varied , either as regards its duration or the conditions attaching thereto but , if the limit on duration is removed , any conditions attached to the leave cease to apply ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The power to give or refuse leave to enter is exercised by immigration officers but the power to give or vary leave to remain can be exercised only by the ORG Secretary ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the Home Secretary is obliged from time to time to lay before ORG statements of the rules , or of any changes therein , laid down by him as to the practice to be followed in the administration of the LAW for regulating entry into and stay in GPE . These rules contain instructions to immigration officers as to how they shall exercise the statutory discretions given to them by the LAW and statements of the manner in which the ORG Secretary will exercise his own powers of control after entry . The rules are required to provide for the admission of persons coming for the purpose of taking employment , or for the purposes of study , or as visitors , or as dependants of persons lawfully in or entering GPE , but uniform provision does not have to be made for these categories and , in particular , account may be taken of citizenship or nationality ( sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Thus , different rules can be and are made for nationals of the member LAW under Community law , and NORP citizens are in a special position .", "CARDINAL . The rules are subject to a negative resolution procedure whereby , if a resolution disapproving the Home Secretary 's statement is passed by either ORG of ORG within DATE of its being laid , he is required as soon as may be to make such changes as appear to him to be required in the circumstances and to lay the rules as amended before ORG within DATE of the passing of the resolution ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The statement of rules thus amended is subject to the same procedure as the original statement . Because of the continuous nature of decision - making by immigration officers , the statement originally laid is not abrogated by any negative resolution ; it will come into operation when made or on the date therein provided and will remain in force until replaced .", "CARDINAL . The exact legal status of the rules is of some complexity . This question was considered by ORG in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL , when Lord ORG said :", "\" [ The Home Secretary 's rules ] are not rules of law . They are rules of practice laid down for the guidance of immigration officers and tribunals who are entrusted with the administration of the [ DATE Act ] . They can be , and often are , prayed in aid by applicants before the courts in immigration cases . To some extent the courts must have regard to them because there are provisions in the LAW itself , particularly in section DATE , which show that in appeals to an adjudicator , if the immigration rules have not been complied with , then the appeal is to be allowed . In addition the courts always have regard to those rules , not only in matters where there is a right of appeal ; but also in cases under prerogative writs where there is a question whether officers have acted fairly . But they are not rules in the nature of delegated legislation so as to amount to strict rules of law . \"", "Lord Justice PERSON also doubted whether the rules constituted delegated legislation . He observed : \" These rules are very difficult to categorise or classify . They are in a class of their own . They are certainly a practical guide for ... immigration officers .... Indeed they are , as to large parts , ... little more than explanatory notes of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] itself . \" However , he noted that if ORG disapproved of the rules , they were not thereby abrogated . Furthermore , at least as far as an adjudicator dealing with appeals was concerned , the rules had the force of law , although it seemed that they could be departed from with the consent of the applicant himself .", "Lord Justice PERSON said :", "\" [ The rules ] are a totally different kind of publication from the rules that usually come into being under the authority delegated to Ministers under Acts of ORG ; ... they are not in my view in any sense of themselves of legislative force . It is true that ... the rules are given legal effect in the field of the appellate process to the adjudicator or the tribunal .... But the legal effect that the rules have in that limited field flows not from the fact that they have been published by the Minister and laid before ORG , but because by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] the rules are given an effect which is in a certain field clearly legally enforceable , and that is a quite different matter . \"", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding that an application for entry clearance ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) below ) or leave to enter or remain may fall to be refused under the relevant immigration rules , the Home Secretary has a discretion , deriving from historic prerogative powers , to authorise in exceptional circumstances the grant of entry clearance or of leave to enter , or to allow a person to remain in GPE . Where the applicant is a husband seeking to join or remain with his wife settled in GPE , factors which the ORG Secretary will consider include the extent of her ties with that country and of the hardship she might suffer by going to live abroad , and any recommendations by the immigration appellate authorities ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . The rules in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case were contained in the \" Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules \" ( ORG CARDINAL ) , laid before ORG on DATE ( \" the DATE Rules \" ) ; they applied to all decisions taken on or after DATE , except those relating to applications made on or before DATE . A draft of the rules had previously been included in a ORG published in DATE .", "The DATE Rules , which in paragraph CARDINAL instructed immigration officers to carry out their duties without regard to the race , colour or religion of the intending entrant , detailed firstly the controls to be exercised on the entry into GPE of \" non - patrials \" and then those to be exercised after entry . The former depended on whether the individual concerned was coming for temporary purposes ( for example , visitors or students ) , for employment or business or as a person of independent means , or for settlement . As under the rules previously in force , visitors were normally to be prohibited from taking employment and persons wishing to come for employment were subject to strict regulations as to work permits . The work - permit requirements , however , did not apply to nationals of other member GPE of ORG nor to persons covered by the \" GPE ancestry rule \" ; under the latter rule , which had been in force since the DATE Act came into operation , a GPE citizen having a grandparent born in GPE and wishing to take or seek employment in GPE could obtain indefinite leave to enter even without a work permit . A further exception was to be found in the \" working holiday rule \" , whereby young GPE citizens could , without a permit , take employment incidental to an extended holiday being spent in GPE ; however , the period of their stay could , under LAW , not exceed DATE . All these exceptions have been maintained in subsequent immigration rules .", "CARDINAL . A particular feature of the changes introduced by the DATE Rules was the inclusion of a number of provisions directed towards implementing a policy of protecting the domestic labour market at a time of high unemployment by curtailing \" primary immigration \" , that is immigration by someone who could be expected to seek full - time work in order to support a family . In taking these measures , the Government were concerned also to advance public tranquillity and , by exercising firm and fair immigration control , to assist in securing good community relations .", "To these ends , among the changes effected was the introduction of stricter conditions for the grant of leave to a \" non - patrial \" husband or fianc\u00e9 seeking to join or remain with his wife or fianc\u00e9e settled in GPE . Previously , any such husband or fianc\u00e9 would normally have been allowed to settle after a qualifying period , provided that the primary purpose of the marriage was not to obtain settlement in that country . These new measures were not extended to the wives and fianc\u00e9es of settled men , a fact attributed by the Government to long - standing commitments ( based allegedly on humanitarian , social and ethical reasons ) to the reunification of the families of male immigrants . Nor did the new measures apply to nationals of other member GPE of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the DATE Rules - and of their successors - are summarised below in terms of the following expressions .", "( a ) A person is \" settled in GPE \" when he or she is ordinarily resident there without having entered or remained in breach of the immigration laws , and is free from any restriction on the period for which he or she may remain ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "( b ) An \" entry clearance \" ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) is a document ( either a visa , an entry certificate or a ORG letter of consent , depending on the nationality of the person concerned ) which is to be taken by an immigration officer as evidence that the holder , although a \" non - patrial \" , is eligible under the immigration rules for entry to GPE . It is obtained at NORP missions abroad or from ORG prior to arrival in GPE .", "( c ) A marriage or intended marriage is \" non - qualifying \" if there is reason to believe that :", "- its primary purpose is to obtain admission to or settlement in GPE ; or", "- the parties do not intend to live together permanently as man and wife ; or", "- the parties have not met ( paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "( d ) There is \" potential evasion of the rules \" if there is reason to believe that a husband has remained in GPE in breach of the immigration rules before the marriage , that the marriage has taken place after a decision or recommendation that he be deported or that the marriage has terminated ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "( e ) The \" financial requirement \" is a requirement that varies according to the circumstances of the particular case : basically it means that adequate maintenance and accommodation must be available to the person concerned without the need for recourse to public funds ( paragraphs DATE , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Where a \" non - patrial \" whose spouse or intended spouse was \" settled in GPE \" came to that country for settlement , he or she would be admitted for that purpose provided that he or she held a current \" entry clearance \" and unless the circumstances specified in paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Rules obtained ( for example , false representations , medical grounds , criminal record , exclusion would be conducive to the public good ) .", "( a ) Where the intending entrant was a husband or fianc\u00e9 , he could , under paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE , obtain an \" entry clearance \" :", "( i ) unless the marriage or intended marriage was \" non - qualifying \" ;", "( ii ) if his wife or fianc\u00e9e was a citizen of GPE who or one of whose parents had been born in GPE ; and", "( iii ) if , in the cases of fianc\u00e9s only , the \" financial requirement \" was satisfied .", "( b ) Where the intending entrant was a wife or fianc\u00e9e , she could , under DATE , DATE and DATE , obtain an \" entry clearance \" irrespective of the nationality of her husband or fianc\u00e9 or of his own or his parents ' place of birth . Here , there was no provision as to \" non - qualifying \" marriages , but the \" financial requirement \" had generally to be satisfied .", "( c ) Wives admitted under these rules would be given indefinite leave to enter ; husbands would be initially admitted for DATE and fianc\u00e9s or fianc\u00e9es for DATE , with the possibility , subject to certain safeguards , of applying subsequently to ORG for indefinite leave ( DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . \" Non - patrials \" already admitted to GPE in a temporary capacity who subsequently married a person \" settled in GPE \" could also obtain permission to stay .", "( a ) Where the \" non - patrial \" seeking permission was a man , the basic conditions ( paragraph CARDINAL ) were that :", "( i ) his wife was a citizen of GPE who or one of whose parents had been born in GPE ; and", "( ii ) the marriage was not \" non - qualifying \" and there was not \" potential evasion of the rules \" .", "( b ) Where the \" non - patrial \" seeking permission was a woman , she would normally be granted leave to remain on application ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) Leave to remain granted under these rules would be , for wives , indefinite and , for husbands , for an initial period of DATE with the possibility , subject again to the conditions referred to in sub - paragraph ( a ) ( ii ) above , of subsequent removal of the time - limit ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Decisions on applications for leave to remain were taken in the light of all relevant facts ; thus , even where the individual satisfied the formal requirements , permission would normally be refused if the circumstances specified in paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Rules obtained ( for example , false representations , non - compliance with the time - limit or conditions subject to which he or she had been admitted or given leave to remain , undesirable character , danger to national security ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL result of QUANTITY was that the right of abode in GPE became divorced from nationality : thus , a number of citizens of GPE did not have that right ( for example , because they had not been born in GPE ; see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) above ) , whereas it was enjoyed by a number of persons who were not such citizens ( for example , GPE citizens having an ancestral link with GPE ; see paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) above ) . With a view to bringing citizenship and immigration laws into line , the position was substantially amended by LAW DATE , which came into force on DATE . So far as is relevant for the present purposes , that Act :", "( a ) replaced citizenship of GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) with CARDINAL separate citizenships , \" NORP \" , \" British Dependent Territories \" and \" ORG \" ;", "( b ) provided , in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , that on DATE \" NORP citizenship \" was to be acquired by persons who were then citizens of GPE and had the right of abode in GPE under LAW ; this category could include a person who was neither born nor had a parent born in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) above ) ;", "( c ) laid down detailed provisions on the acquisition of NORP citizenship by persons born after DATE ;", "( d ) contained , in section CARDINAL and Schedule CARDINAL , detailed provisions on naturalisation as a NORP citizen on the basis of residence in GPE , the grant of a certificate of naturalisation being at the discretion of the Home Secretary ;", "( e ) amended LAW by providing in section CARDINAL that the right of abode in GPE - use of the expressions \" patrial \" and \" non - patrial \" was abandoned - and the consequential freedom from immigration controls were in future to be enjoyed only by NORP citizens and by such ORG citizens as on DATE had the right of abode under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after debates in ORG and ORG , the ORG Secretary laid before ORG a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules ( ORG CARDINAL ; \" the DATE Rules \" ) , intended to harmonise the immigration rules with LAW DATE and expressed to come into force on DATE . However , on DATE ORG passed a resolution disapproving the Statement , some Members finding the changes too lax and others , insufficient . Since by DATE no further changes had been laid before ORG , the DATE Rules came into force on that date , notwithstanding the negative resolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Rules made no changes to the regime governing wives and fianc\u00e9es , described in paragraphs CARDINAL above . The regime governing a husband or fianc\u00e9 was modified in the following main respects .", "( a ) The requirement that , for him to be eligible for leave to enter or remain , his wife or fianc\u00e9e had to be a citizen of GPE born or having a parent born in GPE was , under paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL , replaced by a requirement that she be a NORP citizen . The place of her own or her parents ' birth ceased to be material since NORP citizens could include persons without the territorial birth link ( for example , a woman born in a former ORG but having the right of abode in GPE by virtue of long residence there ; see paragraphs CARDINAL ( b ) and CARDINAL ( b ) above ) .", "( b ) By virtue of CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL , the onus of proof was reversed , so that it became for the man seeking leave to enter or remain to show that the marriage was not \" non - qualifying \" or , in cases to which paragraph CARDINAL applied , that there was not \" potential evasion of the rules \" .", "( c ) Leave to remain for settlement following marriage , granted to a man admitted in a temporary capacity ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) above ) , would be for an initial period of DATE , followed by a further period of DATE and then by the possibility , subject again to the conditions referred to in sub - paragraph ( b ) above , of subsequent removal of the time - limit ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . No provision was made in the DATE Rules for women settled in GPE who were not NORP citizens to be joined by their husbands , although leave could be granted by the ORG Secretary in the exercise of his extra - statutory discretion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . These women could also apply for naturalisation as NORP citizens on the basis of residence , under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a further Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules ( ORG CARDINAL ; \" the DATE Rules \" ) was laid before ORG . A motion disapproving these rules was defeated in ORG and they came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Rules again did not modify the regime governing wives and fianc\u00e9es .

Any party to an appeal to an adjudicator may appeal against his decision to ORG , which may affirm that decision or make any other decision which the adjudicator could have made ; it also has similar duties and powers in the matter of directions and recommendations .

( a ) The Government estimated total immigration into GPE from GPE ( that is , the ORG except GPE , GPE and GPE ) at CARDINAL in the period from DATE to DATE .

In DATE , MONEY of \" economically active \" men and MONEY of \" economically active \" women were unemployed , as measured by official figures based on persons claiming unemployment benefit . There was a marked increase DATE , when the figures rose from PERCENT MONEY and from CARDINAL to MONEY , respectively .", "( e ) The Government also produced to the ORG detailed statistics in support of their claim that the overall effect of the DATE Rules had been to lead to an DATE reduction of CARDINAL ( rather than CARDINAL , as they had estimated before the Commission ) in the number of husbands either accepted for settlement or applying successfully to come for settlement from all parts of the world . They recognised , however , that part - though not a major part - of this figure might represent a decrease attributable to economic conditions . In their submission , this reduction was of a considerable scale when viewed in relation to the figures for the total number of persons accepted for settlement into GPE . The latter figures ( CARDINAL of which were in DATE accounted for by wives and children of men already settled in the country ) were : over CARDINAL in DATE and in DATE ; CARDINAL in DATE ; CARDINAL in DATE ; CARDINAL in DATE ; and CARDINAL in DATE .

Her parents were born and live in the GPE .", "This applicant went to GPE in DATE with a work permit for employment as a nursing assistant and was admitted , as a \" non - patrial \" ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , for DATE . She remained in approved work thereafter and , on DATE , the conditions attached to her stay were removed and she was allowed to remain in GPE indefinitely . She is now employed , and has an established career , as a ORG - enrolled nurse .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON is a citizen of the GPE , born in that country in DATE . He met the applicant in GPE in DATE when she was on holiday and again in DATE when she was there for DATE . During the latter period , the couple became engaged . On DATE , they went through a ceremony of marriage in the GPE . The applicant returned to GPE shortly afterwards to take up her job again . In DATE , she informed ORG of the marriage and applied for leave for Mr. PERSON to enter GPE , a request which she repeated in DATE . On DATE , he , being a \" non - patrial \" , applied to ORG in GPE for a visa to join his wife for settlement in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After Mrs. PERSON had supplied certain further information requested by it , ORG wrote to her on DATE to advise her that the visa application had been refused on the ground that she was not a citizen of GPE who , or one of whose parents , had been born in GPE ( paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Rules ; see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) ( ii ) above ) . Notice of the decision was not handed to Mr. PERSON until DATE as he had failed to respond to an invitation of DATE to attend at ORG for that purpose .", "On DATE , ORG for ORG wrote to ORG , seeking a review of this decision . However , on DATE , the ORG , having considered the circumstances , informed the ORG of its decision to maintain the refusal . Mr. PERSON had on DATE lodged an appeal with an adjudicator ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) against the decision but the appeal was dismissed on DATE on the ground that the visa officer 's decision was in accordance with the law and the immigration rules . The adjudicator , who noted that Mrs. PERSON had not taken legal advice but had thought at the time of the marriage ceremony that a forthcoming change in the law would allow Mr. PERSON to be admitted , expressed the hope that the authorities would look at the case sympathetically . This was not initially recognised by the authorities as a recommendation , but the ORG Secretary subsequently concluded that there were not sufficient grounds for acting outside the immigration rules . There is no record of an application for leave to appeal to ORG . Representations to ORG were also rejected , basically on the ground that the couple could live together in the GPE and that there were not sufficient reasons for the ORG Secretary to exercise his extra - statutory discretion .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , Mr. PERSON continued to live in the GPE and the couple were separated , apart from a short period in DATE when Mrs. PERSON visited that country . However , following an application made by her in DATE under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) above ) , Mrs. PERSON obtained naturalisation as a NORP citizen with effect from DATE ; she thereby lost her NORP citizenship . On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied for entry clearance for permanent settlement as the husband of a NORP citizen , under paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Rules ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . For the reasons and in the circumstances indicated in the following paragraph , this application was refused on DATE but , on DATE , Mr. PERSON applied for and was granted a visa entitling him to enter GPE for DATE for the purposes of marriage . He arrived in that country on DATE and the parties were married there on DATE . On DATE , he was granted leave to remain as a husband for DATE ; on the expiry of that period , he will be eligible to apply for indefinite leave .", "CARDINAL . In a memorial filed with ORG on DATE , the ORG questioned the validity of the DATE marriage ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Philippine Civil Code , a marriage solemnised without a licence was to be considered void , save in the case of a \" marriage of exceptional character \" , that is CARDINAL between persons who have lived together as husband and wife for DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) . The ORG marriage contract recited that the ceremony the couple went through in DATE had been performed , without a licence , under LAW . The parties had stated in a contemporaneous affidavit that they had previously cohabited for DATE , but according to Mrs. PERSON ' version of the facts this could not be so since she had not met Mr. PERSON until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the Government , the requirements of LAW were therefore not satisfied and the marriage thus had to be considered void .", "At the hearings on DATE , the applicant 's counsel expressed the view that , assuming a defect existed , it was purely formal and the status of Mr. and Mrs. PERSON could be regarded as akin to that of the parties to a common - law marriage . Her representative subsequently filed with the ORG details of the advice he had received from NORP lawyers , to the effect that under the law of that country the marriage was to be presumed valid unless and until it was declared void by a court . The Government replied that they had been advised that the marriage was void ab initio and that no judicial decree was necessary to establish its invalidity . This opinion was contradicted in further advice obtained on behalf of Mrs. PERSON .", "Mr. and Mrs. PERSON were interviewed by the GPE authorities in DATE and DATE . They adduced no evidence to alter the ORG 's conclusion that the marriage was void . However , Mrs. PERSON stated that if Mr. PERSON were admitted to GPE , the couple would go through a ceremony of marriage in that country . It was in these circumstances that in DATE Mr. PERSON was refused leave to settle as a husband but was regarded as eligible , under the DATE Rules , for leave to enter GPE temporarily as the fianc\u00e9 of a NORP citizen .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG and the ORG , Mrs. PERSON submitted that there would have been real obstacles to her returning to live in the GPE : she was too old , her qualifications were not recognised there and , by working in GPE , she was able to support financially her parents and other members of her family . These claims were contested by the Government , in particular on the ground that it was unrealistic to suppose that her nursing skills could not be put to good use in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mrs. PERSON is permanently and lawfully resident in GPE with the right to remain indefinitely . She was born in GPE in DATE or DATE . Her parents were born and live in that country .", "This applicant first went to GPE in DATE and was given leave , as a \" non - patrial \" ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) , to enter as a visitor for DATE . Subsequently , she obtained several further leaves to remain , as a visitor or a student , the last being until DATE . She has a high level of university education . In DATE , she married a Mr. PERSON , a citizen of GPE , and , DATE , was given indefinite leave to remain in GPE , by virtue of her marriage , under the provisions then in force . On DATE , again by virtue of her marriage , she obtained registration as a citizen of GPE under LAW DATE , as a result of which she became a \" patrial \" ( see paragraphs CARDINAL in fine and CARDINAL ( a ) above ) . At that time , she was already separated from Mr. PERSON and the marriage was dissolved in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON is a NORP national born in GPE on DATE . In DATE , he was granted leave , as a \" non - patrial \" , to enter GPE , apparently as a visitor , for DATE . Subsequently , he obtained leave to remain as a student until DATE . His application of DATE for an extension of this leave was refused on DATE because he had not attended his course of studies and the ORG Secretary was not satisfied that he was a genuine student who intended to leave the country on their conclusion . Since his application for an extension had been made after his leave had expired , he had no right of appeal under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; he was advised to leave GPE and warned of the risk of criminal or deportation proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) if he did not .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant had been living with Mr. PERSON . In DATE they had a son , who has the right of abode in GPE . On DATE , an application was made by ORG for ORG for leave for Mr. PERSON to remain in GPE until he married his fianc\u00e9e , the applicant . They were interviewed together by ORG officials on DATE and produced evidence of their marriage , which had been celebrated in DATE . The application was therefore treated as one to remain as the husband of a woman settled in GPE .", "Leave was refused on DATE on the ground that Mrs. PERSON was not a citizen of GPE who , or one of whose parents , had been born in GPE ( paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Rules ; see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) ( i ) above ) . There was no right of appeal against this decision as Mr. PERSON had no current leave to remain at the time when his application was made ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Representations through a Member of ORG to ORG were rejected , basically on the ground that the couple could live together in GPE and that there were not sufficient compelling compassionate circumstances to warrant exceptional treatment outside the immigration rules . In a letter of DATE to the Member , the Minister of State at ORG wrote that \" Mr. PERSON should now make arrangements to leave GPE forthwith , otherwise arrangements will be made to enforce his departure \" ; however , a letter of DATE to the Member stated that \" [ the Minister did ] not propose for the time being to take any action against [ Mr. LANGUAGE ] \" . In fact , the authorities did not at any time institute criminal or deportation proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) against him ; their decision , according to the Government , was taken in the light of all the circumstances , including the ORG 's decision on the admissibility of Mrs. PERSON 's application ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as the husband of a NORP citizen , Mr. PERSON was given DATE leave to remain in GPE in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) above ) ; this was possible because , on DATE , Mrs. PERSON had automatically acquired NORP citizenship by virtue of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) above ) . Mr. PERSON subsequently applied for indefinite leave to remain and this was granted on DATE under paragraph CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Rules ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE , he was working in the catering business and planned shortly to open a restaurant ; his wife was working DATE a week in a creche .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG and the ORG , Mrs. PERSON submitted that there would have been real obstacles to her going with her husband to live in GPE : she cited her strong ties to GPE and alleged that as an educated woman and the mother of an illegitimate child she would have been treated as a social outcast in GPE . The Government maintain that there were no real obstacles ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
