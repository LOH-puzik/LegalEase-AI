NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr I. \u017duri\u0107 , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was employed as a salesman ( manager for key buyers ) in company I. ( hereinafter : the \u201c company \u201d ) on an indefinite contract . The contract of employment conditioned his confirmation in the post by a successful DATE probationary period .", "CARDINAL . By the company \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s employment was terminated on the grounds that he had failed to satisfy the requirements of the post . He was given CARDINAL days\u2019 notice .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected to the decision terminating his employment arguing , inter alia , that it was incorrect that he had failed to satisfy the requirements of the post and that the real reason for the cancellation of the employment contract had been the overall financial austerity within the company .", "CARDINAL . The company maintained its position reiterating the reasons for its decision to terminate the applicant \u2019s employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil action in ORG ( Op\u0107inski gra\u0111anski sud u GPE ) challenging the company \u2019s decision . He argued that he had duly complied with all relevant requirements of the post and that the real reason for the cancellation of his employment contract had been the overall financial austerity within the company . Accordingly , he contended that since the reason for the cancellation of his employment contract had not been the CARDINAL cited by the company , namely his inadequate professional performance , but the economic reasons related to the company \u2019s business performance , the termination of his employment had been unlawful . The applicant requested that the relevant documents concerning his employment contract be admitted into evidence and that CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , be questioned in court .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings ORG questioned several witnesses , including PERSON and PERSON , and examined the relevant documents submitted by the parties . Throughout the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer who actively participated in the questioning of witnesses and examination of evidence at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil action . It set out the scope of the case before it in the following manner :", "\u201c The cancellation of an employment contract conditioned by a probationary period should be assessed under the legal provisions concerning regular or extraordinary [ dismissal ] , that is to say , in the concrete case , under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) of LAW . This provision provides that an employer can cancel the employment contract in case of a justified reason . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW the burden of proof of the existence of a justified reason is on the employer .", "...", "In these circumstances the defendant is required , under LAW in conjunction with section QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , to prove the existence of the justified reason for a dismissal related to the [ worker \u2019s ] personal circumstances , that is to say [ to prove ] that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of the post of a manager for key buyers . The objection of the plaintiff that his dismissal was based on some other reasons , namely economic , is irrelevant since the plaintiff is not in a position to demonstrate the existence of reasons which were not cited as the reasons for dismissal . This court therefore dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s request for obtaining of the information from the [ ORG ] about the number of workers in the [ company ] in the period DATE , as well as the information from the [ competent tax authority ] concerning the financial reports about the defendant \u2019s business performance in DATE , as well as the information about the workers who were dismissed [ from the company ] in that period . This is because this court finds such information irrelevant given that the grounds for dismissal were not the economic reasons . It is not for the plaintiff to demonstrate [ the existence of these reasons ] but the burden of proof is on the defendant who is required to show the existence of the reasons cited in its decision on dismissal as that is the subject matter of this dispute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that it followed from the statements of several witnesses and the relevant evidence adduced during the proceedings that the applicant had failed to meet the requirements of the post and that therefore his dismissal by the company had been justified and lawful . ORG in particular stressed :", "\u201c In the case at issue the dismissal was based on the grounds that \u201c the worker failed to meet the requirements of the post \u201d ; that is therefore a dismissal related to the worker \u2019s personal circumstances . ...", "The court \u2019s assessment whether the justified reasons for such a dismissal existed is based on the assumption that the communication skills , teamwork and personal initiative are the relevant characteristics and skills for the position of a manager for key buyers , and the plaintiff failed to demonstrate those characteristics and skills . As already stated above , the purpose of the probationary period is to allow the employer to verify the working skills of the worker , and the worker thereby assumes a certain risk which he or she must be aware of when concluding such a contract of employment . It should be also noted that the employer independently decides which characteristics and skills of a worker are relevant for a particular post , that is to say which are the characteristics and skills that [ the employer ] requires , given that [ the employer ] is independent in organising and managing its business . In these circumstances , and in view of the evidence adduced during the proceedings , this court finds that the plaintiff was given an opportunity to demonstrate his skills , given that he was invited to the meetings , he had free access to everything and everybody in the company and essentially free space to demonstrate his skills . However , he failed to show that he possessed the required characteristics and skills , which this court found established from the cited witness statements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) arguing , inter alia , that , given the scope of the case set out by ORG , he had not been given an opportunity to challenge the real reasons for his dismissal which had been , in his view , related to the company \u2019s business performance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . With regard to the applicant \u2019s specific arguments , and in view of the evidence adduced during the proceedings before the first - instance court , ORG noted :", "\u201c In view of these findings , the first - instance court correctly examined the lawfulness of the impugned decision [ on dismissal ] under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) of LAW . In such a case , under LAW of the same LAW , the burden of proof for the justification of the decision [ on dismissal ] is on the defendant . The plaintiff argued that the reasons for the dismissal were false and fabricated and that the real reasons for the termination of his employment contract had been of the economic nature , whereas he had professionally , diligently and correctly performed the assignments of his post .", "...", "Given the [ relevant ] factual findings , it undoubtedly follows that the reasons for the impugned dismissal are truthful and justified and that the objection of the plaintiff that these reasons are not real is unsupported by evidence and unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant further lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) reiterating his previous arguments that he had not been able to demonstrate the real reasons for his dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded , upholding the decisions of the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) reiterating his arguments adduced before the lower courts .", "CARDINAL .
