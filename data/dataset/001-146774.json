Under several agreements between the company and the town administration , including CARDINAL dated DATE , the company undertook to provide transport services to certain sections of the population free of charge , and the town administration was to reimburse it for the expenses incurred out of the budget allocated for that purpose by ORG of GPE or the federal budget . According to a letter from ORG of Petrozavodsk dated DATE , at some point the respective budgets accumulated a considerable debt towards the company owing to a shortage of funds .

First , it had failed to reimburse the expenses the company had incurred for providing transport services , as stipulated by the respective agreements ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

On DATE ORG of LOC heard the parties , including the applicant , the district administration representative and the head of the liquidated company who was , at the time of the events , employed as the director of ORG \u201c ORG \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and granted the applicant \u2019s claims in part . The court reiterated that the debtor company had been set up by the district administration , which , as its owner , had been entitled to decide on its restructuring and liquidation under LAW . The owner could not be held liable for the insolvent company \u2019s debts unless the insolvency had been caused by the owner \u2019s actions . The court established that as a result of the administration \u2019s tariff - setting policy ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the company had been put in a pre - insolvency situation . Furthermore , the court emphasized that the district administration had withdrawn all assets from the company except for its authorized capital , which resulted in the company \u2019s inability to continue its activity in accordance with the goals and objectives assigned to it . With reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON and NORP v. GPE , no . DATE ; and PERSON GPE , no . GPE , DATE ) ORG found that the administration had subsidiary liability for the insolvent company \u2019s debts , ordered that the judgment debt be recovered from the district administration at the expense of the district treasury and rejected the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claims . In particular , the court found that the newly created company was not liable for the debts of the applicant \u2019s employer since they had not been transferred to it in the spin - off procedure .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a fresh examination . The regional court found that it was for the applicant to demonstrate that the insolvency had actually been caused by the owner \u2019s actions . However , he had failed to do so . Turning to the tariff - setting issue ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the regional court noted that under the domestic law the owner was not obliged to finance the company directly . The regional court further considered that the assets had not actually been withdrawn from the company which employed the applicant , but that the company itself had transferred them to the newly created company on the spin - off balance sheet after the restructuring . There was nothing in the case to suggest that the lawfulness of the transfer of the assets had at any point been challenged in court . Furthermore , NORP employment law had not contained any provisions on the subsidiary liability of owners for the debts of municipal unitary enterprises . On the other hand , the first - instance court had failed to examine the issue of ORG \u201c MTS\u201d\u2018s liability for the debts of the restructured company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . The court found that , as a result of the withdrawal of all assets from ORG \u201c FAC \u201d , the latter had become unable to continue its activities , which indeed constituted a reason for its insolvency . However , the court went on to find that", "\u201c ... the insolvency occurred through no fault of the owner , since they [ sic ] had been bound by the federal law . Therefore , CARDINAL of the criteria for the application of subsidiary liability , namely , fault on the part of the owner , is missing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant \u2019s claims for compensation for delayed enforcement were concerned , the court noted , in addition , that he had failed to raise that issue before the main debtor , that is , the employer company , and was therefore prevented from making such claims in the subsidiary liability proceedings . Lastly , the claims lodged against the newly created company could not be granted since the debt in respect of the salary arrears had not been transferred to it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the liquidator had not been heard by the first - instance court and the documents on the debtor company \u2019s remaining assets had not been available to him .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s findings of CARDINAL DATE on appeal . The regional court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument regarding the unavailability of the company \u2019s documents as irrelevant , having noted that the claimant had to demonstrate that the insolvency had been caused by the owner \u2019s actions and not by the company \u2019s own management \u201c and , in any event , not vice versa \u201d .
