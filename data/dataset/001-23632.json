Thereafter the applicant successfully challenged the former presiding judge for bias .", "Subsequently , ORG objected to the validity of the powers of attorney submitted by the applicant and excluded him from representing his clients in the further proceedings . On the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG ( ORG ) quashed the decisions by ORG given in this respect and confirmed the validity of the applicant \u2019s mandate .", "On another occasion , in reply to a question of the president of ORG how to proceed with the numerous cases brought by the applicant , judge NORP declared at a meeting of the judges of ORG held on CARDINAL DATE that , as a matter of course , these cases would be disposed of and sent to GPE .", "On CARDINAL and DATE , following various procedural requests and challenges for bias filed by the applicant , ORG refused to accept the applicant as representative acting on behalf of his clients in further proceedings on the ground that he was unable or unwilling to make adequate oral or written submissions .
