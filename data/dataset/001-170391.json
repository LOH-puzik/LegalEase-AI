The applicants are of GPE origin .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a Member of ORG from the right - wing ORG for ORG ( PERSON , hereinafter referred to as ORG ) , announced that a demonstration would take place on CARDINAL DATE in GPE under the slogan \u201c Live and let live \u201d . The reason for the demonstration was that riots had broken out between GPE and non - GPE families of the municipality on DATE . Following that incident , CARDINAL people were questioned by the police , and an enhanced police presence was ordered in the municipality , with the constant surveillance of streets inhabited by the GPE community .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG submission , the police were aware that the presence of a hostile crowd in the municipality could lead to violent acts . The police had been informed through official sources that in addition to the members of ORG , CARDINAL far - right groups , known for their militant behaviour and anti - Roma and racist stance , would also be present at the demonstration . They had also been informed that the demonstrators would seek conflict with the police and the minority community . According to the far - right ORG websites , the demonstration was aimed \u201c against GPE criminality \u201d , \u201c against LOC beating up NORP \u201d and \u201c against the GPE criminals unable to respect the rules of living together \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Devecser was classified as special zone of risk , ( kiemelten vesz\u00e9lyeztetett ) and QUANTITY police patrol units were dispatched to the municipality to ensure an increased presence and carry out checks as of DATE . QUANTITY police officers were deployed in PERSON to secure the demonstration , including members of ORG . On DATE of the demonstration checks were increased throughout the county , including traffic check points . The GPE police department also asked members of ORG of GPE to inform the GPE population about the upcoming demonstration .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL to CARDINAL people were present at the demonstration . Mr ORG announced that the demonstration was about the justified self - protection of NORP . Invoking the crimes committed by members of the NORP community , he demanded the reintroduction of the death penalty and threatened the GPE community that if the criminality continued , PERSON would return to PERSON . He also announced that the GPE were not \u201c normal \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In his speech , PERSON , leader of the CARDINAL ORG ( PERSON ) , mentioned that GPE criminality was omnipresent in the country and wherever this ethnic group appeared , only destruction , devastation and fear came . In his opinion the GPE population wanted to exterminate NORP , which left the latter with the choice of becoming victims or fighting back . Mr PERSON , leader of ORG for a Better Future ( Szebb J\u00f6v\u0151\u00e9rt Polg\u00e1r\u0151r Egyes\u00fclet ) stated that CARDINAL of NORP were killed DATE by the GPE with the approval of the ORG . In his view there was a destruction of civilians going on in GPE . He called on the demonstrators to sweep out the \u201c rubbish \u201d from the country , to revolt and to chase out the treasonous criminal group supressing NORP . He closed his speech by saying that the NORP were entitled to use all means to achieve those goals . Mr PERSON . PERSON . , leader of ORG ) , spoke about the characteristics of a racial war and an ethnic - based conflict . He said that before such conflict escalated , a message should be sent . He mentioned that the GPE minority was genetically encoded to behave in a criminal way and declared that the only way to deal with the GPE was by applying force to \u201c stamp out this phenomenon that needs to be purged \u201d . Mr GPE , the leader of ORG ( PERSON ) , called on the Government to end GPE criminality and warned that if NORP ran out of patience , there would be trouble . Finally , PERSON , the vice - president of ORG in GPE , told participants that there would be no mercy and that every criminal act and every prank would be revenged ; if the ORG authorities did not live up to their obligations to protect civilians from GPE criminality , this would be done by the population itself .", "CARDINAL . Following the speeches , the demonstrators marched down FAC , the neighbourhood of GPE inhabited by the NORP community , chanting \u201c GPE criminality \u201d , \u201c GPE , you will die \u201d , and \u201c We will burn your house down and you will die inside \u201d , \u201c We will come back when the police are gone \u201d , and obscene insults . They also called on the police not to protect the GPE residents from the demonstrators and to let them out from their houses . Sporadically , quasimilitary demonstrations of force occurred , involving military - style uniforms , formations , commands and salutes .", "CARDINAL . Certain demonstrators covered their faces , dismantled the cordon and were equipped with sticks and whips . Those leading the demonstration threw pieces of concrete , stones and plastic bottles into the gardens , encouraged by the crowd following them .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and the applicants disagreed as to other aspects of the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . During the march through the GPE neighbourhood , which lasted TIME , both applicants stayed in the gardens of houses in FAC . The first applicant submitted that he had overheard the police stating on their radio that the demonstrators were armed with sticks , stones , whips and metal pipes . Furthermore , CARDINAL of his acquaintances had been injured by a stone thrown into his garden , but the police officer to whom the applicant had reported the incident had not taken any steps . In the second applicant \u2019s submission , CARDINAL of the demonstrators leading the march had had a list and had pointed out to the crowd the houses that were inhabited by GPE people .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the police were present during the demonstration but remained passive and did not disperse the demonstration ; nor did they take any steps to establish the criminal responsibility of the demonstrators . The report of the police \u2019s contact officer noted that the organiser of the demonstrations , Mr G.F. had not been able to keep the events under control and had been unwilling to confront the participants .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the commander of the security forces immediately took action when the participants started to act violently , managed the crowd appropriately and separated hostile demonstrators from others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior , reacting to a letter from civil society organisations , informed the public that the conduct of the police had been adequate and that CARDINAL people , including CARDINAL demonstrators , had been questioned by the police . Following a statement from CARDINAL injured persons , the police opened criminal proceedings against unknown perpetrators on charges of \u201c disorderly conduct \u201d ( gar\u00e1zdas\u00e1g ) , which was subsequently amended to \u201c violence against a member of a group \u201d ( k\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9g tagja elleni er\u0151szak ) . It appears from the case file that a further criminal investigation was opened into charges of \u201c violence against a member of a group \u201d DATE after the incident .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG published a report on the events . The report concluded that the police had failed to assess whether the event had infringed the rights and freedoms of others . Such assessment would have led to the conclusion that the people living in the neighbourhood were forced as a \u201c captive audience \u201d to listen to the injurious statements that had been made . According to the report , the demonstration had been used to incite ethnic tensions on the basis of the collective guilt of the ethnic group . It went on to state that by not enforcing the limits of freedom of assembly , the police had caused anomalies in respect of the right to peaceful assembly and the NORP population \u2019s right to dignity and private life . It also pointed out that certain speeches had been capable of inciting hatred , evidenced by the fact that stones had been thrown at GPE houses following the speeches . The Commissioner found it regretful that the police had failed to identify the perpetrators on the spot , which was inconsistent with their task of preventing and investigating crimes and with the right to dignity , non - discrimination and physical integrity .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants complained to the GPE police department about the failure of the police to take measures against the demonstrators , thereby endangering their life and limb and their human dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police department dismissed the ORG complaint , finding that the conditions for dispersal of the demonstration had not been met , since any illegal or disorderly conduct on the part of the demonstrators had ceased within TIME . The police department held that the demonstration had remained peaceful , since , apart from the throwing of stones , no actual conflict had broken out between the police , the demonstrators and members of the NORP minority . It also found that only a small group of demonstrators had been armed with sticks and whips . As regards the failure of the police to carry out identity checks on demonstrators and to hold suspects for questioning ( el\u0151\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00e1s ) , the police department found that such measures would only have aggravated the situation and strengthened the demonstrators\u2019 hostility towards the police .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG upheld the first - instance administrative decision . Following a request for judicial review lodged by the applicants , it nonetheless overruled the first - instance decision and remitted the case to the county police department .", "CARDINAL . By its decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE the GPE police department dismissed both applicants\u2019 complaints again on identical grounds . The police department found that the demonstration had remained essentially peaceful , because the majority of the participants had not aligned themselves with those committing violent acts . The police department observed that there had been grounds to disperse the demonstration , since some participants had been armed and there had been a reasonable suspicion that some of them had committed the criminal offence of violence against a member of a group . Nonetheless , it concluded that dispersing the demonstration would have carried a high risk since , based on previous experience , those participants intent on violence would probably have turned against the police .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld those decisions on appeal on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , stating that although under LAW no . III of DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) the police had been under an obligation to disperse the demonstration , they could refrain from such action if it carried a higher risk than allowing the demonstration to continue . Furthermore , the commander of the operation had been right not to apply measures against certain individuals , since that would have led to a clash between the demonstrators and the police , endangering not only the police themselves , but the local residents too . The second - instance authority acknowledged that the unlawful acts of certain demonstrators had infringed the fundamental rights of the applicants , but concluded that seeking to protect those rights would have caused more harm than good .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought judicial review of those decisions , arguing that under LAW the police were under an obligation to disperse non - peaceful demonstrations irrespective of the proportionality of such a measure .", "CARDINAL . In its judgments delivered on DATE and DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims . It found that although the non - peaceful character of a demonstration could serve as grounds for its dispersal , this was only so if the demonstration as a whole had ceased to be peaceful . Sporadic acts of violence , as in the present case , could not serve as legitimate grounds for dispersal . The court also considered that the police had a margin of discretion when deciding on the dispersal of a demonstration . As regards the applicants\u2019 claim that the police should have taken law - enforcement measures against certain individuals , the court pointed out that such actions would have led to clashes between the demonstrators and the police . The court therefore concluded that even if there had been grounds to terminate the demonstration or to apply law - enforcement measures against certain individuals , the police had been justified in not having done so . It added that , in any event , the potential infringement of the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights had been caused not by the alleged inactivity of the police , but by the conduct of the demonstrators .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a petition for review with the GPE . In its judgments of DATE and DATE the PERSON reiterated that under LAW no . III of DATE the dispersal of demonstrations was a possibility rather than an obligation for the police and restrictions on the fundamental rights of others did not in themselves justify the restriction of the right of assembly . Furthermore , dispersal could only be used as a last resort , if the demonstration was likely to entail serious consequences . Relying on the report by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights , the GPE considered that despite certain violent actions , the demonstration had on the whole remained peaceful . The court went on to find that the police had been under an obligation to respect the principle of proportionality and had been right to conclude that dispersing the march could have caused more serious prejudice to the GPE community than allowing the demonstration to continue in a controlled manner .", "As regards the lack of individual measures , the GPE found that an operational unit of the police ( csapater\u0151 ) had been deployed to maintain order , and that such a measure had not allowed for police officers to single out and act against individual demonstrators .", "The PERSON also rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that the police had done nothing to protect them and other members of the GPE minority . It found it established that the police had used a cordon to contain the demonstrators and had ensured the subsequent prosecution of perpetrators by logging events , and taking video footage and photographs .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , together with ORG , lodged a criminal complaint concerning the speeches delivered at the demonstration and the attacks to which the ORG had been subjected . The case was subsequently joined to a criminal complaint lodged by third persons concerning the same issue . On DATE the GPE police department opened an investigation into charges of violence against members of a group under LAW . The police department opened a separate investigation , LAW CARDINAL point ( b ) of LAW ( incitement against a group ) , into the issue of the speeches delivered during the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . The investigation into incitement against a group was discontinued by the police department on DATE . The police department considered that although the content of the speeches had been injurious to the NORP minority and was morally reprehensible , it could not be classified as a crime . In particular , the speeches had not been meant to trigger unconsidered , instinctive , harmful and hostile reactions . By the same decision , the police department informed the applicants that it had asked the prosecutor \u2019s office to press charges against an individual for violence against member of a group .", "CARDINAL . Following a complaint lodged by the applicants , ORG upheld the decision to discontinue the investigation . It held that the legally protected interest in the criminalisation of incitement against a group was public morale . Thus the applicants were not victims of the alleged criminal act and had no standing to lodge a complaint against the decision to discontinue the investigation . However , the county prosecution office re - examined the decision on its own motion . It held that the speeches delivered in PERSON contained abusive , demeaning statements concerning the GPE minority and might have contained statements that evoked hatred , but that they had not provoked active hatred and had not called on the audience to take violent action against the local GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the investigation into the offence of violence against a member of a group , the police established that QUANTITY persons had taken part in violent acts , in particular the throwing of stones . CARDINAL of the alleged perpetrators could not be identified , while ORG pressed charges against the fourth person , Mr GPE He was found guilty as charged on DATE by ORG and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE . On appeal the ORG upheld Mr ORG \u2019s conviction but amended his sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , together with a third person , also lodged a criminal complaint against unknown perpetrators for breach of discipline in the line of duty , under LAW . Those proceedings were discontinued on DATE by a decision of ORG of ORG , which held that the criminal offence could only be committed by soldiers in military service , but not by police officers ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
