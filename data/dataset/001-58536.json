In DATE ORG , a major provider of loan capital to the NORP shipping community , granted a MONEY loan to a group of companies under the ownership of ORG , a NORP shipowner . The applicants , also under the ownership of ORG , were among the guarantors of the loan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought an action for damages against ORG and CARDINAL NORP members of its senior management before ORG ( PERSON ) . The applicants argued that because of a shipping crisis they had been unable to meet repayment instalments on the loan and that in DATE they had been obliged to sell CARDINAL ships at below their insured and actual value to another client of the bank , who had been given generous financing terms in order to take over the vessels . Eventually other vessels in the fleet were put under the same management prior to their being sold to the management company . The applicants alleged therefore that ORG had acted contrary to business morality under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by decision no . CARDINAL , ORG ordered the parties to submit further evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by decision no . GPE , ORG dismissed the applicants ' action as being ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE DATE ORG declared the appeal admissible without prejudging the merits and ordered a new hearing in order to submit further questions to the parties . The new hearing was held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision no . DATE , ORG unanimously overturned the decision of ORG and granted the applicants ' claim . In particular , ORG established that ORG , at a time of shipping crisis , had rejected a request by ORG for an extension of time to pay off his debt and for a small amount of capital which would have enabled him to tackle urgent cash problems , despite the fact that he had already repaid PERCENT of the loan granted to him and that he had never been late in making payments . As a result , ORG 's business went bankrupt and the bank took over the management of his ships . The vessels were subsequently sold and the bank provided the new owner with the credit facilities it had previously refused to ORG", "CARDINAL . Therefore , the ORG considered that it was \u201c against morality for a bank to exploit its dominant position vis - \u00e0 - vis its counterpart during a period of financial crisis by cruelly prosecuting it instead of extending financial facilities which are customary in banking transactions during such periods \u201d . The ORG awarded the applicants MONEY plus interest at PERCENT per year back - dated from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The above judgment created a stir in the local shipping community . Several publications appeared in the local and international shipping press , stressing the impact that the judgment would have on future ship credits .

ORG , which had already appealed in cassation ( \u03b1v\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 ) on DATE , threatened to withdraw from the NORP market altogether if ORG ) upheld the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , by decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG overturned the judgment of ORG on the ground that the bank had not acted contrary to business morality and that the impugned judgment did not give sufficient reasons . The case was then referred to ORG for further examination .", "CARDINAL . Following deliberations on DATE , ORG , by decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ordered the parties to appear in person before it and to give further explanations about the case . The hearing was held on DATE . With the exception of CARDINAL judge who had also participated in the deliberations of CARDINAL DATE and was the rapporteur in the case , ORG sat in a different composition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i.e. DATE after the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL of the judges participating in that hearing retired . Under NORP law this meant that if the ORG had not reached a decision by that date it could no longer deliberate but should hear the case again in a different composition . However , no actions were taken at that stage , which led the applicants to believe that the decision had already been taken before the retirement of the judge and that they had to await the delivery of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL cases were heard after the hearing on the applicants ' case and before the retirement of the judge on DATE . In CARDINAL of these cases the judgments were delivered before DATE . In the course of the judicial vacations ( i.e. from CARDINAL July to DATE ) , the President of the ORG delivered CARDINAL more judgments . The judgments in the remaining CARDINAL cases were delivered in the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants inserted an open letter in a NORP newspaper . In their publication , entitled \u201c Open letter to ORG \u201d , the applicants questioned the reasons for the delay taken by ORG in delivering its judgment . Having received no answer , the applicants sent a similar letter on DATE to the Minister of ORG and the President and Public Prosecutor of ORG . They again received no answer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of ORG ( who had until DATE been President of ORG ) returned the file of the case to the ORG of ORG , accompanied by a hand - written note which read as follows : \u201c To be further discussed , in accordance with LAW ( since it was ascertained , after the last report , that there is a need for further deliberation , which is not feasible due to the retirement of CARDINAL of the members of ORG ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new hearing was held . ORG was composed of CARDINAL judges . The first had participated in the deliberations of DATE and the second in both previous compositions as rapporteur . The other CARDINAL members heard the case for the first time . CARDINAL of them , a junior judge , was designated as the new rapporteur .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by decision No . DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , lodged by the applicants against decision no . GPE of ORG , on the ground that it was ill - founded . In his dissenting opinion , the judge who was initially the rapporteur in the case expressed the view that ORG had not acted in good faith and that the applicants ' appeal should therefore be upheld .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW a decision is taken by the same judges who participated in the hearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW if , after the hearing of a case , a decision can not be taken for any reason ( namely the death , resignation or removal from office of a judge who has participated in the hearing ) the case must be reheard ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
