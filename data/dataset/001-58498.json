The co - accused were sentenced to DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE imprisonment on probation respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that in DATE , in the course of her studies and research for her thesis in political science , the first applicant had been contacted by agents of ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG , the secret service of the GPE . On the occasion of a meeting in the east sector of GPE at DATE or DATE , she had agreed to work for ORG concerned . She had kept ORG informed about her work at a research institute DATE . Subsequently , upon her employment by ORG ( PERSON ) , she had forwarded secret information such as reports prepared by NORP embassies , and in particular reports prepared by ORG itself , to the secret service of the GPE . The first co - accused , living in GPE , had operated as courier ; the CARDINAL other co - accused had been agents of the secret service of the GPE and had also been living there .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the first applicant and the co - accused had thereby committed espionage . As regards the co - accused , the court , referring to a decision of ORG ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE , observed that there was no legal impediment to punishing them ; however , the fact that their prosecution had only been possible following the NORP reunification had to be regarded as a mitigating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . NORP In fixing the first applicant \u2019s sentence , ORG regarded as mitigating circumstances in particular that she had no criminal record , had a regular life and had also shown helpfulness in taking care of a handicapped child . She had got involved in her criminal conduct due to her relationship with CARDINAL of the co - accused and she had not managed to discontinue her contacts with the secret service of the GPE . Moreover , due to a lack of adequate controls , she had had no particular difficulties in obtaining and forwarding the information concerned . Moreover , she had not obtained any financial advantage , but she would suffer serious professional disadvantage as a consequence of her conviction . Finally , ORG took into account that the first applicant had largely admitted her guilt . However , in view of the aggravating circumstances , in particular the lengthy period of the first applicant \u2019s involvement in espionage as well as the volume of secret information forwarded , ORG regarded a prison sentence of DATE and DATE appropriate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( Revision ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was released , having served CARDINAL of her sentence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE criminal proceedings were initiated against the second applicant on suspicion of having committed espionage . On DATE the second applicant was arrested and taken into detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the second applicant and CARDINAL co - accused was held before ORG sitting as a court of first instance over DATE in DATE . In these and the following proceedings the second applicant was assisted by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the second applicant and the co - accused of espionage on behalf of the GPE , pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) and QUANTITY , first sentence , of LAW . The second applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The second applicant was also deprived for DATE of the rights to hold public office , to vote and to be elected . The forfeiture of a sum of money amounting to MONEY was ordered . The co - accused was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on probation , and he was deprived for DATE of the rights to hold public office , to vote and to be elected .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in DATE the second applicant had been contacted by agents of ORG . At the latest in DATE , he had agreed to work for ORG in question . The co - accused had acted as contact agent ( PERSON ) . The second applicant had incited his friend to commit espionage on behalf of the GPE . His friend , who had died in DATE , had worked for ORG and had had access to secret , and partly top secret , information . The applicant \u2019s friend had taken copies of secret documents , or originals thereof , to his home where the originals had been photographed ; copies and films had subsequently been forwarded by the second applicant to the co - accused .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the second applicant and the co - accused had thereby committed espionage , within the meaning of LAW , which had been punishable at the time of their offences and had remained punishable following the accession of the GPE to GPE ( FRG ) , as regulated in LAW ( Gesetz zu dem PERSON . DATE zwischen der PERSON der GPE \u00fcber die GPE der PERSON ) of DATE . As regards the second applicant , the court noted that he had acted as a citizen of the ORG against his own country . There was no appearance of a violation of his right to equal treatment . In particular , the NORP legislator was not obliged to enact legislation granting an amnesty or to limit the application of the provisions on espionage and treason . Finally , he could not be compared to secret agents of ORG who , irrespective of the different goals of the secret services concerned , acted on behalf of their own country and not against it . As regards the co - accused , the court , referring to a decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , observed that there were no rules of public international law prohibiting a ORG from punishing foreigners having committed espionage abroad . Moreover , taking into account the different goals of ORG and the secret service of the GPE , his prosecution for espionage did not amount to discrimination against him , and the secret agents of the GPE could not have any legitimate expectation that they would not be punished for their conduct following the accession of the GPE to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In fixing the second applicant \u2019s sentence , ORG regarded as mitigating circumstances in particular that he had no criminal record , had a regular life and had not committed espionage primarily for financial purposes , but had pursued political ideas . However , in view of the aggravating circumstances , in particular the lengthy period of the second applicant \u2019s involvement in espionage , the involvement of his late friend , the kind of secret information forwarded as well as reasons of general crime prevention , ORG regarded a prison sentence of DATE appropriate . As regards the co - accused , ORG took into account the fact that he was a citizen of the GPE and a secret agent acting from within that territory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was released , having served CARDINAL of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed to ORG on DATE . Following indications as to certain formal shortcomings in her constitutional complaint , she filed supplementary submissions on DATE . Her case was registered on CARDINAL DATE . The second applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE was received by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The processing of the ORG and other similar cases was postponed as ORG envisaged rendering a leading decision in some test cases , that is , the application for a ruling submitted by ORG in DATE as well as CARDINAL constitutional complaints . In DATE a third constitutional complaint , covering general aspects , was added to the test cases . On DATE ORG , having considered the further action to be taken in these cases , ordered the preparation of an expert opinion on questions of international public law . The expert opinion , which should initially have been ready by DATE , was received by ORG on DATE . The parties in the test cases were given an opportunity to submit comments before DATE . Deliberations were taken up again in DATE , but again suspended DATE . However , during that period , a first draft of the decision was prepared .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rendered the said leading decision ( CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL and others \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE LAW , in separate decisions , refused to admit the first and second applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints . ORG referred to sections CARDINALa and PERSON of ORG and to the decision of ORG CARDINAL DATE , which was attached to the decisions in the ORG cases . The first applicant received the decision on DATE . The second applicant \u2019s counsel received the decision on DATE , and the second applicant himself on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under the criminal law of the ORG , treason ( PERSON ) is punishable under LAW and espionage ( geheimdienstliche GPE ) under LAW ) . The provisions of LAW are applicable to offences committed within the territory of the FRG ( Inlandstaten ) , pursuant to LAW .

In the course of the negotiations on the above LAW , an amnesty for persons having committed espionage on behalf of the GPE was considered ; however , this matter was not pursued on account of reservations among members of the general public and of envisaged difficulties in ORG ( NORP ) .

On DATE ORG ( GPE ) suspended criminal proceedings relating to charges of espionage , treason and corruption in order to obtain a decision by ORG on the question whether persons who had been living in the GPE and had committed the above offences from the territory of the GPE could be prosecuted . Furthermore , in DATE and later , numerous persons convicted of such offences lodged constitutional complaints with ORG , claiming that their respective convictions violated in particular their rights of liberty , as guaranteed under LAW of LAW , as well as their right to equality , as guaranteed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rendered a leading decision on the request submitted by ORG and CARDINAL of the constitutional complaints .", "CARDINAL . The request submitted by ORG was declared partly inadmissible ; as regards the remainder , ORG held that there was no rule of public international law , forming an integral part of federal law , prohibiting criminal prosecution of espionage committed on behalf and within the territory of a ORG which had later peacefully become part of the ORG spied upon . Furthermore , as regards the first of the CARDINAL constitutional complaints , it found that the complainant \u2019s conviction violated his constitutional rights ; the first- and second - instance judgments were set aside and the case was referred back to the first - instance court . With regard to the second individual case , the sentencing was found to have violated constitutional rights , the judgments of the lower courts were , to that extent , set aside and the matter was referred back to the first - instance court . The third constitutional complaint was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG recalled its case - law according to which the prosecution for treason and espionage as provided for under LAW and CARDINAL of the Criminal Code amounted to an interference with the rights of liberty under LAW which was justified from a constitutional point of view . This finding also applied to the extent that secret agents of the GPE were liable to punishment even if they had only acted within the territory of the GPE or abroad . In this respect , ORG considered that the relevant provisions of LAW aimed at protecting the external security of the ORG , and took into account that the offences in question had been committed at a time when the ORG was particularly exposed to secret service operations of its enemies .", "CARDINAL . However , according to ORG , the question arose whether or not the accession of the GPE to the ORG required a new appraisal of the constitutional issues , in particular with regard to espionage committed from the territory of the GPE by persons who were citizens of the GPE and living there .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the fact that espionage on behalf of the GPE was prosecuted as a criminal offence whereas the criminal provisions of the GPE regarding espionage committed by agents of ORG had been repealed in the context of LAW did not amount to discrimination . Rather , such difference in treatment resulted from the particularities of national security rules ( PERSON ) , which protected the ORG against espionage by foreign powers . Thus , espionage against the ORG on behalf of the GPE remained a punishable act even after the accession of that ORG .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the punishment for espionage on behalf of the GPE following the reunification of GPE did not breach any general rules of public international law , contrary to LAW . ORG , having regard to a legal opinion of ORG for foreign public law and public international law of DATE , observed that , under public international law , a ORG was entitled to enact legislation relating to criminal offences committed within its territory as well as to offences committed by foreigners abroad to the extent that its existence or important interests were at risk . There was no justification for espionage under public international law and there were no rules on the criminal liability for espionage following the accession of another ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the prosecution of espionage on behalf of the GPE on the basis of the criminal laws in force in the ORG at the time of the offences concerned did not amount to a violation of the rule that no act could be prosecuted unless it was not a criminal offence under the relevant law at the time when it was committed . ORG noted that the scope of the provisions on treason and espionage was determined by ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which had been in force before the time of the offences in question . The extension of the jurisdiction of the FRG regarding such offences was a consequence of the accession of the GPE and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court next examined whether or not the results of this extension of the jurisdiction of the ORG amounted to a breach of the rule of law ( ORG ) and , in particular , the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , in the unique situation of the NORP reunification , the prosecution of citizens of the GPE , who had been living in the GPE and had acted solely within the territory of the GPE or of other GPE where they were safe from extradition or punishment , violated the principle of proportionality . Consequently , there was a technical bar to prosecution ( Verfolgungshindernis ) regarding this group of persons . Criminal prosecution and punishment as a means of protecting legal interests should not result in a disproportionate interference with the rights of the persons concerned .", "CARDINAL . In this context , ORG considered the difference between the punishment for espionage and for other criminal offences . Public international law did not prohibit espionage , but it also allowed the ORG spied upon to punish spies even if they had only acted abroad . There was no differentiation between espionage on behalf of a totalitarian ORG and espionage on behalf of a ORG with a free democratic basic order . Thus , espionage had an ambivalent nature : it served the interests of the observing ORG , where it was accordingly regarded as lawful , and prejudiced the interests of the ORG being spied upon , where it was therefore regarded as a punishable offence . Punishment of foreign spies was not , therefore , justified on account of a general moral value judgment of reproach ( ORG ) regarding the espionage act , but only for the purpose of protecting the ORG spied upon .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , DATE of the GPE , and the consequent termination of any protection for its spies , together with the replacement of its legal order by that of the ORG , which rendered prosecution possible , resulted in a disproportionate prejudice towards the group of offenders who had committed espionage on behalf of the GPE solely within the latter \u2019s territory and had not left the sphere of its protection , or had only been within the territory of other GPE where they had not risked extradition or punishment in respect of such acts . The reunification had at the same time repealed the punishment of espionage activities on behalf of the ORG . The court further found that any punishment of this group of persons would jeopardise the process of creating NORP unity .", "CARDINAL . With regard to other citizens of the GPE who had committed espionage within the territory of the ORG or one of its allies , or in CARDINAL ORG where they had risked extradition or punishment , there was no general bar to prosecution as the above conditions were not necessarily all met . However , those persons had , as a consequence of the fall of the GPE , also lost the protection of that ORG , if only the expectation of being exchanged in case of arrest . Moreover , even confronted with the legal order of the ORG , these ORG sense of wrongdoing ( PERSON ) was attuned to the legal order of the GPE . Above all , they were meanwhile prosecuted by their own ORG in respect of espionage activities committed at a time when they regarded that ORG as a foreign ORG . In such cases all relevant circumstances had to be weighed in the light of the above considerations with a view to determining whether or not prosecution should be continued , or in fixing the sentence .", "CARDINAL . In their separate opinion to ORG judgment , CARDINAL judges of ORG explained that they disagreed with the judgment as far as the finding of a technical bar to the prosecution of a group of persons having committed espionage was concerned .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and Mr PERSON applied to ORG on DATE . They alleged , inter alia , a violation of LAW as regards the length of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission declared the application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) partly admissible on DATE .
