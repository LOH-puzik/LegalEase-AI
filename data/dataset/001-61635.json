THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 3", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and currently resides in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in the GPE , where , on DATE , he applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature ( klemmende PERSON aard ) . In support of his claim for asylum he submitted the following .", "CARDINAL . He belonged to the NORP population group , was married with CARDINAL children and lived in the town of GPE on the GPE peninsula . This area was controlled by ORG ( the \u201c NORP \u201d ) , a NORP terrorist organisation , engaged in an armed struggle for independence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant owned a minibus which was his livelihood . From DATE the ORG forced him to transport foodstuffs as well as its members CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a month . The ORG would pay for his petrol . In DATE the ORG confiscated his minibus because he had refused to transport bombs for them . They subsequently forced him to work in their kitchens and to help dig trenches . On DATE some ORG members came to his house and told his wife that the applicant had to report to their camp , which meant that he was expected to fight alongside them and to transport their weapons . Upon hearing this , the applicant immediately went into hiding . Since CARDINAL friends of his , who had also driven his minibus , had recently been shot dead by the NORP when they had refused to join the ORG 's ranks , the applicant decided to flee to the national capital GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he went to the army camp at ORG to apply for the required travel pass . He was apprehended and held until DATE as he was suspected of being an NORP supporter . He was taken to a mill where he was undressed and beaten with a small iron rod . This left a horizontal scar of QUANTITY in length on the heel of his right foot . He was also stabbed with a knife , leaving a number of scars on the underside of his forearms , and a cigarette was put out on his left arm , leaving a round scar . His hands were tied and he was strung up and beaten . After DATE he was made to stand in a line . A man wearing a black mask walked past the people in the line , indicating the moment he recognised somebody . This man was an informant . The applicant was not recognised . He was released and issued with a travel pass on condition that he return from GPE within DATE .", "CARDINAL . He travelled to GPE by train . In GPE he stayed at the house of an acquaintance for DATE without leaving the house as he feared arrest by the army . A doctor came to the house to see to his injuries . As he was not allowed to settle in GPE , and he could not go back to GPE because of his problems with the ORG , he decided to leave the country . An acquaintance of his father 's arranged for his flight to GPE via GPE . He left the country using his own passport , but the \u201c travel agent \u201d kept his passport in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After his arrival in the GPE on DATE , he was interviewed by an official of ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) on DATE . According to this official , the scars which the applicant showed him were much DATE , and the round scar on the applicant 's left forearm was bigger than the diameter of a cigarette .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant 's requests . It was noted that it had not appeared that the Sri Lankan authorities had such grave presumptions against the applicant that he could be said to have a well - founded fear of persecution . Although he had once been detained for a short period , there had been no evidence against him of any NORP involvement . The fact that the applicant had been able to leave his country using his own passport also did not suggest that the applicant had to fear persecution . Finally , according to a country report ( ambtsbericht ) of ORG of DATE , NORP coming from the NORP peninsula were able to find safety in the centre , south and west of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister further informed the applicant that he would not be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the consideration of any objection ( bezwaar ) he might wish to submit against the decision to refuse his requests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed on objection on DATE and , on DATE , also applied for an interim measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) to the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . By letter of DATE , the applicant was informed that his expulsion would in fact be suspended while his objection was being considered . The applicant withdrew his request for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's objection was rejected by the Deputy Minister of ORG on DATE . He was also informed that he would not be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the examination of any appeal he might lodge . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of The Hague and at the same time requested an interim measure from the President of that court . By final decision of DATE , the acting President of ORG of The GPE rejected the applicant 's appeal against the Deputy Minister 's decision as well as his request for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , an expulsion order was issued to ORG ( vreemdelingendienst ) in the applicant 's place of residence on DATE . However , the applicant did not leave the country and neither was he forcibly expelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he lodged a new request for a residence permit based on compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature . Finding that the applicant had not submitted any new facts or circumstances which invalidated the decision of ORG of DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected this request on DATE . In his objection to this decision , the applicant argued that , according to information that had recently become available , some groups of NORP in GPE ran an increased risk of persecution or treatment contrary to LAW . The applicant submitted that he belonged to one of these identified \u201c risk categories \u201d , given that he came from GPE , spoke no NORP , was suspected of ORG membership , had already been detained for TIME on the basis of that suspicion and had been seriously ill - treated on that occasion .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister rejected the objection on DATE . Referring to domestic case - law , the Deputy Minister held that merely belonging to CARDINAL of the \u201c risk categories \u201d was an insufficient basis on which to accept that LAW might be violated if the applicant was expelled . Since it had not appeared that , in addition to belonging to CARDINAL of the \u201c risk categories \u201d , any other special circumstances existed which could give rise to the assumption that the Sri Lankan authorities wished to apprehend the applicant , he was not eligible for residence in the GPE . As regards the applicant 's argument that the Deputy Minister of ORG ought to have sought the advice of the Ministry 's Medical Adviser to have his scars examined , it was held that such a step would only have been called for if doubts existed as to the truthfulness of the applicant 's account , which was not the case . The Deputy Minister also informed the applicant that he would not be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the examination of any appeal he might lodge against this decision .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant appealed to ORG of The GPE against the decision of DATE . In order to prevent his expulsion , he also requested an interim measure from the President of that court .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal , the applicant argued that he did run an increased risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if expelled , because he had given practical assistance to the NORP . His chances of being apprehended were also increased , given that he had no identity card , no fixed address and no accommodation . If he was arrested and detained for a second time , he would certainly not be treated well or released after DATE . There would , on the contrary , be a great likelihood that he would be killed . Moreover , arrested NORP ran a real risk of being tortured if their bodies bore signs of military training or deployment , such as grazes or scars .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , the applicant lodged a request for revision ( herziening ) of the Deputy Minister 's decision of DATE , submitting that the fact that he bore scars increased the risk of being subjected to torture , and informing the Deputy Minister that a member of ORG was going to conduct an examination of his scars . In the applicant 's submission , this development required the Deputy Minister to review the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of The Hague rejected the applicant 's appeal of DATE in a judgment delivered orally . ORG found that the applicant had failed to adduce new facts or changed circumstances , and added that the matter of the applicant 's scars had already been taken into account in the determination of his first requests . In view of this decision , the applicant 's request for an interim measure was declared inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , an expulsion order was issued to the Aliens Police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , the application for revision of the Deputy Minister 's decision of CARDINAL DATE was dismissed by that authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a physician belonging to ORG . The applicant 's lawyer had put the following questions to the physician :", "- could the applicant 's scars be linked to the torture he had undergone ?", "- was the applicant traumatised as a result of his experiences in GPE ?", "CARDINAL . In his report , the physician described , inter alia , the scars he had noted on the applicant 's body . There were a number of horizontal scars , QUANTITY in length and differing in width , on the underside of the forearms ( CARDINAL on the left and CARDINAL on the right ) , consistent with unsutured , open wounds , possibly caused by knives . There were also CARDINAL round scars on the right forearm and CARDINAL round scar on the left forearm , with a diameter of QUANTITY , consistent with burns , possibly caused by the putting out of a cigarette . Finally , there was a round scar , sensitive to pressure , QUANTITY in diameter , and level with the PERSON tendon of the right foot , from which ran a QUANTITY scar outwardly with clear traces of sutures . In the conclusion to his report , the physician answered the questions put by the applicant 's lawyer in the affirmative .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW DATE ( vreemdelingenwet , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , in force at the relevant time , aliens coming from a country where they have a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political conviction , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted by the Minister of ORG as refugees .", "CARDINAL . The expression \u201c refugee \u201d in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in LAW relating to LAW DATE ( decision of ORG of the Raad van State of DATE , PERSON \u2013 Immigration Law Reports DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Aliens , other than refugees , wishing to reside in the GPE for any length of time had to hold a residence permit ( LAW ) . Such a permit was to be requested from , and granted by , the Minister of Justice ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Given the situation obtaining in the GPE with regard to population size and employment , Government policy was DATE and is \u2013 aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if :", "( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so , as in the case of citizens of ORG or GPE member GPE and refugees covered by the above - mentioned LAW ; or", "( b ) this serves the \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; or", "( c ) there are \u201c compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d .", "CARDINAL . An alien not , or no longer , qualifying for admission to the GPE could be expelled ( LAW ) . However , aliens claiming that their removal from the GPE would compel them to travel to a country where they have reason to fear persecution on CARDINAL of the grounds set out in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not be expelled except by a specific order of the Minister of Justice ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An objection ( bezwaar ) against the refusal to grant refugee status or a residence permit lay to the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , LAW of LAW ) . An appeal against the rejection of an objection lay to LAW of ORG of GPE ( Article CARDINAL of the General Administrative Law Act ; Article PERSON of LAW ) . No further appeal was allowed ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the decision on the applicant 's objection ( DATE ) , GPE policy was based on country reports issued by ORG on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . To assess whether a person ran a real risk of being treated in a manner contrary to the provisions of LAW , the following factors were taken into account :", "- All young NORP in GPE who speak little NORP and whose documents reveal that they were born in the north ran the risk of being taken to a police station for questioning following an identity check . Most were released within TIME once their identity had been established and they had explained their reasons for being in the city .", "- People who had recently come to GPE from a war zone and had no identity documents or \u201c valid \u201d reason for being in GPE , ran the risk of being held for longer than TIME so that further enquiries could be made . People who failed to register on arrival also lay themselves open to suspicion .", "- NORP suspected of NORP activities on the basis of police files or information from other sources ran the risk of being held for DATE . This also applied to people whom the authorities believed could provide information on the ORG , such as people known to have a relative who is an ORG member .", "- People could be detained for CARDINAL , DATE under LAW if there was firm evidence that they were involved in the NORP . Such evidence included arms caches or suspect documents .", "CARDINAL . Persons held for longer than TIME for further questioning could be treated roughly ( beatings ) . Where the person concerned was held for DATE , and questioned about NORP involvement , the risk of illtreatment was considerable .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that a GPE belonged to CARDINAL or more of the above categories of persons , who in theory ran the risk of longer detention did not necessarily mean that there was a real risk of their being subjected to treatment prohibited by LAW . According to the country report of DATE , it could be assumed that , in any event , no such risk existed in the case of NORP falling into the first CARDINAL categories .", "CARDINAL . NORP GPE policy in force when the Government submitted their observations on the admissibility of the present application was based on the country reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . These reports indicated that NORP fleeing the war could find an alternative place of residence in Government - controlled areas , including GPE . NORP were subject to frequent identity checks in such areas , especially on or around public holidays , after attacks and if the military position of Government troops had deteriorated . NORP who could not identify themselves on the spot or who were believed to come from the north or east of GPE could be arrested . Most were released within TIME , after their identity and background had been checked . As to the factors which could occasion longer detention , the report of DATE referred to that of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The country report of CARDINAL DATE included information on the developments of the peace process that was started in DATE , stating that a formal cease - fire agreement ( ORG ) between the ORG and the ORG had been signed on DATE . It further stated that during the period under review CARDINAL suicide attack had taken place in GPE , which had not been followed by the usual round - ups , large - scale identity checks and arrests . After the installation of PERSON as prime minister in DATE , the security situation in GPE had improved considerably and the atmosphere in the city was relaxed and had normalised . Most roadblocks and checkpoints were removed . The number of identity checks had been drastically reduced and there were no reports of arrests of ORG suspects .", "CARDINAL . The most recent country report , of CARDINAL DATE , confirmed that the security situation in GPE had significantly improved as had freedom of movement . NORP were free to travel through the whole of the country without requiring prior permission to enter certain areas . As a result , it was now far simpler for NORP fleeing NORP - controlled areas to go to areas under Government control . In GPE , no restrictions on freedom of movement applied . During the period under review , the GPE authorities had in general respected human rights , in line with the provisions of the ORG . No arbitrary arrests had been made . Ill - treatment and torture to which persons who had been arrested on suspicion of membership of , or involvement in , the ORG had been subjected in the past , no longer occurred .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , returning unsuccessful asylum seekers were for the most part allowed to leave the airport after their identity documents had been checked . In a few cases , returnees had been handed over to ORG ( ORG ) , usually within CARDINAL but sometimes within TIME , and subsequently transferred to a ORG . ORG judge had to decide whether , on the basis of the information provided by the ORG , the person concerned should be remanded in prison , released on bail pending the conclusion of the investigation , or simply released . During the period under review , all returnees were released DATE , either on or without bail .", "CARDINAL . The country report of CARDINAL DATE stated that persons who were suspected of ORG membership because they bore scars ran a risk of detention for a period longer than TIME . According to the report of DATE , the presence of scars could constitute an indication for further questioning , but this element alone would not be a reason for such questioning . If a NORP , when checked in the street or during a round - up , had valid identity documents and a credible explanation for his presence in GPE , there would generally be no reason to question that person further . None of the sources interviewed by ORG thought it likely that in that case the presence of scars would constitute an element of risk .", "CARDINAL . The report of DATE stated that the presence of scars alone did not lead to an increased risk of detention longer than TIME . In the country report of CARDINAL DATE , it was stated that the presence of clearly visible scars of whatever nature generally did not by itself lead to a suspicion of NORP - involvement , and this was even less so if the person concerned was in possession of correct identity papers . Such visible scars could nevertheless constitute a reason to stop a person . In practice , it was only on very rare occasions that a person would be taken to the police station for questioning solely because he or she bore scars . There were no indications that NORP were ordered to undress during identity checks at checkpoints so that any scars might be detected . The report of CARDINAL DATE , finally , stated that the treatment of returning unsuccessful asylum seekers bearing scars of whatever nature was no different from the treatment of returnees without scars . Neither were there any indications that , during DATE period that they were held by the ORG , returnees with scars encountered an increased risk of suspicion of ORG - involvement or longer detention .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE Report DATE , covering events from DATE , ORG noted with respect to GPE :", "\u201c There was a major improvement in the human rights situation in the context of a cease - fire and peace talks between the ORG and the ORG . However , torture in police custody continued to be reported frequently ...", "Unilateral cease - fires declared by both the ORG and the NORP in DATE were followed by a formal cease - fire agreement ( ORG ) that came into force on DATE . Peace negotiations , facilitated by ORG , started in DATE in GPE . ORG ( SLMM ) consisting of representatives of NORP countries was set up to verify the implementation of the agreement through on - site monitoring . By DATE , CARDINAL of CARDINAL internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) had returned home . ...", "As part of the ORG , the ORG made a commitment not to arrest anyone under the ORG . ...", "Especially in the first part of DATE , there were numerous complaints of hostage- taking and recruitment of children by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG released ORG on ORG for DATE . It stated :", "\u201c In the past , arbitrary arrest and detention were problems ; however , there were no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions during DATE . ...", "Unlike in DATE , there were no large - scale arrests of NORP during DATE . ...", "The ... reports of regular mistreatment by security forces largely ceased . ...", "The reconciliation also has led to a sharp reduction in roadblocks and checkpoints around the country , the return of CARDINAL IDPs to their points of origin in the north and east , and to the opening of numerous investigations into actions by security force personnel . ...", "The Government restricted the movement of displaced NORP due to possible security , economic , and social concerns . These restrictions have been lifted with the onset of the peace process . ...", "The ORG continued to commit serious human rights abuses . The ORG reportedly committed several unlawful killings , and was responsible for disappearances , torture , arbitrary arrest , detentions , and extortion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Operational Guidance Note on GPE , issued on DATE by ORG ) of ORG reported :", "\u201c The authorities in GPE will no longer be concerned with those individuals with past low - level support for the LTTE ( e.g. digging trenches , providing food / shelter to NORP fighters ) , those with no police / criminal record or those who may have been arrested in the past and subsequently released . Those individuals who may be of continuing interest to the authorities would be ... ' those wanted in a relatively serious fashion ' . This could mean high - profile members of the NORP who are still active and influential , and wanted by the authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A letter dated DATE from the GPE section of ORG to the applicant 's representative stated :", "\u201c ORG are aware that the presence of scars suggestive of LTTEtraining may cause army and police to suspect him or her of ORG Police look for traces on the body of an arrested person , such as grazes or scars , which may point to military training or deployment as a fighter for the NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A report by ORG for ORG entitled \u201c Caught In The Middle : A study of NORP torture survivors coming to the GPE from GPE \u201d dated DATE stated :", "\u201c The evidence available to ORG suggests that any sort of scar can be interpreted by the GPE security forces as linking that person to the ORG . ... Nor is it the presence of easily visible scars alone that leads the security forces to the conclusion that the person arrested is an NORP supporter . Several of our clients have reported that their bodies were actively searched for scars , which , when discovered , were taken as evidence of NORP support . Thus we maintain that any sort of scar can be and has been taken by the GPE security forces as ' evidence ' of ORG support and the bearers of such scars detained and tortured . ... It is our view therefore that whether an asylum seeker has the type of scars described as ' battle ' or ' combat ' , whether the scars are ' significant and visible ' is not relevant to an assessment of the likelihood of further persecution if returned . What is relevant is simply whether or not they have scars . \u201d", "CARDINAL of the recommendations made in ORG report mentioned above read :", "\u201c That it is not safe to return to NORP with scars , or who do not have proper identity documents until ORG ends its torture of many of the NORP arrested . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to a solicitor in GPE , the ORG ( ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ) noted :", "\u201c Although steps towards peace have been taken in GPE recently , it is still premature to advocate that the situation has reached a satisfactory level of safety to warrant the return of all unsuccessful asylum applicants to GPE . In this regard , ORG has been aware that returning NORP are potentially open to risk of serious harm similar to those generally encountered by young male NORP in certain circumstances . ... In ORG 's view , the presence of torture - related scars on the body of a returnee should be a relevant consideration in assessing the likelihood of danger upon the return of GPE Tamil asylum seekers . Where such scars are related to human rights abuses , they would likely be seen as evidence of the security forces ' previous interest in the particular individual . This could in turn serve to trigger further adverse attention to that individual . While every case should be assessed on its own merits , ORG would reiterate its view that special care must be taken in relation to the return of failed asylum seekers to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE , drawn up by ORG ) of ORG , noted :", "\u201c The ORG has indicated [ in DATE ] that NORP asylum seekers with scars , should they be returned to GPE , may be more prone to adverse identification by the security forces and taken for rigorous questioning and potential ill - treatment . However , in discussions in GPE in DATE , respondents including local NGOs rarely mentioned scarring , and then generally only when the subject was brought up by members of ORG fact - finding mission team . The views of many of the NGOs , and indeed the police , was that scarring was not likely to be an overriding reason for arresting or suspecting someone , but if a person had been stopped or arrested for some other reason , the presence of certain types of scars could be a reason for holding or questioning them further . Most respondents felt that scarring was CARDINAL of many factors which could play a part in the authorities ' decision to detain someone ...", "On a more recent visit to GPE DATE a ORG delegation discussed the issue of scarring with the Director of the ORG . The Director explained that if a returnee was not wanted they would not be stopped at the airport . However , when the ORG are certain that the individual has committed or been convicted of an offence then they would be stopped . A computer holds the name , address and age of a wanted person . The police purely go on records \u2013 scars would not make a difference , and the authorities would not make a decision only on that basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , GPE President PERSON suspended parliament and sacked CARDINAL senior ministers . The President accused the Government of making too many concessions to the ORG . On DATE , NORP mediators said , after talks with the NORP , that the peace process was on hold until the country 's political crisis was resolved . The mediators had passed on to the NORP guarantees from both the President and the Prime Minister that they would abide by the terms of the ORG .
