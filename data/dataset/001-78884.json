LITHUANIA (No. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;Not necessary to examine Art. 10 and 11", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated murder . He served the sentence in FAC in GPE . The applicant was released on licence on an unspecified date in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the President of the organisation for ORG mutual assistance and support \u201c Freedom \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . On DATE the applicant signed a letter , on behalf of this organisation and certain other prisoners , complaining about the conditions of detention at FAC and about various allegedly unlawful acts of the prison administration . The complaint was addressed to QUANTITY persons , QUANTITY of whom were ORG officials and the CARDINAL others representatives of the private media . According to the applicant , the complaint was not sent through the prison administration , but rather through an inmate who had been released from the prison , in order to avoid censorship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Director punished the applicant by prohibiting him from receiving a parcel during a personal visit , having found that the sending of the complaint of DATE through channels other than the prison administration had breached LAW . It was also established that ORG ( fifth addendum ) prohibited a prisoner from using a personal computer , as had been the case with this letter . The Director held that the applicant could only send the complaint to the ORG authorities , not to other organisations or persons ( LAW ) . The Director further stated that LAW prohibited complaints \u201c on behalf of other prisoners \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , on DATE the ORG established that the provisions of FAC had not properly protected prisoners\u2019 rights of association . The Ombudsman did not express her opinion as to the lawfulness of the penalty .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant applied to the administrative courts , claiming that the penalty had been unlawful . On DATE ORG disallowed the claim for want of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision on appeal . Upon the applicant \u2019s further appeal , on DATE ORG quashed the lower court decisions . It held inter alia that the prison administration was part of the Executive , and that the administrative courts were consequently competent to examine the applicant \u2019s action concerning its allegedly unlawful acts .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant subsequently submitted the claim in accordance with the requirements of LAW , his action was examined by ORG on DATE , in the presence of the applicant , transported to the hearing directly from the prison .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the action as unsubstantiated , finding that the penalty of DATE had been lawful . It held inter alia :", "\u201c Pursuant to LAW , convicted persons are guaranteed the right to submit applications , proposals and complaints to the ORG authorities , public organisations and officials . When needed , the prison administration can attach their observations [ thereto ] . However , convicted persons are prevented from applying to these institutions through channels other than the prison administration ( LAW ) . The applicant admitted that the application [ of DATE ] was sent to CARDINAL addressees illegally , through a person who had completed his sentence and had been released from the prison . The prison administration was therefore deprived of the right to submit their comments as to the issues set out in the application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment , holding inter alia :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s claims that the [ relevant ] provisions of the Prison Code contradict the LAW are unsubstantiated . The applicant must acknowledge that he has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment , and that his legal situation is different from that of persons who have not breached the law ... .", "As appears from the case file , the applicant was punished [ on DATE ] not for corresponding with representatives of the media , but for a breach of the requirement under LAW to conduct [ such correspondence ] through the prison administration . The same can be said regarding the applicant \u2019s claims that , by way of the impugned penalty , he was punished for making criticisms , holding opinions or imparting information . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of FAC , as then in force , stipulated that convicted prisoners were not restricted in the amount of their outgoing letters . The third paragraph of Article CARDINAL required the prison administration to send a prisoner \u2019s letter to the addressee within DATE of receipt or its presentation by the prisoner .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Prison Code applicable at the material time provided that convicted prisoners could send \u201c proposals , applications and complaints to the ORG authorities , public organisations and officials . \u201d The provision also entitled the prison administration to attach its own explanations in relation to such matters .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , LAW provided that convicted ORG correspondence with the prosecutor could not be subject to censorship ( cenz\u016bra ) . Following a legislative amendment effective since DATE , convicted ORG correspondence with the ORG authorities and ORG could not be censored .", "CARDINAL . According to the then LAW , convicted prisoners were not allowed to send \u201c collective complaints and applications \u201d or complain \u201c on behalf of other convicts \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW as then in force , convicted prisoners were not allowed to send proposals , applications and complaints addressed to the ORG authorities through channels other than the prison administration .", "CARDINAL . Rule CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of ORG , applicable at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c Proposals , applications and complaints [ by a convicted person ] raising questions within the competence of the prison administration shall not be sent to the addressee , but shall be examined on the spot . Having examined [ such a ] proposal , application , or complaint , a prison official shall write a report and ... include it in the convicted person \u2019s prison file . Should there be disagreement , the proposal , application or complaint shall be sent to the addressee together with the report . If there is a repeated proposal , application or complaint with the same content , the prison administration will note its previous reply in the report ... If the authority , organisation or official addressed by the convicted person is not competent to decide the questions raised , the prison administration shall advise [ the prisoner ] to re - address the proposal , application or complaint . Should [ the prisoner ] refuse to do so , the proposal , application or complaint shall be sent to the addressee . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Prison Interim Rules ( fifth addendum ) applicable at the material time prohibited a detainee from using a computer .", "CARDINAL . The new Prison Code applicable since DATE does not allow any screening of convicted ORG correspondence with the ORG authorities and ORG rights . Under LAW , all other correspondence may be censored ( cenz\u016bruojama ) on the basis of a decision by a competent authority ( a prosecutor , prison director or court ) taken on a case - by - case basis .", "CARDINAL . In its ruling of DATE , ORG held that the domestic statutes were in breach of the LAW insofar as they allowed unjustified censorship of ORG correspondence . ORG also held that specific grounds should have been indicated for any particular instance of censorship .", "CARDINAL . Certain other domestic provisions concerning the censorship of convicted ORG correspondence have been summarised in the judgments of PERSON v. GPE ( no . PERSON , CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) and PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) v. GPE ( no .
