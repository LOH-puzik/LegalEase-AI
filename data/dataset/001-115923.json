IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE", "The applicant is a school traffic warden . She took part in a prison visiting project for which she provided her personal details to the prison authorities for security purposes . During the project she became acquainted with N ( in prison for the murder of CARDINAL persons and charged with the murder of CARDINAL others ) and they began a personal relationship .", "At CARDINAL on DATE ( DATE ) the applicant was visited at home by a journalist from ORG newspaper . The journalist sought information on the applicant \u2019s relationship with ORG from confirming that she knew N , the applicant refused to comment further . TIME the journalist returned and the applicant did not make any comment . At CARDINAL that day a letter from the journalist was delivered to the applicant \u2019s home : the journalist was writing an article about the applicant \u2019s relationship with N , she was sure of its validity based as it was on information from prison sources and she wanted to give the applicant the opportunity to tell her side of the story . The article would be published the following DATE ( DATE ) .", "On DATE the applicant went to visit N. As she entered the prison , she was approached by the journalist and photographed . As she left , the journalist requested the applicant to tell her side of the story . The applicant made no comment and contacted her solicitor who sent a letter by facsimile to the newspaper on DATE . The letter underlined that the proposed article concerned the applicant \u2019s private affairs and was devoid of any real public interest so that its publication would breach the code of practice of ORG as well as the applicant \u2019s constitutional and Convention rights . Since her vital personal interests would be irreparably damaged , the letter called on the newspaper not to publish the story . A response was requested by CARDINAL the following day , failing which the applicant would apply to ORG for protection . The newspaper did not respond .", "On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors contacted ORG duty judge ( it was a DATE ) . They applied to that judge , on an ex parte basis and grounded upon a draft ORG and the applicant \u2019s affidavit , for an interim injunction restraining publication of any material disclosing her relationship with N ; for a declaration that any such publication would infringe her right to privacy contrary to the Convention and the LAW ; and for damages for breach of her LAW and constitutional right to privacy . The applicant \u2019s grounding affidavit underlined that she was a private person of modest means and pointed to the prejudicial impact of the inevitable media scrutiny on her , her CARDINAL young sons and her ongoing employment . Since the story was not a matter of any real public interest , the devastating consequences for her and her family \u2019s personal dignity and private life would be disproportionate .", "In an ex tempore judgment dated DATE ORG refused to grant the injunction . She was a private citizen with a right to respect for her private life and there was no public interest in revealing that she was in a relationship with ORG which invaded private life in the threatened manner was meretricious and worthless . However , in ORG ( [ DATE ] IEHC CARDINAL ) , ORG had found that the common law rule enunciated in PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Ch CARDINAL ) had survived LAW DATE in GPE and applied in GPE . The rule provides that , in all but exceptional cases , the court should refuse injunctions . It can only grant such injunctions where it is shown that there is no prospect of successfully defending the substantive action . ORG judge considered this was a limited protection as it seemed to allow even worthless publication the same level of protection as is accorded to journalism that has redeeming characteristics . He noted ORG recent confirmation that the ORG does not have direct applicability in NORP law and only arises when that law falls to be interpreted in some fashion . He queried whether the rule in GPE would survive a LAW challenge but acknowledged that this was a matter for DATE and another court . Applying the rule in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG judge concluded that he could not make an order restraining the publication .", "On DATE ORG published on its front page a story entitled \u201c Lady and PERSON . It contained a series of photographs of the applicant and the associated article read , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c Meet the lollipop lady who has struck up an unlikely bond with double murderer TIME [ the applicant ] helps primary school kids across the road at a plush south GPE school . But once her work is done , the mum - of - CARDINAL regularly cycles into town to visit high - profile convicted double killer N. ... Prison sources have revealed the pair have been seen being openly affectionate in the visitors\u2019 centre at the jail . For DATE , [ the applicant ] , from ORG , has been visiting psycho PERSON twice DATE in [ prison ] . Jail sources have told Star Sunday that killer DATE who has admitted that he is mentally ill \u2013 is \u201c besotted \u201d with the attractive woman .", "... \u201c [ the applicant ] always sits up on the table between her and PERSON in order to be closer to him , \u201d said a source . \u201c She often snuggles in to his chest and they embrace a lot , which can often be a bit embarrassing for the other visitors . \u201d However , when [ the applicant ] was confronted by Star Sunday at her home on DATE TIME , she denied she was romantically involved with N.", ".... Sources at the jail said [ the applicant ] visits the killer twice a week , usually DATE between TIME . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant formally filed ORG on which she had relied when she applied for the interim injunction and in which she claims damages for a breach of privacy . It would appear that this substantive action has not been pursued further .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s Counsel advised that , since the application for an injunction had been refused and the article published the following day , there were no further steps open to the applicant through which she could have prevented the publication . In so concluding , Counsel noted that it had not been open to her to appeal to ORG on DATE because that court was not sitting on either of DATE .", "In this case ORG outlined the criteria for deciding interlocutory injunction requests . It recalled the judgment of ORG in Campus Oil v. Minister for ORG ( No . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] I.R. CARDINAL ) and noted the guidelines for the granting of an interlocutory prohibitory injunction . A plaintiff had to demonstrate :", "( a ) the existence of a serious question to be tried ;", "( b ) the inadequacy of damages ; and", "( c ) that the balance of convenience lies in favour of the grant of the injunction .", "While resolving these issues in favour of an applicant would , in many cases , result in an injunction being granted , it was not always so . In addition to these CARDINAL questions , there might be many other special factors to be taken into consideration in the particular circumstances of individual cases . Over DATE , a number of cases had been identified where the guidelines , even if satisfied , do not result in an interlocutory injunction being granted . A good example of this was the rule in PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Ch CARDINAL ) which ORG in GPE deemed to be of \u2018 some ORG to an application for an injunction restraining publication . Although the courts undoubtedly possessed the requisite jurisdiction to grant interlocutory injunctive relief , the rule in PERSON provides that in all but exceptional circumstances they should not issue an interlocutory injunction to restrain the publication of a libel which the defence sought to justify except where it was clear that the defence would fail . The rule was based on the need not to restrict the right of free speech by interfering before the final determination of the matter save in a clear case of an untrue libel . ORG in PERSON noted that the right to freedom of expression as provided for in the LAW and in the LAW is an important right and one which the courts must be extremely circumspect about curtailing particularly at the interlocutory stage of a proceedings . While refusing to restrict the defendant \u2019s right between the making of the application for an injunction and the trial of the action , it did , however , direct an early trial and heard submissions on the delivery of accelerated pleadings .", "The rule in PERSON was approved and followed by ORG in PERSON v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] I.R. CARDINAL ) .", "This rule reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where an ex parte application has been refused in whole or in part by ORG an application for a similar purpose may be made to ORG ex parte within DATE from the date of such refusal , or within such enlarged time as ORG may allow . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
