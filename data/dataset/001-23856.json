BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a company with registered office in the village of PERSON , the FAC region . It held PERCENT of the shares of ORG DATE ( \u201c DCB AD \u201d or \u201c the bank \u201d ) , a bank with registered office in PERSON . The applicant was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE and GPE respectively .", "On DATE ORG found that as of DATE DCB DATE 's capital adequacy had been PERCENT , which was significantly below the level set forth in ORG DATE . The fact that the capital adequacy of the bank was negative indicated that the bank 's riskweighted assets significantly exceeded the amount of its capital base . The bank experienced durable difficulties to perform its obligations on the date of their maturity , as evidenced by the high number of noncompleted payments . For a prolonged period the bank had not had enough liquid funds to perform its obligations to pay . For the period after DATE the bank had had waiting payments every day . As of DATE these payments had been CARDINAL amounting in total to CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL old NORP levs ( \u201c BGL \u201d ) [ On DATE the NORP lev was denominated . CARDINAL new NORP lev ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) equals CARDINAL old NORP levs ( \u201c BGL \u201d ) ] . Thus , ORG was of the opinion that there was a risk of ORG AD becoming insolvent within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE . Therefore BNB placed the bank under special supervision ( \u201e \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u201c ) . It removed its board of directors from office and appointed special administrators ( \u201e \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u201c ) to act in its place . It also limited the bank 's activities , prohibiting it from taking deposits , extending loans , dealing with commercial papers , dealing with foreign currency and precious metals , making guarantees , effecting noncash payments , clearing cheques , acting as a stock broker and carrying out factoring operations . It also prohibited the bank to pay dividends and to dispose of its assets .", "DCB AD did not seek judicial review of this decision .", "On DATE ORG petitioned ORG to open bankruptcy proceedings against ORG AD . The bank , which was respondent in these proceedings , was represented by the special administrators previously appointed by ORG .", "On DATE ORG found that during the period of special supervision , which had expired on DATE ( i.e. DATE after the entry into force of LAW DATE paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of the LAW ) , DCB DATE 's financial situation had improved through the efforts of the special administrators . Its debts towards other financial institutions had been paid off and the bank had collected more than FAC it had extended as loans and had thus improved its capital adequacy . Also , it could be expected that its overall capital adequacy would improve sharply during DATE . However , as at that time the bank was still unable to pay off all its creditors , certain restrictions on its activities had to be maintained . Accordingly , ORG , exercising its powers under LAW of LAW , reappointed the special administrators for DATE , ordered ORG AD to increase its capital adequacy to PERCENT of its tierone capital not later than DATE , and prohibited it from receiving deposits , extending loans , paying dividends , effecting noncash operations and clearing cheques until it had attained the said PERCENT ratio . The decision stated that it was not subject to judicial review .", "On DATE the general meeting of shareholders of ORG AD resolved to increase the bank 's capital from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL through the issuing of CARDINAL new shares with par value of ORG CARDINAL each . CARDINAL new shares were to be subscribed exclusively by the applicant and the remaining CARDINAL shares were to be subscribed by all shareholders of DCB DATE pro rata their respective shareholdings . On DATE the resolution was entered in the register of companies kept by ORG .", "The applicant subscribed the shares and , accordingly , became liable to pay them up .", "However , it sought to discharge this liability by other means . On DATE it had purchased debts due by ORG AD to CARDINAL other banks . By virtue of these debt assignments the applicant , apart from being shareholder of ORG DATE , had become also its creditor . It advised ORG AD that it wished to set off its obligation to pay its newly subscribed shares against the debt that DCB AD now owed to it . Accordingly , on DATE ORG AD made entries in its accounts whereby it effected the required setoff .", "Also , on DATE the applicant had made a contract with ORG AD whereby it had provided funds to the bank under the understanding that they were given as a hybrid capital instrument for the increase of the bank 's capital base . The applicant had transferred to DCB AD BGL CARDINAL pursuant to the contract .", "On DATE ORG , exercising its powers under LAW of LAW , ordered ORG AD to cancel the abovementioned entries in its accounts and to return the amounts given by the applicant . It reasoned that the setoff had represented non - cash consideration for the shares and that it had been effected in breach of sections DATE CARDINAL of LAW and of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Further , ORG found that the contract whereby the applicant had provided a hybrid capital instrument to ORG DATE had not been approved by ORG , as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of its Regulation No . CARDINAL on the capital adequacy of banks , and was thus invalid .", "Meanwhile , on DATE ORG , acting on the joint motion of ORG and ORG DATE , decided to stay the proceedings under the bankruptcy petition against the bank . Also , on DATE ORG , finding that the previous special administrators ' mandate had expired , appointed new special administrators of DATE .", "On DATE ORG revoked DCB DATE 's licence by reason of insolvency . It found that a check up of its assets and liabilities as of DATE indicated that the liabilities exceeded its assets by ORG CARDINAL . The decision stated that it was not subject to judicial review .", "On an unspecified date in DATE ORG requested ORG to resume the proceedings for declaring ORG DATE bankrupt .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing in chambers . DCB DATE was represented by attorneys retained by the special administrators appointed by ORG . The attorneys for ORG DATE argued that the bank 's assets exceeded its liabilities and that ORG 's determination in this respect had been erroneous . Also , ORG AD tried to commence an action for declaratory judgment to the effect that ORG 's decision for revoking the bank 's licence had been unlawful . The court rejected the action as inadmissible , holding that by LAW ORG 's decisions for revoking a bank 's licence were not subject to judicial review and that it was thus not competent to examine the action .", "In a judgment of the same date ORG declared DCB DATE insolvent and bankrupt , terminated the powers of its bodies , appointed trustees in bankruptcy ( \u201e \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u201c ) ( the companies ORG and ORG ) , divested the bank of its property and ordered the sale of its assets . It held that whereas under ORG DATE it had had the power to independently ascertain whether a bank was indeed insolvent either because its liabilities exceeded it assets or because it could not discharge a undisputed debt which had fallen due , under the new Banks Act DATE it was precluded from verifying the existence of these prerequisites . According to section CARDINAL of the LAW , the court 's task was only to ascertain whether ORG 's bankruptcy petition complied with the requirements of sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the LAW , i.e. whether it was facially valid and indicated the grounds on which the bank 's licence had been revoked . In the case at hand ORG had revoked DCB DATE 's licence and had indicated the ground on which it had done that . Therefore its bankruptcy petition had to be allowed .", "As the judgment was immediately enforceable , from that moment on the persons having the right to act on behalf of ORG AD were the courtappointed trustees .", "Before the trustees had started performing their duties , the bank 's attorneys filed appeals against the judgment for declaring DCB DATE bankrupt and against the decision in which ORG had rejected the action for a declaratory judgment as inadmissible . However , once the trustees started performing their duties , they withdrew the powers of the attorneys and withdrew the appeals . Accordingly , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE a threemember panel of ORG discontinued the appeal proceedings and declared that ORG judgment had entered into force .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the prosecution authorities about the actions of the vicegovernor of ORG who had signed ORG 's decision of CARDINAL DATE and had proposed the revoking DCB DATE 's licence on DATE . It argued that she had acted ultra vires with a view to causing prejudice to ORG DATE . The prosecution authorities opened criminal proceedings against the vicegovernor and on DATE charged her . However , on DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , holding that the vicegovernor had acted lawfully and had not abused her office .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant requested ORG to replace the trustees . It argued , inter alia , that their actions had prejudiced the creditors of ORG DATE . In particular , the trustees had failed to collect a number of the bank 's receivables and had deposited MONEY ( \u201c USD \u201d ) of the bank 's money in a another bank which was experiencing financial difficulties .", "On DATE ORG rejected the motion , holding that the applicant did not have standing to make such a request and that the trustee of a bankrupt bank could only be removed if BNB had struck its name off the register of bank trustees it was keeping . The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "On DATE ORG discharged ORG and ORG as trustees in bankruptcy . It appointed PERSON as the new trustee of ORG . The applicant did not specify whether this was done on its motion , on the motion of another creditor or of the court 's own motion . However , it appears that this was done because in DATE LAW was amended to provide that only natural persons , and not juridical persons , could be trustees in bankruptcy .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to replace the new trustee . It argued , inter alia , that she had failed to collect a number of the bank 's receivables , that she had been squandering the bank 's assets , that she had deposited ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL of the bank 's money in another bank which was experiencing financial difficulties and that she had made unnecessary expenses .", "In a decision of DATE ORG rejected the request . It held that the trustee had not failed to perform her duties . In particular , she had commenced a large number of actions to recover the bank 's dues . The depositing of the USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been done by the previous trustees . Finally , the trustee had been making DATE reports about the expenses she had been incurring . The court instructed the ORG to reduce to a minimum the number of attorneys she had retained to prosecute actions on the bank 's behalf . The applicant did not appeal against the decision .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to strike PERSON out of its register of bank trustees in bankruptcy . It averred that she had deposited USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in another bank which had gone bankrupt . The expenses ( allegedly MONEY ( \u201c BGN \u201d ) ) she had incurred for administrating the bankruptcy estate \u2013 in particular , by retaining a high number of lawyers to prosecute cases on behalf of the bank \u2013 had been unreasonably high . Further , she had done nothing or very little to collect the bank 's dues and had kept the bank 's accounting books in a very poor manner .", "BNB carried out an inspection in DATE and in a letter of DATE rejected the applicant 's request . As regards the deposit of ORG CARDINAL in another bank , ORG found it had been done by the previous trustees . Moreover , as of the date of the deposit the other bank had not experienced financial difficulties . At the time PERSON had been appointed , she had tried to withdraw the amount from the other bank , but had succeeded only partially . She had made a claim before the trustees of the other bank in respect of the part of the amount which had remained at the other bank at the time it had been declared bankrupt . As regards the fact that PERSON had commenced a large number of actions , the vast majority of those had been against debtors of ORG DATE and for the avoidance of transfers , i.e. for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate . The number of lawyers retained by the ORG had been minimal and the expenses , compared to those for the administration of the estates of other bankrupt banks , had been smaller . The overall expenses incurred by the ORG had not been ORG , as claimed by the applicant , but ORG DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to replace the trustee . It argued that she had improperly filed actions against ORG AD and that she had been squandering the bank 's assets .", "On DATE the ORG filed objections against the request , submitting that it was inadmissible and unfounded . As regards the actions she had filed against DCB AD , those were actions seeking to avoid transfers effected by the bank prior to becoming bankrupt ; the court examining those actions had instructed the trustee to constitute the bank as a codefendant . The trustee further provided a detailed account of the expenses she had incurred .", "In a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request . It held that it was inadmissible , because a bank 's trustee in bankruptcy could only be removed by the court if he or she had been stuck off the register of bank trustees kept by BNB . Nevertheless , the court proceeded to examine the request on the merits and held that it was also unfounded . It found that in DATE the applicant had signalled ORG about alleged irregularities in the trustee 's activities and that ORG had carried out an inspection and had not found any wrongdoing on the part of the trustee . The court went on to state that the fact that the trustee had constituted DCB DATE as a codefendant in the actions she had filed was not improper ; on the contrary , it had been done pursuant to the court 's express instructions . The applicant 's contention that the ORG had squandered the bank 's assets was unsubstantiated . The ORG had provided a detailed account of the amounts she had expended . That account , as well as the results of ORG 's inspection of DATE , indicated that she had not spent large amounts , as averred by the applicant .", "The applicant appealed to ORG .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG vacated the lower court 's decision and declared the applicant 's request inadmissible . It held that in proceedings for the bankruptcy of a bank the court could only remove the trustee if he or she had been struck off the register of bank trustees kept by BNB . Therefore ORG should have declared the request inadmissible and should not have examined its merits .", "Despite an express request by ORG in a letter to the applicant of DATE , the applicant did not provide any information about the further course of these proceedings . However , the published caselaw of ORG ( \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0447.\u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG V \u0433.\u043e. , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u2116 DATE , \u0441. CARDINAL ) indicates that the applicant appealed to that court and that in a decision of DATE it quashed ORG decision and remitted the case with instructions to the lower court to examine the request on the merits . It held that the striking of a trustee off the register kept by ORG and the removal of the ORG pursuant to a request by the debtor or a creditor DATE such as the applicant \u2013 were completely distinct hypotheses . The fact that BNB could bring about the discharging of a trustee did not mean that a creditor could not request her removal if she did not perform her duties properly or imperilled the creditor 's interests through her actions .", "Similarly , despite the above - mentioned express request by ORG , the applicant did not provide any information about the proceedings on remittal before ORG . Noting however that PERSON was not removed as trustee , the ORG concludes that apparently ORG examined the applicant 's request on the merits and found it to be unfounded .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to annul certain actions of the trustee which it considered prejudicial to DCB DATE 's creditors . On DATE the judge in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings informed the applicant that he did not have the power to annul actions of the trustee .", "On DATE some of ORG DATE 's assets were put on sale by the ORG , at a price fixed by experts appointed by ORG . The applicant submitted that it had tried to challenge that price as being too low , but that the courts examining its request had rejected it as inadmissible because they had considered that the experts ' valuation was not subject to judicial review and that a creditor of the bankrupt bank did not have standing to appeal against the fixing of the sale price . Despite an express request by ORG in a letter to the applicant of DATE , the applicant did not provide any further details , not did it submit any documents relating to these events .", "On an unspecified date in DATE or DATE DCB DATE 's trustee in bankruptcy asked ORG for permission to sell the bank as a going concern .", "In a decision of DATE ORG granted permission . On DATE the trustee entered into a contract with ORG ( \u201c ORG AD \u201d ) whereby it agreed to purchase ORG AD as a going concern . The contract provided that ORG would pay ORG for the bank and pay ORG CARDINAL to the bank 's fourth - tier creditors ( all previous tiers having been already paid off ) , which consisted solely of ORG ( which had indemnified all depositors of the bank and had subrogated itself in their claims ) . By an annex to the contract of DATE ORG agreed to pay the creditors ORG CARDINAL instead of BGN CARDINAL .", "The ORG submitted the contract to ORG for approval . The court requested ORG to submit its observations on the contract . ORG submitted its observations on DATE . It maintained that ORG offer to buy DCB DATE was fully compliant with ORG and that ORG had enough funds to pay the creditors of the bankrupt bank .", "In a decision made in chambers on DATE the court approved the contract , terminated the bankruptcy proceedings and struck DCB DATE from the register of companies . It held , inter alia , that the sale of ORG AD as a going concern would not prejudice its creditors ' interests and would not put them in a worse position than that which would have obtained in case the bank 's assets were sold apiece . The net worth of ORG , as assessed by experts appointed by the trustee with the assent of the court , was a negative value . The total value of its assets , as assessed by the same experts , was BGN CARDINAL . Since the price agreed by ORG was ORG CARDINAL , the creditors were in fact placed in a better position . Moreover , the creditors would receive their dues much faster ( within DATE after the sale had been approved by the court ) than if the bank 's assets were to be sold apiece . The assets which had been sold apiece thus far had generated proceeds amounting only to ORG GPE , whereas the aggregate of the creditors ' claims against ORG AD amounted to BGN CARDINAL .", "As provided by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the decision was not subject to appeal .", "Under ORG DATE ( superseded on DATE by LAW ) BNB could put a bank under special supervision , if it found that the bank was at a risk of becoming insolvent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . By CARDINAL of the LAW , a bank was at such a risk when ( a ) its capital adequacy was below a certain minimal level or when ( b ) due to the state of its assets there was a risk that it could not pay its debts at maturity . When ORG placed a bank under special supervision , it could remove the members of its governing bodies from office and appoint special administrators with powers to act in their place ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) in limine and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ) . It could also limit the bank 's activities and prohibit it from paying dividends or from disposing of its assets ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW provides that the regime of special supervision imposed on a bank under the repealed LAW DATE lapses if within DATE after the entry of the LAW into force ( i.e. CARDINAL DATE ) BNB does not revoke the bank 's licence .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW allows in broad terms BNB to order a bank to remedy violations it has made of the LAW and of ORG 's regulations and other acts and directives .", "Under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE BNB may , in certain circumstances ( e.g. when placing a bank under compulsory administration or revoking its licence ) appoint special administrators ( \u201e \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u201c ) .

The court terminated the powers of the bank 's bodies ( general meeting of shareholders , board of directors , etc . ) ( section CARDINAL ) ) and appointed trustees in bankruptcy in whom these powers , including the right to represent the bank in court , vested ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) [ At present section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ] of LAW ) .
