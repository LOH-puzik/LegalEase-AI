ORG On DATE the Inspector of Direct Taxes sent the applicant an assessment of his contributions for DATE under various social security schemes , including ORG ( Algemene kinderbijslagwet , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaarschrift - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to this assessment on CARDINAL DATE . He based his argument on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG and on the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE ( Staatsblad ( Official Gazette ) no . CARDINAL ( \" the royal decree \" ) - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , by virtue of which unmarried childless women of DATE or over were exempted from the obligation to pay contributions under ORG ; in his view the prohibition of discrimination such as was contained in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) implied that this exemption should be extended to men in the same situation .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant later received similar assessments for DATE , against which he likewise filed objections . The ORG reserved his decision on these , pending the outcome of the proceedings relating to the DATE assessment .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG issued a decision declaring the first objection unfounded on the ground that \" under national legislation the application of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG is not possible since the person by whom the contributions are due is not female \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE . Relying on LAW taken together with LAW No . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL+PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and LAW , he claimed that the provisions of the royal decree should be given a \" gender neutral \" construction . LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG and the royal decree were in his view discriminatory .", "The Inspector lodged a written defence . Thereafter the applicant filed a reply , and the ORG a rejoinder .", "CARDINAL . ORG The exemption enjoyed by unmarried childless women of CARDINAL or over from the obligation to pay contributions under LAW was abolished by LAW of DATE ( Staatsblad DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its judgment on DATE , dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirming the ORG \u2019s decision . Its reasoning included the following :", "\" CARDINAL . Neither the wording of the impugned provision nor its drafting history indicates that the legislature intended to discriminate or has caused discrimination . In particular , it can not be said that the legislator wished to discriminate against unmarried men who had reached DATE before the beginning of the calendar year and were not entitled to child care benefits under LAW vis - \u00e0 - vis comparable women .", "CARDINAL . By means of the provision set out in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , the legislature merely wished to take due account of the difference in factual situation between women over DATE and men over DATE with regard to having ( begetting or raising ) children .", "CARDINAL . The fact , as stated by [ the applicant ] , that it appears from statistical data that older men only rarely beget children makes no difference to what is considered in paragraph CARDINAL above . The legislature has assessed the factual situation of the group of women referred to in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG differently on the basis of the possibility of their having children and not on the basis of the reality of their having children .", "Older men \u2019s possibilities of procreating are fundamentally different from those of older women , in the sense that this difference is considerable irrespective of these statistical data .", "CARDINAL . The difference in treatment opposed by [ the applicant ] is therefore not based on a difference in sex , but on a difference in factual situation .", "This conclusion is not altered by the fact that this difference ( partly ) coincides with the difference between the sexes . The impugned provision does not therefore contravene the prohibition of discrimination .", "CARDINAL . It can not be excluded in principle that the fairness and acceptability of ORG benefit by taking account of these differences in factual situation .", "It not being for ORG to rule on the intrinsic value of a statute , the ORG can not consider whether the differences in factual situation entirely justify the exemption in question .", "CARDINAL . Even if it were correct , contrary to what is set out above , that the impugned provision contravenes the prohibition of discrimination , this would not benefit [ the applicant ] .", "ORG would not be at liberty to extend the exemption in question to CARDINAL or more groups of individuals for whom the legislature definitely did not intend it .", "If the argument based on prohibition of discrimination should have to be accepted in principle , this could only lead to a finding that the impugned provision had no binding force .", "This would not be in [ the applicant \u2019s ] interest . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant filed an appeal on points of law ( beroep in cassatie - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . In so far as is relevant here , he challenged the above reasoning of ORG relying on LAW ( article CARDINAL ) and LAW .", "The Inspector responded in writing .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . Its reasoning included the following :", "\" CARDINAL . The third ground of appeal [ middel ] argues that the principle set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG violates LAW CARDINAL of the LAW article CARDINAL ) . To the extent that the ground of appeal relies on the latter provision ( article CARDINAL ) , it must fail as the present case does not relate to any of the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Convention .", "...", "CARDINAL . In view of , inter alia , the drafting history of the provision in question the limitation of the exemption set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG to women of CARDINAL and over was inspired by the idea that it would not be reasonable to levy contributions under LAW from these women , since it had to be assumed that a great number of them would never have children and were prevented by social and - unlike men - biological factors from ever bearing children .", "ORG need not consider the question of whether the above - mentioned fact constitutes an objective and reasonable justification for exempting only women of CARDINAL and over from paying contributions under LAW .", "Since this difference in treatment between ( unmarried ) women and men , which in any case , given their biological differences , can not be said to lack all reasonable ground , has been removed with effect from DATE by the abolition of the exemption by LAW DATE ( PERSON , no . CARDINAL ) there is no reason for a court to intervene by declaring the exemption applicable , for DATE in question , to unmarried men of CARDINAL and over .", "... \"", "CARDINAL .
