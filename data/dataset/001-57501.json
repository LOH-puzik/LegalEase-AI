He was struck off the Bar roll of that city and has twice applied unsuccessfully to be reinstated .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , after completing the prescribed period as a pupil avocat in GPE , H was entered on the roll and took chambers .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , ORG of GPE commenced disciplinary action against him for having deliberately given false information to clients .", "On DATE , it struck him off the roll , having satisfied itself that he had wrongly persuaded a client that he ( the client ) risked arrest if he did not immediately pay a sum of CARDINAL BF . The ORG had previously dismissed the other charges against H.", "On appeal by H , ORG , in a judgment on DATE , affirmed the decision to strike him off ; and on DATE , ORG dismissed H \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . H was subsequently prosecuted for fraud and unlawfully holding himself out as an avocat ; he was in custody pending trial from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and many of his files were seized . He was acquitted by ORG on DATE and made an unsuccessful claim for compensation .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant set up as a legal and tax adviser , after having worked for some time as a commercial traveller .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when he was about to apply to have his name restored to the roll , the police again seized documents at his office . On DATE , the chambre du conseil of ORG committed him for trial in ORG for forgery and fraudulent conversion , but the prosecution ended in an acquittal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . H has no criminal convictions .", "CARDINAL . ORG By a letter of DATE , the applicant requested ORG of GPE to restore his name to the roll . This application was based on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

ORG The hearing was held on DATE . According to H \u2019s counsel , the \" exceptional circumstances \" justifying his restoration to the roll consisted essentially in the great professional and family difficulties his client had experienced over DATE , particularly as he had to confine himself to his occupation as a legal and tax adviser ; furthermore his disbarment had not been followed up with any criminal proceedings and the later prosecutions had ended in acquittals .", "CARDINAL . The Council of the ORG dismissed the application on DATE ; although DATE had elapsed since H had been struck off , the explanations offered orally by H \u2019s counsel did not disclose any exceptional circumstances such as would justify restoring his name to the roll .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant renewed his application . He appended a memorandum criticising the DATE decision and to which was attached an opinion by a retired procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ( Principal Crown Prosecutor ) , B. According to B , ORG should , under LAW , have reported to the GPE procureur du PERSON ( ORG ) the matters of which the applicant stood accused ; that would have entailed suspending the disciplinary proceedings until the final decision in the criminal trial was known .", "CARDINAL . The Council of the Ordre heard H and his counsel on DATE . Counsel submitted that the decision to disbar H had been based on the uncorroborated evidence of CARDINAL of H \u2019s clients , and that from DATE to DATE H had run his legal and tax consultancy very satisfactorily . He added that in DATE ORG had not reported the facts to the procureur du Roi , with the result that no prosecution had been brought and H had not had a chance of securing an acquittal . He also emphasised H \u2019s family difficulties . In addition , he filed a memorandum in which the applicant explained why the retired procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral B was entitled to give an opinion .", "CARDINAL . The Council of the ORG dismissed the application at the end of its sitting on DATE , holding that H had not established that there were exceptional circumstances ; in particular , the consequences of disbarment did not constitute such circumstances . In response to the memorandum of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it stated that the relevant procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral was aware of the facts before the decision was given and had ordered a judicial investigation .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In the instant case it is sufficient to mention the following .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW , which enshrines the case - law of ORG on the subject ( judgment of DATE , PERSON , I , p. CARDINAL ) , the ORG draws up the roll of avocats and the list of pupil avocats , and no appeal lies from its decisions in this matter . The principle of the ORG \u2019s having responsibility for its roll is justified by the need to restrict access to the profession to persons of unimpeachable integrity .", "CARDINAL .

The avocat concerned has a right both of objection ( opposition ) ( Article CARDINAL ) and , like the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , of appeal ( appel ) ( Article CARDINAL ) . At the time the events in this case occurred ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , appeal lay to ORG ( LAW of DATE regulating the practice of the profession of avocat and the discipline of the Bar ) .

DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , p. CARDINAL ) . The general law does not make any specific provisions ; and ORG did not have any internal rules of procedure at the relevant time .
