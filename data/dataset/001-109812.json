In DATE , the plaintiff moved from the occupied area of GPE to the government - controlled area and requested that his house be returned to him . His request was dismissed on the ground that as a result of the NORP invasion of DATE , all NORP - Cypriot properties had been vested in the Custodian until final settlement of the NORP problem .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff lodged a recourse against this decision with ORG under Article CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He contended , inter alia , that he was entitled to recover his property as he resided in the government - controlled area , relying on section CARDINAL of the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Attorney General argued that \u201c residence \u201d was determined on DATE the PERSON entered into force and not at any subsequent time so that from the moment the Custodian took over the administration of NORP - Cypriot property , such administration would continue as long as the PERSON was in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s interpretation of LAW , finding that such an interpretation would constitute an illogical , unjustifiable and excessive limitation of the fundamental constitutional right to property . It referred to the preamble of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and held that :", "\u201c ... the Legislator also decided , as it appears from the definition of the term \u2018 NORP - Cypriot\u2019 , as his criterion , that only in the case where the owners of the properties in question are not resident in the areas controlled by the Republic is their protection necessary , evidently as those NORP properties whose owners live in the areas controlled by the Republic do not need such protection , thus establishing a criterion which does not apply generally to NORP - Cypriots en masse but specifically to each owner . The ordinary residence of the specific owner in the areas controlled by the Republic , as the criterion of the same Legislator , puts the said specific properties on the same footing as all the other properties there and rules out the intervention or further intervention of the Custodian in their protection and administration . As things are , it does not matter whether the specific owner acquired his ordinary residence in the areas controlled by the Republic before or after CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and whether he returns to his ordinary residence there and seeks to live in his own house . In such a case , the criterion of the PERSON itself excludes the property from the administration of the Custodian . And , furthermore , it is certainly not only , to avoid referring to elementary human logic , the normal rules of interpretation which dictate this view but also the fundamental principles of interpretation which require the interpretation of the laws to be compatible with constitutional rights and to be analogously restrictive . If the PERSON were to be interpreted otherwise so as to cover the continuation of the administration of NORP - Cypriot property after the reestablishment of the ordinary residence of the owner in the areas controlled by the Republic , in all probability it would constitute an unjustified and excessive , even as regards the necessity expressly stated in the PERSON as justifying this , restriction of the fundamental constitutional right to property . This approach also arises from the jurisprudence of the ORG as regards the validity of the principle of proportionality , as an objective and reasonable criterion , concerning the restrictions which may be placed on the basis of discrimination in violation of LAW ( which is reflected in LAW ) . It is sufficient for me to refer to a very recent decision in the case of PERSON v GPE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG upheld the recourse and annulled the decision in question .", "CARDINAL . The Attorney General filed an appeal against the judgment but withdrew this on DATE . The plaintiff \u2019s property was returned to him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff , a NORP , was appointed administrator of the estate of his deceased father , who owned a CARDINAL share of a plot of land in the district of GPE which had vested in the Custodian .

An amount in respect of compensation for the compulsory acquisition had been deposited in the Special Fund of NORP - Cypriot properties ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . However , payment of the sum to the plaintiff was suspended , in accordance with section CARDINAL of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL , for as long as the abnormal situation continued to exist ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff sought the transfer of the property to the legal heirs and payment of the amount due as a consequence of the compulsory acquisition . Although the Custodian gave his consent to the issue of letters of administration , he noted that the NORP - Cypriot owners and their heirs did not have the right to the use of their properties vested in the Custodian and were barred from exercising any property rights without the permission of the Custodian as long as the abnormal situation created by the NORP occupation continued . He further noted that the request for payment of the compensation could not be satisfied because , in accordance with section LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL , payment of any amount owed to an owner of ORG was suspended .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff lodged a recourse requesting the recovery of his property and claiming that LAW was contrary to LAW and the constitutional principle of equality , and that the compulsory acquisition had been unlawful .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the recourse . It found that , as the plaintiff had been living in the occupied areas , Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL was applicable to the case . It further found that the plaintiff was not prevented from fulfilling his obligations as administrator of the deceased \u2019s estate and from distributing and transferring the property to the lawful heirs . He was only prevented temporarily from possessing and administering the property . This limitation did not affect his rights and interests , which would be granted to him when the abnormal situation ended .", "CARDINAL . The court also dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s claim as to the incompatibility of LAW with LAW . In this respect it observed that the ORG , in DATE , had found itself faced with circumstances which necessitated the creation of a state of emergency . The ORG had , therefore , the duty to adopt measures even if these limited the fundamental rights and liberties protected by LAW . The mass movement of NORP and the abandonment by them of their properties in areas which were controlled by GPE gave rise to a need to protect these properties for their ORG benefit , as stated in the preamble of the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The enactment and adoption of the PERSON was completely justified .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff lodged an appeal . The judgment in the appeal was handed down on DATE . The court noted that the applicants did not request the Custodian to return the property . It further observed that issues arose as to the constitutionality of LAW and it encouraged applicants to go to FAC , which had jurisdiction to examine the matter .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff was a NORP who had abandoned his property as a result of the events of DATE and had since been living in the occupied part of GPE . Part of his property had been granted to refugees for temporary use and part of the property had been compulsorily acquired for public benefit purposes .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff requested damages for the part of his property that had been compulsory acquired and the return of the remainder of his property . The requests were rejected and the plaintiff filed a recourse before ORG . He complained that LAW infringed ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and LAW No . CARDINAL of the Convention . He further claimed that following the relaxation of restrictions on movement from the occupied areas to the areas controlled by the Republic , the abnormal situation on which the abovementioned law was based had ceased to exist . He relied on the ORG \u2019s judgments in the case of PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALVI and PERSON v. GPE , no . MONEY , ORG CARDINALV.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the recourse . It reaffirmed the need to protect the abandoned properties of NORP and to help displaced NORP Cypriots who had lost their property that had been created following the NORP occupation . The abnormal situation still existed and would only cease to exist following a decision of ORG to that effect , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the PERSON . NORP Cypriots were not deprived of their property as they continued to be the owners , notwithstanding the fact that during the abnormal situation , the administration of the properties was vested in the Custodian . The court further considered that the fact that the abnormal situation had continued for so many years did not affect the temporary nature of the PERSON as it did not intend to impose permanent limitations or to deprive the lawful owners of their rights . The measures adopted were absolutely necessary and proportionate to the situation which had to be faced .", "CARDINAL . With regard to LAW No . CARDINAL the court noted :", "\u201c LAW protocol , after recognising the right of every natural or legal person to peaceful enjoyment of his property , refers to the exceptions , to set aside the right for public interest purposes under conditions provided for by the law and by the general principles of public international law . The protection afforded by LAW does not take away the right of the state to enact such laws as it considers to be necessary for controlling the use of property in accordance with the general interest ...", "The exception of LAW exists in the present case . LAW was mandated for reasons of public interest which are obvious . On the contrary in GPE \u2019s case the deprivation of the rights of Ms. PERSON was made without any legal basis and of course without the existence of any law . Let us not forget that the occupied part of GPE does not constitute a state recognised by the international community . Moreover , in the case of LAW ownership remains with the NORP - Cypriot owners and the Custodian simply has the responsibility and competence to administer the property until the end of the abnormal situation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff lodged an appeal before ORG but the appeal was withdrawn on DATE in order for an action to be lodged with ORG in accordance with the amended LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . On DATE ORG , hearing an appeal from ORG , handed down its judgment in a case where the plaintiff had argued that LAW violated the LAW and the LAW . It noted that the constitutionality of LAW was well - established in NORP jurisprudence , referring to its judgment in PERSON . It accordingly dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs were NORP residing in the occupied part of GPE . They filed a recourse before ORG challenging the decision of the Custodian to refuse to return the property they owned in GPE , arguing that they had not abandoned their property following the NORP invasion and that , accordingly , Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not apply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the recourse . It relied , inter alia , on the judgments of ORG in the cases of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and ( see paragraphs DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sitting as an appellate court dismissed the LAW appeal . It noted the ORG \u2019s decision in PERSON v. GPE ( striking out dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE , and the ORG \u2019s position as presented to this ORG in that case . However , it did not consider that in making a proposal for friendly settlement the ORG had accepted that LAW violated the LAW . It further considered that their undertaking to amend the PERSON was irrelevant , as the amendment concerned merely the lifting of custodianship for NORP - Cypriot property owners who permanently resided abroad before or after DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the case before , the court noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was concerned with the applicability of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL and accordingly concluded that the only issue raised in the case was whether the Custodian was a trespasser . This was a matter of private law and there was therefore no jurisdiction in the case .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff lodged an action for trespass and alleged a violation of his property rights as protected by LAW . On CARDINAL DATE ORG handed down its judgment .", "CARDINAL . The court considered whether the applicant \u2019s property fell within the scope of LAW . It noted that the PERSON applied to properties owned by NORP - Cypriots who did not have their usual residence in the territories controlled by the Republic . It referred to ORG judgment in PERSON and considered that this decision confirmed that LAW could be justified on the basis of necessity . The judge emphasised that ownership of properties was not transferred under LAW : only the administration vested in the Custodian . Accordingly the measures did not restrict or deprive the owners of their rights and were absolutely necessary .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff \u2019s claim was accordingly dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Between the entry into force of the amendments to LAW on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , when the Government provided statistical information to the ORG as to the operation of the amended PERSON , approximately CARDINAL applications were made to the Custodian requesting the lifting of custodianship over NORP - Cypriot property .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the applications lodged concerned sales of properties to NORP - Cypriot buyers . In these cases , the relevant sale agreement was lodged with ORG for completion of the necessary procedures prior to referral to the Custodian for a decision on whether to lift the custodianship . Of these , CARDINAL applications were still under examination by ORG . The remaining CARDINAL cases were referred by ORG to the Custodian for decision .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL sales cases referred to him , the Custodian decided to lift custodianship in CARDINAL , in both cases reversing prior negative decisions made before DATE . He declined to lift the custodianship in CARDINAL cases . In the remaining CARDINAL case , inquiries as to the facts and circumstances were ongoing .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL applications lodged which did not concern sales , inquiries by the Custodian as to the facts and circumstances were ongoing in CARDINAL . These CARDINAL outstanding cases concern the return of property ( CARDINAL cases ) , the return of property for occupation by the owners ( CARDINAL cases ) , requests for negotiations for the purchase of the property by the Government ( CARDINAL cases ) and a claim that the property does not fall within the scope of LAW ( CARDINAL case ) . In the only decided case , custodianship was lifted under an agreement with the NORP - Cypriot owner following negotiations for the purchase of the property by the Government at an agreed price reflecting its present day value .", "CARDINAL . It can therefore be seen that of the CARDINAL applications lodged DATE and CARDINAL DATE and put before the Custodian for decision , inquiries were continuing in respect of CARDINAL . In the CARDINAL concluded cases , he agreed to lift the custodianship in CARDINAL and refused to do so in CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Custodian also examined under the PERSON as amended a further CARDINAL applications made prior to CARDINAL DATE . Examination of all CARDINAL applications has been concluded .", "CARDINAL . A total of CARDINAL of these applications concerned sales and the Custodian agreed to lift custodianship in CARDINAL of them . He declined to do so in CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . He agreed to lift the custodianship in the CARDINAL non - sales cases . CARDINAL of these concerned agreements with the NORP - Cypriot owners following negotiations for the purchase of the property by the Government at an agreed price reflecting its present day value . In the remaining case custodianship was lifted in respect of a transfer under a will .", "CARDINAL . NORP In summary , of the CARDINAL cases lodged prior to CARDINAL DATE , custodianship was lifted in CARDINAL cases and was not lifted in CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . In total , the Custodian has decided CARDINAL applications to date . In CARDINAL cases he lifted custodianship and in CARDINAL he refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cases in which custodianship was lifted , the owners had their ordinary residence abroad and did not occupy NORP - Cypriot property in the north of GPE . In CARDINAL of them the owners were permanently settled in areas controlled by the Republic . In the remaining case the owner was permanently settled in the north of the island and custodianship was lifted in order to enable the administrator of the estate of a deceased NORP - Cypriot owner to sell part of the property to cover administration costs and enable distribution of the property to the heirs . Aside from this case , all other cases in which custodianship was lifted concerned sales , either to NORP - Cypriot buyers or to the Government .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL cases in which the Custodian refused to lift custodianship were sales cases . In CARDINAL of them , the owners were permanently settled in the north of the island and occupied NORP - Cypriot property . In these cases the occupation of NORP - Cypriot property was a factor taken into account by the Custodian but was not , in most of these cases , the only factor . In CARDINAL cases the owners alleged that they had their ordinary residence abroad but failed to substantiate the claim despite being requested to do so and in CARDINAL cases the owners failed to provide any details about their place of residence despite being requested to do so . In these cases the failure to provide the information was a factor taken into account by the Custodian as it was possible that they occupied NORP - Cypriot property in the north of the island . It was not , however , the only factor . Other relevant factors included low sale prices indicating that buyers were seeking to take advantage of the abnormal situation in order to make a profit at the expense of the owner . In CARDINAL cases the owners had their ordinary residence abroad but also occupied NORP - Cypriot property in the north of the island . In these cases the occupation of NORP - Cypriot property was the only reason for not lifting the custodianship . Finally , in CARDINAL cases the owners had their ordinary residence abroad and did not occupy NORP - Cypriot property in the north of the island . In these cases the Custodian weighed all relevant factors ; in most cases the sale price was significantly lower than the property \u2019s market value .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cases decided by the Custodian involved claims for compensation . In CARDINAL cases , civil proceedings had previously been lodged in FAC for damages for trespass ( loss of rents ) . These proceedings were withdrawn following the lifting of the custodianship . In the remaining case , the buyer filed civil proceedings in ORG under the amended law on DATE seeking damages for a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL as a result of the Custodian \u2019s decision not to lift the custodianship of a property subject to a saleagreement with the NORP - Cypriot owners . The Custodian subsequently agreed to lift custodianship and the proceedings were withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . Following the entry into force of the amendments to LAW , CARDINAL civil actions were filed with ORG against GPE and the Custodian alleging a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL and claiming compensation and other remedies .", "CARDINAL . Of these , CARDINAL actions concerned refusals by the Custodian prior to CARDINAL DATE to lift custodianship so that the property could be transferred under sale agreements . Of these , CARDINAL ( the ORG proceedings lodged by a buyer described in paragraph CARDINAL above ) was subsequently withdrawn . In another an application has been made to the Custodian for re - examination , which is pending . The plaintiffs in CARDINAL of the cases claim compensation for damage and loss caused by the refusal to lift custodianship and thereby allow a property transfer to be effected pursuant to a sale agreement , as well as general damages for the alleged violation of the ORG as a result of the custodianship . They also seek declaratory judgments that they are entitled to exercise their ownership rights , and orders lifting the custodianship . In the case in which re - examination has been requested , no compensation is sought : the claim brought by the heir of a deceased NORP - Cypriot owner was for a declaratory judgment recognising her right to the property and an order lifting the custodianship .", "CARDINAL . The remaining CARDINAL actions concern a refusal of the Custodian before DATE to lift custodianship and return the property to the owners free of occupation . Damages for loss of use and for an alleged violation of LAW No . CARDINAL are also claimed .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , CARDINAL cases are pending before FAC .
