The applicant was born in DATE and lives in FAC . He is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in drug trafficking as a member of an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand until DATE in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question . The court considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings given the risk that he might obstruct them . This suspicion was , in the court \u2019s view , justified by the fact that the applicant had been acting in an organised criminal group , \u201c the members of which had not been identified \u201d . The court also stressed the severity of the likely sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was repeatedly extended by several decisions of ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) . In their decisions , the courts repeatedly relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged , the serious nature of the offences and the risk that the applicant , as a member of an organised criminal group , would obstruct the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with ORG against the applicant and CARDINAL other co - accused . The prosecutor requested CARDINAL witnesses to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , extending the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE , noted that the length of the investigation had already been excessive and ordered that , by DATE extended detention ( that is , by DATE ) , ORG commence the trial and hear all the defendants in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed its decision .", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG instructions were not followed by ORG . After DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended CARDINAL more times and the measure has still not been lifted .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer , relying on the applicant \u2019s state of health and his family situation , requested the court to vary the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request , again invoking the serious nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged and the risk that he would obstruct the proceedings . As regards the applicant \u2019s health and his family situation the court found that :", "\u201c It emerges from the information received from ORG doctor that the applicant can be treated in detention .... The applicant \u2019s family situation is not so different from the situation of most families where a husband and father is imprisoned . However , the applicant \u2019s wife runs her own business , which secures her and her children a basic income . It is true that the applicant \u2019s apartment has been sold at auction but , in the court \u2019s view , any possible eviction is still a long way off and even then the applicant and his family can obtain alternative accommodation . Lifting the applicant \u2019s detention order would not change the living conditions of his family much . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was further extended by ORG on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and on DATE . The applicant appealed against all those decisions , apart from the CARDINAL given on DATE , but they were confirmed by ORG . In all those decisions ORG relied basically on the same grounds , repeating the arguments relating to the suspicion against the applicant , the serious nature of the offences with which he had been charged , the severity of the penalty to which he was liable and the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings . The suspicion was justified , in the court \u2019s view , by the charge of acting in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is still detained and the proceedings before the first - instance court have not yet been terminated .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand ( aresztowanie tymczasowe ) , the grounds for its extension , release from detention and rules governing other \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) are stated in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of ORG v.
