On DATE the applicant brought an action against the city council before ORG for recovery of possession of the entire building .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the court granted the action for recovery of possession and recognised the applicant as the building 's owner . It held that the applicant 's father had not been among those individuals to whom Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had applied , since he was specifically excluded by its LAW . It ordered the city council to return the building to the applicant . The judgment became final and , in the absence of an appeal , became legally binding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , under PERSON no .

On DATE the applicant and the representatives of the city council signed a memorandum assigning possession of the part of the building which had not been affected by the above - mentioned contracts of sale ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . They noted that , in order for the rest of the building to be returned to the applicant , the contracts concluded with the tenants would first have to be set aside .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed the main claim lodged by the city council and allowed in part the applicant 's interlocutory request .", "At the same time , the court held that the agreements concerning the sale of the flats were valid , on the ground that the applicant had not proved that the parties thereto had been acting in bad faith .

It dismissed the idea that communication of the introductory claim for recovery of possession amounted to notification , on the ground that the judgment of DATE did not refer to the exact date on which the claim had been lodged .", "The court also held that the purchasers would have been unable , by taking reasonable steps , to find out about the existence of the action for recovery of possession brought by the applicant against the city council .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG gave judgment against him , considering that he had not proved that the purchasers were acting in bad faith when the contracts were concluded . It observed that possible bad faith on the part of the city council did not implicitly entail that of the purchasers .", "ORG also held that at the time of the sale the purchasers did not know , and could not have found out by taking reasonable steps , that the ORG was not the rightful owner of the building . In addition , it considered that the application for restitution lodged by the applicant with the city council in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) did not affect the purchasers ' good faith , given that in DATE the local authorities had informed the applicant that , under PERSON no . LANGUAGE , he was entitled only to damages and not to the return of the property .", "CARDINAL . In NORP law , the concept of \u201c title \u201d refers to the legal act by which the right of ownership is acquired , namely , for example , through sale , gift or succession , or through the nationalisation law and its practical implementation in the actions of the legally empowered administrative authorities .", "Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was one of the nationalisation decrees that was widely applied with regard to immovable property ; under it , numerous buildings , listed in the schedules annexed to the decree and which belonged to former industrialists , owners of large estates , bankers and owners of large trading enterprises , were nationalised . LAW of the decree expressly excluded from its scope immovable property belonging to workers , civil servants , small artisans , persons working in intellectual professions and retired persons .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of special legislation governing the legal status of nationalised immovable property , the courts initially considered that they had jurisdiction to deal with cases concerning such property , particularly where it had been nationalised in application of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In those disputes , the national courts held that they had jurisdiction to rule on whether the provisions of the various nationalisation decrees met the substantive and procedural requirements laid down in the Constitutions in force when they were adopted .", "During this initial phase , the loss of ownership as a result of nationalisation was considered to have involved a transfer of \u201c title \u201d if , at the time of expropriation , there had been compliance with the relevant decrees , the LAW and the international treaties to which GPE was a party .", "CARDINAL . In a second period , subsequent to ORG departure from precedent on DATE , the national courts no longer considered that they had jurisdiction to analyse the application of the nationalisation decrees and to order the return of immovable property nationalised in application of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . They considered that legislation alone could bring the nationalisations carried out under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL into accord with the provisions of the LAW concerning the right of property ( see also GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-VII ) .", "CARDINAL . In a third period the State enacted PERSON no . LANGUAGE , which allowed for the sale to tenants of nationalised buildings which had passed lawfully into the ownership of the ORG . The return of nationalised buildings to the former owners or their heirs was possible only if they lived in those buildings as tenants or if the property was unoccupied and had not been rented out . In respect of property which did not fulfil those conditions , it was open to the former owners to request compensation .", "In decision no . CARDINAL , which was binding on the authorities responsible for implementing the PERSON , the government defined nationalised buildings legally vested in the ORG as those which had passed into the ownership of the ORG under a legislative provision . Under the same decision , PERSON no . DATE was not applicable to immovable property held de facto by the ORG , that is , where ownership was not based on any legislative provision , given that the ORG had no title to such property .", "CARDINAL . Legal opinion , followed in practice by the national courts , found that ORG \u201c title \u201d as governed by decision no . CARDINAL implied the existence of a legislative provision authorising nationalisation . It was sufficient for the ORG merely to refer to legislation that was in force at the time of the nationalisation of a property for its expropriation to be considered as having taken place lawfully ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , PERSON preluate abuziv .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL had been included in the schedules annexed to the decree for it to be considered as having been nationalised \u201c by transfer of title \u201d , irrespective of whether or not the substantive and procedural requirements imposed by the decree had been met at the time of nationalisation .", "CARDINAL . Having sold off , under decision no . CARDINAL , part of the immovable property considered to have been nationalised \u201c by transfer of title \u201d , in a fourth period , marked by the adoption and entry into force of government decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on DATE , the executive amended and added to the definition of the immovable property which had been nationalised \u201c by transfer of title \u201d . It introduced an additional condition : under LAW of the latter decision , property acquired by the ORG through transfer of title was that which had been acquired in accordance with the requirements of the decrees in force at the material time . The decision also provided :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . Residential property which passed into ORG ownership in violation of the legislative provision in force at the material time , or where ORG ownership was not based on any legislative provision , shall be considered as having passed into ORG ownership without title , and is excluded from the scope of PERSON no .

NORP and for which the ORG has no valid title . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to precedent , as confirmed by the practice of the domestic courts , decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL is considered to apply not only to property expropriated in fact , but also to that acquired in violation of the legal requirements imposed by the nationalisation decree , both of which were held to have been nationalised \u201c without title \u201d ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , op . cit , p. CARDINAL ; similarly , PERSON , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cited above , p. CARDINAL , and Drept civil , cited above , p. CARDINAL ; and judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Property acquired by ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was considered to have been nationalised by transfer of title if the legal requirements set out in GPE I \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and II of the decree were met on the date of the nationalisation and if , on DATE , the person listed as owner on the annexed schedules was the real lawful owner .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this PERSON provides :", "\u201c Property acquired by the ORG DATE and DATE , provided that it passed into ORG ownership by virtue of a valid title , that is to say in a manner not contrary to the LAW , to international treaties to which GPE was a party or to any legislation in force at the time of its transfer to the State , shall likewise form part of the public or private property of the ORG or other public authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the ORG had sold off , under decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , some of the property nationalised \u201c by transfer of title \u201d , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL introduced a new \u201c validity \u201d condition for ORG title ; the validity of the ORG 's right of ownership became subject to the compliance of the nationalisation decree and its administrative implementing acts with the LAW , the international treaties to which GPE was a party and the laws in force at the date on which the property in question passed into ORG ownership . A contrario , in the absence of such compliance , the ORG did not have valid title and had thus not acquired ownership rights to the immovable property . The former owner could consequently claim it by applying to the competent courts for examination of the \u201c validity \u201d of ORG title ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; similarly , PERSON , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cited above , p. CARDINAL , and Drept civil , cited above , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The courts granted actions for recovery of possession brought against the ORG where they considered that the relevant nationalisation decree had been applied in breach of the conditions set out in it ( see , for example , judgment no .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL to a person who was exempt from its application ; judgments LAW . CARDINAL and DATE of ORG \u2013 failure to comply with the administrative formalities set out in nationalisation Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In certain cases ORG decided , in application of the new condition introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , that certain nationalisation decrees had been contrary to the LAW in force at the time of their adoption and to the international treaties to which GPE had been a party .", "Thus , in judgment no .

Where the seller is not the owner of the possession to be sold , NORP legislation does not explicitly penalise the sale of someone else 's property , which is not regulated by statute .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , published in LAW of ORG in DATE , p. CARDINAL ; judgment no . CARDINAL of FAC ) . In practice , the contract of sale concluded between a seller who is not the owner and the purchaser is binding on them alone ( res inter alios acta ) and not in respect of the rightful owner ; the property does not cease to belong to the rightful owner , who continues to be free to dispose of it ( see , for example , judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG , LAW , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "The fate of the contract depends on the good or bad faith of the parties to it . If the parties acted in bad faith in concluding the contract , in that they were aware that the seller was not the owner of the property , legal opinion and the case - law generally consider that the sale was a speculative operation , was unlawful in purpose and , accordingly , that it is null and void ( fraus omnia corrumpit ) ( see , for example , judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG , published in Summary of the Judicial Practice of the Gala\u0163i Court of Appeal , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "If the parties to the contract , or at least the purchaser , concluded the sale in good faith and if the purchaser was persuaded that the seller fulfilled all the legal requirements to be entitled to transfer title ( LAW ) , the contract is tainted only by relative nullity ( see , for example , judgment no . DATE of ORG , published in the journal PERSON , no . DATE , p. CARDINAL ; judgment CARDINAL of ORG , published in ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The lawful owner can not apply to have such a sale set aside , because he or she is not a party to the contract , but he or she does have the option of defending his or her title by means of an action for recovery of possession if the property is in the purchaser 's possession ( see , for example , judgment no .

Legal opinion and the case - law define an action for recovery of possession , which is not regulated by statute , as an action by which the owner of a specific individual property who has lost possession of it to a third party seeks to have his or her title to the property re - established and to obtain possession of it from the third party , who is not the owner . The claim , as an indefeasible action to establish title which is not subject to limitation of time , is intended to establish directly the existence of the claimant 's title ; obtaining possession is merely an incidental effect .", "The NORP courts have considered that it is sufficient during recovery proceedings to examine the CARDINAL titles , namely those of the claimant and the respondent , in order that the court examining the action may declare that CARDINAL of them had priority ( este mai caracterizat ) over the other on account , for example , of its chronological priority or the fact that it had previously been included in a land register ( see , for example , judgment no .

In a series of more recent judgments , ORG has dismissed actions for recovery of possession brought by former owners against purchasers following the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL while indicating that , where the courts had upheld the sale of someone else 's property , this consolidated , ipso jure , the transfer of title to the purchasers , as such an effect was inherent in the contract of sale and could not be overturned through a comparison of the competing titles to the same property ( judgments nos . DATE , DATE , DATE or DATE of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In other judgments , ORG has dismissed actions brought against purchasers for recovery of possession by applying the theory of appearances ( see , for example , judgments FAC . CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL ) , without however explaining the nature of the joint and unavoidable error or the difference between that and mere good faith on the part of the purchaser ( in judgment no . DATE , ORG noted the purchasers ' \u201c public \u201d error at the time of the sale , because they had considered , when concluding the sale , that the ORG was the rightful owner of the immovable property ; it also noted that the purchasers had been acting in good faith because they had believed that the ORG was the true owner . In contrast , in judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL it refused to apply the same theory on the ground that the purchaser had not proved the existence of a joint and unavoidable error ) .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions , ORG took the view that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no .

Certain domestic courts have ruled that the purchaser must be asked to provide evidence that he or she took reasonable steps to establish the legal status of the property .
