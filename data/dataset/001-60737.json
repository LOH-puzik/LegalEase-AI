SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . By a provisional decision of DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE decided that payments of industrial injury benefits to the applicant , who was born in DATE , should be discontinued as from DATE . This decision was confirmed by a final decision of DATE . The ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s ability to work was not reduced due to her back problems to such an extent that she was entitled to the benefits in question under the applicable rules of LAW ( Lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW )", "CARDINAL . The applicant later requested the ORG to review its decision , which it did on DATE . Save for the grant of benefits for DATE , the ORG upheld its previous decision and also found that the applicant was not entitled to a life annuity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that she was entitled to continued benefits after DATE . She maintained that the medical evidence , on which the ORG \u2019s decision was based , in fact showed that she was entitled to the benefits sought .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . The court \u2019s assessment was based on medical certificates from CARDINAL different physicians who all stated that the applicant was able to work and thus was not entitled to the benefits in question . It did not hold an oral hearing , nor did the applicant request CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . In support of her appeal she invoked medical certificates issued by CARDINAL other physicians . Furthermore , without stating any reasons for her request , she asked the court to hold an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appellate court rejected the request for an oral hearing . After having restated section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG , ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ; see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it gave the following reasons :", "\u201c Having regard to the subject - matter at issue and the information that has so far come to hand in the case , [ the court ] finds that an oral hearing is at present unnecessary . [ The applicant ] is invited to submit her final written observations in the case within DATE after having been notified of this decision .", "The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on the medical evidence submitted in the case , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It also rejected her renewed request for an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4krings\u00f6verdomstolen ) . She complained about the lack of oral hearings in the lower courts . In that respect , she maintained that the case had not been adequately investigated and that an oral hearing had been necessary for her to explain matters of importance to the ORG assessment .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that an oral hearing in the case appeared to be unnecessary . She was given the opportunity to submit further observations on the question of leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was on sick - leave DATE and DATE , during which period she received per diem sickness benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . However , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found that she was no longer entitled to such benefits . At the applicant \u2019s request , the ORG reviewed its decision on DATE but did not change it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , found that the available medical evidence did not show that she was entitled to benefits as from DATE . The appeal was thus rejected . It does not appear that the applicant asked for an oral hearing before this instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . She requested also in this case that the appellate court hold an oral hearing and , moreover , asked it to obtain further medical evidence . On DATE the court rejected the requests , giving the same reasons on the issue of an oral hearing as in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and her renewed request for an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG . She requested again that an oral hearing be held in the case . She also complained about the lack of oral hearings in the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that an oral hearing in the case appeared to be unnecessary . She was given the opportunity to submit further observations on the question of leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . All gainfully employed persons working in GPE are insured against industrial injuries in accordance with LAW . Anyone who is put on the sick - list as a result of an industrial injury and who is insured under LAW is entitled to the same per diem benefit from the ordinary sickness insurance ( social insurance ) during DATE as if he or she had been sick for a reason other than an industrial injury . When DATE have passed , the insured person is entitled to a per diem sickness benefit in accordance with LAW ( industrial injury insurance ) , if his or her ability to carry on with gainful employment is reduced by PERCENT ( PERCENT prior to DATE ) . After the period of sickness has come to an end and the insured person is no longer on the sick - list , he or she is entitled to a life annuity if the capacity for gainful employment is reduced by DATE .", "CARDINAL . All NORP nationals and other residents in GPE are insured in accordance with LAW . Anyone who is registered with ORG and has an DATE income of MONEY ( SEK ) has the right to a per diem sickness benefit , if his or her sickness reduces the ability to work by PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . A decision by ORG under the DATE and DATE Acts may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and , at the relevant time , subject to leave to appeal being granted , to ORG . The latter court was the final instance in social insurance matters until DATE , when it was abolished and its tasks taken over by ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) .", "CARDINAL . The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of LAW . It also regulated the proceedings before ORG . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances was not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
