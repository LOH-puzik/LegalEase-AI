THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , born in DATE . The second applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE . Both live in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by ORG , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant , a paraplegic , is in a wheelchair . He has a pending asylum application in GPE . On TIME DATE the police arrested him pursuant to ORG ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . He was detained in the police station until DATE when he was charged under sections ORG ( possession of articles for suspected terrorist purposes ) and CARDINAL ( collection of information likely to be useful for terrorist purposes ) of the ORG and remanded in custody by ORG . He was held in the prison medical wing . Numerous bail applications were refused until he was released on bail on DATE . He claims that he suffered ill - health during detention , that the facilities in the prison were not adapted for paraplegics and that he developed urinary infections because he was unable to maintain the personal hygiene necessary for the catheter which was in place .", "The second applicant was also arrested on CARDINAL DATE under the ORG . After detention in police custody , he too was charged with offences contrary to sections ORG and CARDINAL of the ORG and remanded in custody by ORG . He was released on DATE when the charges against him were dropped .", "On DATE an article appeared in a legal journal ( Criminal Law Week ) suggesting that sections ORG and CARDINAL of the ORG had lapsed on DATE . On DATE the criminal proceedings against the first applicant were formally discontinued on the basis that the offences of which he had been charged were no longer part of LANGUAGE law .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary made a statement to ORG confirming that the offences in question had indeed lapsed from LANGUAGE law . He said that this had escaped the notice of the draftsman , Ministers ( including himself ) , ORG and the legal profession . The matter had come to light because of the relevant legal article published in DATE and , as soon as the article had been brought to his attention , he had taken legal advice . Once the status of the sections had been clarified , the police had been advised not to rely on them . Certain persons had been erroneously charged on the basis of those lapsed sections and certain steps had been taken to resolve those cases . He referred to the first applicant \u2019s case ( without naming him ) , noting that the indictment had been quashed .", "The applicants applied for compensation for the time spent in detention under the ex gratia compensation scheme operated by ORG .", "In a letter of DATE the ORG representative informed the ORG that the ORG Secretary had made offers of interim ex gratia payments . The applicants had also made a claim for damages against the Commissioner for ORG for false imprisonment , assault and battery and malicious prosecution . The Commissioner had made a pre - issue offer and the applicants had made a counter - offer which was under consideration by the Commissioner .", "The applicants were requested by the ORG , by letter of DATE , to confirm whether they were considering a settlement or withdrawal of the application before the ORG . No response was received .", "By letter dated DATE the Government noted that it was for the Home Secretary to determine eligibility for the ex gratia compensation scheme and he considered that the applicants qualified . The amounts to be awarded would be determined by an independent assessor . While the final awards had not yet been determined , each applicant had been offered an interim payment of MONEY ( GBP ) . The first applicant had not yet accepted this interim award whereas the second applicant had .", "By letter of DATE the ORG requested the applicants to provide full information to the ORG on the current position concerning ex gratia compensation and any civil proceedings .", "By facsimile dated DATE the ORG representative confirmed an interim ex gratia payment of GBP CARDINAL to the first applicant by the Home Secretary and that his final award was being currently assessed . The Home Secretary had made a final ex gratia award of GBP CARDINAL to the second applicant . No admission of liability had been made in either case .", "The ORG representative further confirmed that the applicants had sent a \u201c pre - action \u201d letter to the Commissioner for ORG claiming false imprisonment , assault , battery and malicious prosecution . The threatened civil proceedings had not issued since the Commissioner had paid each applicant ORG in settlement . As to the first applicant , the Commissioner acknowledged that he may well have been unable to prove the lawfulness of the arrest and that the detention following his being charged had been on the basis of lapsed legislation . He expressed regret for unlawfully arresting and detaining the first applicant . With respect to the second applicant , the Commissioner contended that he would have been able to prove the lawfulness of the arrest but acknowledged that the detention following his being charged had been on the basis of lapsed legislation and was therefore unlawful .", "The ORG was first enacted in DATE . It is temporary legislation which lapses after DATE unless renewed . The procedure for such renewal involves laying before ORG a statutory instrument which is subject to affirmative resolution of both ORG .", "The ORG had CARDINAL parts ( I , II , PERSON and V ) and section CARDINAL of ORG DATE inserted a new part ( IV.A ) which included sections ORG and CARDINAL DATE , Part ORG was continued in force , together with the remaining provisions of the ORG , by statutory instruments coming into force on DATE .", "The DATE Order expired on DATE . On DATE ( Partial Continuance ) Order came into force . However , Parts II and ORG had been omitted from that renewal LAW and , therefore , lapsed on DATE .", "ORG operates a discretionary scheme which provides for the ex gratia payment of compensation , upon application , to people who have spent time in custody following a wrongful charge or conviction . The Home Secretary decides whether an individual qualifies for the scheme and an independent assessor calculates the level of ex gratia compensation required ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
