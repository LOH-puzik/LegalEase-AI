The experts confirmed that the landslide \u2013 affecting land which had already been unstable \u2013 could be explained both by the mounting pressure of the gas inside the tip and by the explosion of the gas . Reiterating the public authorities\u2019 obligations and duties under the relevant regulations , the experts concluded that liability for the accident should be apportioned as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) CARDINAL/CARDINAL to ORG , for failing to act sufficiently early to prevent the technical problems which already existed when the tip was first created in DATE and have continued to increase since then , or to indicate to the district councils concerned an alternative waste - collection site , as it was obliged to do under PERSON no .

On DATE the public prosecutor made an order declining jurisdiction ratione personae in respect of the administrative authorities that had been held liable , namely ORG , ORG , ORG and the heads of government from the period DATE . He accordingly referred the case to the GPE governor , considering that it came under LAW , the application of which was a matter for the administrative council of the province of GPE ( \u201c the administrative council \u201d ) . However , the public prosecutor stated in his order that the provisions applicable to the authorities in question were LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , which respectively concerned the offences of negligence in the performance of public duties and negligent homicide .", "In so far as the case concerned the possible liability of the slum inhabitants \u2013 including the applicant \u2013 who were not only victims but had also been accused under LAW , the public prosecutor expressed the opinion that , as the case stood , it was not possible to disjoin their complaints , having regard to sections CARDINAL of the above - mentioned Act .", "On DATE , when the investigation department had completed the preliminary inquiry , the public prosecutor \u2019s file was transmitted to the Ministry .", "CARDINAL .

It has broken its silence and caused death . We knew it and were expecting it . As a district council , we had been hammering at all possible doors for DATE to have this waste - collection site removed . We were met with indifference by ORG . It abandoned the decontamination works ... after laying CARDINAL spades of concrete at the inauguration . The ministries and the government were aware of the facts , but failed to take much notice .

NORP The chief inspector finalised his report on DATE . It endorsed the conclusions reached by all the experts instructed hitherto and took account of all the evidence gathered by the public prosecutor . It also mentioned CARDINAL other scientific opinions sent to ORG in DATE , CARDINAL by ORG and the other by a professor of civil engineering at ORG . These CARDINAL opinions confirmed that the fatal landslide had been caused by the methane explosion . The report also indicated that on DATE the investigation department had requested the city council to inform it of the measures actually taken in the light of the expert report of CARDINAL DATE , and it reproduced Mr PERSON \u2019s reply :", "\u201c Our city council has both taken the measures necessary to ensure that the old sites can be used in the least harmful way possible until DATE and completed all the preparations for the construction of CARDINAL of the biggest and most modern installations ... ever undertaken in our country .

In short , over DATE our city council has been studying the problem of waste very seriously ... [ and ] currently the work is continuing ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The chief inspector concluded , lastly , that the death of CARDINAL people and the injuries to CARDINAL others ( figures available at the material time ) on DATE had been caused by the CARDINAL ORG failure to take appropriate steps in the performance of their duties and that they should be held to account for their negligence under LAW . In spite of , inter alia , the expert report and the recommendation of ORG , they had knowingly breached their respective duties : Mr PERSON because he had failed to comply with his obligation to order the destruction of the illegal huts situated around the rubbish tip , as he was empowered to do under section CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL , and PERSON because he had refused to comply with the above - mentioned recommendation , had failed to renovate the rubbish tip or order its closure , and had not complied with any of the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL , which required him to order the destruction of the slum dwellings in question , if necessary by his own means . However , in his observations the chief inspector did not deal with the question whether LAW was applicable in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG had asked the applicant to contact it , informing him that in an order ( no .

The applicant paid the first DATE instalment on DATE and continued to make payments until DATE . In the meantime , prior to DATE , he had let his flat to a certain GPE for a DATE rent of GPE CARDINAL . It appears that from DATE the authorities had to avail themselves of enforcement proceedings in order to recover the outstanding instalments .", "On DATE the applicant , who by that time had discharged his debt to the city council , gave a notarially recorded undertaking to sell his flat to a certain ORG in return for a down payment of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , the administrative council decided , by a majority , on the basis of the chief inspector \u2019s report , to institute proceedings against Mr PERSON and PERSON for breaching LAW .", "PERSON and PERSON appealed against that decision to ORG , which dismissed their appeal on DATE . The case file was consequently sent back to the public prosecutor , who on DATE committed both mayors for trial in ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The trial before the ORG began on CARDINAL DATE . At the hearing PERSON PERSON stated , among other things , that he could not be expected to have complied with duties which were not incumbent on him or be held solely responsible for a situation which had endured since DATE . Nor could he be blamed for not having renovated the PERSON tip when none of the CARDINAL sites in GPE had been renovated ; in that connection , relying on a number of measures which had nonetheless been taken by the city council , he argued that the tip could not have been fully redeveloped as long as waste continued to be dumped on it . Lastly , he stated : \u201c The elements of the offence of negligence in the performance of duties have not been made out because I did not act with the intention of showing myself to be negligent [ sic ] and because no causal link can be established [ between the incident and any negligence on his part ] . \u201d", "PERSON submitted that the groups of dwellings which had been engulfed dated back to before his election on DATE and that since then he had never allowed slum areas to develop . Accusing ORG and ORG of indifference to the problems , PERSON asserted that responsibility for preventing the construction of illegal dwellings lay with the forestry officials and that , in any event , his district council lacked the necessary staff to destroy such dwellings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG found the CARDINAL mayors guilty as charged , considering their defence to be unfounded .", "The judges based their conclusion , in particular , on the evidence that had already been obtained during the extensive criminal inquiries carried out DATE to DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It also appears from the judgment of CARDINAL DATE that , in determining the share of liability incurred by each of the authorities in question , the judges unhesitatingly endorsed the findings of the expert report drawn up on this precise issue at the public prosecutor \u2019s request , which had been available since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The judges also observed :", "\u201c ... although they had been informed of the [ experts\u2019 ] report , the CARDINAL defendants took no proper preventive measures . Just as a person who shoots into a crowd should know that people will die and , accordingly , can not then claim to have acted without intending to kill , the defendants can not allege in the present case that they did not intend to neglect their duties . They do not bear the entire responsibility , however . ... They were negligent , as were others . In the instant case the main error consists in building dwellings beneath a refuse tip situated on a hillside and it is the inhabitants of these slum dwellings who are responsible . They should have had regard to the risk that the mountain of rubbish would CARDINAL day collapse on their heads and that they would suffer damage . They should not have built dwellings QUANTITY from the tip . They have paid for that recklessness with their lives ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG sentenced Mr PERSON and PERSON to the minimum term of imprisonment provided for in LAW , namely DATE , and to fines of GPE CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , the ORG commuted the prison sentences to fines , so the penalties ultimately imposed were fines of ORG CARDINAL . Satisfied that the defendants would not reoffend , the ORG also decided to suspend enforcement of the penalties in accordance with section CARDINAL of the same PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Both mayors appealed on points of law . They submitted , in particular , that the ORG had gone beyond the scope of LAW in its assessment of the facts , and had treated the case as one of unintentional homicide within the meaning of LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has apparently never been informed of those proceedings or given evidence to any of the administrative bodies of investigation or the criminal courts ; nor does any court decision appear to have been served on him .", "CARDINAL .

The court also held that the applicant was not entitled to claim compensation for the destruction of his slum dwelling given that , following the accident , he had been allocated a subsidised flat and that , although ORG had not exercised its power to destroy the dwelling , there had been nothing to prevent it from doing so at any time .", "The court decided , lastly , not to apply default interest to the sum awarded for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL .

With regard to dwellings built before the PERSON came into force , section QUANTITY provides that , subject to certain conditions , slum inhabitants may purchase the land they occupy and take out low - interest loans in order to finance the construction of buildings which conform to the regulations and urban development plans .

The general information the ORG has been able to procure as to the risk of a methane explosion at such sites may be summarised as follows . Methane ( CHCARDINAL ) and carbon dioxide ( COCARDINAL ) are the CARDINAL main products of methanogenesis , which is the final and longest stage of anaerobic fermentation ( that is , a process taking place in the absence of air ) . These substances are generated , inter alia , by the biological and chemical decomposition of waste . The risks of explosion and fire are mainly due to the large proportion of methane in the biogas . The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CHCARDINAL in the air is PERCENT . If the level rises PERCENT , methane will catch fire but will not explode .", "CARDINAL . It appears from various circulars and regulations in force in ORG member GPE regarding household - waste management and the operation of municipal rubbish tips that the main priorities of the authorities and operators concerned include : isolating waste - disposal sites by ensuring that they are not located within a minimum distance of any housing ; preventing the risk of landslides by creating stable embankments and dykes and using compaction techniques ; and eliminating the risk of fire or biogas explosions .", "As regards the last - mentioned priority , the recommended method for decontaminating sites appears to entail setting up a drainage system for fermentation gases whereby gases are pumped out and treated using a biological filter as the site continues to operate . A gas - extraction system of this kind , provision for which is also made in the Regulations of DATE in force in GPE , generally consists of perforated vertical ducts drilled into the waste or horizontal drains buried in the mass of waste , a ventilation system , a biological filter and a network of suction pipes .", "CARDINAL .

It can be seen from these documents that primary responsibility for the treatment of household waste rests with local authorities , which the governments are obliged to provide with financial and technical assistance . The operation by the public authorities of a site for the permanent deposit of waste is described as a \u201c dangerous activity \u201d , and \u201c loss of life \u201d resulting from the deposit of waste at such a site is considered to be \u201c damage \u201d incurring the liability of the public authorities ( see , inter alia , LAW , LAW ( c)-(d ) and CARDINAL ( a)-(b ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
