According to this report , the Municipality was in actual possession of plot no . CARDINAL/A.", "The GPE denied the allegations and argued that they had been in actual possession of plot no . CARDINAL since DATE . They therefore argued that the applicant \u2019s action for compensation had to be rejected as being time - barred .", "On DATE ORG submitted a sketch plan to ORG of First Instance according to which plot no . CARDINAL was situated next to CARDINAL other plots of land belonging to the applicant and her co - owners and was left by the owners as an access area .", "On DATE ORG of First Instance requested the GPE and GPE Municipalities to submit information on whether plot no . CARDINAL was used by these municipalities .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG of First Instance that the applicant was one of the co - owners of plot no .

CARDINAL was the front access area of the buildings next to the plot and that construction of a building on the plot was not possible .", "The LOC proposed that ORG transfer the title to plot no .
