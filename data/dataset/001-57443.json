AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-2;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , who is a citizen of GPE born in DATE , lives in GPE . He runs a firm that specialises in meat smoking . He bought the production plant from the firm PERSON , which was thereafter called PERSON , following the death of Mr. PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON had been reported under the then applicable legislation to the prosecuting authorities by ORG ( Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr GPE - \" the Institute \" ) for suspected offences resulting from the technique he used for smoking meat . In DATE , during the course of these proceedings , ORG had been asked to draw up an expert report ( GPE ) . In this report , the maximum quantity permissible in smoked meats of a carcinogenic substance called benzopyrene CARDINAL was stated to be CARDINAL part per ( NORP ) billion ( \" ppb \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG After Mr. PERSON had bought the firm , similar complaints were lodged with the prosecuting authorities . These led to the prosecution of the applicant before ORG of Vienna ( CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) and before ORG of GPE ( DATE ) . Basing themselves mainly on the expert opinions of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , these courts came to the conclusion that the products prepared with the impugned smoking technique were dangerous to health because they contained an excessive quantity - more than one ppb - of benzopyrene CARDINAL and that their distribution consequently constituted an infringement of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . It was further found that the products were adulterated ( verf\u00e4lscht ) by reason of an excessive water content not apparent to the consumer , whereby they also contravened section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , of LAW . Mr. PERSON was accordingly convicted . His appeals against these decisions , which are not in issue in the present case , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , ORG of GPE drew CARDINAL samples of smoked meat from the production of the PERSON company , leaving CARDINAL counter - samples from the same pieces to the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG was entrusted with carrying out the analysis of these samples . In its analysis , which was carried out on DATE , the ORG found a benzopyrene concentration of CARDINAL and QUANTITY respectively and an excessive water content . The samples were therefore described as being dangerous to health and adulterated . This opinion by ORG , which had been drafted on DATE by the Director of the Institute , amounted to the lodging of a complaint ( ORG ) ; it was transmitted by ORG to the prosecuting authorities with a view to the institution of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG The case came before the same judge of ORG who in DATE had dealt with an earlier case against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , he again appointed PERSON ORG as expert in order to hear him in connection with the opinion submitted . On DATE , Mr. PERSON challenged both the judge and the expert ; in his contention , the conduct of the proceedings had shown that both were biased against him and resolved to disregard his rights of defence , in particular the right - guaranteed by LAW witnesses and experts for the defence under the same conditions as those for the prosecution . In addition , the applicant asked for the hearing of several experts .", "On DATE , the President of ORG rejected the challenge concerning the investigating judge on the ground that it was unfounded . However , he did not formally examine the challenge concerning the expert , who in fact took part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , at the request of Mr. PERSON , ORG heard as witness Mr. PERSON , the Director of ORG . According to written evidence submitted by this ORG after analysis of the CARDINAL counter - samples , the concentration of benzopyrene was QUANTITY ppb respectively , and there was accordingly no reason for any objections .", "In reply to questioning by both the judge and the expert , the witness explained in detail the method of analysis applied by his ORG , which was very similar to that used by ORG .", "The expert thereafter developed his personal opinion . As regards the benzopyrene concentration , he pointed out that the method employed by ORG was subject to criteria which were especially stringent and rigorously controlled ; its degree of accuracy was maximised and the margin of error did not exceed MONEY . On the other hand , he criticised the method used by the witness ; in his view , the margin of error had to be considerable as the results obtained from each of the CARDINAL counter - samples differed greatly , whereas the ORG \u2019s analysis showed analogous results in both instances . He emphasised that the products made by Mr. PERSON \u2019s firm showed a water content of MONEY , whereas , according to LAW ( Codex PERSON ) , it should not have exceeded MONEY .", "On his side , Mr. PERSON , who was not represented by a lawyer , stated that a water content below MONEY was technically unattainable and requested the hearing of a meat and sausage expert on this point . ORG however refused this , on the ground that black smoking was forbidden if the water content could not be limited to the required level .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment delivered DATE ( DATE ) , ORG found the applicant guilty of offences under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , of LAW and accordingly sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It particularly stressed that , at the time of the takeover of the firm , ORG had informed Mr. PERSON of the requirements of LAW , that the applicant was aware of the criminal proceedings instituted against his predecessor and that , moreover , he too had been the subject of criminal proceedings for the same reasons but had nonetheless continued his production without changing method .", "ORG considered that the expert opinion of the Director of the ORG was conclusive and that there were no doubts as to the reliability of his findings . It shared his view that the different results at which ORG had arrived were erroneous . Even allowing for a margin of error of MONEY in the ORG \u2019s findings , it held that the concentration of benzopyrene in the applicant \u2019s products was by far in excess of the permissible level ( QUANTITY ) . The carcinogenic effects of this substance were found to have been established by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; the evidence to the contrary adduced by the applicant - in particular letters from CARDINAL NORP experts and a publication written by CARDINAL other experts - did not seem convincing to it .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON appealed . In essence , he took issue with the Director of the Institute for not having adhered to the opinion of his colleagues , which - in Mr. PERSON \u2019s view - nevertheless reflected the prevailing view , and submitted that the Director was biased . He also raised objections of principle against the appointment as court expert of the very person who had reported the case to the prosecuting authorities , and complained that this person had been heard as a court expert whereas Mr. PERSON had appeared as a mere defence witness ; this seemed to him contrary to the requirements of LAW . In addition , he requested the hearing of several experts .", "ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . As to the carcinogenic effects of benzopyrene , it noted that ORG had based its decision on the opinion of ORG , which , according to settled case - law , could not be contested . Apart from that , ORG had extensively dealt with all relevant aspects of the case before holding that the products made by the applicant were adulterated and dangerous to health . The findings of ORG were not open to doubt as they were based on the detailed explanations of the expert . As the latter had already refuted Mr. PERSON \u2019s arguments , it was not necessary to take any additional evidence on the adulterated and dangerous character of the said products . In particular , ORG ruled out the hearing of a counter - expert since the expert opinion obtained in the first - instance proceedings was not tainted with any defects ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . Finally , it rejected the challenge of ORG as expert ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following analysis of samples taken in DATE and DATE from products made by the applicant \u2019s firm , the ORG once more found an excessive concentration of benzopyrene ( QUANTITY ppb ) and an undeclared high water - content .", "Criminal proceedings were accordingly instituted against the applicant before ORG . The case came before the same judge as before , who again appointed the Director of the ORG as expert pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Hearings were held on DATE . Invoking Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , Mr. PERSON unsuccessfully challenged the expert . ORG pointed out that LAW required the appointment of an expert from the staff of the ORG ; it added that even though the Director had previously given opinions unfavourable to applicant , this did not substantiate the challenge .", "The expert then presented his report . When ORG examined him on recent research said to support the views of the applicant , he acknowledged that this research had arrived at less emphatic results on the carcinogenic effects of benzopyrene ; but , according to him , this did not cause the opinion of ORG to lose any of its validity in the particular circumstances . In reply to defence counsel \u2019s questions , he explained the method for analysing foodstuffs used by ORG , which made it possible to detect MONEY of benzopyrene ; he conceded that this method differed from the one used by ORG , but declared himself not to be bound by the findings of a foreign authority . The defence asked for the hearing of witnesses on the subject ; ORG did not accede to this request , considering itself sufficiently informed through the opinions of ORG and the expert from ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ( DATE ) , ORG found the applicant guilty of offences against sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . For reasons almost identical to those stated in the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON appealed from this decision on grounds similar to those pleaded in the first proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . In its view , the appointment of a particular person as expert was not prohibited unless the person lacked competence to give evidence as a witness ( Article CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , of LAW ) ; apart from this , the applicant had failed to adduce any reasons casting doubt on the impartiality and professional qualifications of ORG . Whilst the Director had admittedly already formulated opinions unfavourable to the applicant on several occasions , this did not warrant his being challenged , as ORG had rightly noted . As regards the alleged violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the Court of Appeal emphasised that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act required that the official of the ORG who had analysed the samples taken or drawn up the report should be appointed as expert . Rejecting the request for counter - expertise made by Mr. PERSON , ORG reiterated , as far as the remaining issues were concerned , the reasoning contained in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the Federal President , exercising his power to grant a pardon , commuted the CARDINAL prison sentences imposed on the applicant to fines of CARDINAL and QUANTITY ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under the terms of LAW , ORG of a city shall periodically draw samples of foodstuffs and send them for analysis to ORG ( section CARDINAL ) , making available a sealed counter - sample to be used by any private expert that the firm subjected to control might wish to consult . This expert must possess special professional qualifications and have a special authorisation from ORG ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "Several members of the ORG \u2019s staff are involved in the examination of the samples , for which purpose standard scientific techniques are employed . The various results are submitted to the Director of ORG , who draws up a report .", "If the ORG has cause to suspect the commission of an offence , it must state so in its report and notify the responsible authorities ( section CARDINAL ) . In practice , the report ( Anzeigegutachten ) is sent to ORG , which in such cases transmits it to the public prosecutor \u2019s department . The prosecuting authorities have to decide whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought , but they usually adhere to the ORG \u2019s opinion .", "CARDINAL . ORG Whilst the provisions of LAW are applicable in such cases , section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act involves a derogation from them in so far as expert evidence is concerned :", "\" If the court has doubts concerning the findings or the opinion of a ORG or if it considers that such findings or opinion need to be amplified or if justifiable objections have been raised in respect thereof , it shall hear as expert the official of the said ORG who carried out the analysis or drew up the report for the purpose of explaining and supplementing the findings or the report ... In all other respects , expert evidence shall be governed by the provisions of LAW ... \"", "Under LAW , the prosecuting authorities and the accused are to be informed of the names of the experts appointed by the court ; should they raise valid objections , other experts are to be consulted .", "Thus , the court is bound to appoint CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s officials who carried out the analysis or formulated the opinion . This official may be the person who drew up the report which served as the complaint prompting the criminal proceedings ; such a circumstance is not capable of giving cause for a challenge . Should there be other grounds , such as a personal bias against the accused , the expert may be replaced by another official of ORG who took part in the analysis and in the drafting of the opinion .", "If any doubts persist or if the findings of these experts \" are unclear , vague , contradictory \" , etc . ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) , the court may call another expert .", "Under the terms of LAW , only the prosecutor and the defence counsel or the accused are entitled to put questions to witnesses and experts . Nevertheless , the court may authorise experts to examine witnesses and the accused . Witnesses , on the contrary , do not have this possibility .", "CARDINAL . ORG The provisions of LAW , as well as certain practices followed by the courts and the Institutes , have been the subject of controversy in academic writings and on the occasion of an enquiry organised in DATE by ORG . The matter was debated in ORG prior to the passing of the LAW and subsequently in DATE when a proposed amendment to section CARDINAL was examined ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This amendment , which was not in fact adopted , provided that both the ORG \u2019s expert and any private expert called by the accused were to be heard only as witnesses and that , in case of doubt , an independent expert should be appointed .", "The receipt by ORG officials of certain bonus payments also gave rise to some discussion which subsequently provoked their discontinuance ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report , paragraph CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s memorial and point ORG memorial ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
