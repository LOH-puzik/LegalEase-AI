She had also been concerned about the consequences , including psychological ones , that an abortion might have . The headmaster was of the view , relying on a conversation he had had with the class teacher and with the school social pedagogue , that the first applicant might be under pressure from her family . He was concerned that the second applicant had not sought psychological assistance for her daughter , who , it had been suggested by the school , might have suicidal tendencies .
