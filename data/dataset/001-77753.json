The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a journalist and film critic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG film \u201c The People vs. PERSON \u201d was released to cinemas in GPE . Prior to that , the film was promoted , inter alia , by means of a poster placed in the streets . In the poster the main character had the flag of the GPE around his hips and he was depicted as crucified on a woman \u2019s pubic area dressed in a bikini .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u201c Common Declaration of Ecumenical Council of Churches and of the NORP Bishops\u2019 Conference \u201d was published . The declaration protested against the display of the poster as being a profanation of God . ORG subsequently associated itself with the declaration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Archbishop Mons . PERSON made the following declaration on ORG :", "\u201c In DATE we are witnessing \u2018 the humiliation of the crucifix\u2019 . In spite of all protests of the NORP Bishops\u2019 Conference and ORG aimed at stopping the production and distribution of the poster promoting the film of ORG : \u2018 The People versus PERSON Flynt\u2019 this poster is present in the streets of our capital GPE . It is a defamation of the symbol of the NORP religion . ORG did not allow this blasphemy . It was not allowed in GPE and GPE either . How is it possible that it was allowed in GPE which professes the tradition of PERSON and PERSON , that is the NORP religion , even in the LAW ? ... Therefore we request the Government , the ORG , our public officials within the legislature and judiciary to examine the entire issue and take appropriate measures for withdrawal of the posters and the film and to hold accountable those who violated the laws ... We hope that our protest will be viewed favourably by the responsible officials and that redress will be made . To all those who endeavour to do so we express our sincere thanks in advance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE ORG published an article written by the applicant . The DATE was at that time published in CARDINAL copies and it mainly concentrated on political commentary and specialised articles on economy , philosophy , natural sciences and culture . It was aimed at intellectually - oriented readers .", "CARDINAL . The article was entitled \u201c The falcon is sitting in the maple tree ; PERSON and CARDINAL slaps to the hypocrite \u201d . In it the applicant criticised Archbishop PERSON . It did not mention that it had been written in reaction to the above TV broadcast of the Archbishop . The article reads as follows :", "\u201c I. As is generally known , the LOC is a flat board . Even if it is not a flat board , the LOC turns around it . Even if it does not turn , the church dignitary made love to his mother .", "II . The text may go on as follows : \u2018 Even if he did not make love ... \u2019 He did . Proves : ( a ) PERSON won a ORG trial in the GPE . ( b ) The church dignitary is a \u2019trtko\u2019 . This all will acknowledge who saw him at least on TV .", "III . I profoundly hate using the word \u2018 trtka\u0165\u2019 . The indispensable exceptions can be counted on the fingers of PERSON \u2019s left hand :", "CARDINAL . \u2019Trtkaj\u2019 is the nickname of a former professor at ORG at ORG during the period of \u2018 normalisation\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . NORP \u2019Trt\u2019 is a rarely used acclamation for [ negating something ] or the equivalent of the negation term \u2018 shit\u2019 used in the GPE region .", "CARDINAL . \u2019Trtko\u2019 is DATE as from a certain DATE the same as the perhaps more colourful and euphemistic \u2018 trotko\u0161\u2019 . Such a person does not make love , nor does he ... At the utmost \u2013 oh \u2013 [ the verb \u2018 trtka\u0165\u2019 is used ] ; poor mother .", "IV . GPE is not a NORP State . ( When NORP church dignitaries requested the prohibition of the PERSON poster , they had not even thought , fearful ones , of requesting prohibition of the film . They also alleged that GPE was a NORP State . Alas , a glimpse at the first articles of the constitution shows that the NORP people live in liberty , democracy and that it is their private affair whether of not they believe . Not a single word about a NORP State . )", "A ORG would be equally as intolerable as an NORP State , for example GPE . It indirectly follows that none of the western GPE is NORP . The long - lasting separation of church from the ORG is to be considered as a major victory of spirit over matter . ( I now disregard the fact that your neighbours in an NORP or NORP village will make your life difficult if you leave the church ) .", "The continuation of certain ceremonials is no proof that a ORG is \u2018 ORG . For example , the NORP President ends the oath with the ritual words : \u2018 So help me God\u2019 . However , PERSON refused to swear on the Bible with the explanation that he did not believe in God . Of course , the judge was satisfied with his statement that he would tell the truth . The NORP President could act likewise , but he would complicate his political life . The number of political struggles which we are able to fight in our life is limited . It is thus more important that PERSON should send soldiers to GPE than the fact that he finally did not send there soldiers who were openly homosexual .", "V. Given that the archbishop apparently lacks any sex - appeal it is entirely irrelevant whether in the inside of his body he is homosexual or bisexual ( as PERSON Love in the film ) or whatever . What matters , however , is his positive lustration finding . This principal representative of the first NORP church has not even as much honour as the leader of the last gypsy band in his bow !", "I do not understand at all why decent NORP do not leave the organisation which is headed by such an ogre . Are they waiting until he dies ? That is too weak . No member of ORG maintains in his or her defence : \u2018 I waited until PERSON and PERSON had died . Then I would make an effort to ensure ORG . Otherwise we would still live in the trees .", "VI . As we actually do \u2013 in the figurative sense . The success of \u2018 FAC ( there is not a jot of paedophilia , not a single fellatio in that film ) shows how pale the world has become . PERSON is the hunted one . It is true that the NORP President received him , but it is unthinkable that the NORP President would do the same . The latter preferred joining the archbishop in his effusions . Which \u2018 ORG advised him to do so : PERSON , PERSON ?", "VII . NORP The real PERSON published and continues publishing materials that are scurrilous . Their degree of effrontery exceeded the threshold accepted up to then . So what ? The real PERSON acted in the film as a judge and in his role he made unacceptable statements . That was however foreseen in the script . The NORP archbishop makes unacceptable statements without being ordered to do so by anyone . And nothing ? ! ORG , all is vanity .", "At the request of the editorial office I leave it to the kind readers to pronounce a judgment as to the degree of scurrility of the NORP archbishop . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently CARDINAL associations complained that the religious feelings of their members had been offended by the article . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant . Archbishop PERSON first joined the proceedings as an aggrieved person . He later withdrew from the case and waived his right to claim compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of an offence under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW . The relevant operational part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c ... as author of the article \u2018 The falcon is sitting in the maple tree ; PERSON and CARDINAL slaps to the hypocrite\u2019 ... stating inter alia : \u2018 This principal representative of the first NORP church has not even as much honour as the leader of the last gypsy band in his bow ! I do not understand at all why decent NORP do not leave the organisation which is headed by such an ogre ... \u2019 , to which the local association of the PERSON and ORG in GPE and ORG in GPE reacted independently of each other as offending their religious feelings , the applicant publicly defamed a group of citizens for their faith . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL NORP korunas , to be converted into DATE imprisonment in the event that he deliberately attempted to avoid payment of the sum .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant explained that his article had been a reaction to statements by Archbishop PERSON broadcast in the main evening news bulletin of ORG in DATE . The applicant considered the ORG \u2019s proposal to prohibit the distribution of both the poster and the film to be contrary to the principles of a NORP society and , in particular , the freedom of expression . The applicant considered it appropriate to express his view openly as in the TV broadcast no one had been given the opportunity to express a different view from that of the Archbishop . He did not consider the Archbishop to be morally spotless as he had learned that he had been registered in the files of the former NORP secret police . The applicant underlined that he had not intended to offend the feelings of members of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to his article , the applicant stated that it was not a commentary but a literary joke with ideas and associations which , admittedly , might be appreciated only by a couple of intellectuals . The applicant stressed that it had not been his intention to accuse the Archbishop of incest as the relevant passage related to the film in question in which a preacher had allegedly committed incest with his mother . His statement concerning the alleged scurrility of the NORP Archbishop had no erotic connotation , the applicant had in mind exclusively the moral failings of the person criticised .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also explained that he had not been able to publish any articles for DATE and that ORG had stopped co - operating with him following the publication of the above article .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the criminal proceedings the ORG stated that he did not understand the purpose of the applicant \u2019s attack against his person , his mother and the church which he represented . He further stated that he had pardoned the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court heard the representatives of the CARDINAL associations which had filed a criminal complaint against the applicant . They stated that the applicant had offended and scandalised NORP worshippers in that , inter alia , he had invited them to leave their church if they considered themselves to be decent and alleged that the representative of the church was an ogre .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence taken ORG found that the applicant had committed an offence under LAW in that in his article as a whole , and in particular by the words quoted in the operative part of its judgment , he had defamed the highest representative of ORG in GPE and thereby offended the members of that church . In particular , the applicant \u2019s statement in which he wondered why decent members of the church did not leave it had blatantly discredited and disparaged a group of citizens for their NORP faith . In doing so the applicant had placed ORG at the level of an organisation to which decent NORP should not belong and which they should leave . The applicant should have been aware that his article was capable of offending the interests of other persons protected by law . Given that a high proportion of citizens of GPE were NORP , the applicant through his article harmed the religious feelings of a considerable number of persons .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the associations which had filed the criminal complaint against him appealed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that he had committed no offence and that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression . He referred to constitutional provisions , international instruments and the practice of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The representatives of the complaining associations expressed the view that the sentence imposed on the applicant was too lenient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed both appeals . It held that the first - instance court had established the relevant facts with sufficient certainty and that it had correctly applied the relevant law . As to the applicant \u2019s arguments relating to his right to freedom of expression , ORG held :", "\u201c It is true that LAW as well as LAW guarantee the freedom of expression and the right to information .", "Thus it is not disputed that , LAW , each citizen has the right to receive , seek and impart any information , however only to the extent that the constitutional rights and freedoms of others are not thereby violated . This conclusion can be indirectly deduced from ORG finding PL \u00daS CARDINAL in which ORG held that \u2018 All fundamental rights and freedoms are protected only to the extent that availing oneself of a right or freedom does not disproportionately restrict or even negate a different right or freedom\u2019 .", "The article \u2018 The falcon is sitting in the maple tree ; PERSON and CARDINAL slaps to the ORG is not of a common journalistic standard ; the accused admitted this at the main hearing and ORG considers that it goes beyond the principles of journalistic ethics . [ ORG ] is also aware that LAW protects the freedom of expression not only in cases of \u2018 information and ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference , but also to those that offend , shock or disturb or worry the ORG or any part of GPE . The members of the appellate court \u2019s chamber believe that even in such cases certain limits exist which should not be exceeded . The article in question is vulgar and it ridicules and offends . In the view of ORG it therefore enjoys no protection . Otherwise media could easily become distributors of , inter alia , various malevolent expressions which diminish human dignity . That would certainly not correspond to the spirit and principles of democracy . By the contents of the published article the accused violated the rights , guaranteed by LAW , of other persons DATE namely a group of inhabitants with NORP faith . He thereby offended their religious feelings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the qualification of the applicant \u2019s action under the NORP criminal law and the penalty imposed , ORG upheld the reasoning of the first - instance court . Finally , ORG pointed out that the associations concerned lacked standing to challenge by means of an appeal the sentence imposed on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complied with the order to reimburse to ORG the costs of the proceedings amounting to SKK CARDINAL .", "On DATE the company VMV a.s . paid , on behalf of the applicant , SKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the ORG with reference to the pecuniary penalty which had been imposed on him .
