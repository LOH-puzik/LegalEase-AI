In the meantime on DATE , ORG ( OAN ) ( hereinafter \u201c the CAN \u201d ) had asked the applicant to submit an explanation as to the facts surrounding the criminal proceedings . By a letter of DATE , the applicant informed the CAN that no charges had been issued against him and that any impugned conduct had not been in connection with the carrying out of his profession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the issuance of a bill of indictment against the applicant , the CAN once again asked him for explanations , and the applicant submitted the relevant bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . Following the delivery of the first - instance judgment , on DATE the CAN requested the applicant to provide a copy of the operative part of the judgment .

On DATE , the applicant challenged that decision before ORG ( libere professioni ) ( CNLP ) , hereinafter \u201c the Commission \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commission rejected the applicant \u2019s challenge concerning prescription on the basis that the decision of CARDINAL DATE was not a decision on the merits , namely as to whether or not to apply the disciplinary measure , and thus was not subject to an autonomous challenge . Such a challenge could be raised in the context of an appeal in the event of the CAN ordering a disciplinary measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the decision of the Commission .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s challenge and upheld the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment of DATE in the criminal proceedings against the applicant , on DATE the CAN informed the applicant that disciplinary proceedings were to be continued and that he was to appear at a hearing .", "CARDINAL . Hearings in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer took place on CARDINAL and DATE , and written submissions were also filed . The applicant made submissions concerning , inter alia , the invalidity of the CAN owing to its constitution ; the generic nature of the accusation ; the fact that the impugned conduct had taken place outside the ambit of his professional activities ; and the lack of proportionality of the measure . He also reiterated his argument that the disciplinary action was time - barred , and requested the suspension of the measure . Without prejudice to his arguments he claimed that in any event , the sanction should not be anything other than suspension for DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the CAN disbarred the applicant . It noted that LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE provided that disbarment applied ( importa , di diritto ) in cases of a final finding of guilt under LAW ( relevant to the present case ) . Thus , the CAN had no room for evaluation , discretion or decision making , save for the determination of whether an irrevocable criminal judgment finding guilt actually existed . In the present case , that fact had been ascertained and the judgment had been submitted by the applicant himself . It followed that the CAN \u2019s finding applying such a sanction was simply declaratory , the legislator having prescribed mandatory disbarment in such cases . It further rejected the applicant \u2019s plea concerning prescription in respect of the disciplinary action and his request for suspension of the disciplinary proceedings . It also considered that the disciplinary punishments provided for by law were justified by a general principle , namely that of behaving in line with the duties of correctness , dignity and honour for the profession , even beyond the exercise of the professional activity , in so far as such behaviour may harm the common beliefs of the community . Indeed , the law ( LAW no . DATE ) could only be interpreted in the sense that actions undertaken outside the scope of one \u2019s activity must be subject to disciplinary action if they affected society \u2019s values , reflected on the professional reputation of lawyers or notaries , or compromised the image of the forensic and notarial categories . The correctness of this interpretation was evident given that , according to the law , a finding of guilt brought about disbarment mandatorily , as well as from the wording of LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning the statute of ORG , and the correlation between law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL and legislative decree no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commission confirmed the decision of the CAN in its entirety and rejected the applicant \u2019s challenges concerning the prescription of the disciplinary action , and the composition and constitution of the CAN . It also rejected his allegations concerning the lack of detail about the accusation , the automatic application of the sanction and the incoherence of the CAN \u2019s decision , which had not followed the expert opinion . As for the applicant \u2019s complaint that the facts that had led to the accusation had occurred outside his professional duties , as well as the proportionality of the measure , the Commission referred back to the decision of the CAN , which had found that such arguments were irrelevant given the content of LAW no . DATE and its application in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG , reiterating the arguments he had already put forward .", "CARDINAL . In his application lodged on DATE against the decision of ORG of DATE , the applicant raised a number of pleas ( in a DATE document ) . His pleas concerned issues relating to the law and its application , whether in substance or as a matter of procedure .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his requests dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant raised CARDINAL more procedural pleas . In a further request he also challenged the constitutional legitimacy of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of legislative decree no . DATE in so far as they did not provide for the possibility of requesting the withdrawal of or abstention by persons sitting on the disciplinary body . He also challenged the legitimacy of LAW no . DATE and Article CARDINAL of legislative decree no . DATE . The applicant argued that the fact that the legislation provided for an automatic sanction , without the possibility of a progressive application of sanctions depending on the specific case , subject to evaluation by the disciplinary body , was contrary to the principles of reasonableness and proportionality .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s pleas concerning the irregularity of the CAN \u2019s constitution . In particular , as to the constitutional legitimacy of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of legislative decree no . DATE , it considered that , in the present case , the applicant \u2019s inability to request the withdrawal of a member of the organ had not breached his rights . As to the constitutional legitimacy of LAW no . DATE and LAW no . DATE , the court considered that the automatic application of a sanction would be in breach of constitutional principles only if it were not preceded by disciplinary proceedings . In the present case , the applicant had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings during which he had been able to put forward all his arguments and defend himself before both the CAN and the Commission . Indeed , it transpired from the decision of the CAN that that organ had : verified the existence of the disciplinary breach ( by establishing the existence of a final criminal judgment ) ; heard the applicant various times ; established the facts and indicated the relevant provisions relating to the breach at issue ; allowed the applicant \u2019s legal representative full access to the disciplinary file ; and allowed the applicant to make written submissions and call witnesses as well as make any oral submissions in his defence . It followed that although the law provided for automatic application of the measure , as happened in the present case , the measure was applied only after disciplinary proceedings had been carried out in compliance with the relevant rules of procedure . In the present case the disciplinary organs had correctly interpreted and applied the law in conformity with the constitutional principles invoked . The applicant \u2019s complaint was therefore ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before ORG , the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the effects of the ORG \u2019s decision pending a decision in the administrative proceedings was rejected on CARDINAL DATE following an oral hearing . ORG rejected the request on the grounds that the applicant had not shown what prejudice he had suffered and bearing in mind the interests of third parties and the crimes of which the applicant had been found guilty by means of a final judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision , but ORG dismissed his appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant reiterated his challenges in respect of the constitutionality of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of legislative decree no . DATE as well as of LAW no . DATE , but this time in the light of ORG and the Convention .", "CARDINAL . An oral hearing took place on CARDINAL DATE . The decision on the matter was delivered in the main proceedings ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims ( by means of a CARDINAL - page judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . The court held that as it had already stated in various decisions in the present case , its jurisdiction in the instant case was that provided for under law no . CARDINAL of DATE , as set out in LAW no . DATE , namely judicial review of administrative action ( giurisdizione di legittimita ` ) . Thus the impugned acts could only be challenged on the basis that the decision in the disciplinary proceedings was not in accordance with the law , had been delivered by a body that did not have the requisite jurisdiction or had been delivered in abuse of power . It was not for the administrative court to assess the facts or conduct leading to the decisions , which was the responsibility of the disciplinary body in accordance with the law . According to jurisprudence , in disciplinary proceedings against lawyers the establishment of the misconduct leading to the disciplinary breach was the exclusive competence of the disciplinary organs . However , the decision was subject to a control concerning its reasonableness , in judicial review proceedings . This was also confirmed by the disciplinary bodies\u2019 statements . Other jurisprudence had confirmed that the factual assessment made by the disciplinary organ would be irreproachable as long as it was backed up by sufficient and appropriate reasons , and that judicial review should not extend to an assessment of the evidence or of the gravity of the offence , or the appropriateness of the sanction imposed . The court further noted that those were administrative proceedings and as such were not subject to the guarantees of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind the above , the court found that the applicant \u2019s complaints were ill - founded . Concerning constitutional legitimacy , the court confirmed the decision it had delivered on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and noted that the applicant had again reiterated those complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment of DATE . He once again reiterated his claims concerning constitutional legitimacy ( mentioned above ) and the lack of adequate reasoning given in this respect by the previous organs . He also challenged the first - instance court \u2019s findings in so far as they had repeatedly relied on previous decisions given in his case . They had also relied on NORP jurisprudence without considering the fact that GPE law was different from NORP law . He further considered that the first - instance court had wrongly interpreted and applied relevant laws in relation to each and every one of his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted further written submissions on his grounds of appeal . On DATE the parties agreed that no oral pleadings were necessary since the arguments had already been exhaustively made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed and the judgment of ORG was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "ORG noted that the issues of constitutional legitimacy had once again been reiterated . It considered that the CAN and the Commission were disciplinary organs to which ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW , or the equivalent articles of the San Marino ( human rights ) Declaration did not apply . Furthermore , ORG highlighted that the law distinguished between minor crimes and more grave crimes when regulating the application of the various applicable sanctions , including disbarment from a profession . The application of such a serious sanction , which only applied to more serious crimes , in the applicant \u2019s case had been wilfully and consciously decided by the legislator , leaving no discretion to ORG . It was worth noting that in GPE , lawyers also carried out the functions of notaries , and a criminal conviction for making false declarations in public documents was objectively incompatible with the function of a public official which was , by definition , the guarantor of truthfulness and the veracity of documents . Thus , the fact that the law provided an automatic application of the sanction in such cases could not be considered unreasonable or disproportionate , and was thus in conformity with LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the first - instance administrative decision , the court found that the first - instance court had given relevant and sufficient reasons in its decision and that its findings were valid . The mere fact that in some instances that decision had relied on NORP jurisprudence only served to further the reasoning in relation to the arguments raised . As to each of the remaining grounds of appeal , ORG entered into each and every one and reached the conclusion that they were all manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The decision to disbar the second applicant was communicated to ORG , which in turn and in accordance with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of law no . DATE , namely the legal framework concerning the exercise of the liberal professions , struck him off its list of liberal professionals .
