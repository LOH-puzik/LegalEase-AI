SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE , the applicant has been on PERCENT sick leave due to various health problems . She has , inter alia , been operated on for cancer as the consequence of which she suffers from recurrent PERSON ( a bacterial infection of the skin , which typically involves the lymphatic system ) and lymphatic oedema in both legs .", "CARDINAL . Hence , on DATE , the applicant applied for disability benefits ( handikappers\u00e4ttning ) retroactively from DATE . She claimed that , due to her health problems , she had incurred , and still incurred , extra costs for , inter alia , medication , ORG visits , treatment , travel expenses , special clothes and shoes , special soap and creams , and for supplementary vitamins and minerals . She had calculated that these extra costs amounted , in total , to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) per year .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan NORP \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of GPE rejected the request . It accepted certain extra costs for medication , medical treatment and support material as well as for certain travel up to a specific amount . However , in the ORG \u2019s view , the total of the applicant \u2019s extra costs per year amounted to MONEY from DATE , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL from DATE and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL from DATE . Thus , the ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s extra costs did not reach the minimum level established for DATE to be granted disability benefits ( namely SEK CARDINAL for DATE , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE , which was equal to PERCENT of the basic amount in line with the price index [ basbelopp ] ) . It further noted that the applicant had claimed that she needed help with shopping and some cleaning and driving but that she had not stated that she had a DATE need for assistance . In this respect , the ORG took into account that the applicant was married and could rely on some help from her husband . Therefore , it considered that she had failed to show that she had a substantial need of assistance in her daily life ( minimum TIME per day ) . Finally , it found that the total need of support was not sufficient for disability benefits to be granted . The decision was based on Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance ( Lagen om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag , Act no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and the ORG also had CARDINAL medical certificates at its disposal from different doctors who had treated the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , requesting that the decision be set aside and that the case be remitted to the ORG for further action . In the alternative , she requested that the court declare her entitled to disability benefits as from DATE . She maintained her claims and developed her reasons for why the various extra costs were essential . She further added that the ORG had failed to investigate her actual need for assistance , which she alleged amounted to TIME per day , in order to estimate the total cost of extra needs due to the disability . Moreover , the applicant stated that she needed manual lymphatic drainage which ORG of PERSON lacked resources to provide . Since her need was medically documented , she had to travel to a neighbouring county for treatment at her own expense . In this connection , she alleged that she was unable , due to her illness , to use public transport for which reason her travel expenses were higher than calculated by the ORG . All these extra costs should , in her view , be included in the calculation to grant her disability benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . As concerned the applicant \u2019s need of assistance in her DATE life , the court considered that it was the common responsibility of a couple to clean and shop , for which reason the applicant was not found to be in need of assistance from a third person in her daily life . The applicant was not considered to be in need of assistance on a DATE basis to such an extent that this alone could constitute a basis for granting disability benefits . Turning to the extra costs , the court shared the ORG \u2019s conclusions and calculations but added some additional costs for special soap . It also observed that ORG was responsible for the costs related to the treatment for lymphatic drainage and that these costs thus could not be included in the calculation of disability benefits . Furthermore , it found that the medical certificates invoked before it did not show that the applicant was unable to use public transport . The court concluded , in an overall assessment of the applicant \u2019s need of assistance and of her extra costs , that the conditions for granting disability benefits were not fulfilled and , thus , that the applicant was not eligible for a disability allowance .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining her earlier claims and insisting that she was in need of assistance for TIME per day . She further noted that according to the calculation based on the lower court \u2019s judgment , the total amount of extra costs acknowledged by the court was QUANTITY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) below the limit to be granted disability benefits for DATE . Moreover , the applicant alleged that she had to buy custom - made clothes and special shoes due to her deformities caused by the lymphatic oedema and hip problems . These costs , and the costs for the lymphatic drainage , should be included . She requested that the court order the ORG to submit information about how it had calculated her total need for assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for further investigation of the case as it considered that the case had been clarified to the extent that was demanded . The applicant was given DATE to submit , in writing , any further information that she wished to add .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal and , by letter dated DATE , the applicant requested that the court hold an oral hearing because she considered the investigation to be incomplete and , for that reason , points about the matter to be decided remained unclear .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG declared its intention to obtain supplementary information from the ORG , as it found it necessary to investigate the case further . On DATE ORG ordered the ORG to submit supplementary information about lymphatic drainage treatment .", "CARDINAL . In a supplementary submission by the applicant , dated DATE , she stated that she had been in contact with PERSON hospital to clarify whether it was now possible to carry out manual lymphatic drainage there . She had received various replies but , according to the latest reply , it was not possible although some private therapist within the county apparently could do it . She demanded that an oral hearing be held by telephone to clarify certain unclear points of the case . During the oral hearing , ORG ought to establish that the hospital lacked resources to provide continuous manual lymphatic drainage treatment , that the frequency of the treatments , as stated in the application for disability benefits , was medically motivated and that costs incurred for treatment performed by private providers were extra costs in the present circumstances . Furthermore , the court ought to clarify contradictions in the ORG \u2019s submission and calculate the time needed for assistance as well as the total need for support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing \u201c per telephone \u201d as it found that it was not necessary . The applicant was given DATE to finalise her submissions in writing and she was informed that , after that time , the case could be decided on the basis of the case file as it stood .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . The court , consisting of CARDINAL judges including CARDINAL lay judges , found it established that lymphatic drainage treatment of the kind the applicant needed was to be regarded as medical treatment and that ORG was responsible for costs of such treatment to the extent that it could be considered medically motivated . Accordingly , when assessing the application for disability benefits , the applicant was not entitled to include extra costs for lymphatic drainage treatment . In the light of this and as the court also shared ORG assessment concerning the remainder of the subjectmatter the appeal was to be rejected . The judgment was unanimous .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant made a further appeal to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that ORG judgment be repealed and the case returned for renewed examination since it had failed to hold an oral hearing . She referred to LAW and claimed that an oral hearing was necessary in order to clarify the case , in particular her need for assistance . In the alternative , the applicant requested that the court grant her disability benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance ( Lagen om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag , Act no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time ) , provides that a person who has reached the age of DATE and who , before reaching DATE , has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person on a DATE basis or needs continuing assistance from another person in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses , may receive disability benefits ( section CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . If the disabled person needs assistance either on a DATE basis or in order to be gainfully employed and , in addition to this , has extra expenses , the issue of whether he or she is entitled to disability benefits and the amount of compensation shall be decided on basis of the total need of support ( section CARDINAL , second paragraph ) . Thus , when making this assessment , it is necessary to look into the person \u2019s whole situation and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses incurred .", "CARDINAL . It follows from section CARDINAL of the DATE Act that disability benefits are granted on a yearly basis at a level of PERCENT , PERCENT or PERCENT of the basic amount for social security purposes ( prisbasbelopp ) depending on the extent to which the person in question is in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability . The basic amount was CARDINAL for DATE , SEK CARDINAL for DATE and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE .", "CARDINAL . A medical report is required when it comes to the assessment of the functional impairment itself . As to the disabled person \u2019s need of support , regard must be had to the fact that support may be provided naturally to a certain extent by the person \u2019s husband or wife or another person with whom the person is living . If the support amounts to TIME per day , the need for assistance is considered time - consuming and may , for that reason , constitute a basis for granting disability benefits amounting to PERCENT of the basic amount , even if there are no extra expenses ( see LAW , PERSON , ORG CARDINAL , applicable at the time of the ORG \u2019s decision ) . As far as the assessment of extra costs is concerned , account has to be taken of whether and to what extent the disabled person has access to assistance provided by the municipal social services , such as having his or her own personal assistant or having the possibility of using municipal transport services for the disabled . According to the above - mentioned Guidelines , considerable extra expenses incurred as a consequence of the functional impairment may in themselves result in a right to disability benefits amounting to PERCENT of the basic amount , provided the extra expenses come to PERCENT of the basic amount . It is necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to the Guidelines , the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain PERCENT of the basic amount in order to make the individual eligible for disability benefit . Thus , if a person needs support for TIME per day but also extra expenses amounting to PERCENT of the basic amount , he or she is entitled to PERCENT of the basic amount in disability benefits ( see LAW , cited above , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to be granted disability benefits , the individual has to file an application with a social insurance office ( section CARDINAL ) . The benefits are paid as from DATE when the entitlement to the benefits arose . Disability benefits may be paid for a certain period of time before the insured person filed the application . Such retroactive payment may refer at most to a period of DATE preceding the application ( section CARDINAL ) . The purpose of the latter regulation is to avoid situations where the individual would lose his or her right to the benefits owing to lack of information ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . Since DATE , retroactive payment of disability benefits may at most refer to a period of DATE preceding the application .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Procedure Act ( ORG , Act no . ORG , as in force at the relevant time ) was worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to ORG emphasise that an oral procedure can be advantageous for the investigation of a case in CARDINAL respects in particular . Firstly , such a hearing may be needed in order to examine a witness , expert or party or in cases where a party has difficulty expounding his or her claim in writing . Secondly , an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute . In the latter case , the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature . Moreover , the oral form of procedure envisaged in the DATE Act is not to be seen as an alternative to the written form , but rather as a complement to that form ( see the Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The possibility of holding an oral hearing in order to promote an expeditious determination of the case , which was first introduced in DATE , was a clarification of a practice that already applied ( see the Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , ORG on Justice JuU CARDINAL , Parliamentary Communication CARDINAL , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . The purpose of the legislative amendment was to make it clearer that an oral hearing can and should be used for preparatory purposes in certain cases , to make for speedier and more effective proceedings . The amendment was primarily intended for tax cases associated with tax offence cases before courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act underlined , in connection with the provision in section QUANTITY concerning the right of a party to an oral hearing in certain cases , that while serious consideration should be given to the wishes of a party for such a hearing , the party could hardly be allowed to have a decisive influence in the matter . The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case , but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors , for example , if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the import of the decision to be given in the case . CARDINAL particular reason not to arrange an oral hearing could be that the case is of a trivial nature or that the costs of the hearing are high compared to the value of the object of dispute ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG has set aside a number of decisions on appeal and referred the case back to the administrative courts of appeal because of the lack of an oral hearing in the lower courts ( see , for example , ORG CARDINAL ref . CARDINAL , BA DATE note DATE , ORG note CARDINAL and ORG DATE note CARDINAL ; as more specifically regards work injuries , see ORG note CARDINAL and RA CARDINAL note CARDINAL ) . In the last mentioned case , an administrative court of appeal had changed the lower court \u2019s judgment to the applicant \u2019s disadvantage without holding an oral hearing . Furthermore , the applicant had requested that a medical doctor be heard as a witness .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE concerning a claim for damages brought by an individual against ORG , inter alia , on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW on account of the excessive length of the criminal proceedings , ORG held that the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated . Based on this finding , and with reference , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these provisions , in particular the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under NORP law for both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages . With respect to the level of compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG took note of the criteria established in the ORG \u2019s case - law stating that the ORG \u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the principle concerning a right to damages established in the above - mentioned case of DATE also applied with regard to the rights contained in LAW . ORG stated that the plaintiff \u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article CARDINAL should be assessed in the first place under LAW ( LAW no . ORG ) and GPE and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , Act no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . To the extent necessary , the relevant provisions of domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the LAW . If GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW could not be met by such an interpretation , the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions . As concerned the determination of the level of compensation , ORG repeated that the ORG \u2019s case - law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from CARDINAL country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for their private life under DATE had been violated on the basis that a police decision on a medical examination of some of them had not been \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of LAW , ORG held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the abovementioned cases of DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL to violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In view of this and with reference to , inter alia , LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law under these ORG , ORG concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non - pecuniary damage for the violation of LAW . With regard to the levels of compensation , ORG concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under LAW . Generally speaking , these levels should , however , be compatible with the case - law of the Court . In the same case , ORG had also concluded , in a judgment dated DATE , that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL and that an award for non - pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of DATE .", "CARDINAL . A further ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerned a claim for damages against ORG on the basis of an alleged violation of LAW relating to the suicide of the LAW father while in detention . ORG concluded that the case revealed no violation of LAW . However , in its reasoning leading to this conclusion , ORG noted , inter alia , that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law there was a right to an effective remedy under LAW connected to the ORG \u2019s duty under the ORG to take measures to protect the lives of individuals in custody or who were otherwise deprived of their liberty , which should , in principle , include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage . ORG thus referred in particular to the judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning a claim for damages against ORG , the Chancellor of Justice held that the right of one of the plaintiffs LAW CARDINAL of the Convention had been violated on account of the excessive length of the civil proceedings . Based on this finding , and with reference to the above - mentioned ORG judgments of DATE and CARDINAL September CARDINAL , the Chancellor of ORG concluded that the individual was entitled to compensation from the ORG for non - pecuniary damage . With respect to the level of compensation , the Chancellor of ORG took note of the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular the case of ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government decided to set up a working group on tort liability and the Convention to study the current legal situation . In DATE the working group submitted its report ( PERSON , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) to the Government . In the report it is proposed that LAW be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the ORG or a municipality for violations of the LAW . Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the ORG has been violated . The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non - pecuniary damage arising from disregard of the LAW , and to fulfil , together with the other already existing legal remedies , GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
