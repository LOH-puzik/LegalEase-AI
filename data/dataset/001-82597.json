SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Ke\u017emarok .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her husband held a joint tenancy of a CARDINAL - room flat owned by a cooperative in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Owing to differences with her husband , the applicant left the flat together with her CARDINAL children in DATE . They started living in a CARDINAL - room flat owned by ORG . It was leased by the applicant 's father , who suffered from a long - term illness and died on DATE . The applicant and her CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE respectively , continued to live in the flat . The applicant paid the rent .", "CARDINAL . In a decision which became final on DATE a court granted a divorce order in respect of the applicant and her husband . Their children were placed in the applicant 's custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her former husband reached an agreement whereby the latter would continue using the flat in which they had formerly lived together . On DATE the ORG which owned the flat and of which the applicant was a member approved a request for the flat to be exchanged for a CARDINAL - room flat in Ke\u017emarok . The applicant 's former husband lived in the flat in Ke\u017emarok until his death on DATE . His and the applicant 's son inherited membership rights in respect of the cooperative which owned the flat in Ke\u017emarok , including the right to use it . The applicant later started leasing the flat with a view to improving her financial situation .", "CARDINAL . After her father 's death the applicant requested to be registered as permanently residing in the flat where she had lived DATE . In a letter of DATE the mayor of ORG replied that the position was unclear . It had to be determined , in particular , whether the tenancy had passed to the applicant pursuant to LAW after her father 's death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that she had formally ceased to be a tenant of the flat which she had used with her former husband on DATE that is , after the death of her father . The right to use her father 's flat had not passed to the applicant after the former 's death as the requirements of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG had not been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG included the applicant on a list of persons seeking the tenancy of a flat . No municipal flat could be put at the applicant 's disposal at that time as other persons were above her on the list .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had refused to move out , on DATE ORG sought a judicial order for her eviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to move out of the flat within DATE after its judgment had become final . On DATE the ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . The courts established that the applicant had not become a tenant of the flat originally used by her father since , at the time of the latter 's death , she had been registered as a user of a different flat , in which she had lived with her former husband . The requirements of LAW had not been met . After her father 's death the applicant had lived in the flat in issue without any justification . In addition , ORG held that the applicant could live in the flat in Ke\u017emarok which her son had inherited from her former husband . The plaintiff had rightly sought the protection of its ownership rights in respect of the flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing that the plaintiff company lacked the capacity to take part in the proceedings . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law , holding that the plaintiff was a legal entity established by ORG . As such it had standing to sue the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The GPE requested that the order be enforced . The applicant objected that her son had reached the age of majority and that she could not live in his flat in Ke\u017emarok . ORG dismissed the objection on DATE , holding that the issue could not be examined in the context of the enforcement proceedings . On DATE an enforcement officer enforced the judgment , in accordance with the relevant provisions of ORG with the result that the applicant was obliged to move out of the flat in which she had lived DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that flat was allocated to a municipal employee who lived in a CARDINAL - room flat and who had applied , on DATE , for a bigger one as she had to take care of an elderly and ill relative . Later the new tenant acquired ownership of the flat for a relatively small sum in accordance with the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , with her under - age daughter , started living in the CARDINAL - room flat in Ke\u017emarok inherited by the applicant 's son . The flat has a surface area of QUANTITY . The applicant has continued to work in GPE . The distance between the CARDINAL towns is QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a petition under LAW of the LAW , alleging , inter alia , a violation of her constitutional right to protection of her private and family life as well as a violation of her ownership rights in the proceedings referred to above . She argued that the municipality had been informed that she had moved to her father 's flat in DATE with the intention of living there permanently . She had requested to be allocated municipal housing and had therefore believed that her interests would be protected . The municipality 's argument that she could live in her son 's CARDINAL - room flat in Ke\u017emarok was unreasonable . In addition , her daughter , who was under age , was disturbed by having to live in that flat as the girl 's father had committed suicide there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared admissible the complaint alleging a violation of the applicant 's right to respect for her private and family life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that by its judgment of DATE the ORG had violated the applicant 's rights under LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The decision stated that the ordinary courts ' conclusion that the requirements of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG had not been met in the applicant 's case was correct as such . It also had to be considered , however , whether there had been a pressing social need for the interference and whether it had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued , .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not acted contrary to the law when she had moved to her father 's flat in DATE . She had lived in that flat continuously , together with her children , even after her father 's death . At the time of the examination of the request for her eviction the applicant had had no other place to live . The flat was to be regarded , therefore , as the applicant 's home .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that LAW permitted the granting of relief from hardship in justified cases by ensuring that alternative accommodation should be provided to persons who had been ordered to move out of a flat . As to ORG practice and , in particular , judgment no . CARDINAL Cdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the circumstances of the applicant 's case were different in that the applicant had legally moved into the flat in DATE and the flat was owned by the municipality and not by individuals . In any event , neither LAW nor any other legal provision could be interpreted and applied in a manner producing effects incompatible with GPE 's obligations under international treaties .", "CARDINAL . In view of LAW , the municipality 's ownership rights in respect of the flat could not be dissociated from its obligation to assist citizens of GPE in having their basic needs satisfied . it should have been examined whether ordering the applicant to leave the flat , together with her under - age daughter and without providing them with alternative accommodation , was contra bonos mores within the meaning of LAW . The protection of family , minors and juveniles under LAW should also have been taken into account .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG had registered the applicant as a person seeking a flat , after having verified whether her request had been justified , at approximately the same time as it had initiated judicial proceedings for her eviction . It should have been verified whether the municipality , as the owner and manager of municipal flats , had a compelling reason for ordering the applicant to move out of the flat immediately without being obliged to provide her with alternative accommodation .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not consider the applicant 's behaviour improper . In DATE she had left the cooperative flat where she had lived with a view to avoiding the negative impact of her husband 's inappropriate behaviour on her and her children . The applicant had petitioned for divorce and her return to that flat would not have resolved her personal situation as her husband also had the right to use it .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant had used the flat for a long time and the representatives of the municipality had initially not taken a firm standpoint as regards her title to use the flat . Reference was made , in particular , to the mayor 's letter of DATE . The owner of the flat had therefore contributed to the applicant 's belief that she would not be obliged to leave the flat without alternative accommodation being provided to her . In DATE , when the judicial proceedings had started , the applicant had been in a difficult situation as the mother of CARDINAL under - age children who had lost their father .", "CARDINAL . When deciding the case , the ORG had not duly considered the above relevant facts . Its decision to uphold the first - instance judgment ordering the applicant to leave the flat without being provided with any other accommodation therefore amounted to an interference with the applicant 's right to respect for her private and family life and for her home which was not based on relevant and sufficient reasons . As a result , and also having regard to the particular protection which LAW afforded to children and juveniles , that interference could not be regarded as being necessary in a democratic society .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL guarantees to every person the right to protection against unjustified interference with his or her private and family life .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decision NORP . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL March CARDINAL ORG rejected a petition filed by a judge who alleged a violation of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW in that ORG had asked him to submit a financial statement . The decision stated that the petitioner should have sought redress before the ordinary courts by means of an action under LAW seq . of LAW for protection of his personal rights .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL guarantees the right to own property . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL prohibits the abuse of ownership to the detriment of the rights of others or contrary to general interests protected by law .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , interference with the inviolability of the home ( other than the search of a home in the context of criminal proceedings , which is governed by paragraph CARDINAL of the same Article ) may be permitted by law only where it is necessary in a NORP society for the protection of a person 's life , health or property , for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or in cases of serious threat to public order .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that marriage , parenthood and family are to be protected by law . Particular protection is to be afforded to children and juveniles .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , as in force until DATE , the ORG could commence proceedings upon a petition ( podnet ) filed by any individuals or corporations claiming that their rights had been violated .", "CARDINAL . According to its case - law under LAW , ORG lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner 's constitutional rights . It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found . In ORG view , it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the exercise of civil rights and obligations must not interfere with the justified rights and interests of others unless there are relevant legal grounds and must not be contra ORG mores .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , any natural person has the right to protection of his or her personality , and in particular of his or her life and health , civil and human dignity , privacy , name and personal characteristics .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , where a tenant of a flat dies , unless the flat has been jointly leased by spouses , the tenancy passes to the late tenant 's children and other close relatives , provided that they lived in the same household as the tenant at the time of his or her death and that they do not have their own flat .", "CARDINAL . NORP In judgment no . CARDINAL Cdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL , delivered on DATE , ORG expressed the view that LAW could not be applied for the purpose of obliging the owner of a flat ( CARDINAL individuals in that particular case ) to provide accommodation to a person who used the flat without any legal grounds . Imposing such an obligation would infringe the owner 's property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG in which she complained under LAW and LAW above - mentioned decisions of the ordinary courts leading to her eviction from the flat in which she lived . The application was registered as no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a committee of CARDINAL judges rejected the application as being inadmissible . At that time the constitutional proceedings initiated by the applicant were still pending . As ORG had declared admissible the complaint alleging a violation of the applicant 's right to respect for her private and family life , the ORG considered the relevant part of the application to be premature at that time . The decision on admissibility reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG has examined the application and notes that the applicant has been informed of the possible obstacles to its admissibility . In the light of all the material in its possession , and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence , the ORG finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the ORG or its Protocols . It follows that the application must be rejected , in accordance with LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
