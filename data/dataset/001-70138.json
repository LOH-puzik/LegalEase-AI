The relevant parts of the ORG 's report concerning the visit to GPE DATE read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Prisoners were accommodated primarily in CARDINAL buildings . Buildings I , II and VII for the most part accommodated remand prisoners . Male juveniles were held in a section of building III , the basement of which was reserved for prisoners in transit . Women had a separate detention area , situated in FAC prisoners were scattered among the various buildings , except for the buildings housing the detachment of convicted prisoners employed as workers , situated in FAC . It should also be noted that all prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment were accommodated in the basement of FAC .", "...", "CARDINAL . In contrast , in all the other detention areas , living conditions of the vast majority of the prison population left a considerable amount to be desired . In most of the cells , the living space per prisoner was well below the minimum standard set and the cramming in of persons had reached an intolerable level . For example , in Buildings I and II , CARDINAL people were accommodated in cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 , CARDINAL people had to share a cell of QUANTITY m\u00b2 , and CARDINAL people were packed into a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 . In the juveniles ' section in Building III , CARDINAL young people were placed in a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 and CARDINAL in a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 . In addition , the delegation observed that cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 to CARDINAL m\u00b2 accommodated CARDINAL people .", "Furthermore , in these cells access to natural light was very limited , artificial lighting was mediocre , and the air polluted and rank . For prisoners still under investigation ( i.e. over QUANTITY prisoners ) , the situation was even worse , their cells being virtually totally without access to natural light because of the thick external metal blinds covering the windows . By force of circumstances , the equipment was reduced to the bare minimum , comprising metal or bunk beds which were extremely rudimentary and in a poor state , and a table and CARDINAL or CARDINAL benches . Furthermore , in many cells , there were not enough beds and prisoners had to share them or sleep in turns . In addition , the bedding was in a bad condition ; the very small stocks of mattresses , blankets and sheets was not enough and many prisoners without family or resources had to sleep just on the bed frame .", "The cells had a sanitary annex , a real source of infection . Above the NORP toilet was a tap which served both as a flush and as a source of water which prisoners could use to freshen up or wash . Moreover , this area was only partially partitioned by a small low wall QUANTITY high , which meant that it was not possible to preserve one 's privacy .", "The state of repair and cleanliness in the cell blocks , overall , was also of considerable concern . In addition , many of the cells were infested with cockroaches and other vermin and some prisoners also complained that there were rodents .", "To sum up , the living and hygiene conditions for the vast majority of the prison population were execrable and , more particularly , constituted a serious health risk .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL transit cells in use at the time of the visit in LOC deserve particular mention . The situation in terms of living space in the cells was without a doubt the worst seen . Up to CARDINAL prisoners were crammed into cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 . CARDINAL of the surface was taken up by a CARDINAL level wooden platform ( without mattress and blankets ) completely blocking the window . In addition , the artificial lighting was mediocre and the atmosphere there was suffocating . As the remaining surface of the cell was filled up with the detainees ' belongings and an NORP toilet , the detainees had no other choice but to pile onto the CARDINAL levels of the platform . A number of detainees had been accommodated in these intolerable conditions for DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards washing facilities for prisoners , they had DATE access to the showers . However , the number of showers was notoriously inadequate for the male population ( CARDINAL showers for CARDINAL detainees , and moreover , its functioning was unreliable ) . In addition , prisoners who were not in a position to receive the basic washing necessities from their families were totally left without because of the lack of soap and towels in the prison .", "CARDINAL . The material conditions described above were further aggravated by another major inconvenience . Prisoners had to put up with very loud and repetitive music which was ongoing throughout DATE and broadcast by loud speakers in the yard from TIME . The reason given for this measure was to ensure that the various categories of prisoners had no contact with each other . Many prisoners complained about this situation and the delegation was able to see for itself how obtrusive it was . For example , in many of the cells it was virtually impossible to hold a conversation .", "...", "CARDINAL . The health care staff in prison No . CARDINAL comprised CARDINAL full - time doctors , assisted by CARDINAL assistants , CARDINAL nurses and a psychologist . The CARDINAL doctors were as follows : CARDINAL doctor in charge of the prison medical service , CARDINAL general practitioners , CARDINAL pneumologists , a psychiatrist , a dermatologist , a radiologist and a dentist . In addition to providing a consultation facility , the medical staff was responsible for an infirmary with a capacity of CARDINAL beds , although in reality , this area accommodated CARDINAL patients , primarily patients suffering from tuberculosis .", "The medical team could at a pinch be considered sufficient . However , such is not the case for the team of assistants and nurses . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the ORG 's report concerning the visit to GPE DATE read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The visited penitentiary establishments were severely affected by the country 's economic situation . The budget ceiling for spending on the prison service under the DATE LAW had been set at MONEY ( MONEY ) or PERCENT of the resources needed per year . As a result , prisons suffered from severe shortages from every standpoint . For example , the DATE budget for feeding a prisoner was CARDINAL Lei , PERCENT of the current statutory norm . Prisons also suffered form cuts in electricity , water and heating , not to mention the unavailability of medicines necessary for treating prisoners .", "In their letter of DATE , the NORP authorities refer to the efforts made at DATE by ORG to obtain humanitarian aid from international organizations and individuals , in order to resolve the most urgent problems of the prison system ( CARDINAL Lei have been obtained in this way ) .", "The ORG recognizes the laudable efforts made by the NORP prison administration and these deserve to be supported . Nevertheless , the ORG has already recalled on several occasions that there are certain basic necessities of life that must , in all circumstances , including in a serious economic situation , be assured by the state in respect of persons for which it is responsible . Nothing can ever exempt the state from this responsibility .", "As a consequence , the ORG calls upon the NORP authorities , at the highest political level , to take without delay the necessary measures in order that all prisons in GPE may adequately assure the basic necessities of life for all detainees .", "...", "CARDINAL . The description of Prison No . CARDINAL in PERSON in paragraph CARDINAL of the report on the DATE visit is still valid . As previously indicated , this establishment suffered from severe overcrowding : CARDINAL prisoners ( mainly remand prisoners ) , including CARDINAL women and CARDINAL juveniles , for CARDINAL places .", "CARDINAL . For example , the follow - up visit to Prison No . CARDINAL in PERSON revealed positive changes which the ORG welcomes . It particularly approves of the removal of the heavy blinds covering the windows of cells looking onto the interior of the establishment . It is also planned to replace the blinds on the windows looking onto the street with an alternative arrangement that will let in sufficient natural light .", "...", "... Major repairs had also been made to the heating with , in particular , the installation of a new boiler , while the prison 's central showers had been completely renovated ( CARDINAL shower rooms were operational and a fourth was being repaired ) with the help of former prisoners and prisoners ' families . This made it possible for male prisoners to take a shower , with hot water , every ten days . In certain buildings , moreover , repair work on the electrical system and painting of the corridors had been completed . A few cells were currently undergoing refurbishment .", "That said , the appalling living conditions and state of hygiene in buildings I , II and III , including the transit cells , described in DATE and DATE of the previous report , had not changed ( except as far as access to natural light is concerned ) . Indeed , the acute overcrowding in these buildings exacerbated matters still further . In the few cells viewed that were properly equipped and fitted out , this was due to the prisoners themselves , who had been able to procure what was needed from their families .", "...", "CARDINAL . The absence of organised activity programmes was a common feature of the establishments visited . This was undoubtedly a consequence of the economic situation and overcrowding , but also of the restrictive legislation governing the categories of prisoners accommodated there . TIME fraction of the prison population had work : TIME in PERSON and PERSON and CARDINAL in GPE . The majority of these prisoners formed part of the workforce allocated to the various prison duties . Other forms of activity were almost non - existent . It should be noted , however , that some efforts had been made in Prison No . CARDINAL , following the ORG 's recommendations . For example , the outdoor exercise areas had been equipped with modest sports facilities . In this context , management plans to fit out CARDINAL sports halls as soon as possible deserve particular support . Improvements had also been made to the juvenile detention regime : a television room had been provided and a few activities organised , such as music , singing and group discussions / debates . However , these early attempts to meet the needs of young persons remain an isolated example . In the other establishments , they were left entirely to their own devices .", "...", "CARDINAL . The follow - up visit to Prison No . CARDINAL showed that compared with DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) the situation regarding health staffing levels had deteriorated . In particular , the number of nurses had fallen ( from CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) added to which , CARDINAL of these posts were vacant . The number of doctors and medical assistants remained the same , CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively , but the post of head doctor was vacant . Such a team is not sufficient to meet the needs of CARDINAL prisoners , a significant number of which were in the prison hospital ( CARDINAL ) , particularly as far as the care staff is concerned ( medical assistants and nurses ) . The number of complaints received concerning access to medical staff and medical care is therefore hardly surprising .", "...", "CARDINAL . As indicated in the preliminary remarks , the supply with necessary medication was problematic in the visited establishments . The detainees mostly depended on their families or on non - governmental organisations in order to obtain the necessary medication ( for example , ORG at Prison No . CARDINAL ) ...", "CARDINAL . From the standpoint of medical confidentiality , medical examinations and consultations did not take place in appropriate conditions in any of the establishments . As a rule , everything took place in the custody areas at cell doors ( through the hatch ) , in the presence of guards . If prisoners had to be treated in a consultation room , guards were also in attendance . The situation in Prison No . CARDINAL , in the so - called \" procedure \" room in the infirmary , was particularly undignified . Treatment was administered through a closed door with bars , with an opening measuring QUANTITY . The patients concerned then had to present the relevant part of the body , be it forearm or buttocks , in full view of other prisoners and staff .", "CARDINAL . There also needs to be a review of access to a doctor and a medical assistant . The delegation observed that when they were doing their DATE rounds , the medical assistants only had minimal contact with prisoners , and always in the presence of guards . As a result , it proved very difficult to request consultations , which had to be done through guards . Many complaints were received about the considerable delays in gaining access to care staff and the barriers erected by guards . The ORG recommends that this situation be remedied .", "CARDINAL . There are several indicators to suggest that the situation regarding tuberculosis , already a matter of concern in DATE , is deteriorating . For example , in Prison No . CARDINAL , there has been a constant increase in the number of recorded active cases , from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE . Moreover , according to statistics supplied , tuberculosis accounts for PERCENT of the deaths in prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG notes the improvements made in Prison No . CARDINAL to the conditions in which visits take place , with the refurbishment of the booths used for short visits and rooms fitted out for convicted prisoners ' long visits .
