Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ORG are all NORP citizens , born in DATE , DATE respectively . They live in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE respectively . At the relevant time they were each permanently employed in different capacities by various local authorities . Their precise status and functions are described in Section C below .", "The background to their complaints to the Convention institutions is constituted by the enactment and implementation of legislative measures designed to limit the involvement of certain categories of local government officials , such as themselves , in political activities . The history of the enactment of the relevant measures as well as their purport and scope are described in Section B below . The impact of the measures on the applicants , all persons considered holders of politically restricted posts within the meaning of the applicable legislation , is described in Section C below .", "CARDINAL . Against the background of the increasing politicisation of local government and attendant problems in respect of the relationship between elected members and local government officers , the Secretaries of State for the Environment , for GPE and for GPE , appointed on CARDINAL DATE a committee ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to inquire , inter alia , into the respective roles of elected members and officers of local government authorities and to make any necessary recommendations for strengthening the democratic process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after receiving evidence from CARDINAL local government authorities and over CARDINAL other organisations and individuals , ORG submitted its report . The ORG firmly endorsed the continuation of the tradition of politically impartial local government officers having regard in particular to the roles of senior officers as managers , advisers and arbitrators in the day - to - day functioning of local government . In his foreword to the final report the Chairman of the ORG wrote :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Although most of the problems we have perceived have been ones of uncertain relations , there have been some cases , albeit a few , where power has been abused . \u201d", "In the Chairman \u2019s view , the recent sharpening of the political intensity of local politics was reflected in the relations between elected council members and local government officers and that the trend towards greater politicisation might be a source of future problems unless recommendations were made in order to provide a framework able to cope with it . With regard to the importance of the impartiality of local government officers , ORG concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The overwhelming view in the evidence we have received has been that officers ( subject to very limited and closely defined exceptions ) should continue to serve the council as a whole . \u2026 There has been equally wide agreement that the public service tradition of a permanent corps of politically impartial officers should be retained . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Public service in GPE is founded on a tradition of a permanent corps of politically neutral officers serving with equal commitment whatever party may be in political control . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Local government in GPE has traditionally been based on the same public service tradition as central government , but this has been a matter of convention and practice . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The issue of principle is therefore straightforward . There must continue to be a system of permanent and politically neutral officers appointed on the basis of merit . The issue which we need to consider is whether new machinery or rules are required to ensure this , and if so on what basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . To ensure that senior officers continued to discharge their functions in a manner which was impartial from both a subjective and an objective point of view , ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its report recommended that :", "\u201c ( a ) the legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors or who are standing for election as councillors , or who have been councillors within DATE , may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above ;", "( b ) LAW should take steps to include in the terms and conditions of officers at the rank of principal officer and above a prohibition on political activity , including :", "( i ) standing for , and holding , public elected office ;", "( ii ) holding office in a political party ;", "( iii ) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate ; and", "( iv ) canvassing at elections ;", "( c ) if the changes recommended at ( b ) are not made to ORG terms and conditions , legislation should be introduced to similar effect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the publication of the recommendations of ORG , on CARDINAL DATE ORG passed ORG Housing Act DATE ( \u201c the Act \u201d ) , which empowered the Secretary of ORG for the Environment to make regulations to restrict the political activities of certain categories of local government officers . The LAW entered into force on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Political Restrictions ) Regulations DATE ( \u201c the Regulations \u201d ) were made under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW on DATE . They were laid before ORG DATE and came into force on DATE . The ORG applied to all persons holding a politically restricted post as defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . This term covers CARDINAL broad categories of local government officials : the most senior post - holders in local government ( category one ) ; officials remunerated in excess of a prescribed level and whose posts are listed for the purposes of the application of the Regulations ( category CARDINAL ) ; and officials paid less than the prescribed level but who hold a listed post ( category CARDINAL ) . Each local authority was obliged to draw up a list of posts falling within the second and third categories ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . A local government officer in the second and third categories could apply to an independent adjudicator to have his or her post removed from the list of posts to which the LAW applied ( section CARDINAL ) .", "All local government officials employed in these categories at the time of the entry into force of the Regulations were deemed , according to regulation MONEY ) , to be subject to the measures .", "A more detailed analysis of the contents of the LAW and the ORG is set out at paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , PERSON , was a solicitor employed by ORG of GPE . Although his salary fell below the level prescribed in section CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and especially CARDINAL below ) , making him a category CARDINAL officer , the ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the LAW included his post in the list of politically restricted posts because , in its opinion , his post involved giving advice on a regular basis to committees of the ORG , namely ORG , ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was adopted as Labour candidate for election to GPE of GPE in DATE , but was obliged to withdraw his candidature as a result of the Regulations . On DATE he applied for removal of his job description from the list of politically restricted posts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and especially CARDINAL below ) . The ORG confirmed that PERSON had not attended committees during DATE , but stated that he would be involved in giving advice to committees in future , and would attend on a more regular basis . ORG did not provide therefore a certificate stating that he did not give advice regularly . The adjudicator replied to ORG that PERSON application for exemption could not therefore be granted .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his retirement , the second applicant , Mr PERSON , was ORG with ORG ( a category CARDINAL officer ) . He was responsible for leading , directing and developing the ORG \u2019s area valuation staff . His post required him to give regular advice to the ORG \u2019s committees , including strategy advice on key estate management issues , and to speak to the media . Accordingly his post was included in the list of politically restricted posts kept by the ORG in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and especially paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Perrin applied for exemption from political restrictions on the ground that although he advised the ORG at meetings and spoke to the media , the advice was \u201c factual valuation information regarding the acquisition , disposal and management of property \u201d . His application for exemption was refused on DATE . The adjudicator wrote :", "\u201c I am satisfied that the duties of your post do fall within section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW in that you do regularly attend committee meetings of the authority to give advice . Your authority do state that this advice does not extend to \u2018 policy advice\u2019 , but the LAW itself makes no distinction between types of advice . I am not prepared , therefore , to grant an exemption under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As a result of the ORG , Mr PERSON had to give up his position as Vice - Chair and Property Officer of ORG , and had to refrain from supporting and assisting Labour candidates in ORG elections , including his wife , who was a candidate in DATE and DATE . He also reduced his involvement in trade union activities .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant , Mr Bentley , is a planning manager with ORG . He resigned from his position as Chairman of ORG and ORG because of the ORG , and was also restricted in canvassing for his wife who stood as the only ORG for ORG , and in giving radio interviews in his capacity as Chairman of ORG , a body concerned with ORG policies .", "CARDINAL . The monitoring officer of the ORG classified Mr PERSON \u2019s post as CARDINAL that was politically sensitive ( a category one post ) and appropriately subject to political restrictions under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The reasons for the classification included that Mr Bentley was head of the ORG \u2019s corporate policy unit , that he was responsible directly to the head of the ORG \u2019s paid service , that his post was responsible for policy analysis and research , that he represented the ORG on a transport steering group involving other authorities and organisations , and that , in DATE prior to CARDINAL DATE , he attended CARDINAL meetings of ORG sub- ) ORG and advised on CARDINAL separate issues of public transport . The monitoring officer considered that Mr PERSON \u2019s post also fell within section CARDINAL ) and ( b ) of the LAW , and was therefore politically restricted in any event ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Bentley applied for exemption from political restrictions . On DATE the adjudicator underlined that he regarded his duties as limited to considering applications concerning restrictions under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW . He stated that although the ORG may have identified the post as being politically restricted , it was not", "\u201c politically restricted because of that fact , but because it is explicitly covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the LAW . I therefore do not consider it necessary or desirable to address the question of whether this post meets the criteria for inclusion in the list of posts under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or for exemption from that list , unless or until it is established that the post is not covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant , PERSON , is employed by ORG as the head of its ORG ( a category one post ) . The provision of services to the ORG \u2019s committees necessarily involves ORG in frequent contact PERSON with and giving advice to the elected members of ORG . PERSON was the officer responsible for those activities .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the ORG , Mr ORG can no longer act as NORP Chairman of his party in GPE and is prevented from speaking at public meetings on issues such as housing and the health service . PERSON did not apply for exemption from the scope of the Regulations .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and ORG ( the predecessor of ORG , the trade union of which the applicants are members and which represents public - sector workers ) applied for and were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the LAW . The application was dismissed on DATE . The judge , Mr Justice PERSON , considered that he was bound by the recent decision of ORG in the case of NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON and Others regarding the status of LAW in domestic law . In connection with the test of \u201c ORG \u201d unreasonableness , the judge referred to an affidavit submitted by PERSON Simcock , a senior civil servant at ORG , in which ORG explained how ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been set up in DATE to inquire into local authority practices and procedures with particular reference to the respective roles of elected members and officers . Mr PERSON also described the consultation process between the publication of ORG and the making of the Regulations , in which ORG was involved , and how the Regulations were in some respects less restrictive than ORG proposals . Referring to senior officers , ORG had said :", "\u201c ... It is part of their job to advise councillors , and to adjudicate on matters of propriety , and in so doing they must command the respect and trust of all political parties . There might well be some senior officers who are politically active but who are nevertheless totally able to detach themselves from such activity in carrying out their duties as neutral officers . Nevertheless we believe there will always be a very significant risk that they are viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties , and that as a consequence the performance of their duties towards the council as a whole will be impaired . \u201d", "The judge continued :", "\u201c ... I preface my summary by pointing out that some of [ the applicants\u2019 complaints ] reflect the applicants\u2019 root and branch opposition to the whole concept of restricting the political activities of local government employees . It is said that :", "There was no pressing social need for the Regulations \u2013 local government employees have in the past provided impartial advice and there is public confidence in their ability to do so .", "The definition of [ persons holding politically restricted posts ] is unduly wide \u2013 a much more restricted category would have served the government \u2019s purpose .", "The restrictions are expressed in broad , subjective and uncertain terms \u2013 a vice particularly objectionable where , as here , they seek to restrict fundamental human rights . Thus , in the Schedule references to apparent intention ( paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE ) and to publication in circumstances likely to create an impression ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) are objectionable , as is paragraph CARDINAL of the Regulations themselves .", "The consequence of the vice mentioned in the previous paragraph is that employees are likely to be treated inconsistently by different employers , by reason of there being room for undue latitude in interpreting the restrictions .", "The Regulations go too far in prohibiting conduct undertaken with apparent intention , etc . , or likely to create the impression of support , etc . They should , at most , have proscribed actual political activities .", "The width of the language used means that many non - party political activities , including trade unions and charitable activities , are prohibited .", "The terms are imposed on existing employees , who entered into their contracts of employment on a different basis .", "The restrictions may have an adverse effect on recruitment and lead to resignations by skilled staff .", "Some of these points will have to be considered individually when I come to deal with further arguments advanced by the applicants under quite different heads , but in the context of ORG unreasonableness I propose only to say that they do not in my judgment come near to establishing a case of perversity . I have already briefly referred to the genesis of the LAW and the LAW in ORG , and to the consultative processes that followed it . Paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG contained the recommendation that :", "\u2018 ... terms and conditions of [ persons holding politically restricted posts ] [ should include ] a prohibition on political activity , including ... ( iii ) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate;\u2019", "ORG in DATE ( in which , as already mentioned , the view was expressed that the categories of [ persons holding politically restricted posts ] should be more restricted than the ORG proposed ) spelt out the essential aim that :", "\u2018 it was important that the post - holder should be seen to be politically impartial but that otherwise , local government employees should not be subject to restrictions on their political activity.\u2019", "Of the specific arguments mentioned in ( a ) to ( h ) above , those in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) , ( g ) and ( h ) are , it seems to me , essentially arguments against the whole concept of restricting such activities , and in the circumstances can not found an attack on ORG grounds . The arguments summarised in ( c ) and ( d ) are to the effect that the Regulations are uncertain and incapable of consistent and fair application . As a ORG argument , this contention could not avail the applicants DATE at least unless the Regulations were void for uncertainty ( this would be a distinct ground for challenge ) which plainly they are not . Finally , the argument mentioned in ( f ) is in my view misconceived : the Regulations do not prohibit the kind of activities there mentioned . I shall have more to say on this subject when I deal with the applicants\u2019 specific arguments on vires and legitimate expectation , to the first of which I now turn . \u201d", "In conclusion , the judge found that the ORG did not go beyond the policy and purpose of the LAW , and rejected an argument that the applicants had a \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d that the ORG would not interfere with trade union activities on the basis of an assurance from the then minister for local government matters .", "CARDINAL . An appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE . Lord Justice PERSON found that the provisions of LAW did not assist ORG and the applicants , confirmed that it was not open to the courts below ORG to depart from the traditional ORG grounds in reviewing the decision of a minister who has exercised a discretion vested in him by ORG , and found that the ORG were not \u201c ORG unreasonable \u201d or ultra vires . He also agreed with the first - instance judge as to legitimate expectation . The other judges , ORG Justices PERSON and PERSON , agreed . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused leave to appeal to it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides :", "\u201c The terms of appointment or conditions of employment of every person holding a politically restricted post under a local authority ( including persons appointed to such posts before the coming into force of this section ) shall be deemed to incorporate such requirements for restricting his political activities as may be prescribed for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made by the Secretary of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
