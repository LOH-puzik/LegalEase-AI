The applicant is a GPE national who was born in DATE ; he is an advocate practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , a private organisation holding a public broadcasting license , broadcast a television documentary entitled \u201c Secret mothers \u201d ( PERSON moeders ) . It featured a woman , CARDINAL PERSON , who claimed to have been the victim of incest committed by her grandfather , her father and CARDINAL of her brothers .", "CARDINAL . PERSON alleged that CARDINAL pregnancies had resulted . CARDINAL had been terminated . Of the babies born from the other CARDINAL , CARDINAL had been ritually murdered and one had been sold .", "CARDINAL . These statements were said to be based on memories which PERSON had repressed but which she had been able to recover with the aid of a therapist , PERSON , who had been treating her for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON family , who denied the truth of PERSON allegations , sought the assistance of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The GPE public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) opened a prosecution file , charging the ORG with criminal libel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecution service published a press release in which it was stated that the ORG had admitted having libelled the PERSON family and had settled out of court . The prosecution had been dropped subject to the conditions , which the ORG had accepted , that the ORG would pay a sum of money to the public prosecution service , publish a retraction and pay the PERSON family compensation for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage and legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another private organisation holding a public broadcasting license , the ORG , broadcast a radio programme featuring an interview with the applicant about the case of the PERSON family .", "CARDINAL . The applicant said , among other things :", "\u201c Here we are faced with a dangerous group of individuals who ... [ though ] unproved , nonetheless present , er , a horrible crime . I mean , we 're talking about CARDINAL infanticides , we 're not talking about nothing . ... all right , QUANTITY murders , CARDINAL abortion and CARDINAL child allegedly sold , whatever , it 's a terrible accusation and you ca n't just do that . That should not go unpunished . \u201d", "The interviewer explained that the reference was to", "\u201c ... alternative therapies such as hypnosis and regression therapy ... \u201d", "going on to say :", "\u201c The alternative therapist who was treating PERSON at the time was PERSON . He actually does believe in recovered memories , and therefore also in the recollection of incest and of quadruple infanticide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Referring to the intuitive methods used by PERSON , the interviewer stated :", "\u201c So , PERSON can sense and see whether people have been sexually abused . \u201d", "The applicant responded , saying , among other things :", "\u201c I ca n't understand how he , how he can do that ! To me , that shows how dangerous these therapists are . Someone like that should n't , should not be allowed to be a therapist surely ? That man , he lives in GPE province , he should , er , grow cabbages for the market ... He should go and grow cabbages out there , but he should absolutely not be working with with with patients , or with people who who are in emergency situations . I find this very worrying . I consider this very unprofessional . It 's possible of course [ that ] these people are NORP ( magi\u00ebrs ) , that has nothing to do with therapists , nothing to do with doctors . They take people back in regression therapy . Where was that man educated ? Where did that man study ? I have no idea , and what does he presume to be ? That man likens himself to God . There is no medical practitioner , surely , who could say that ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . Later in the programme , referring to a conversation which PERSON had had with PERSON parents in DATE , the applicant said , among other things :", "\u201c ... I just ca n't imagine how anyone can be so presumptuous as to tell CARDINAL vulnerable old people , like some sort of guru , and , er , his truth , and then give them an audio tape and tell them : well , go and listen carefully to what I have said . Such arrogance . In my opinion it 's quite terrible . Well , if you know that father PERSON died shortly after that , he went to his grave accused by him , right , accused by a relative ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The programme also comprised an interview with PERSON , who stated that he was neither a hypnotist nor a regression therapist properly socalled . He believed , however , that the emotions aroused by relaxation exercises and acupressure reflected true events and he was certain that the memories which he had helped PERSON recover were the truth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON lodged a complaint against the applicant with the PERSON ( deken ) of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON gave a provisional opinion on DATE . It mentions that PERSON was asked , on DATE , to state his medical and scientific qualifications but declined to do so .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON noted that Mr PERSON 's refusal to state his qualifications did not , at any rate , indicate that the applicant 's statements were incorrect . However , it was understandable that Mr PERSON should feel aggrieved and it was not clear that the interests of the PERSON family were served by the applicant 's statements .", "CARDINAL . The provisional conclusion was that the complaint was well - founded . The PERSON forwarded Mr PERSON 's complaint to ORG ( ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . On DATE it gave a decision finding Mr PERSON 's complaint unfounded . It recognised that the PERSON family had a legitimate interest in contesting , in the media and elsewhere , the accusations levelled against them by PERSON ; the applicant 's expressions , though forceful , had not been disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . That ORG held a hearing on DATE , at which it was stated among other things that PERSON had been practising as a self - employed psychotherapist since DATE . He had been trained at ORG , after which he had taken some practical and theoretical courses and a DATE course on multi - method relationship therapy . He was a recognised member , supervisor and trainer of ORG ( PERSON ) . He was associated with the private foundation ( ORG ( PERSON Registratie- , Certificatie- en Ontwikkelingsinstituut PERSON , also known as \u201c Registration Institute for Nature - Oriented Health Care \u201d , GPE - instituut PERSON , or \u201c RING \u201d ) , which had set up a disciplinary system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its decision . It considered that a lawyer had not to judge the quality of a particular therapeutic method . Although PERSON had levelled accusations against her family involving CARDINAL pregnancies , CARDINAL infanticides , an abortion and the sale of a baby , PERSON PERSON had not been present when she did so ; the applicant should therefore not have connected Mr PERSON to them .", "CARDINAL . Nor should he have suggested that PERSON alleged repressed memories had been caused by PERSON use of hypnotism or regression therapy , PERSON not having claimed to be a hypnotist or a regression therapist . The applicant had been unclear in explaining what improper therapeutic measures exactly he held against PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The conversation between Mr PERSON and PERSON parents in DATE , also criticised by the applicant , had not been part of the therapy . In any case , the applicant 's criticism of that conversation was unfounded given that the applicant had not clearly explained why he considered Mr PERSON negligent in his therapeutic methods .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's vagueness might have been defensible if only he had chosen to make the interview a \u201c clarion call \u201d ( klaroenstoot ) preparatory to a civil suit to follow shortly after , but no civil suit had ever been brought .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not been entitled either to describe Mr PERSON as a \u201c magus \u201d who \u201c likened himself to God \u201d . Mr PERSON had in fact stated , in his DATE conversation with PERSON parents , his reasons for believing the truth of PERSON statements , and he had been careful to spare them feelings of guilt for the acts of their sons and to avoid labelling the sons as delinquents .", "CARDINAL . Whether or not the applicant could be said to have used \u201c irony \u201d , as he argued , the way in which he had expressed himself had been unnecessarily wounding ( onnodig grievend ) for PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON 's complaint was therefore well - founded . Since the applicant had a clean record , he was given a mere admonition ( CARDINAL waarschuwing ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , through his counsel , informed the ORG that he had instituted civil proceedings in the competent domestic tribunal , which proceedings had been adjourned pending the ORG 's decision .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON family brought an action for damages against Mr PERSON on DATE , based on what the applicant describes as the escalation of PERSON problems and the statements made by PERSON as to the veracity of Ms A.K.s alleged recollections .", "CARDINAL .
