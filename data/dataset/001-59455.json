The case is reported as NORP and Others v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON gave the leading judgment . In respect of claims for breach of statutory duty , he stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... My starting point is that the Acts in question are all concerned to establish an administrative system designed to promote the social welfare of the community . The welfare sector involved is CARDINAL of peculiar sensitivity , involving very difficult decisions how to strike the balance between protecting the child from immediate feared harm and disrupting the relationship between the child and its parents . In my judgment in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if , on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight , it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties . ...", "When CARDINAL turns to the actual words used in the primary legislation to create the duties relied upon in my judgment they are inconsistent with any intention to create a private law cause of action . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the claims that the local authority owed a duty of care to the applicants pursuant to the tort of negligence , Lord PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c I turn then to consider whether , in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs . The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority and the plaintiffs is sufficiently proximate . The third requirement laid down in GPE is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ...", "The Master of the Rolls took the view , with which I agree , that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy ( see [ DATE ] CARDINAL AER CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) . However , in my judgment there are such considerations in this case .", "First , in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk . As a result of the ministerial directions contained in ' ORG the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority 's social services . The system is inter - disciplinary , involving the participation of the police , educational bodies , doctors and others . At all stages the system involves joint discussions , joint recommendations and joint decisions . The key organisation is ORG , a multi - disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on ORG . This procedure by way of joint action takes place , not merely because it is good practice , but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority . The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive : the current edition of ' ORG runs to CARDINAL pages . To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against CARDINAL of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair . To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability , both primary and by way of contribution , of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent .", "Second , the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate . Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well - being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child 's family environment . ... In one of the child abuse cases , the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately ; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother . As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in GPE DATE ( ORG . CARDINAL ) ( ' ORG DATE ' ) said , at p. CARDINAL :", "' ... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough . Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents ; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children . These parents themselves are often in need of help . Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives . '", "ORG , if liability in damages were to be imposed , it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties . For example , as ORG makes clear , on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital . If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child ( such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations ) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts . Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay , the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children .", "The relationship between the social worker and the child 's parents is frequently CARDINAL of conflict , the parent wishing to retain care of the child , the social worker having to consider whether to remove it . This is fertile ground in which to breed ill - feeling and litigation , often hopeless , the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided . The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty . But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which can not be ignored .", "If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children , it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care . But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section DATE of LAW and the much fuller procedures now available under LAW provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation . Further , it was submitted ( and not controverted ) that the local authorities ORG would have power to investigate cases such as these .", "Finally , your Lordships ' decision in Caparo [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories . We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases . Here , for the first time , the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme . Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society ( children ) from harm done to them by others . The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who , under the general law , are responsible for the child 's welfare . To my mind , the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police ( in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others ) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty . In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer . ... In my judgment , the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by ORG with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

ORG upheld his decision . The headnote for the judgment summarised ORG findings as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Although no claim in damages lay in respect of decisions by a local authority in the exercise of a statutory discretion , if the decision complained of was so unreasonable that it fell outside the ambit of the discretion conferred , there was no a priori reason for excluding common law liability . In the instant case , the giving of information to the parents was part and parcel of the defendants ' performance of their statutory powers and duties , and it had been conceded that it was arguable that those decisions fell outside the ambit of their discretion . Accordingly , since it had also been conceded that the damage to the children was reasonably foreseeable and that there was sufficient proximity , the question for the court was whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the council or the social worker . Having regard to the fact that common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk , that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate , that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed , that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently CARDINAL of conflict and that the plaintiff children 's injuries were compensatable under LAW , it was not just and reasonable to do so . It followed that no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff parents who in any event were secondary victims in respect of their claim for psychiatric illness ...", "( CARDINAL ) ( ORG dissenting ) It was arguable that the policy considerations against imposing a common law duty of care on a local authority in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to protect children did not apply when the children whose safety was under consideration were those in respect of whom it was not performing any statutory duty . Accordingly , since in the instant case , the plaintiff children were not children for whom the council had carried out any immediate caring responsibilities under the child welfare system but were living at home with their parents , and express assurances had been given that a sexual abuser would not be placed in their home , their claim should proceed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On further appeal by the parents , ORG on DATE held that it was impossible to say that the psychiatric injury allegedly suffered by the parents , flowing from a feeling that they had brought the abuser and their children together or from a feeling of responsibility for not having detected the abuse earlier , was outside the range of psychiatric injury recognised by the law , nor was it unarguable that the local authority had owed a duty of care to the parents . The parents ' claim could not be said to be so certainly or clearly bad that they should be barred from pursuing it to trial and their appeal was allowed .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE in PERSON v. GPE of GPE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) . That case concerned the claims of the plaintiff , who had been in care from DATE , that the local authority had negligently failed to safeguard his welfare causing him deep - seated psychiatric problems . The local authority had applied to strike out the case as disclosing no cause of action . ORG , upholding the plaintiff 's appeal , unanimously held that the judgment in X and Others v. ORG did not in the circumstances of this case prevent a claim of negligence being brought against a local authority by a child formerly in its care .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , in his judgment in that case , commented as follows on the operation of the duty of care :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Although the word ' immunity ' is sometimes incorrectly used , a holding that it is not fair , just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject . It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair , just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence . ( CARDINAL ) In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances , e.g. some activities of financial regulators , building inspectors , ship surveyors , social workers dealing with sex abuse cases . In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant 's primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence . In LANGUAGE law the decision as to whether it is fair , just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would - be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would - be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered . ( CARDINAL ) In LANGUAGE law , questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law . Once the decision is taken that , say , company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company ( see ORG plc v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL , [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) , that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind . The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , LAW , Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG provided that a claim could be struck out if it disclosed no reasonable cause of action . This jurisdiction has been described as being reserved for \u201c plain and obvious cases \u201d , in which a claim was \u201c obviously unsustainable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In applications to strike out , the courts proceeded on the basis that all the allegations set out in the claimant 's pleadings were true . The question for the courts was whether , assuming that the claimant could substantiate all factual allegations at trial , the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action .", "DATE . The striking out procedure , now contained in Part CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG in force since DATE , is regarded as an important feature of LANGUAGE civil procedure , performing the function of securing speedy and effective justice , inter alia , by allowing a court to decide promptly which issues need full investigation and trial , and disposing summarily of the others . By means of this procedure , it can be determined at an early stage , with minimal cost to the parties , whether the facts as pleaded reveal a claim existing in law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
