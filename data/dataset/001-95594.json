In the course of the proceedings , CARDINAL members of ORG made a number of statements which the applicant considered defamatory . At the end of his term as a member of the ORG , A. was appointed as a judge of ORG ) .", "The proceedings ended with a decision by the ORG to transfer the applicant .", "The applicant subsequently applied to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which set aside the decision on DATE , holding in particular that the statements in issue concerned \u201c new information \u201d of which the applicant should have made aware beforehand in order to have the opportunity to make submissions in reply . The ORG did not appeal against that judgment , which became final .", "In response to a request by certain members of the ORG , it was decided to publish the documents relating to the transfer proceedings in the ORG \u2019s official bulletin . The applicant challenged that decision in the ORG , which ordered a stay of its execution . An appeal was lodged against the ORG \u2019s order . The parties have not informed ORG outcome of those proceedings .", "In addition , on the basis of the documents relating to his compulsory transfer , the applicant was accused of corruption and abuse of office . On DATE the proceedings concerning those accusations were discontinued by order of the GPE investigating judge ( giudice per le indagini preliminari ) . CARDINAL sets of disciplinary proceedings were instituted in respect of the same allegations . In CARDINAL decisions delivered on DATE and DATE the disciplinary section of the ORG ruled that there was no case to answer .", "The applicant himself subsequently requested a transfer .

CARDINAL of DATE . By virtue of that provision , members of the ORG can not be prosecuted for opinions expressed in the performance of their duties ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .

Judgment was then reserved .", "In a judgment deposited with the registry on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation .", "Referring to judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG , it held that it would have been illogical to grant immunity from criminal prosecution for certain acts while retaining the possibility of civil proceedings in respect of the same conduct . It took the view that the immunity in question should apply to civil and disciplinary proceedings as well as to criminal proceedings , so that members of the ORG could remain free from interference in performing their duties .", "In conclusion , ORG found that A. and C. should enjoy immunity ; it therefore held that the applicant \u2019s requests for investigative measures should not be granted . It also dismissed the compensation claim against ORG and PERSON", "The applicant appealed against that judgment . He argued , in particular , that during its scrutiny of the PERSON introducing section CARDINAL bis of the PERSON cited above , ORG had replaced the wording \u201c can not be prosecuted \u201d ( non sono perseguibili ) with \u201c can not be punished \u201d ( non sono punibili ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in so far as it was directed against C. and allowed it in so far as it concerned the statements by A.", "It held that the immunity provided for in section CARDINAL bis should be limited to the expression of opinions relating to \u201c the exercise of the powers and duties of members of the ORG \u201d . Whereas C. had expressed opinions while remaining within the scope of his duties , PERSON \u2019s comments had gone beyond what was normal in a situation of that kind . ORG ordered A. , GPE and PERSON to pay the applicant compensation .", "A. appealed on points of law to ORG , arguing that the immunity provided for in section CARDINAL bis covered any statement made within the NCJ . The applicant lodged a cross - appeal against ORG and an appeal on points of law against C.", "The case was set down for hearing before a CARDINAL - member bench of ORG of ORG . On DATE the applicant asked for CARDINAL of the judges to withdraw on account of their links with A.", "On DATE , counsel for the applicant asked for the case to be heard by the combined divisions of ORG ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "The President of ORG allowed the request . Counsel for the applicant then asked the President to ensure that , in the interests of impartiality , the bench of the combined divisions was made up of judges \u201c who have had no dealings of any kind with PERSON ( or , of course , with [ his own client ] ) \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers complained to the President that the composition of the bench did not comply with the rules on representation of the presidents of the different divisions .", "On DATE the applicant requested CARDINAL of the judges on the bench of the combined divisions to withdraw on account of their links with A. He added that , if they did not do so , his request was to be treated as an application for the removal of the judges in question .", "On DATE the applicant observed that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges ( Ca . ) had not withdrawn . He therefore asked for a decision on his application for that judge \u2019s removal .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the combined divisions dismissed his application .", "On DATE the applicant applied for that decision to be set aside , arguing that it breached certain procedural rules .", "On DATE counsel for the applicant likewise applied for the decision to be set aside in so far as it concerned the order for his client to pay costs .", "On DATE the applicant again requested Ca . to withdraw on the ground that he was now president of the division of which A. was a member .

In a judgment adopted DATE and deposited with the registry on DATE they allowed ORG \u2019s appeal but dismissed the applicant \u2019s cross - appeal against ORG and his appeal against C.", "ORG outlined the following legal principle :", "\u201c The guarantee laid down in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL has a broader scope than the applicant maintained , extending to the sphere of civil liability in cases concerning the expression of an opinion directly linked to a vote taking place in the course of the ORG \u2019s work and relating to the subject under discussion . This guarantee would be devoid of purpose if members of the ORG , who are exempted from all criminal liability , were on the other hand exposed to the risk of civil proceedings for activities involving the performance of the duties assigned to them ; this would have a serious effect on their function itself . \u201d", "The combined divisions went on to examine ORG reasoning as to A. \u2019s liability . They decided to quash that part of the judgment , remitting the case to a different division of ORG .", "However , they upheld ORG judgment in so far as it dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims against C. In accordance with the law , the part of ORG judgment that was not quashed became final immediately .", "In respect of the part of the judgment that was quashed , the parties had DATE and DATE from the date on which ORG judgment had been deposited to institute proceedings in ORG . However , none of the parties availed themselves of this option . Accordingly , on DATE ORG judgment became final in so far as it allowed the appeal by A.", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides that the judiciary constitutes \u201c a branch that is autonomous and independent of all other powers \u201d . By Article CARDINAL , the ORG has jurisdiction over \u201c appointments , assignments and transfers , promotions and disciplinary measures concerning judges \u201d . The ORG is presided over by the President of GPE ; the President of ORG and ORG at that court are ex officio members . CARDINAL of the other members are elected by all the ordinary judges \u201c from among the [ judges ] belonging to the various categories \u201d , and CARDINAL by ORG . The last - mentioned group , known as \u201c lay members \u201d of the ORG , are elected from among university law professors and practising lawyers with CARDINAL years\u2019 experience . Members are elected for a DATE term and can not be immediately re - elected . During their term of office they may not be registered on professional rolls , or be members of ORG or a regional council ( LAW , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW ) .", "LAW , CARDINAL of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c Members of the judiciary may not be removed from office ( sono inamovibili ) . They may not be dismissed or suspended from office or assigned to other courts or functions except by a decision of ORG , taken either on the grounds and with the guarantees for the defence set forth in the [ law on ] the judiciary or with their own consent .", "The Minister of ORG has the power to initiate ( promuovere ) disciplinary proceedings .", "Judges may be distinguished from one another only by their different functions .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL provides that , without prejudice to the powers of the ORG , the organisation and functioning of services relating to justice are the responsibility of the Minister of ORG .", "Law no . CARDINAL of DATE amended PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE on the establishment and operation of the ORG . Thus , LAW added a new section CARDINAL bis to the DATE Law , worded as follows :", "\u201c Members of ORG can not be punished for opinions expressed in the performance of their duties in connection with the subject under discussion . \u201d", "On DATE ORG objected that LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was unconstitutional in that it exempted members of the ORG from any criminal liability for abuses of authority committed in the performance of their duties . In judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the plea of unconstitutionality as being ill - founded . It observed in particular that the provision in issue was favourable to defendants in that it guaranteed members of the ORG a \u201c reinforced right \u201d to freedom of expression in the performance of their duties . The immunity it established was different from parliamentary immunity , since members of parliament \u201c [ could ] not be prosecuted \u201d for their opinions , whereas members of the ORG \u201c [ could ] not be punished \u201d . Accordingly , they could not escape the jurisdiction of the criminal courts , which could assess whether the conduct complained of had exceeded the limits laid down in CARDINAL cited above , namely whether or not it concerned \u201c the subject under discussion \u201d . Lastly , the granting of immunity to the ORG \u2019s members was justified by its position and its functions as the body guaranteeing the autonomy and independence of the judiciary .", "Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL lays down \u201c guarantees relating to the judiciary \u201d . It provides , as a general rule , for the irremovability of judges with a view to preserving their independence . It remains possible , however , to order the compulsory transfer of judges who are in a position of \u201c environmental incompatibility \u201d or who , \u201c for any reason , even through no fault of their own , are unable to perform their duties in their current post with the requisite independence and impartiality \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
