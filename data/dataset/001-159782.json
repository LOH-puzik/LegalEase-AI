GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Procedure prescribed by law;Article 5-1-e - Persons of unsound mind);No violation of Article 7 - No punishment without law (Article 7-1 - Heavier penalty;Conviction;Criminal offence)", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Khanlar Hajiyev;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in the centre for persons in preventive detention on the premises of FAC ( hereinafter the \u201c PERSON preventive detention centre \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant was convicted by the criminal courts CARDINAL times . He was found guilty of sexual assault of a DATE girl and attempted rape of a DATE girl , committed under the influence of alcohol , and of attempted sexual acts with a DATE boy . He was found to have committed other unlawful acts , including arson and strangulating a DATE boy during a burglary , but was not held criminally liable because he had been drunk . He was sentenced , in particular , to terms of imprisonment ranging from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of attempted murder , combined with attempted rape in CARDINAL case , and of CARDINAL counts of dangerous assault . It sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that DATE and DATE , the applicant had stabbed a DATE female cyclist in the back in a life - threatening manner for sexual gratification ; had stabbed a male cyclist he had mistaken for a woman twice in the back and at the temple , again for sexual gratification ; and had stabbed a twentythree CARDINAL woman CARDINAL times in a life - threatening manner in an attempt to rape her . He had committed those offences under the influence of alcohol in a park in GPE . Still drunk , he had then broken into a house , strangulated a DATE girl and had injured her with a knife below the waist for sexual gratification . He was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having consulted CARDINAL medical experts , ORG found that at the time of committing the offences , the applicant had been in a state of diminished criminal responsibility ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was diagnosed with sexual deviance , a personality disorder and psycho - organic syndrome , which was probably a consequence of his longstanding alcohol abuse . As long as the applicant did not drink alcohol , those abnormalities did not affect his criminal responsibility as he was able to control his aggression . However , combined with the consumption of alcohol , they led to his criminal responsibility being diminished .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided to order the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW of LAW . It considered that as a result of his personality disorder , the applicant had a propensity to commit serious offences which seriously harmed the victims both physically and mentally . As confirmed by the CARDINAL medical experts , there was a high risk that if released , the applicant would commit further violent offences for sexual gratification under the influence of alcohol , similar to those of which he had been found guilty . He therefore presented a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG decided not to order the applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court endorsed the experts\u2019 finding that the applicant \u2019s personality disorder could no longer be treated because his sexually deviant aggressive behaviour had lasted for DATE and because he would be unable to pursue psychotherapy in view of his limited intellectual capacity . Public security could therefore be better safeguarded by placing the applicant in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant served his full term of imprisonment , and on DATE he was placed for the first time in preventive detention , for which he was held in a wing of GPE prison . By DATE he had served DATE in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . The courts responsible for the execution of sentences ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention at regular intervals . In particular , ORG ordered the continuation of his detention on CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences , ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . ORG further ordered FAC authorities to offer the applicant , within DATE on which its decision became final , a specific anti - hormonal therapy with medication aimed at reducing his sadistic fantasies and his libido , and thus his dangerousness . The court had consulted ORG authorities and the prosecution and had heard the applicant in person as well as his counsel , who represented him throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the requirements for ordering the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention laid down in the second sentence of section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been met .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that the said transitional provision was applicable to the applicant \u2019s case . It noted that at the time of his last offence on DATE , the applicant \u2019s first placement in preventive detention could not exceed DATE . It was only following the entry into force of ORG and Other LAW on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the courts responsible for the execution of sentences could prolong preventive detention without any maximum duration . The applicant therefore fell within the category of detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively , as defined by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . ORG further noted that the second sentence of section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW had regard to , and had taken up , the standards set up by ORG in the above - mentioned judgment for the continuation of retrospectively ordered or retrospectively prolonged preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that , in accordance with section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It endorsed the findings made on that point by PERSON , an external psychiatric expert it had consulted , in his report dated DATE . The expert had been obliged to draw up his report on the basis of the case files as the applicant had refused to be examined . Expert PERSON had confirmed that the applicant suffered from sexual sadism , a sexual deviance , and was addicted to alcohol , even though he had not drunk since being detained . ORG stressed that expert PERSON \u2019s assessment confirmed the findings made by a number of previous experts , notably those made in DATE and DATE by CARDINAL experts who had diagnosed the applicant with a sexual preference disorder with sadomasochistic , fetishist and paedophiliac elements and with an alcohol addiction without current consumption of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that , as required by section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW to LAW , there was still a very high risk that , owing to specific circumstances relating to his personality and his conduct , the applicant would if released commit the most serious sexually motivated violent offences , similar to those of which he had been convicted . Endorsing the findings of expert PERSON , in accordance with the above - mentioned previous expert reports , the court noted that the applicant had admitted to his sadistic fantasies but had been unable to address them through therapy . In FAC , he had stopped participating in any activities for persons in preventive detention . The ORG stressed that , in his assessment of the applicant \u2019s dangerousness , the expert had taken into consideration his advanced age of DATE . However , he had convincingly explained that the applicant \u2019s sexual deviance had not yet been considerably alleviated thereby . Furthermore , his alcohol addiction had not yet been treated adequately . However , the consumption of alcohol further increased the high risk that the applicant would commit sexual or violent offences again if released .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the prolongation of the preventive detention of the applicant , who had been detained for DATE , was still proportionate in view of the considerable threat he posed to the public . It noted in that context that the applicant \u2019s detention in a supervised residence , which it had suggested in its previous decision , was not possible in practice .", "CARDINAL . As regards the order issued by ORG , based on LAW , read in conjunction with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL sub - paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE below ) , that FAC authorities offer the applicant specific anti - hormonal therapy , the court found that that order was necessary to guarantee the applicant sufficient care while in preventive detention . Expert PERSON had stressed \u2013 as he had already done in DATE that the prison authorities must at least attempt to treat the applicant , who was willing to undergo treatment with medication . The anti - hormonal therapy to be offered had proved to diminish sadistic fantasies and the libido , and could therefore reduce the applicant \u2019s dangerousness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision , for which he submitted reasons on DATE . He argued , in particular , that his preventive detention , a penalty which had been prolonged retrospectively , failed to comply with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it confirmed that the requirements laid down in section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW to LAW for ordering the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention had been met .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account the report submitted by expert PERSON , ORG held that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder as defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Referring to ORG case - law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , it found that a mental disorder under that Act did not require that the disorder was such as to diminish or exclude the criminal responsibility of the person concerned for the purposes of Articles DATE of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Specific disorders affecting a person \u2019s personality , conduct , sexual preference and control of impulses were covered by the notion of \u201c mental disorder \u201d in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The applicant \u2019s sexual sadism and his alcohol addiction without current consumption of alcohol amounted to a mental disorder within the meaning of that provision .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , there was still a very high risk that , if released , the applicant would commit the most serious violent and sexual offences , similar to those of which he had been convicted , owing to specific circumstances relating to his personality and his conduct . The applicant \u2019s dangerousness had not been reduced through therapy ; nor had he become less dangerous by his advancing age . He currently did not participate in any serious therapeutic activities and kept trivialising his offences . Moreover , expert PERSON had confirmed that his mental illness was difficult to treat . ORG further endorsed ORG finding that the applicant \u2019s continued detention was still proportionate , despite the considerable overall length of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG and ORG . He claimed that the order for the continuation of his preventive detention violated his constitutional right to liberty , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that under ORG Rights\u2019 well - established case - law ( he referred to PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) , the retrospective prolongation of a person \u2019s preventive detention DATE a penalty DATE beyond the former DATE time - limit breached the prohibition on retrospective punishment under LAW and did not comply with sub - paragraph ( a ) of LAW . Moreover , his continuing preventive detention could not be justified under sub - paragraph ( e ) of LAW either . He did not suffer from a mental disease as required by that provision . In addition , the notion and scope of \u201c mental disorder \u201d under the applicable provisions of domestic law and in the domestic courts\u2019 case - law was unclear .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stressed that ORG had recommended his placement in a supervised residence . In those circumstances , his continued preventive detention on the LOC of FAC was no longer proportionate . He conceded , however , that his detention in the new preventive detention centre on the LOC of FAC complied with the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , civil section , ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in ORG under LAW . It found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of LAW and that there was a high risk that , if released , he would commit further serious offences . On DATE ORG quashed that decision on the grounds that detention under LAW could only be ordered once the preventive detention of the person concerned had been terminated by a final decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a decision reviewing the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . It noted that the applicant had repeatedly refused treatment with medication to diminish his libido .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having consulted medical expert PERSON , again ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with section CARDINALf(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the applicant had been held in preventive detention in a wing of FAC . He had participated in therapy with a psychologist DATE , but had then stopped that therapy . He had refused to participate in the alcohol addiction treatment programme offered to him or any other treatment measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred with his consent to a wing of FAC for persons in preventive detention where a transitional concept had been adopted . The aim was to improve the available treatment options in the light of the duty to differentiate preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment , by reference to ORG Rights\u2019 judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) and ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The applicant participated in group therapy sessions run by a doctor and in a social skills training course . He stopped attending the group for addicts and refused to take medication to reduce his libido for fear of side effects .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been detained in the new PERSON centre for persons in preventive detention , a separate building constructed on the premises of FAC .", "CARDINAL . NORP The conception of preventive detention in the centre was developed in order to comply with the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment , as defined in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see CARDINAL and DATE below ) and as further specified in the newly enacted Article CARDINALc of LAW and in FAC ( see DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Up to CARDINAL persons can be detained in the PERSON centre . Detainees are placed in apartment units measuring QUANTITY containing CARDINAL furnished rooms and a bathroom . With the exception of detainees posing a particular security risk , the detainees can move freely within the preventive detention building and on its outdoor LOC from CARDINAL TIME They may furnish and paint their rooms , to which they have their own keys . The rooms are equipped with a controlled access to the internet including e - mail , telephone , television , CD and DVD player and radio . There are common rooms for residential groups consisting of CARDINAL detainees , which include a kitchen , a dining room , a television room and rooms for games , handicraft work and exercise . The outdoor LOC , measuring QUANTITY , can be used for sports , recreation or gardening .", "CARDINAL . Persons in preventive detention in the PERSON centre may wear their own clothes . They can either take meals prepared by the centre \u2019s staff or prepare their own meals ( in which case they receive an allowance for purchasing food in the centre \u2019s supermarket ) . Persons in preventive detention may work , but are not obliged to do so . They may receive visits regularly .", "CARDINAL . According to information furnished by the ORG , at the relevant time the applicant was CARDINAL of CARDINAL persons detained in the PERSON preventive detention centre . In order to comply with the duty to provide the necessary therapy and care and to motivate detainees to participate in the relevant therapies and treatment , the centre \u2019s staff comprised CARDINAL psychiatrist , CARDINAL psychologists , CARDINAL social workers and CARDINAL members of the general prison service . The staffing situation was similar to that of ORG , situated in the same Land and where persons were detained under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Detainees are examined at the beginning of preventive detention in order to determine the necessary therapy and care . A personal treatment plan ( NORP ) is then drawn up .", "CARDINAL . According to the personal treatment plan drawn up for the applicant by the PERSON centre on DATE , it was noted that in the past , from DATE until DATE , the applicant participated in group sessions aimed at preventing detainees from relapsing into excessive alcohol consumption . He then stopped attending the meetings . He also regularly participated in group sessions at which detainees discussed their experiences during leave from detention . He stopped participating in those meetings in DATE too , arguing that the participants were not granted sufficient additional leave . In addition , he had motivation meetings with a psychologist DATE until DATE , when he stopped attending the meetings , alleging that the psychologist lacked experience . He took part in DATE residential group meetings from DATE until DATE , when he stopped attending the meetings , arguing that his treatment plan did not meet his expectations . He did not take part in any structured leisure activities and spent most of DATE alone watching television . He declined repeated invitations to take part in group sessions of the treatment programme for offenders . Thus , as from DATE the applicant no longer participated in any therapy measures . He proved reliable during leave from the detention centre under escort on a number of occasions .", "CARDINAL . According to the PERSON centre \u2019s treatment plan for the applicant of DATE and an internal note from a staff member of the centre , the applicant has refused regular and repeated offers to start a treatment with medication to reduce his libido , which had been recommended by expert PERSON in DATE , for fear of side effects . In DATE he showed willing for the first time to take up such treatment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "7-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-e"]}
