Taking these arguments into account , on CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted PERSON and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court applied a sentence below the minimum provided for by law for the crime of rape against a person DATE , finding mitigating circumstances due to the defendant \u2019s good behaviour prior to the commission of the crime on trial .

ORG of Appeal based its verdict on the statements given by PERSON and M.S.B. as well as the account of the events given by the other perpetrators .

The findings of the forensic psychiatric report of DATE were not mentioned or discussed in any way by the court .", "The court of appeal explained as follows :", "\u201c The court considers that the crime of rape is committed by constraint - physical or moral - or by taking advantage of the victim \u2019s lack of capacity to express his / her will , more specifically rape is a sexual intercourse committed without consent . On the other hand , the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor , as provided by LAW , means engaging in a sexual intercourse with a minor DATE , but with the minor \u2019s consent . ...", "\u201c The presumption of lack of capacity applies only to minors who are under DATE and have committed a crime , but with respect to the crime provided by LAW , the minor [ the applicant ] is the victim and not the perpetrator . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
