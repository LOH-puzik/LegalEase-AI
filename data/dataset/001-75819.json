BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - reserved;Costs and expenses (Convention proceedings) - partially awarded and partially reserved", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In DATE ORG decided to privatise a hotel owned by GPE , and situated in GPE , GPE . In DATE ORG opened a procedure for the privatisation of the hotel through negotiations with potential buyers . At the close of the procedure only CARDINAL company had submitted a privatisation bid . On DATE that company assigned its rights under the privatisation procedure to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company entered into a privatisation contract with ORG , whereby it bought the hotel . It agreed to pay MONEY ( ORG ) and also agreed to make , during DATE , investments in the amount of MONEY . The applicant company also undertook to create fortyfive new jobs . ORG CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the contract stipulated that the applicant company was barred from disposing of the hotel for DATE without the express consent of ORG . Clause CARDINAL of the contract , however , stipulated that the applicant company could convey the hotel as noncash consideration for shares in a limited liability company , if it held PERCENT of such a company \u2019s shares .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG , acting pursuant to an article in the DATE newspaper ORG published in its issue of CARDINAL DATE , and to complaints by employees and leaseholders of hotel LOC , ordered the suspension of the performance of the privatisation contract . It relied on LAW ( \u201c the CCrP \u201d ) and on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , and reasoned that the privatisation procedure had been tainted by a breach of paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of ORG and LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . There were also indications that certain interested parties had not been properly notified of the privatisation terms . The latest valuation of the hotel prior to the privatisation had been conducted under circumstances which called into question the objectivity of the officials involved . These facts could only be elucidated through a criminal investigation . The prosecution authorities were also bound to exercise their powers under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In these circumstances , the performance of the obligations in the privatisation contract would disturb public order , lead to the commission of offences by officials and economic offences , and cause considerable damage .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the chairperson of ORG and on ORG , but not on the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The mayor of GPE appealed against the decision to ORG , arguing that the privatisation contract could only be set aside by a court . In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , reasoning that the lower prosecutor \u2019s office had correctly found that measures \u2013 consisting of the suspension of the performance of DATE had to be taken to prevent the future commission of offences and that it was bound to seek the annulment of the contract by a court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The mayor of GPE further appealed to ORG . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal , fully endorsing the reasoning of the lower prosecutor \u2019s offices and noting that a criminal investigation had been opened into the matter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was not served copies of the above decisions and was apparently not aware of these developments .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , GPE handed possession of the hotel over to the applicant company . On DATE the mayor of GPE ordered that all prior leaseholders be removed from the hotel LOC .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG apparently opened a criminal investigation against an official of GPE or the municipal company which previously owned the hotel . The charges apparently included abuse of office .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG , relying on LAW ORG and on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , ordered the police to remove the applicant company \u2019s officers , subcontractors and agents from the hotel , which was to be placed in the custody of a ORG company . It also ordered the police to seize all accounting and other documents relating to the returns obtained by the company since it had taken possession of the hotel , and to notify its officers that any attempt to regain possession of the hotel would constitute an offence under LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It reasoned that by undertaking these measures despite the fact that it had ordered the suspension of the performance of the privatisation contract and had commenced an action under paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW ORG of DATE and a criminal investigation , GPE had seriously breached section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Judicial Power Act of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) and had infringed important public interests and public order .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision was served on GPE , but not on the applicant company . The company learned about it on DATE , when the police arrived at the hotel , removed its officers and agents from the LOC , and warned its manager that any attempt to regain possession of the hotel would constitute an offence under LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE appealed against the decision to ORG , arguing that it had been unlawful , as the applicant company was the rightful owner of the hotel and there were no legal grounds for its eviction . In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that the performance of the privatisation contract had been suspended and that an action had been commenced by ORG aiming to annul the contract . The legal basis of the decision appealed against were LAW ORG and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE . The fact that a civil action had been commenced and that a criminal investigation had been opened indicated that there was a risk that an offence would be committed . The legality of the decision was not affected by the fact that it had not been served on the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG , exercising its powers under LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , brought a civil action against GPE and the applicant company , seeking the annulment of the privatisation contract . It argued that it had been entered into under manifestly disadvantageous conditions , within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW and LAW of DATE . The price paid for the hotel had been below its real market value . The penalties stipulated in the contract in the event of a failure of the applicant company to perform its investment obligations were negligible . The applicant company was allowed to convey the hotel as noncash consideration for shares in a limited liability company despite the prohibition to dispose of the hotel for DATE . The contract made no provision for its rescission in the event of nonperformance . Finally , the performance of the contract was questionable in view of the fact that the negotiations had initially been conducted with another company , while the applicant company had intervened in the process later .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE made a request for a declaratory judgment to the effect that the decisions of ORG had been made without a legal basis , were ultra vires and thus null and void , and did not entail any legal consequences . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the request as inadmissible , holding that it was not connected with the subjectmatter of the original action , as it concerned acts which postdated the execution of the contract , and that it was not sufficiently precise , as it did not specifically identify all impugned decisions of GPE Prosecutor \u2019s Office . The court went on to say that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the lawfulness of ORG decisions and actions in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed GPE Prosecutor \u2019s Office \u2019s action . It held , inter alia , that the price at which the hotel had been sold was not unreasonable . It took into account not only the cash amount paid to ORG , but also the investment and job creation commitments . The court went on to say that there was no legal prohibition on the use of privatised property as noncash consideration for shares . There was nothing to prevent the parties to the contract to agree that the applicant company was free to do so under certain conditions . ORG Office \u2019s arguments concerning the possibility of such a transaction were immaterial , as the court \u2019s task was not to hypothesise about future events , but to decide on the basis of concrete facts . The court further found that the lack of any clauses in the contract for its rescission did not render it manifestly disadvantageous , since in the event of nonperformance it could be rescinded by virtue of the law . The penalties provided by the contract for nonperformance were immaterial since ORG could in any event claim compensation for its actual damages by law . The court thus did not find it established that the contract had been entered into under manifestly disadvantageous conditions .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Prosecutor \u2019s Office appealed to ORG . Its appeal was not endorsed by ORG , which argued in an additional memorial that GPE had correctly disposed of the case .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment , with similar reasoning .", "CARDINAL . Despite its previous stance , the Sofia Appellate Prosecutor \u2019s Office lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG , apparently on the express instructions of ORG ( the successor entity of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE , at which a prosecutor of ORG maintained the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment , fully confirming its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , while the proceedings before ORG were pending , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant company appealed to ORG against ORG decisions of DATE and DATE . It argued that they were unlawful and that ORG Office reliance on LAW ORG had been misplaced . It filed the appeal through ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant company that the decisions had already been unsuccessfully appealed before ORG and ORG and sent the applicant company copies of the latter \u2019s decisions . It noted that there were no new facts warranting the rescission or variation of the impugned decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed its appeal directly with the Sofia ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It reasoned that the decisions of DATE and DATE had already been appealed against before ORG and ORG , which had rejected the appeals . It had therefore no competence to examine them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG , asking it to rescind its decisions of DATE and DATE . It argued that the dismissal of the action against it by means of a final judgment was a fresh fact indicating that the privatisation contract had not been entered into under manifestly disadvantageous conditions and that no ORG or public interests had been prejudiced thereby . Moreover , the prohibition to use the hotel had already lasted DATE , without any justification , in breach of its right under LAW No . CARDINAL to peacefully enjoy its possessions .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant company that there was no need to rescind the decision of DATE , but that the final judgment of ORG was binding upon the parties to the case and they should comply with it .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , a copy of which was sent to the applicant company , ORG notified the police that following ORG judgment the decisions of DATE and DATE were no longer enforceable .", "CARDINAL .

The task of ORG is to ensure the enforcement of the law by ( i ) prosecuting persons who have allegedly committed criminal offences , ( ii ) overseeing the execution of penalties and coercive measures , ( iii ) seeking the annulment of unlawful decisions and instruments , and ( iv ) participating , where provided by law , in civil and administrative proceedings ( LAW of CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

[ These measures may include ] the temporary impounding of the means which could be used for committing the offence \u201d . The new Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE , which entered into force on DATE and superseded the ORG , does not contain a provision similar to that of the former LAW", "CARDINAL .
