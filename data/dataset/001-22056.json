After the latter \u2019s expulsion from the GPE in DATE , the applicant divorced her . In the meantime , the applicant had started a relationship with PERSON , a NORP national . CARDINAL children , PERSON and PERSON , were born out of this relationship on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively . On DATE the applicant was granted a permanent residence permit ( vergunning tot vestiging ) .", "On DATE , the applicant was driving a getaway car after an armed robbery . During the car \u2019s pursuit by the police CARDINAL of the persons in the car driven by the applicant shot and killed a policeman .

This request was rejected by the President of ORG on DATE . The President , noting that financial difficulties had led the applicant to become involved in the facts of which he had been convicted and that he wished to maintain his relationship with his seriously heroin - addicted partner , held that recidivism could not be excluded .", "On DATE the applicant was expelled to GPE . He travelled back to the GPE on CARDINAL DATE , allegedly because his mother and his children had difficulties living without him . He further made arrangements with the childcare organisation in order to see his youngest child .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life with his children was justified under the second paragraph of LAW , in particular on the ground of prevention of disorder . It found that neither the applicant \u2019s submissions about the interest of himself and his children in his continued stay in the GPE nor his personal circumstances should be given an overruling importance by the ORG Secretary .", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted of unlawful residence in the GPE as an undesirable alien and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .

In DATE , his spouse filed a request for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) on behalf of the applicant for the purpose of \u201c stay with spouse \u201d . The PERSON local police issued a positive opinion on the condition that the applicant complied with the requirements for the stated purpose , one of these being no criminal record .", "After the provisional residence visa had been issued in DATE , the applicant entered the GPE on DATE . On DATE , he applied for a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) and , for this purpose , signed a declaration in NORP stating that he had never had any dealings with the police or the criminal justice authorities ( antecedentenverklaring ) . On DATE , he was granted a residence permit .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary withdrew the applicant \u2019s residence permit , holding that both the provisional residence visa and the residence permit had been issued erroneously , as DATE pursuant to LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW persons having been declared an undesirable alien are not eligible for residence permits . In addition and , according to his own statement , hoping that this would remain unnoticed , he had signed a declaration that he had no criminal record .", "The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) to the decision was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision with ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) sitting in GPE .

It held that the applicant \u2019s residence permit to stay with a NORP spouse had been withdrawn on correct grounds , since DATE by signing the declaration on criminal antecedents \u2013 the applicant had provided incorrect information . Recalling that the applicant had stated that he had signed this declaration in the hope that it would not be noticed that he had had dealings with the GPE criminal justice system and that he had served a DATE prison sentence and thus would obtain a residence permit , ORG concluded that he had willingly misinformed the authorities .", "Insofar as the applicant relied on LAW NORP spouse and his CARDINAL children , ORG considered , taking into account the applicant \u2019s conviction in balancing the interests involved as required under LAW , that the interests of the GPE authorities outweighed those of the applicant . ORG held that , after ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , no new facts or circumstances had become apparent prompting a different finding .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant returned or was expelled to GPE .", "Under LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) , an alien can be declared undesirable by the Minister of Justice when he or she has been convicted of an offence punishable by a prison sentence of DATE or more .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that an alien who stays in the GPE knowing that he has been declared an undesirable alien commits a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of MONEY .", "According to LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of FAC ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) , a body of immigration directives drawn up and published by ORG , a decision declaring a person an undesirable alien shall \u2013 upon a request thereto from the person concerned \u2013be lifted after DATE residency abroad where the decision declaring this person an undesirable alien has been taken on grounds of a conviction of serious violent crimes or drug dealing .
