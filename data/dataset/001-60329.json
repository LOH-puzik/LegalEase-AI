NORP Immediately following its birth in a private clinic , \u201c FAC \u201d , in PERSON the applicant 's new - born baby was admitted to the intensive care unit of ORG suffering from serious respiratory and neurological post - asphyxia syndrome induced by the position in which it had become lodged during delivery . The baby died on CARDINAL DATE , DATE after birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint . The PERSON public prosecutor 's office started an investigation that DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was questioned as a witness . A team of CARDINAL expert witnesses was named .", "CARDINAL . As nothing further happened in the proceedings , the applicants made several requests , notably on DATE , and DATE and DATE , for the investigation to be expedited . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office itself requested the expert witnesses to lodge their report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were informed that at the request of the public prosecutor 's office , the investigating judge had notified GPE \u2013 the doctor responsible for delivering the baby and the joint owner of the clinic DATE that charges would be brought against him .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the scheduled questioning of certain witnesses on DATE did not take place , as the judge dealing with the case was on holiday .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicants were joined to the proceedings as civil parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution applied for the complaint to be filed away without further action . That application was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge instructed the public prosecutor 's office to make further inquiries . Consequently , on CARDINAL DATE the deputy public prosecutor ordered forensic tests . The results were made available on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was committed for trial before ORG on a charge of involuntary manslaughter and the applicants renewed their application to be joined to the proceedings as civil parties .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was set down for DATE but had to be adjourned because of a lawyers ' strike . The next hearing on DATE was also adjourned due to a delay in service of a summons on the accused to appear .", "CARDINAL . A new hearing date was fixed for DATE . On that date an order was made for the accused 's trial in absentia . The trial did not begin , however , until DATE , as meanwhile the accused had changed lawyers . The hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned until DATE as the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated . The trial thereafter continued with hearings on DATE , and CARDINAL and DATE ( the latter hearing being adjourned as one of the expert witnesses appointed by the court had to be replaced ) . A hearing on DATE was adjourned to QUANTITY DATE , again owing to the fact that the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated . There were further hearings on CARDINAL and DATE . On the latter date the order for the accused 's trial in absentia was revoked , but the hearing had to be adjourned as the expert witnesses failed to attend without due cause ( they were ordered to pay a fine and to attend the next hearing on DATE ) . A final hearing took place on DATE . The accused , who had attended the hearings on CARDINAL DATE and DATE , was not present at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the ORG found the accused guilty in absentia of involuntary manslaughter . Its judgment was lodged with the registry on DATE . ORG sentenced the accused to DATE imprisonment and ordered him to pay the civil parties ' costs together with compensation to be assessed at DATE .", "CARDINAL . It found firstly that the accused knew that the birth had to be regarded as high risk since the mother was a level - A diabetic and had a past history of confinements that had been equally difficult because of the size of the foetus . The risks inherent in deliveries in such circumstances , which the expert witnesses appointed by ORG described as readily foreseeable , meant that precautionary measures should have been taken and that the doctor in charge should have been present . ORG found , however , that GPE , whom the applicant had consulted during the pregnancy , had made no arrangements for precautionary measures , such as an external examination of the mother , to assess whether the foetus was too large for a natural birth . Above all , he had absented himself during the birth . When the complications had occurred , it had taken the nursing staff TIME to locate GPE , who was busy seeing patients in another part of the clinic . The intervening delay before ORG was able to perform the manipulation necessary to extract the foetus had significantly reduced the new - born 's chances of survival .", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless suspended the sentence and ordered that the conviction should not appear on GPE 's criminal record . In addition , it dismissed the civil parties ' application for a provisional award of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE E.C. appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was delivered in absentia and lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . Noting that he had been tried in absentia at first instance , ORG held that ORG had failed to give his lawyer the authority to act required under the rules applicable in such cases . It ordered him to reimburse the costs incurred by the civil parties in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE appealed to ORG . In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG overturned the decision of ORG , to which it remitted the case for a retrial . It held that ORG had erred in treating GPE as being absent , as he had been present at the start of the trial and had accordingly to be regarded as having left the court during the trial and not as liable to trial in absentia .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG ruled that the prosecution of the offence was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . In so doing , it noted that the limitation period for the offence of which ORG was accused had expired on DATE , in other words , even before ORG had delivered its judgment .", "CARDINAL . Following DATE 's conviction at first instance by ORG on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the applicants served a summons requiring ORG to appear before the civil court of that town .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the applicants entered into an agreement with the insurers of the doctor and the clinic under which the insurers were to pay MONEY ( ORG ) for any damage sustained by the applicants . Of that sum , ITL CARDINAL were designated as reparation for the special loss sustained by PERSON . At that time , the criminal proceedings were pending in ORG following ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , as the parties failed to attend a hearing on DATE , the case was struck out of the civil court 's list . At that stage , the criminal proceedings had only just ended , ORG ruling that the prosecution of the offence was time - barred having become final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the NORP LAW provides :", "\u201c The public prosecutor 's office has a duty to prosecute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW lays down that the penalty for involuntary manslaughter is imprisonment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , LAW , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW provides that the limitation period for involuntary manslaughter is DATE . That period may be extended by CARDINAL as a result of any interlocutory matters arising , but may under no circumstances exceed DATE from the date of the offence .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , LAW provides :", "\u201c In cases in which publishing the decision on the merits may contribute to providing reparation for the damage , the court may , on application by an interested party , order the losing party to publish the decision at its own expense in CARDINAL or more newspapers determined by the court .", "If the decision is not published within the period fixed by the court , the interested party may arrange for publication and shall retain the right to recover the costs from the losing party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the resolution cited above , adopted on DATE , ORG recommended that in their internal legislation and practice the governments of the member States be guided by the following principles :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings should not be instituted or , if appropriate , sanctions shall not be imposed for manslaughter or accidental bodily injury resulting from a minor traffic offence , that is to say , a driving offence that was not such that its author must have been aware of the danger to which he exposed himself or others ;", "CARDINAL . The same should apply , subject to the inexcusable character of the fault committed , in respect of a person who has caused manslaughter or accidental bodily injury if he himself or someone dear to him has been so badly injured that a sanction would be pointless , if not inhuman ;", "CARDINAL . Application of the above - mentioned recommendations should in no way prejudice the rights of the victims to obtain compensation . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
