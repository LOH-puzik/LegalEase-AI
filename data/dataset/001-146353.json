On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for judicial review . He argued that the term \u201c widow or widower \u201d in LAW , ORG ( LOC . ORG ) should be construed as encompassing the surviving partner in a civil partnership .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . According to the court the surviving partner in a civil partnership could not be called a \u201c widower \u201d in the generally accepted sense of the term . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s civil partnership had not lasted DATE , which would have led to statutory exclusion from the benefit even for married couples .", "CARDINAL .

The remaining leapfrog appeal on points of law ( Sprungrevision ) was dismissed on DATE by ORG . The court pointed out that the respondent had partly acknowledged the applicant \u2019s claim , so that the appeal concerned only the period from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , hereinafter \u201c the DATE case \u201d ) which had been brought in DATE concerning the pension rights of a surviving partner in a civil partnership . It found that denying a partner in a civil union the right to a survivor \u2019s pension from the civil servants\u2019 pension scheme , when the legislature had already amended LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , Book VI , in respect of the general pension scheme , violated the principle of non - discrimination as set down in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pointed to the above - mentioned judgment and requested a decision to the same effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG decided not to review the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . In its reasoning the panel explained that the complaint did not raise a pressing constitutional question as the relevant provision of the social security legislation had meanwhile been amended . Even assuming that the legislative provision concerned had violated the LAW , ORG could not have afforded redress as the legislature could not be required to amend a provision that had already become void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with a copy of the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government informed the ORG that in response to the pilot judgment in GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) an Act on Protracted Court Proceedings and Criminal Investigations ( PERSON \u00fcber den GPE bei \u00fcberlangen PERSON ORG ) had been published in ORG and had entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG informed the applicant of the enactment of the new domestic remedy and drew his attention to the transitional provision of that LAW . Referring to the ORG v. GPE case ( ( dec . ) , no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINALIX ) , the ORG invited the applicant to inform it whether he intended to make use of the new remedy within the time - limit set by the transitional provision in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant informed the ORG that he intended to file a complaint under the new domestic provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint under LAW , claiming compensation in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . He complained that constitutional court proceedings that lasted DATE , DATE and DATE were excessively long , even taking the position and function of ORG into account . He pointed out that his case could not be considered a particularly difficult CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of the proceedings the judge rapporteur for the constitutional complaint submitted a statement explaining that when he took office and became judge rapporteur for this complaint on DATE it had already been agreed between his predecessor and judge PERSON , who was judge rapporteur for the DATE case ( compare paragraph CARDINAL , above ) , that the handling of the applicant \u2019s complaint should be postponed until the DATE case had been determined . Subsequently , it became clear that the DATE case did not pose a problem of retroactivity and therefore did not affect the outcome of the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . The judge rapporteur conceded that the applicant \u2019s submissions were sufficiently substantiated for his constitutional complaint to indeed have been dealt with earlier on the basis of the actual reasoning given . However , the judge maintained that it had been in the applicant \u2019s best interest to wait for the court \u2019s ruling in the DATE case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant replied that the judge rapporteur \u2019s statement demonstrated that his constitutional complaint had not been given any attention whatsoever in DATE after it was lodged . It would have been obvious even from a cursory examination of the constitutional complaints that his complaint concerned the retroactive application of a legislative amendment . Therefore , any proper comparison of his case with the DATE case would have easily shown that the CARDINAL cases were not interdependent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complaints panel of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint under section PERSON of ORG . Citing PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ) , as well as PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG noted that a chronic backlog of cases in the constitutional courts could not justify the excessive length of proceedings . However , when assessing whether the duration of proceedings was excessive , ORG had to consider its special function and position . Unlike the ordinary courts , the capacity and structure of a ORG were laid down in the LAW and it served further purposes beyond the administration of individual justice . The scope for adaptation and for the acceleration of proceedings was therefore limited . Furthermore , decisions and judgments of ORG had binding inter omnes legal effect and for this reason had to be drafted with the utmost diligence . The court further explained that it was in the nature of constitutional court proceedings that chronological case management was of subordinate importance . Concerning the applicant \u2019s case , the court noted that the actual duration of the proceedings DATE was unusually long , but not excessive . For the purposes of its examination ORG noted that CARDINAL phases could be distinguished : ( a ) the phase of over DATE between the lodging of the constitutional complaint and the decision to await the outcome of the DATE case ; ( b ) the phase of DATE until a decision had been given in the DATE case ; and ( c ) the phase of DATE until the constitutional complaint at issue had been determined . A new judge rapporteur had stepped in at the end of his predecessor \u2019s term of office and his predecessor had had to finish cases of higher priority than that of the applicant . The court maintained that the DATE wait in accordance with section CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG had not been excessive considering that ORG had opted to rule on a similar case concerning the pension rights of surviving partners in a civil union ( the DATE case ) before the applicant \u2019s case . The court pointed out that , although in hindsight the present case could have been decided without reference to the \u201c pilot case \u201d , the CARDINAL cases shared sufficient similarities to justify the decision of the former judge rapporteur . Nothing indicated that the decision to postpone the applicant \u2019s case pending a decision on the DATE case had been based on arbitrary considerations . The court noted that the applicant had never claimed that the sum of money at issue was of extraordinary financial importance to him . In conclusion , ORG argued that after the decision in the DATE case the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint had been determined in due time , without any delay .", "CARDINAL .
