A final decision was adopted by the ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG disagreed with the lower - level courts\u2019 interpretation of section CARDINAL of LAW . It held that that section could not be interpreted so as to deny a biological father the right to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity if the legal father had acknowledged paternity in the knowledge that he was not in fact the father of the child . On the other hand , having the standing to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity did not mean that the claim should be automatically upheld , since the courts were obligated to balance the rights of the child and the rights of the biological father .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG found no reason to doubt the professional competence of the staff of ORG and agreed with its assessment of the interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG held that the appeal court had erred in deciding that the applicant lacked standing to contest the acknowledgment of paternity . However , \u201c taking into account the unreasonable length of the proceedings \u201d , the ORG , decided not to remit the case to the appeal court . The judgment of the appeal court was thus upheld .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that after the decision became final , he learned of certain facts previously unknown to him .

Among other things , he complained that ORG had come to the unsubstantiated conclusion that PERSON was living with ORG and the child , whereas in fact he had been living with another woman in a different town .", "CARDINAL .
