She has lived DATE in a house on the outskirts of GPE , QUANTITY away from a plant for the storage and treatment of \u201c special waste \u201d classified as either hazardous or non - hazardous . A joint - stock company , ORG began operating the plant in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision ( delibera ) of DATE , ORG granted PERSON a licence to operate the plant for a DATE period . The different forms of waste treatment covered by ORG licence included , for the first time , the \u201c detoxification \u201d ( inertizzazione ) of hazardous waste , a process involving the treatment of special industrial waste using chemicals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised PERSON to increase the annual quantity of waste treated at the plant to a total volume of QUANTITY . In particular , the quantity of toxic waste authorised for detoxification was raised from QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved a number of alterations entailing technological improvements to the facility without any increase in the quantity of waste being treated .", "CARDINAL .

It noted that all her complaints were based on the alleged need for ORG to conduct a fresh licensing procedure . It considered , however , that the size of the facility and its volume of activity had been determined in ORG decisions of DATE and DATE , which had never been challenged by the applicant . However , the alterations approved in the impugned decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE did not entail an increase in the plant \u2019s volume of activity or a change in the types of waste being treated . Accordingly , it was not necessary for ORG to conduct a fresh licensing procedure .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed .
