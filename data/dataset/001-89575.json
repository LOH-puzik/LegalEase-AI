Referring to the above statements , PERSON instituted proceedings in ORG ( PERSON ) under Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) claiming compensation and publication of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The case was subsequently delegated to ORG , which held a hearing at which evidence was heard from PERSON , the T association \u2019s managerial director , its chairman and his deputy at the time of the events , the commercial director of ORG at the time of the events , the CARDINAL auditors in question and the journalist who had written the articles at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a single judge , dismissed PERSON claim . It found that the impugned statements consisted partly of value judgments with a sufficient factual basis and partly of true statements of fact . It noted that the auditors Mr PERSON and PERSON ORG had established in a report of DATE serious shortcomings in the book - keeping and accounting system of ORG . They found that there had been no composite book - keeping for DATE and that this system did not correspond to the principles of proper bookkeeping under the Book - keeping Act ( Rechnungslegungsgesetz ) . The management board of the T association had taken note of this report with thanks and consternation . Despite that report the financial status of the company had been unclear at the time because of missing data . The management board had subsequently decided to appoint a commercial director in addition to Mr Bruck in order to guarantee a solid accounting system and management of public finances .", "CARDINAL . A further report , by an external firm of business auditors commissioned by PERSON , although more favourable , had also established shortcomings in the book - keeping and accounting system and had made recommendations for improvements . For instance , contrary to the company agreement , investments over a certain amount had been made without the authorisation of the company owners . Furthermore , a bank account for a certain project had been registered in PERSON name . Therefore , the ORG statement that PERSON was lax about the finances of ORG was true .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further noted that PERSON former contract had expired at DATE and , although the main features of a new contract had been discussed , there had been no agreement on its fundamental aspects . Therefore , at the time of the audit in DATE Mr PERSON did not actually have a valid employment contract and the payouts , although not considered as arbitrary and tolerated , had taken place without any legal basis . PERSON had not contested the amount of the sums mentioned in relation to his salary and expenses for business trips . The notions \u201c wanderlust \u201d and \u201c business excursions \u201d and \u201c financial avarice \u201d , \u201c expense account profiteer \u201d , \u201c rip - off merchant \u201d and \u201c so - called media expert \u201d and the statement that the finances in the company were \u201c adventurous \u201d were permissible value judgments . The fact that PERSON had wrongly calculated royalties had been proven by the audit report of Mr PERSON and PERSON . The statement that PERSON had used financial tricks was therefore also true . PERSON had in fact once exceeded the credit line of the company and had acknowledged that Mr PERSON had not been paid his fee . His argument that Mr PERSON had not been commissioned by ORG was questionable and , in any event , did not exclude the possibility that another motive for the refusal to pay Mr PERSON had been revenge , which , moreover , appeared obvious in view of the consequences of his report . Mr PERSON had actually requested the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against ORG . It was true that Mr PERSON \u2019s idea of providing every household in GPE with free internet access would have allowed children to access pornographic sites . PERSON had employed his daughter in his company at a slightly higher salary per hour than other employees .", "CARDINAL . The court noted , lastly , that the applicant company could rely on LAW , particularly as there was substantial public interest in the subject matter because public funds were at stake .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by PERSON , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , having held a hearing and sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , quashed that judgment on DATE . It found that ORG had left essential evidence unconsidered and had given pseudo - reasons for its findings . In addition to the facts established by ORG and referring to the statements of the witnesses made before that court , ORG set out the following background to the case :", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was a former honorary professor at ORG and academic director of a technical college . In his function as managerial director of ORG he had had responsibility , in particular , for acquiring research and development subsidies from national , NORP and international bodies in which task he was highly successful . The travel expenses for the corresponding business trips had never been challenged and appeared reasonable in the light of their development over DATE and in relation to the travel expenses of the company \u2019s other employees .", "CARDINAL . After PERSON former contract had expired at DATE , he was able to base his salary claim on an oral agreement of DATE which was recorded in a note for the file and provided for a base amount of CARDINAL NORP Shillings ( ORG ) and a premium depending on any surplus produced by the company , this to be paid as DATE instalments of ORG CARDINAL . The taking of a decision on Mr PERSON \u2019s contract was repeatedly adjourned because no agreement on the concrete calculation of the company \u2019s surplus could be reached .", "CARDINAL . While it was true that Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON \u2019s report of DATE established shortcomings in the accounting system , criticised the fact that PERSON salary was paid without any underlying contract or decision and that royalties for DATE had been wrongly calculated , that report appeared partial and subjective : PERSON had previously praised the accountancy and organisation of ORG . Furthermore , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had been present when the basic agreement on Mr PERSON \u2019s further contract had been reached on DATE . Lastly , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had simply noted the lack of vouchers book - keeping in DATE without questioning the reason for it , namely a computer crash as established by the subsequent audit by an external accounting firm . The report by that firm , commissioned by PERSON , found that the accounting system and management of public finances corresponded to the average standard of a private institution and remarked critically that the company had not adapted its organisation structure to the rise of its business turnover fast enough . It did not confirm the serious shortcomings outlined in PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON \u2019s previous report .", "CARDINAL . The commercial director was in fact appointed to relieve PERSON PERSON who was busy handling other accountancy matters . It was true that in DATE Mr Bruck had exceeded the company \u2019s credit line ; however , he handed in the corresponding authorisation DATE and was absolved by the management board as he had demonstrated that the overdraft had been necessary . When drawing up a proposal for a \u201c ORG web \u201d in DATE , PERSON had wished to create a local educational internet and not provide children with access to pornographic internet pages . Furthermore , there was a possibility of locking certain pages of the internet .", "CARDINAL . Mr Bruck had properly refused to pay Mr PERSON \u2019s fees because it was the T association and not ORG which had commissioned him . Mr ORG \u2019s subsequent request that bankruptcy proceedings be instituted against the company had been unsuccessful because he had not submitted any proof of the company \u2019s insolvency . PERSON had employed several trainees during the holidays , including his daughter , who had been paid DATE , while other trainees had been paid ORG TIME and TIME . There was no indication of preferential treatment as the amount paid to Mr PERSON \u2019s daughter corresponded to her skills and the activities she had carried out .", "CARDINAL . The court found that in its overall context the series of articles wrongly accused PERSON of fraudulent conversion , unjustified enrichment and commercial ineptitude . The applicant company \u2019s reporting did not comply with the standards of journalistic diligence as it had not carried out any fair and objective research and had not questioned PERSON . As the majority of the reported events dated back DATE the journalist concerned had been under no time pressure to research the true facts behind the case . Having regard to the gravity of the criticism levelled at Mr Bruck , who had meanwhile been dismissed in order to get the company and himself out of the applicant company \u2019s firing line , the court ordered the applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL in compensation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company subsequently filed a request for rectification of the transcript of the hearing before ORG . It submitted that the transcript wrongly reported that the full file ( including the transcripts of the examination of the evidence conducted before ORG ) had been read out . On DATE ORG granted this request and rectified the transcript to the effect that the full file had not been read out as , according to the statement of all members of the ORG \u2019s bench , the parties had waived their right to have the full file read out .", "CARDINAL .
