NORP The police arrived at the scene , examined the tree and took some black - and - white photographs . The police report stated that the tree was partly rotten and the roots had torn .

On DATE ORG ) discontinued the investigation into the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s death , finding that it had been an unfortunate accident and that no offence had been committed . He established that the tree had fallen in strong winds . The cause of death was a fractured skull .

She said that the tree had looked healthy and there had been no indication that its removal was required .

The applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she obtained an opinion from ORG ( ORG ) on weather conditions in PERSON on DATE . According to the opinion , the wind had been weak or moderate DATE and there had been no violent atmospheric conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and returned the case to the prosecutor to continue the investigation . It considered that the prosecuting authorities had failed to establish what had caused the tree to fall or to examine whether the visual inspection allegedly carried out by ORG prior to the accident could be considered appropriate . It also pointed to the discrepancy between the police report , which had stated that the tree was partly rotten , and the prosecutor \u2019s finding that it was healthy . The court instructed the prosecutor to question the police officers who had attended the scene and the persons who had been injured in the accident .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation finding that no offence had been committed . From his questioning of the police officers , he established that the tree had looked healthy but that after the accident it had become apparent that it had been partly rotten and had a weak root system . The prosecutor also considered that although ORG had not recorded any violent wind there could have been local gusts . He concluded that the fall of the tree and the death of the applicant \u2019s husband had not been caused by any negligence on the part of those responsible for maintaining the trees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG allowed the appeal and remitted the case to ORG . The appellate prosecutor stressed the need to order expert opinions to establish the condition of the tree .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert , ORG , submitted to ORG his opinion on the condition of the fallen sycamore tree ( klon jawor ) . On the basis of the testimonies of the police officers the expert established that the fallen tree was rotten inside and had been totally deprived of its roots . The photographs taken after the accident also showed that the tree \u2019s root system had already been badly damaged beforehand . On the picture the trunk could be seen to have been completely deprived of its roots , which would not have been the case if the only thing which had caused it to fall had been strong winds . Nevertheless , the expert concluded that it was possible that such damage to the tree had not been visible from the outside , and that persons responsible for tree maintenance could not normally conduct a comprehensive examination of the roots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , mainly on the basis of the expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the appeal and remitted the case to ORG .

She also requested the court to begin the trial and hold a hearing . The applicant indicated her wish to act as an auxiliary prosecutor ( oskar\u017cyciel posi\u0142kowy ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court held the first hearing . However , the court failed to examine the admissibility of the applicant \u2019s civil claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid as she could not afford to pay for a lawyer of her choice , was in poor health and \u2013 given the substantial distance of QUANTITY between her home in GPE and the place of trial DATE it would be difficult for her to commute to hearings . It is not clear whether her application was ever examined .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , until CARDINAL DATE the court held hearings at regular intervals , heard evidence from witnesses and ordered an expert opinion . All hearings scheduled thereafter were cancelled owing to the illness of either the accused or the judge rapporteur .", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing , held on DATE , the composition of the court changed , so the trial had to start from the beginning .

The expert finally submitted the opinion on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had standing in the proceedings as an auxiliary prosecutor , lodged a complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) under LAW of DATE on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed her complaint , found that there had been a breach of her right to a trial within a reasonable time and awarded her ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation . It found that there had been several lengthy periods during which the trial court had been totally inactive , for example , no action had been taken for DATE after the bill of indictment was lodged with the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court held a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it gave a judgment in which it acquitted PERSON after finding that no offence had been committed . It found that she had conducted a proper inspection of the tree prior to the accident and had established that it was healthy . The experts had concluded that the tree looked healthy from the outside and that there had been no signs that the roots were badly damaged . The court considered that the event of DATE was an unfortunate accident which had no direct link with the actions of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment . She submitted that PERSON did not possess the relevant expertise and had been negligent in the manner in which she had inspected the trees or marked them out for removal . In particular , there was no evidence that the inspections had been carried out on the dates given by the accused . Moreover , the tree had been growing on an escarpment and the roots had apparently been removed during the installation of a gas pipeline directly underneath it . The applicant contended that these elements had not been examined by the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the appeal and remitted the case . It pointed to several inconsistencies in the district court \u2019s findings as to the relevant facts . In particular , it was not clear to what extent the tree had been leaning or whether the angle had been calculated with reference to the slope or the pavement .", "CARDINAL . The trial court held hearings on DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment in which it acquitted PERSON It established that she had not been under an obligation to inspect the trees or to prevent them from falling because that was not part of her duties .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the prosecutor lodged appeals against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case . It found that the trial court had failed to analyse the legal regulations in force at the material time . It pointed out that issues concerning trees in public places were the responsibility of the municipal authorities and that they could be held criminally liable for failure to carry out their duties properly . Thus , the Mayor of PERSON was obliged by law to order the removal of trees that were unsafe . Moreover , it appeared from the documents in the file that a gas pipeline had been laid under the tree , making it necessary to remove some of the roots , and that that issue had not been clarified . Lastly , the court noted that the trial court had failed to deal with the complaint , raised by the applicant in her appeal , that her claim for compensation had never been examined .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant received from the office of the Mayor of PERSON a reply to her letter requesting compensation for her husband \u2019s death . The Mayor refused to acknowledge the liability of the municipality and stated that the criminal court had not held the municipality responsible for her husband \u2019s death . The applicant was further informed that if she lodged a civil claim for compensation it would most probably be stayed until the termination of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The trial court held hearings on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it gave a judgment in which it again acquitted PERSON The court established that the root system of the tree in question had been seriously damaged . However the disease had not been visible on the external parts of the tree \u2013 in particular on its crown . Thus persons checking the state of the tree could not have established that the tree had become a danger to the public and ordered its removal . Furthermore , the court established that there had been no grounds to believe that since the tree had grown on a slope it had been necessary to take any preventive measures by , for example , installing special supports .", "The court considered that there had been many shortcomings in the preparatory proceedings . Consequently , many issues relating to the exact location of the tree , its condition , and whether it had been leaning , had not been elucidated . For example , it was not possible to establish if the roots of the fallen tree could have been damaged during the installation of the gas pipeline because it had not been clear where exactly the tree had been growing . Moreover , the tree , or its part , had not been secured for further examination but had been destroyed immediately after the accident . The photographic evidence was of poor quality , black - and - white , and blurred so the reason for the fall of the tree , and where it actually grew , could not be unambiguously clarified . According to the court , the expert opinions prepared on the basis of such poor evidentiary material could not make it possible to conclude that there had been grounds for removal of the tree or use of supports .", "As regards the liability of PERSON the court agreed with the previous findings and concluded that the accused had not been obliged to carry out controls of trees and to order their removal . Although her duties included \u201c issuing of decisions to remove shrubs and trees \u201d , such decisions had in fact been given by the Mayor and she had only been preparing files for his examination . The court acknowledged that PERSON admitted to having carried out some controls of the trees together with a specialist . However , it considered that she had been doing so either directly in accordance with instructions of the Mayor or following complaints made by the public .", "The court considered that the absence of clear regulations regarding who was responsible for the care of green areas and for carrying out checks of trees amounted to clear organisational negligence on the part of the municipality , for which the accused should not be held liable .", "Finally , the court found that the applicant \u2019s request for compensation had been pointless in the light of the acquittal of PERSON because the obligation to compensate damage could arise only in the event of a conviction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the prosecutor each lodged appeals against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . OnCARDINAL DATE the ORG upheld the judgment . It agreed with the first - instance court in that , according to her contract of employment , the accused had not been required to undertake any actions aimed at protecting trees from falling . According to the law , the legal responsibility for care of the greenery lay with the municipality which should have secured the means and organised a system to fulfil its obligations . A failure of the municipality to take necessary measures to eliminate a danger to the public could result in criminal liability . The court however underlined that it had not been proved that the carrying out of these duties had been vested in the accused . Thus , she could not be held criminally liable for having failed to do so .", "The court also established that taking into account the state of the trees discovered during an inspection on DATE , and the lengthy process of development of pathologies in trees , GPE had not been correctly carrying out the above - mentioned duty of care in respect of its green areas . Nevertheless , the responsibility for that failure could not be attributed to the accused .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was final and binding ( prawomocny ) . However , the parties could lodge a cassation appeal with ORG . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal . The applicant submits that a lawyer of her choice refused to lodge a cassation appeal on her behalf because it had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL .
