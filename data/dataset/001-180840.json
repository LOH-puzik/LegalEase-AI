The Government have submitted to ORG a written statement from PERSON , which reads as follows :", "\u201c Following the customs control measure of an interview and given [ D. \u2019s and the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour and the nature of their professional activities , a supposition / assumption ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) arose that they might have banned printed and/or audio- and video - material with extremist content in their bags ... Since [ the applicant ] noted in his declaration that he had electronic storage devices , I made a written report to the acting chief officer of the customs checkpoint concerning the need for carrying out an inspection of [ the applicant \u2019s ] bags in the framework of the risk management system and for involving Officer PERSON , an IT specialist . The inspection was approved by the chief officer by way of his handwritten approval on my report ... The chief officer issued an order for an inspection and authorised PERSON and myself to use the sampling procedure ... The above - mentioned supposition / assumption was based on the presence of a folder labelled \u201c Extremist \u201d in the laptop ... Data from it was copied on DATE [ on the spot ] ... to DVD RW disks , which were then sealed in a plastic bag ... [ The applicant ] , PERSON and CARDINAL attesting witnesses were present ...

The copying was carried out by Officer PERSON I did not open or copy any electronic folders or files ... I did not read any \u2018 correspondence\u2019 ( personal correspondence or other text material ) ... An order to carry out a forensic examination was issued on DATE ... because on CARDINAL DATE we had no information about the relevant expert organisations for that type of forensic examination ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Since the laptop \u2019s hard drive was CARDINAL ORG and at the time we had no means for fast copying , I decided only to copy folders with strange names .

According to the Government , after finding in the directory of the laptop an electronic folder entitled \u201c Extremism ( for ORG ) \u201d , which contained a number of photographs , the customs officer decided to copy it and some other folders from the laptop for further examination by an expert , who could determine whether they contained any information of an extremist nature .", "CARDINAL . The folder contained CARDINAL subfolders and CARDINAL files . The applicant made a note in the record , stating that the material had been copied onto rewritable DVD disks ( thus technically allowing the data to be modified , including by way of adding data ) . According to the applicant , the folder had some photographs and a PDF copy of an article entitled \u201c How to incite hatred ? \u201d on anti - extremism legislation . The article , written by PERSON , was published in the NORP Reporter magazine in DATE and was accompanied by photographs taken by the applicant . The author of the article discussed the controversies and difficulties relating to the interpretation and application of NORP anti - extremism legislation , with reference to CARDINAL criminal cases under LAW . According to the applicant , the material that was copied included documents and text concerning CARDINAL ethnic groups ( the PERSON and ORG ) , who were allegedly under pressure from the PERSON regional administration .

The applicant submitted the following written statement by PERSON to the ORG :", "\u201c At TIME we presented ourselves at the border control and presented our passports ... We were then taken to the customs control area ... There the customs officers asked [ the applicant ] to hand over his press card ; so they were aware that he had one ... Officer PERSON interviewed us about the purpose of our visit to GPE and our professional and civic activities ... I heard an ORG border officer tell the customs officers about the need for a \u2018 special check\u2019 of our electronic storage devices ... Seeing a laptop in [ the applicant \u2019s ] bag , the customs officers expressed their intention to copy all the available information ...

In DATE the expert organisation returned the DVDs to the customs office , stating that it was not possible to carry out the examination , although it gave no reasons . In DATE a report was sought from another expert organisation . Apparently , it concluded that the data contained no extremist material .

In the meantime , the applicant brought judicial review proceedings under LAW of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , challenging the adverse acts and actions of the customs officials .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his claims . The court held as follows :", "\u201c Laptops , storage devices , photo- and video - cameras should be considered as \u2018 ORG within the meaning of LAW . All goods should be presented for checking by customs , as required under LAW ... The customs authorities are authorised to take samples of goods for examination ... and to use technical devices to speed up the checks ... The data from the applicant \u2019s laptop was copied for the purposes of examination in compliance with Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL on combating fascism and political extremism ... In the circumstances , the fact that the samples taken for examination constituted all the relevant data was justified ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the first - instance court \u2019s assessment had not taken into account the requirements relating to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , in particular , the requirement that any interference by a public authority had to be shown to be \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued . He mentioned the ORG \u2019s case - law relating to the seizure of printed material and electronic devices , an action which adversely affects the maintenance of professional secrecy . The applicant also argued as follows :", "( a ) Compliance with Decree no . CARDINAL was not possible without actually reading someone \u2019s correspondence and other personal information , thereby interfering with the constitutional right to the protection of the secrecy of correspondence and other communications . LAW only permitted restrictions on people \u2019s rights on the basis of a federal statute ; the decree in question was secondary legislation ( \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0442 ) and could not lawfully introduce additional limitations on constitutional rights ;", "( b ) The trial court had mentioned that laptops , flash memory cards and the like were \u201c goods \u201d for the purposes of customs legislation . However , the sampling had been carried out in respect of the information they contained rather than the carriers or containers of the information ( \u201c the goods \u201d ) . Access to that information , however , was only allowed on the basis of a court order , as stated in LAW ;", "( c ) In his \u201c written explanations \u201d to the appeal court , the applicant insisted that in LAW proceedings a public authority had the burden of proving that its acts were lawful and justified . However , the first - instance court had not required the customs authority to cite a specific legal provision authorising its officials to examine electronic data . According to the applicant , the customs authority representative had refused at the hearing to explain the specific content of the risk profile concerning the applicant , referring to the fact that the information in question was classified and was for internal use only . However , a DATE Instruction by ORG only authorised a customs inspection where the risk profile in question provided for that type of measure ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment , essentially reproducing the lower court \u2019s reasoning as follows :", "\u201c Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Customs Code , customs authorities fulfill the tasks and functions assigned to them by federal and other legislation ... and have the authority to apply measures prescribed by LAW for ensuring compliance with customs legislation ...", "LAW defines goods ( for the purposes of customs legislation ) as movable property which is being transferred across the customs border .

Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that customs checks are based on the principle of selectiveness and , as a rule , should be limited to such forms of control as are sufficient for ensuring compliance with customs legislation ... When selecting the form of control , the risk management approach is applied , which is based on the effective use of resources for preventing violations of the legislation ... Risk is defined as a probability of non - compliance with customs legislation .", "When carrying out a customs check , the customs authority is allowed to take samples of goods which are needed for further assessment .

CARDINAL of DATE by ORG ( \u2018 On preventing the transfer of prohibited printed , audio- and video - material across the customs border\u2019 ) does not contradict the current customs legislation and has not been revoked because the current ORG Code contains LAW concerning bans and limitations on the transfer of goods across the customs border ...", "In view of the above , the court agrees with the first - instance court that the customs inspection was authorised and carried out within customs control procedures and that the data was copied in line with NORP Presidential Decree no .
