NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms L.

The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a hotel , NORP , in PERSON , a municipality in the coastal part of GPE , which he bought with a view to first reconstructing it and later on using it commercially . The hotel was built in DATE , according to a building permit issued in DATE , and was registered in ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the regulations concerning zoning permits in PERSON were ORG ( ORG o dono\u0161enju Prostornog plana op\u0107ine ORG , ORG of GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , QUANTITY , DATE and DATE ) , a larger central municipality from which the PERSON LOC municipality was formed , and ORG in LOC ( ORG o odredbama za provo\u0111enje u izgra\u0111enim naseljima na podru\u010dju PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) adopted by the Ba\u0161ka GPE in DATE and published in ORG of the Ba\u0161ka Voda Municipality no . CARDINAL on DATE . According to these regulations and the relevant domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , a zoning permit ( lokacijska dozvola ) was required before any construction could be commenced on the buildings in the area concerned .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above zoning documents , on DATE and DATE the owners of the properties adjacent to the applicant \u2019s hotel obtained zoning permits from ORG , Construction and Ecology ( hereinafter : the \u201c ORG \u201d ) for renovation and reconstruction of their buildings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a zoning permit as required by the relevant legislation before reconstruction works could be commenced . The applicant submitted all relevant documents concerning his ownership of the hotel and the reconstruction project . In his project the applicant indicated that the hotel consisted of a ground - floor , CARDINAL upper floors and in CARDINAL part an additional fourth floor whereas he wanted to build a basement and a loft and to extend further the fourth floor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the applicant \u2019s request was still pending , ORG ( ORG za\u0161tite okoli\u0161a i prostornog ure\u0111enja , hereinafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) ordered the Ba\u0161ka GPE to set aside ( staviti izvan snage ) ORG , after finding that they had been adopted contrary to the relevant law . ORG found that ORG merely reflected provisions of a similar document of LOC which had been already found by ORG to be contrary to the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ba\u0161ka Voda Municipality adopted a Decision setting aside ORG and published it in ORG of the Ba\u0161ka Voda Municipality no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a zoning permit . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of GPE ( Official Gazette nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the zoning permit is an administrative decision which must be issued on the basis of zoning documents , special law and other relevant acts , in accordance with the law .", "Given that at the moment the Ba\u0161ka GPE does not have the relevant zoning documents , it follows , and in view of what was said above , that zoning permits for renovation or reconstruction of buildings can not be issued until the adoption of the municipal spatial plan or some related spatial plan . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , pointing out that he had lodged his request for a zoning permit on DATE and that his request had been accompanied by all relevant documents , which followed from the fact that ORG had not dismissed his request as unsubstantiated or ill - founded . Instead , his request had been dismissed only because LOC had not adopted a spatial plan , despite the fact that he had lodged his request when the relevant zoning documents existed . He therefore considered that the law and the zoning documents which existed and were relevant at the time when he had lodged his request , should be applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry quashed the first - instance decision and remitted the case . It instructed ORG to determine whether a zoning permit could be granted on the basis of the zoning documents adopted for the wider area .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It found that the zoning document for the larger area , that is , ORG ( ORG plan PERSON \u017eupanije , adopted on DATE , published in ORG of ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , prescribed adoption of the spatial plan of the Ba\u0161ka GPE , and itself contained no provisions on the basis of which a zoning permit could be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal before ORG , arguing that ORG had failed to comply with the instruction of ORG DATE . He considered that it should be established whether a zoning permit could be issued on the basis of a spatial plan which covered an even wider area than that of the county - wide spatial plan . He pointed out that he should not bear burden for the failure of ORG to adopt a spatial plan . He also considered that a zoning permit should be issued on the basis of the zoning documents which had existed at the moment when he had lodged his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision . It endorsed the finding of ORG , that at present there was no zoning document on the basis of which a zoning permit for property located in PERSON could be granted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then brought an action in ORG ( ORG ) on DATE contesting the decisions of the administrative authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It held that the Splitsko - Dalmatinska County Spatial Plan provided for an obligation to prepare and adopt a spatial plan for the Ba\u0161ka GPE , but that such plan had not yet been adopted , and that therefore the applicant \u2019s request for a zoning permit could not be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) . He pointed out that he had submitted his request for a zoning permit at the time when the zoning documents had existed for the PERSON GPE . However , it had taken the administrative authorities DATE to decide on his request , and in the meantime the zoning documents had been set aside and a spatial plan had not yet been adopted . Therefore , given that there had been a legal gap , the administrative authorities had been obliged to apply the law and the zoning documents which had existed at the time when he had lodged his request . He contended that this had done significant damage to his legitimate interests and that there had been no legitimate public interest justifying the refusal to grant him a zoning permit , since such permits had been issued for a number of properties adjacent to his hotel .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the Ba\u0161ka Voda Municipality had proceeded with the adoption of a spatial plan . It first initiated a public debate in which various experts , public officials and interested citizens were able to put forward all their arguments , proposals and objections . The municipal executive authorities then accepted or rejected the proposals and objections and drafted a provisional spatial plan . The provisional draft was afterwards submitted for approval to the Ministry , the competent ORG authorities , ORG ( PERSON uprava za za\u0161titu prirode ) , ORG ( ORG kulture ) , ORG ( ORG obrane ) , the public water utilities authorities , ORG ( GPE poljoprivrede , ribarstva i ruralnog razvoja ) , ORG ( ORG regionalnog razvoja ) and the competent seaport authority . Only after all the approvals were obtained the final draft spatial plan was submitted to ORG which adopted it on DATE ( ORG of the PERSON GPE no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the adoption of the spatial plan the applicant did not submit a new request for a zoning permit .", "CARDINAL .
