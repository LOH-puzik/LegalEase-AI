ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the first applicant , was a political party that was dissolved by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , the second and third applicants , were respectively Chairman and General Secretary of the ORG . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was formed on DATE . On DATE , its constitution and programme were submitted to the office of ORG at ORG for assessment of their compatibility with LAW and Law no . PERSON on the regulation of political parties ( \u201c PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the ORG was preparing to participate in a general election , ORG at ORG ( \u201c ORG Counsel \u201d ) applied to ORG for an order dissolving the ORG . He accused the party of having sought to establish the domination of CARDINAL social class over the others ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE and former LAW and section CARDINAL of PERSON no . PERSON ) , of having incorporated the word \u201c communist \u201d into its name ( contrary to section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON ) , of having carried on activities likely to undermine the territorial integrity of the ORG and the unity of the nation ( ORG , CARDINAL and DATE and former LAW , and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ) and of having declared itself to be the successor to a previously dissolved political party , ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON ) .", "In support of his application ORG relied in particular on passages from the ORG \u2019s programme , mainly taken from a chapter entitled \u201c Towards a peaceful , democratic and fair solution for the NORP problem \u201d ; that chapter read as follows :", "\u201c The existence of the NORP and their legitimate rights have been denied ever since the Republic was founded , although the national war of independence was waged with their support . The authorities have responded to the awakening of NORP national consciousness with bans , oppression and terror . Racist , militarist and chauvinistic policies have exacerbated the NORP problem . That fact both constitutes an obstacle to the democratisation of GPE and serves the interests of the international imperialist and militaristic forces seeking to heighten tension in LOC , set peoples against each other and propel GPE into military adventures .", "The NORP problem is a political one arising from the denial of the NORP people \u2019s existence , national identity and rights . It therefore can not be resolved by oppression , terror and military means . Recourse to violence means that the right to self - determination , which is a natural and inalienable right of all peoples , is not exercised jointly , but separately and unilaterally . The remedy for this problem is political . If the oppression of the NORP people and discrimination against them are to end , NORP and NORP must unite .", "The ORG will strive for a peaceful , democratic and fair solution of the NORP problem , so that the NORP and NORP peoples may live together of their free will within the borders of GPE , on the basis of equal rights and with a view to democratic restructuring founded on their common interests .", "The solution of the NORP problem must be based on the free will of the NORP and take into account the common interests of the NORP and NORP nations and contribute to the democratisation of GPE and peace in LOC .", "A solution to the NORP problem will only be found if the parties concerned are able to express their opinions freely , if they agree not to resort to violence in any form in order to resolve the problem and if they are able to take part in politics with their own national identity .", "The solution of the NORP problem will require time . In the immediate future , priority must be given to ending military and political pressure on the NORP , protecting the lives of NORP citizens , bringing the state of emergency to an end , abandoning the \u2018 village PERSON system and lifting bans on the NORP language and NORP culture . The problem should be freely discussed . The existence of the NORP must be acknowledged in the LAW .", "Without a solution of the NORP problem , democratic renewal can not take place in GPE . Any solution will entail a fight for the democratisation of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL other passages relied on by ORG read as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG of GPE is the party of the working class , formed from the merger of ORG and ORG .", "...", "The cultural revival will be fashioned by , on the one hand , the reciprocal influence of contemporary universal culture and , on the other , NORP and NORP national values , the heritage of the NORP civilisations , the humanist elements of NORP culture and all the values developed by our people in their effort to evolve with their times . \u201d", "ORG referred to above had been dissolved on CARDINAL DATE on grounds similar to those relied on against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an order dissolving the ORG , which entailed ipso jure the liquidation of the party and the transfer of its assets to the ORG , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL . The order was published in ORG on CARDINAL DATE . As a consequence , the founders and managers of the party were banned from holding similar office in any other political body ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . PERSON \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "ORG firstly rejected the submission that the ORG maintained that CARDINAL social class , the proletariat , was superior to the others . Referring to the party \u2019s constitution , modern works on NORP ideology and contemporary political ideas , it held that the ORG satisfied the requirements of democracy , which was based on political pluralism , universal suffrage and freedom to take part in politics .", "The court also rejected the argument , based on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Law no . MONEY , that no political party may claim to be the successor to a party that has previously been dissolved . In its view , it was entirely natural and consistent with the concept of democracy for a political party to claim the cultural heritage of past movements and currents of political thought . The ORG had accordingly not infringed the provision relied on by reason only of its intention of drawing on the experience and achievements of NORP institutions .", "ORG went on to hold that the mere fact that a political party included in its name a word prohibited by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . MONEY , as the ORG had done in the present case , sufficed to trigger the application of that provision and consequently to entail the dissolution of the party concerned .", "As to the allegation that the ORG \u2019s constitution and programme contained statements likely to undermine the territorial integrity of the ORG and the unity of the nation , ORG noted , inter alia , that those documents referred to CARDINAL nations : the NORP nation and the NORP nation . But it could not be accepted that there were QUANTITY nations within GPE , whose citizens , whatever their ethnic origin , had NORP nationality . In reality the proposals in the party constitution covering support for non - NORP languages and cultures were intended to create minorities , to the detriment of the unity of the NORP nation .", "Reiterating that self - determination and regional autonomy were prohibited by LAW , ORG said that the ORG was unitary , the country indivisible and that there was CARDINAL nation . It considered that national unity was achieved through the integration of communities and individuals who , irrespective of their ethnic origin and on an equal footing , formed the nation and founded the ORG . In GPE there were no \u201c minorities \u201d or \u201c national minorities \u201d , other than those referred to in LAW and the friendship treaty between GPE and GPE , and there were no constitutional or legislative provisions allowing distinctions to be made between citizens . Like all nationals of foreign descent , nationals of NORP origin could express their identity , but the LAW and the law precluded them from forming a nation or a minority distinct from the NORP nation . Consequently , objectives which , like those of the ORG , encouraged separatism and the division of the NORP nation were unacceptable and justified dissolving the party concerned .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the relevant provisions of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c GPE is a democratic , secular and social ORG based on the rule of law , respectful of human rights in a spirit of social peace , national solidarity and justice , adhering to the nationalism of PERSON and resting on the fundamental principles set out in the Preamble . \u201d", "\u201c The State of GPE constitutes with its territory and nation , an indivisible whole .
