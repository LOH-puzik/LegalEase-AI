She is complaining on behalf of her daughter , PERSON , and her grand - daughter , Ms PERSON . They were born in DATE , respectively , and live in GPE . PERSON PERSON and PERSON and PERSON are hereafter referred to as \u201c the applicants \u201d . They are represented before ORG by Ms PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "PERSON arrived in GPE on DATE , under a temporary residence permit granted for the period from DATE until DATE . The residence permit was issued for the purpose of university studies . She immediately , on DATE , applied for a permanent residence permit for business activities and studies .", "PERSON daughter , PERSON , was born on DATE in GPE .", "ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) issued a temporary residence permit for the period from DATE until DATE for the purpose of studies .", "PERSON was no longer registered with the university for the term of DATE . The applications of GPE and PERSON to be granted a residence permit were refused by ORG on DATE . It noted that ORG , who had been granted a residence permit in GPE for DATE on the basis of her studies in GPE , had returned to GPE after having attended only a few courses at ORG . PERSON argued that she had been unable to study because of her pregnancy . The ORG considered that PERSON , who had however not been hindered by her pregnancy from founding a business together with CARDINAL of her brothers , did not have such family ties in GPE that she would be entitled to stay there . Taking into account that ORG husband lived in GPE and that PERSON could continue her business from there ( the business idea was to import goods from GPE to GPE ) , her request was refused . Accordingly , PERSON was not granted a residence permit either . PERSON and PERSON travelled to GPE in DATE .", "On DATE PERSON \u2019s parents arrived in GPE as visitors with a DATE tourist visa . They were later granted a residence permit on a humanitarian basis as CARDINAL of their sons had already stayed in GPE for over DATE and had been granted NORP citizenship .

Their appeal was refused by ORG on DATE . The court noted that PERSON had originally arrived in GPE because of her studies but that the reason for her visit had changed into business and family ties during her stay . Taking into account that PERSON was DATE , ORG did not find that the interests of the child rendered the refusal of the residence permit unreasonable .", "ORG and PERSON applied for leave to appeal from ORG on the basis of new circumstances as PERSON \u2019s mother , PERSON , had fallen seriously ill in GPE , suffering from kidney failure , requiring dialysis CARDINAL times a week . On DATE ORG refused PERSON and PERSON leave to appeal .", "PERSON gave birth to her second daughter in GPE in DATE .", "In DATE PERSON and her family applied for visas to enter GPE . The requests were refused on DATE , with reference to LAW ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ) . The visa application indicated that visas were not sought for \u201c travel or other comparable short - term stay in the country \u201d but rather for long - term stay for which a residence permit should be applied for instead . On DATE the ORG advised ORG and her family to apply for residence permits , if their purpose was not to stay in the country for a short time only .", "On DATE PERSON submitted to the ORG applications for a residence permit for herself and her family . The family was interviewed at ORG on DATE and the difference between a residence permit application and a visa application was explained to them .", "On DATE PERSON informed the ORG that they wished to withdraw the residence permit applications and apply instead for a short - term visa . Subsequently , the fees they had paid ( amounting to LOC ) for the residence permit applications were returned by ORG .", "ORG and her family filed new visa applications on DATE . These applications were also refused and the decisions on refusal were mailed to the persons concerned on DATE . The reasons for the refusals were the same as in respect of the first visa applications . However , having received several petitions , the ORG reviewed the visa applications and sent PERSON a letter on DATE , offering her and her younger child a possibility to have a DATE tourist visa for GPE for the purpose of travelling to see their sick mother / grandmother . PERSON was not offered a visa . Since then PERSON has not been in contact with the ORG and nor has she replied to the letter or filed a visa application as suggested .", "On DATE PERSON \u2019s brother sent the Embassy an e - mail message , according to which his family was not able to accept that visas should be issued only to her sister and her younger child , since in their opinion the whole family should travel together .", "Since ORG and her family \u2019s earlier applications for visas had been refused by appropriate decisions , and she had herself withdrawn the residence permit applications , they have at present no residence permit or visa applications pending .", "According to LAW of LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a visa means a permit or a decision issued for tourist travel or comparable short - term visit on the basis of which an alien may enter GPE , provided that he fulfils the other entry conditions .", "Under LAW of LAW , a visa must be issued by a NORP diplomatic representation or consulate abroad .", "Section DATE ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW defines the family members to whom a residence permit may be issued . Such family members include the spouse of the alien residing in GPE as well as his or her children under DATE for whose custody he is responsible . Should the alien residing in GPE be under DATE , his custodian is considered a family member to whom a residence permit may be issued on the basis of family ties .", "Section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides for a possibility to issue a residence permit on the basis of family ties .", "According to LAW , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , residence permits on the basis of family ties shall be issued by ORG .", "According to LAW of LAW , an appeal may be lodged within DATE to ORG against ORG decision not to grant a residence permit .", "According to LAW , there is no appeal against decisions which are not mentioned in Sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE of LAW .
