Although some of its provisions were modified in DATE , the substance of the provisions relevant to the present case remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , compensation for expropriation has to correspond to the value of the property right concerned . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , the amount of compensation is fixed regard being had to the status and value of the property on DATE on which the expropriation decision was given . The value of the property is estimated on the basis of an opinion prepared by a certified expert .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides for the market value of the expropriated property to serve as a basis on which the amount of compensation is fixed . The following criteria are to be taken into consideration when establishing the market value of the property : its type , location , the use to which it has been put , the existence of any technical infrastructure on the property , its overall state and current prices of properties in the municipality .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( P CARDINAL ) ORG declared the section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE compatible with LAW as well as with LAW CARDINAL to the Convention . It discontinued the proceedings in respect of the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE .", "The court stressed that the legislator intended to regulate in a general manner the question of land ownership in a domain of particular public importance . Sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE concerned plots taken over during DATE for the purpose of road construction . The de facto taking of land and construction of roads created irreversible situations . The contested provisions pertained only to past situations and did not allow any further taking over of plots . The legislation under review served not only the public interest but also the interests of owners . It ended the state of uncertainty caused by the fact that they had not been able to exercise their ownership . The ex lege effect of the provisions was a rational solution which made it possible to bring the legal status of the plots into line with the realities .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) ORG declared section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE compatible with LAW . The court stressed that LAW DATE concerned plots whose legal status did not reflect their actual situation existing for long periods of time , lasting for DATE . ORG emphasised that the owners concerned had in the past a possibility of asserting their rights but had failed to do so within the applicable time - limits .", "CARDINAL . The legislation vesting ownership of properties in ORG or local municipalities by way of LAW was a CARDINAL - off and exceptional solution the effects of which were limited in time . It concerned only land taken over for the purposes of road construction . It required special measures to be applied , partially departing from those envisaged by LAW . The solution consisting in assessing ex officio the status of all the plots concerned and issuing ex officio individual decisions confirming expropriation ex lege in each and every case could have not been carried out within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the special provisions created by LAW imposed certain limitations on the compensation paid to the owners whose lands had been in the past de facto expropriated for road construction purposes . These limitations included their inability to request compensation DATE ; a limitation on the period within which such applications could be made until DATE ; a failure to specify exactly when compensation had to be paid to the person entitled ; and a failure to take into account changes to the value of the property between the date ownership was formally transferred by way of a decision confirming the ex lege expropriation and the date the compensation was decided . However , the context and character of the set of measures created by LAW justified these restrictions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a judgment ( CARDINAL ) in reply to legal question put to it by ORG . That court requested ORG to make an assessment of compatibility of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW in so far as this provision allowed for a compensation entitlement to be irrevocably extinguished regardless of whether an administrative decision confirming the acquisition ex lege , as from DATE , of land used for road construction purposes by the municipality ( or ORG ) had been given . ORG noted that proceedings concerning such decisions were governed by the generally applicable provisions of LAW . Former owners were parties to these proceedings . The decisions confirming that the municipality or ORG , as the case might be , had acquired ownership of properties taken de facto over by the ORG in the past were of a declaratory character . The fact that LAW did not provide for a time - limit for the authorities to give such decisions did not mean that it was impossible in law for former owners to claim compensation in absence of these decisions . These decisions were not a legal prerequisite for claiming compensation prior to the expiry of the substantive time - limit provided for by that LAW , namely DATE . If a request for compensation was submitted in the absence of a decision , the compensation proceedings should be stayed . The authority to which the compensation request was submitted was obliged to request the governor to give a decision confirming the expropriation ex lege as from DATE , after which the compensation proceedings had to be resumed . ORG referred to the practice of the administrative authorities , established by the courts ( ORG , I OSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; ORG , I SA / Wa CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE and I SA / Wa CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "The court observed that the request for compensation under LAW was in principle a second opportunity for owners to seek compensation as they could have claimed it in the past when their land had been taken for the road construction purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG challenged the constitutionality of the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , submitting that it breached the proportionality principle enshrined in the LAW by introducing an unclear and unconstitutional notion of \u201c equitable \u201d ( s\u0142uszne ) compensation , differing from that used for ordinary compensation purposes in the DATE LAW . It was also in breach of the constitutional protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions , as the compensation entitlement had irrevocably ceased to exist on DATE . It was further submitted that the period for submitting a compensation claim should not have been allowed to expire before the administration had given an expropriation decision . No provision was made in the DATE Act obliging the authorities to issue the expropriation decisions prior to DATE , which rendered that regulation manifestly unfair ( \u201c regulacja pozorna \u201d ) and deprived owners of a reasonable protection of their rights .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG dismissed the ORG \u2019s challenge . It essentially rephrased its own reasoning adopted in DATE and reiterated that the former owners had had ample time to take appropriate steps to obtain compensation ; initially DATE of vacatio legis after LAW had entered into force and , subsequently , DATE within which to seek compensation . It had been possible for them to secure their rights by demonstrating adequate diligence .", "CARDINAL . In a number of decisions the courts held that the decisions given under LAW confirming acquisition ex lege of the land by the municipalities ( or by ORG ) on DATE were of a declaratory character . The courts also held that the fact that such a decision had not been issued did not prevent the persons concerned from claiming compensation under the provisions of that LAW ( see e.g. ORG , I SA / WA CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; the ORG , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE and ORG , resolution III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
