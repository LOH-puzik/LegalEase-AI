They also admitted that there had been shortcomings in the transfer of the flat to him and expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the internal records concerning his re - admission .", "DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings . The hearing called for DATE was adjourned due to the absence of the applicant , her lawyer and a witness . It was also noted that , DATE previously , the applicant had challenged the ORG judge dealing with the case for bias . The applicant completed the challenge by submitting new information and documents on DATE and DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the challenge as unsubstantiated .", "A hearing held before FAC on DATE was adjourned until DATE and again until DATE .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing following which , on DATE , it dismissed the action . It concluded that the applicant did not have a \u201c pressing legal interest \u201d in obtaining the ruling sought , which was a conditio sine qua non under LAW ) of LAW for the ruling to be made . Her legal status as regards the flat was defined by the judgment of DATE under which she had an absolute right to stay in the flat until alternative accommodation had been provided to her . The contract of DATE did not concern her directly and its validity had no effect on her own legal position . The applicant appealed against this judgment .", "On DATE , following a hearing of the appeal on DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of DATE , concurring fully with ORG findings and conclusions . The judgment became final and binding on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant requested that the Prosecutor General exercise his discretionary power and lodge an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie ) on her behalf against the judgments of DATE and DATE . She argued that those judgments were legally wrong and violated her right to respect for her private life and home .", "On DATE the Prosecutor General acceded to the applicant \u2019s request and lodged the appeal . He maintained that the applicant did have a \u201c pressing legal interest \u201d in having the action determined as she had been living in the flat for DATE , she was a member of the cooperative and had sought to obtain the flat under LAW , and that PERSON had been taking various illegal and unacceptable measures to have her evicted from it . In contrast , PERSON had vacated the flat DATE , his rights under the judgment of DATE were statuebarred , he had been excluded from the cooperative , his readmission to it was flawed and he was not eligible to have the flat transferred to him under LAW . ORG maintained that the contract of sale of DATE was illegal and should be declared void .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the extraordinary appeal . The applicant had the right to stay in the flat until she had been provided with an alternative dwelling under the DATE judgment . If she was being disturbed in exercising this right , she could seek judicial protection against the trespasser . Her right to stay could not be interpreted as entailing her standing to sue . The transfer of ownership of the flat from the cooperative to PERSON had no effect on her legal position . The applicant must have known that PERSON had a recognised legal title to the flat and thus could not claim to have acted bona fide in obtaining the title herself . The applicant therefore lacked a \u201c pressing legal interest \u201d in the action and , consequently , could not challenge the contract of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , who was represented by a lawyer , lodged a complaint under LAW which she completed on DATE . She maintained that the length of the proceedings in her action of DATE , as conducted before ORG and ORG , had been excessive and that their respective decisions of DATE and DATE had been arbitrary and legally wrong and had violated her right to respect for her private life and home .", "On DATE ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) declared the complaint inadmissible . As to the length of the proceedings in their phase before ORG , they had ended by the judgment of DATE . Their examination thus could not bring about their acceleration . In line with ORG established practice , such an examination was not therefore required . ORG did not address the length of the proceedings before ORG .", "The examination of the subjectmatter of the applicant \u2019s action was primarily the task of the ordinary courts . They had proceeded in accordance with the applicable procedural rules and had given adequate reasons for their decisions . ORG discerned no element of arbitrariness in the contested judgments and found that the remainder of the application was therefore manifestly ill - founded .", "In DATE the applicant turned to ORG again . She sought to challenge the judgments of ORG , ORG and ORG of , respectively , DATE , DATE and DATE on the ground that they had violated her right to respect for her private and family life and her home .", "On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as out of time in that it had been lodged outside the statutory twomonth timelimit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
