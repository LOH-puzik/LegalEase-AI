In the relevant part , this piece read as follows :", "\u201c The citizens of GPE have not had a Mayor for quite some time now because the former Mayor [ PERSON ] has been expelled from JUL [ a political party ] and has thus lost his mandate by virtue of law ... Despite the official Opinion of the Ministry of Justice and Local Self - Government that he can not continue being the Mayor in accordance with LAW ... [ PERSON ] ... considers it no sin to stay on ... [ in this capacity ] ... because he is ... indispensable for ... [ the LOC 's ] ... future development and prosperity ...", "Why is [ PERSON ] pushing so hard to remain as the fictitious Mayor of Babu\u0161nica , committing at the same time , as he is , legal infractions amounting to crimes ... Perhaps he needs the position of Mayor to defend his personal integrity which has been seriously threatened by the criminal complaints filed against him , indicating that he had abused his authority as the Director of a ORG - owned company called ORG in order to acquire enormous material gain ? ... [ PERSON ] ... well knows that ... [ as a former Mayor ] ... his position as the Director of ... PERSON , where he is suspected of having committed certain criminal offences , would also be seriously jeopardised . He understands that ... [ as an ordinary citizen ] ... he would no longer ... [ carry any weight ] ... with the local [ police chiefs and others ] ...", "Therefore , ... in his ' JUL euphoria ' , in line with the slogan \u201c money talks \u201d [ para vrti gde burgija ne\u0107e ] and for his own existential needs , [ PERSON ] has continued with his near - insane spending of the money belonging to the citizens of the LOC [ sumanuto tro\u0161i novac gra\u0111ana PERSON ] on ... sponsorships ...

On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of criminal defamation ( kleveta ) and ordered him to pay a fine in the amount of MONEY ( \u201c CSD \u201d ) plus CSD CARDINAL for costs , which was at that time equivalent to MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) in all . The fine , however , was suspended and was not to be enforced unless the applicant committed another crime within DATE of the judgment becoming final .", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of this decision ( u izreci presude ) only the following text was found to amount to defamation , namely to be \u201c untrue \u201d and , as such , \u201c harmful to the honour and reputation \u201d of the Mayor ( Mr PERSON ) :", "\u201c Therefore , ... in his ' JUL euphoria ' , in line with the slogan \u201c money talks \u201d [ para vrti gde burgija ne\u0107e ] and for his own existential needs , [ PERSON ] has continued with his near - insane spending of the money belonging to the citizens of the LOC [ sumanuto tro\u0161i novac gra\u0111ana PERSON ] on ... sponsorships ...

In its reasoning , the court explained that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of this statement or even that he had reasonable grounds to believe that it was true . Further , the use of the term \u201c near - insane \u201d ( sumanuto ) was deemed to imply the Mayor 's mental illness . The court therefore held that the applicant 's intent was not to inform the public but to belittle the Mayor . In conclusion , it noted that politicians have a special duty to communicate with each other and the public appropriately and stressed that a suspended sentence should \u201c educationally influence the defendant so as to avoid committing ... similar crimes \u201d in the future .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the remainder of the impugned article , however , the court ruled that it was not written with intent to disparage the Mayor and was thus a legitimate way of expressing one 's political opinion , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant 's argument that the Mayor , being an elected politician , had to accept criticism and display a greater degree of tolerance was dismissed , as was his reference to the relevant international standards ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In so doing , ORG found : ( i ) that the applicant had already been convicted of defamation within the criminal proceedings ; ( ii ) that the Mayor could be criticised but that such criticism had to be \u201c constructive , argued and within the limits of decency \u201d ; ( iii ) that , in any event , criticism could not consist of untrue statements which \u201c deeply offend \u201d one 's \u201c honour , reputation and dignity \u201d ; and ( iv ) that the honour , reputation and dignity of the Mayor , as an elected official and Director of a very successful local company , \u201c had more significance than ... [ the honour , reputation and dignity ] ... of an ordinary citizen \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal , except for the part concerning costs , which were reduced to CSD CARDINAL , at that time equivalent to approximately FAC . This court , further , noted that the applicant had relied on , inter alia , LAW but then went on to repeat , in substance , the detailed reasoning of ORG , as described above . Finally , ORG , added , as in the earlier criminal proceedings , that below the published article there had only been the applicant 's name and surname and no indication that it had been written by the President of the local branch of ORG . In any event , the statements made by the applicant were untrue and his intent was to belittle the Mayor , rather than to inform the public or draw the attention of the authorities \u201c to their obligations \u201d .
