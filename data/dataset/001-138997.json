De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , a medical doctor , was given CARDINAL administrative fines amounting in total to CARDINAL NORP levs ( ORG ) ( equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) for failing to keep accurate patient records . The fines were imposed under the Administrative Offences and Sanctions Act DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant sought judicial review of the fines , and his case was examined at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . He retained counsel , who charged him BGN CARDINAL ( equivalent to EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in fees . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the fines .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant brought a claim under the ORG and ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , seeking to recoup the legal fees he had incurred by way of damages . The claimed amount was smaller than the statutory DATE minimum wage in the country , which , at the relevant time , was the equivalent of around LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that since the DATE Act was silent on awards of costs , the applicant could recoup those costs in proceedings under LAW . This was so because they had been incurred as a result of an unlawful administrative decision .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG overturned the lower court \u2019s judgment . It held that since the DATE Act did not lay down any rules in respect of the award of costs , LAW DATE should be applied . However , the Code did not provide for an award of costs either . The court went on to say that the costs incurred by the applicant had not been a direct result of an unlawful administrative decision and could not be regarded as actionable damage under LAW , and dismissed the claim .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with forgery . He was accused of creating CARDINAL false records of medical examinations which had not in fact taken place and for which he had received payments from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged , sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , and barred him from working as a medical doctor for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , requesting , inter alia , the examination of CARDINAL additional witnesses and the gathering of further evidence . ORG turned down those requests in a decision of DATE and at a hearing held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It held , inter alia , that in previous criminal cases against him the applicant had been acquitted because he had been charged with offences which could be committed by a person acting in an official capacity , which he did not have , whereas in the case at hand his official capacity or the lack of it was irrelevant to the charges and to the conviction .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the above criminal proceedings , on DATE the judge presiding over the panel of ORG dealing with the applicant \u2019s case interrupted the applicant \u2019s address while the applicant was saying that the prosecution was \u201c fantasising \u201d about the charges and that \u201c the court was alleging the same nonsense \u201d , and fined him ORG CARDINAL ( equivalent to EUR CARDINAL ) for contempt of court , on the grounds that he had been using insulting words and behaving rudely in the courtroom . The applicant then continued his address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the fine before the president of ORG , who responded that he was not competent to examine the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the president of ORG to forward his appeal to the panel which was dealing with his case and was thus competent to examine it . It is not clear whether his appeal was examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought judicial review of the fine by the administrative courts . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed his application , pointing out that the examination of a legal challenge against a fine for contempt of court was to be conducted using the procedure established by LAW , which provided that such fines were to be challenged before the panel dealing with the case in the course of which the fine had been given .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a claim for damages against PERSON , alleging that she had libelled him . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s application for reopening of the case and quashed the previously delivered judgments in the case .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , at a public hearing held on DATE ORG turned down the applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment on health grounds . It noted that CARDINAL hearing had already been adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request , again on health grounds , and went on to say that the applicant \u2019s medical condition was not so serious as to prevent him from appearing in court . The court then admitted PERSON written submissions and evidence .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again sought the reopening of the case . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the application , as it found that the case had already been reopened once on the applicant \u2019s application and that the applicant had not presented or requested the gathering of additional evidence after the reopening . The court went on to note that one hearing had been adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request and that his medical condition was not so serious as to prevent his appearance in court . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s procedural rights had not been breached and that by seeking adjournments he had been abusing those rights .", "CARDINAL . The Administrative Offences and Sanctions Act DATE lays down the procedure for establishing and punishing administrative offences . Orders imposing administrative sanctions are subject to judicial review by the district courts , whose judgments were , until DATE , subject to appeal before the regional courts ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . On DATE appellate jurisdiction LAW was transferred from the regional to the administrative courts . The LAW does not contain provisions on costs . LAW provides for the subsidiary application of LAW in respect of a number of matters not set out in the LAW , such as remuneration of experts and reimbursement of the expenses of witnesses , but counsel \u2019s fees are not mentioned .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure DATE , in force until DATE , provided in LAW that when an accused was convicted the court had to order him to bear all the costs of the proceedings , including , inter alia , the fees of his or her court - appointed counsel . LAW provided that if the accused was acquitted or the criminal proceedings were discontinued the costs were to be borne by the ORG . In DATE those provisions were superseded by Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , whose wording is identical .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE PERSON provides that a judge presiding over a panel hearing a criminal case shall ensure order in the courtroom and may impose a fine of up to ORG CARDINAL ( equivalent to ORG CARDINAL ) on anyone breaching that order . The fine can be set aside by the panel as a whole .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE provides that the ORG is liable for damage suffered by individuals or legal persons as a result of unlawful decisions , actions or omissions by civil servants , committed in the course of or in connection with administrative action . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) provides for liability of the investigating or prosecuting authorities or the courts for damage resulting from the imposition of an administrative penalty where the penalty has been set aside . Section CARDINAL provides that the ORG is liable for all pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage which is a direct and proximate result of the impugned decision , action or omission .", "CARDINAL . NORP The question of costs for expert opinions and witnesses in proceedings under LAW was settled by ORG in a DATE interpretative decision ( see \u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , ORG ) , in which it held that since the Act did not contain provisions in that respect , the provisions of LAW DATE should apply and that , in cases where a decision imposing an administrative sanction has been quashed , those costs are to be borne by the ORG . The interpretative decision did not deal with counsel \u2019s fees .", "CARDINAL .

The court observed that there existed a certain inconsistency in the administrative courts\u2019 case - law on that point . Some courts awarded costs , whereas others did not , saying that they could be claimed by way of damages in separate proceedings under LAW . The court held that the administrative courts could not award costs in proceedings under LAW , as neither that LAW nor the DATE or DATE Codes of Criminal Procedure made provision for them to do so ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
