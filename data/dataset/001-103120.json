The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG issued a decision by which it imposed a ban on the activities of ORG of Kurdistan ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) , under LAW , second sentence , of ORG , see Relevant domestic law , below ) .", "CARDINAL . Relevant parts of the decision read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The activities pursued by ORG of Kurdistan \u201d ( PKK) ... run contrary to provisions of the criminal law , are directed against the concept of international understanding , endanger inner security and other important interests of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG of NORP \u201d ( PKK) ... is not allowed to pursue its activities within the territorial ambit of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the ORG as such did not challenge the imposition of the ban before the NORP courts , the decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the arrest of its leader , PERSON , in DATE , the ORG 's executives changed their strategy and declared an end to the armed battle against NORP army entities . Following a \u201c peace initiative \u201d declared by the party 's seventh congress on DATE , the ORG did not organise any further demonstrations or violent acts in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG 's presidential counsel decided to launch a large - scale campaign , during which their supporters should address themselves to the NORP authorities , should acknowledge their support for the ORG and should demand that the ban on the ORG 's activities be lifted .", "CARDINAL . The supporters signed a declaration . The declarations were then collected and handed over in large numbers to parliaments , administrative bodies and courts . The content of the largely identical declarations was as follows :", "\u201c Self declaration ( ORG )", "\u201c I also am a follower of the ORG \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d )", "As the NORP people has been denied its basic right to life , it has had no choice but to take up arms . After DATE of war , our national leader , PERSON , has initiated a strategic change . For DATE the ORG has been using exclusively political means to fight for a peaceful and democratic solution to the NORP question . On the basis of this new strategy ORG of Kurdistan ( ORG ) is undergoing a global reformation . Strongly determined to find a solution , it has developed its political activities against all resistance without leaving the framework of legality .", "Although the NORP question emerged geographically in LOC , having regard to its historical , political and international connections it is a NORP problem waiting for a solution . LOC played a major role in the setting of LOC boundaries . That is why LOC is now confronted with the task of playing a role in the solution of the problems . Just as it failed to offer a prospect of a solution when our leader was abducted in the framework of an international conspiracy , LOC fails DATE to make use of the opportunities offered by the ORG .", "While the majority of ORG make GPE 's accession to ORG dependent on the GPE criteria , they deny the national and political status of the NORP living in LOC . GPE and GPE , in particular , insist on a policy of bans . With this destructive attitude LOC puts itself within the context of the policy of destruction and negation which is directed against the NORP people . DATE as in the past LOC continues its negative tradition . This is nothing but a policy of double moral standards .", "CARDINAL . On this basis I , as a member of the NORP people , declare that I share the ORG 's new policy , which , for DATE , has been leading its political fight on a legal basis . I further declare that I belong to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . I challenge the NORP Member States to apply the same standards to themselves they apply to non - member GPE . I furthermore request these ORG to comply themselves with the express criteria for accession to ORG with regard to the NORP living in LOC . I therefore demand the full recognition of the rights granted to other peoples for the NORP people .", "CARDINAL . I further demand the official recognition of the cultural and political values created by the NORP people in the course of their great struggle . In this context I demand respect for my people 's national and political identity .", "CARDINAL . I support the line of the ORG 's democratic struggle , as has been confirmed by its seventh congress . Having regard to the fact that the ORG has not committed CARDINAL single violent act for DATE , I demand the lifting of all bans which are applied on the ORG .", "CARDINAL . I further declare that the liberty of our leader , PERSON , and the possibility of his political activity are the only guarantee for an enduring solution . I therefore demand : \u201c Freedom for PERSON in GPE \u201d .", "I hereby declare that I most severely condemn the prohibition issued against the ORG and the criminal prosecution of ORG membership and of active sympathy for the ORG . I further declare that I do not acknowledge this prohibition and that I assume all responsibility arising therefrom . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With others , the applicant organised and coordinated a collection of signatures of the declaration in GPE . She also signed a declaration herself . On DATE the applicant , with CARDINAL others , handed CARDINAL folders containing CARDINAL signed declarations to the GPE public prosecutor . On DATE the applicant handed over one further folder containing declarations . Furthermore , the applicant donated certain sums of money to a sub - organisation of the ORG , which was also subject to the ban .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the campaign , CARDINAL declarations were handed to the authorities in GPE ; CARDINAL declarations were submitted to NORP administration as a whole .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) convicted the applicant of contravening a ban imposed on an association 's activity ( section QUANTITY no . CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG ) and sentenced her to CARDINAL DATE fines of DATE each . During the hearing before that court , the applicant submitted a declaration that she had not intended to breach the criminal law , but to express her opinion and to further the understanding between the NORP and the NORP people . ORG considered that the applicant , by signing the declaration , taking part in the campaign and giving donations , had flouted the ban on pursuing the ORG 's activities .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the declaration 's content , seen in the context of the accompanying campaign , was likely to have a positive effect on the association 's unlawful activities . ORG considered , in particular , that the declaration \u201c not ( to ) acknowledge this ban and ( to ) assume all responsibility arising therefrom \u201d had a twofold effect : Firstly , the applicant expressed her commitment not to abide by the ban in the future and thus to provide the ORG with security for planning further unlawful activities . Secondly , it was likely to strengthen solidarity with other potential supporters .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the declaration signed by the applicant was not covered by her right to freedom of expression , as the applicant did not confine herself to claiming freedom and self - determination for the NORP people , to demand the lifting of the ban on the ORG and most severely to condemn its continuation , which would fall within the ambit of the applicant 's freedom of expression . Seen in the context of the aims of the overall campaign , the declaration also contained the statement that the applicant would continue to support the ORG even if the ban imposed on its activities was not lifted . This was already implied in the concluding statement , that the applicant would \u201c assume all responsibility arising therefrom \u201d , that is to say from any flouting of the ban . ORG also considered that the campaign had the further aim of overburdening the public prosecution service with such a large number of criminal proceedings that they would not be able to cope .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered as mitigating factors , inter alia , the importance of the right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , referring to its own pilot judgment given on DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , below ) , dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law . According to that court , ORG interpretation of the applicant 's statement and the evaluation of her behaviour were compatible with the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in LAW Law.comprehensively and coherently refuted the applicant 's allegations that she had not participated in a campaign which had been organised by the ORG with the aim to hamper the criminal prosecution of breaches of the ban by provoking a massive quantity of criminal investigations , but that she had merely intended to express her opinion on the ban . This was demonstrated by the fact that the applicant and the other campaigners did not address themselves to ORG , which would have been competent for lifting the ban , but addressed a massive quantity of collected individually signed declarations to the public prosecutor 's office . The applicant 's unwillingness to abide by the ban was further demonstrated by the fact that she had been previously convicted of a similar offence and that she had flouted the ban in another , separate way by financially supporting a sub - organisation of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that ORG had sufficiently weighted the importance of the right to freedom of expression when assessing the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she complained that her right to freedom of expression and her right to petition had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) , in a reasoned decision of CARDINAL pages , refused to accept the applicant 's complaint for adjudication as being unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the German Basic Law ( Freedom of Expression ) reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing and pictures , and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources ( ... ) .", "( CARDINAL ) These rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws , in provisions for the protection of young persons , and in the right to personal honour .", "( CARDINAL ) .... \u201d", "LAW ) provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) All NORP shall have the right to form corporations and other associations .", "( CARDINAL ) Associations whose aims or activities contravene the criminal laws , or that are directed against the constitutional order or the concept of international understanding , shall be prohibited . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( ban on retroactive criminal laws ) provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) An act may be punished only if it was defined by a law as a criminal offence before the act was committed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant sections of ORG ) read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "Banning", "\u201c An association can only be treated as being banned if the competent authority established by decree that its aims or its activity contravene the criminal law or that it is directed against the constitutional order or against the idea of international understanding ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "Geographical applicability of bans imposed on associations", "\u201c ... If a ( foreign ) association does not have a sub - organisation within the geographical applicability of this LAW , the ban ( section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL ) is directed against its activity within that territory . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c Anyone who , within the geographical applicability of this act , by pursuing an activity", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . contravenes an enforceable prohibition under LAW sentence PERSON ( ... )", "Will be sentenced to DATE imprisonment or to a fine . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a pilot judgment ( no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on the criminal liability incurred by signing the \u201c self declaration \u201d which also forms the subject matter of the instant complaint .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed its earlier case - law that a person contravened an enforceable prohibition within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL sentence CARDINAL of ORG if his activity made reference to the banned activity of the association and was conducive to those activities . The acts had to be actually suited to producing an advantageous effect in regard to the banned activities .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the submission of these signed declarations within the framework of a large - scale campaign was concretely suited to support the ORG 's activities . Having regard to the overall context of the statement and to the circumstances of the campaign , ORG considered that it could be ruled out that the signatories confined themselves merely to demand freedom and self - determination for the NORP people , a lifting of the ban and most severely to condemn the maintenance of the ban . This statement would have been covered by their right to freedom of expression . However , the concluding statement , according to which the signatories declared that they assumed \u201c all responsibility arising therefrom \u201d ( that is to say from the non - observance of the ban ) made it unequivocally clear that they were ready to flout the ban and to bear the ensuing criminal prosecution . Otherwise , the addendum would not make sense , as these consequences could not be expected for the mere utterance of criticism and the request for a lifting of the ban , which would be covered by the right to freedom of expression and thus be exempt from criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . This interpretation was further corroborated by the fact that it had been the campaigners ' declared aim to overburden public prosecution authorities with such a large number of proceedings that they would be unable to cope ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
