The court ordered an additional expert report on the value of the jewellery .", "The next hearing took place on DATE . The court heard CARDINAL witnesses and admitted in evidence the expert report on the value of the jewellery . The applicant \u2019s former wife \u2019s lawyer disputed the expert \u2019s conclusion and the court ordered a new expert report to be drawn up by CARDINAL experts .", "The last hearing before ORG was held on DATE .

The court also heard CARDINAL witnesses .", "The last hearing took place on DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the court to adjourn the case , as ORG of which he was a member had ordered a strike and he could therefore not appear before the court on DATE .
