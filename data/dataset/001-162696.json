NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . An ancestor of the applicant , of whom the applicant is the only heir , owned land in the city of PERSON that was expropriated after DATE . Following the adoption of denationalisation legislation in GPE , in DATE the applicant initiated restitution proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the governor of the GPE region ( \u201c the GPE governor \u201d ) held that the land could not be restituted in kind , and awarded the applicant compensation in lieu of restitution . The PERSON governor found that the land had been taken for the construction of buildings and streets , that the construction works had been completed , and that the land which remained unoccupied was insufficient to be registered as separate plot . These findings were reached on the basis of documents submitted by the PERSON municipality , including a letter dated DATE stating expressly that the unoccupied land was insufficient for a separate plot .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , since he had no ground to question the veracity of the documents submitted by the municipality , he did not seek a judicial review of the PERSON governor \u2019s decision , which thus became final . In DATE the applicant received the compensation awarded to him , which took the form of compensation bonds .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant became aware that at about the time when he had sought restitution the municipality had initiated a procedure aimed at separating that part of the land claimed by him which had been unoccupied by buildings or other construction and creating from it an independent plot . The creation of a new plot with a surface of QUANTITY was approved by the mayor of PERSON in a decision of DATE . After that the plot was sold to a third party and construction works were commenced .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a tort action against the NORP municipality , arguing that it had failed to submit to the PERSON governor correct information regarding the status of the land claimed by him . He considered that this had caused him damage , in that had he been awarded partial restitution in kind on the basis of the correct information , he would have received more than what he had actually received after the sale of his compensation bonds . The applicant assessed the losses he had incurred at MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court commissioned an expert report , which confirmed that the documents submitted by the PERSON municipality in the restitution proceedings had not accurately reflected the land \u2019s true status . In point of fact , the land unoccupied by construction at the time had been sufficient to form a separate plot under the statutory requirements . ORG accepted the report \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE it dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It noted that a number of circumstances should have been established in order to substantiate the tort claim ; however , it had not been shown that the land claimed by the applicant had been expropriated on any of the grounds giving rise to an entitlement to restitution , that the applicant had in fact sought restitution in kind , and that , lastly , the PERSON governor had refused such restitution in kind ( and if he had , on what legal ground ) . Thus , it had not been shown that a causal link existed between the alleged damage and the defendant \u2019s actions .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE the above judgment was upheld by ORG . It also pointed out that in order to prove his claim the applicant had had to establish a causal link between the alleged damage and the actions of the defendant , consisting of a number of elements , and that the failure to establish just CARDINAL of them would lead to the rejection of the claim . Like the first - instance court , ORG pointed out that a number of elements in the causal link were missing . It held that it was not clear on what evidence the PERSON governor had relied in granting compensation in the restitution proceedings . It further held that the applicant had not requested restitution in kind and that it was not proven that he had been entitled to restitution in kind , as it was not established that the documents submitted by the PERSON municipality had been the only basis for holding that such restitution was impossible .", "CARDINAL . Upon a further appeal by the applicant , ORG judgment was upheld by ORG in a final judgment of DATE . ORG main argument was that the applicant had failed to apply for a judicial review of the PERSON governor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and seek to establish that a partial restitution in kind had been possible . Thus , any damage incurred by the applicant had not been due to actions on the part of the PERSON municipality but rather to his own failure to act .", "CARDINAL . NORP In separate proceedings , in DATE the applicant brought an action against the governors of the GPE and PERSON regions . That action was dismissed in a final judgment by ORG . On DATE ORG also dismissed an application by the applicant for the re - opening of the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
