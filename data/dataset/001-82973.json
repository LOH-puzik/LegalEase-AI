Furthermore , the applicant had later disobeyed a judgment ordering him to return the stake in the company to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyers objected to the arrest and maintained that the applicant \u2019s detention was incompatible with his state of health .

The detention hearing was supposed to start on DATE at TIME The applicant asked the court to adjourn the hearing in order to allow his lawyers to participate in it .
