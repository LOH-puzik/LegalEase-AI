On DATE , at a general meeting of the company \u2019s shareholders , it was decided that a winding - up procedure should be initiated and ORG was appointed as a provisional liquidator .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Economy refused the application of DATE , noting firstly that the enterprise in question had been nationalised pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)B of the CARDINAL Act , which provided that industrial enterprises capable of employing in production CARDINAL people on CARDINAL shift were to be taken over by the ORG . Capability of employing was to be understood as meaning \u201c the actual capability of employing \u201d on DATE , the date of entry into force of the CARDINAL Act , taking into consideration the manufacturing machinery available . However , on the basis of the existing documents , the Minister was unable to establish whether the factory had been capable of employing CARDINAL people on CARDINAL shift . For that reason , the Minister obtained an expert report determining the enterprise \u2019s potential employment capacity on CARDINAL shift . It emerged from that report that the enterprise \u2019s actual employment capacity at the material time had been CARDINAL people on CARDINAL shift . The Minister endorsed those findings and concluded that the nationalisation of the company had been lawful , as under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) B of the CARDINAL Act it could be effected in respect of enterprises employing a minimum of CARDINAL people on one shift ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company applied for the matter to be reconsidered , but on DATE the Minister upheld the original refusal , referring to the reasons given previously .

On DATE the applicant company lodged a claim with ORG seeking compensation ( MONEY ) for the ORG \u2019s failure to issue the relevant ordinance pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . The claim was based on LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . The applicant company subsequently changed the legal basis for its claim to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It submitted that the ORG \u2019s tortious liability for legislative omission had arisen before DATE and continued after that date .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s claim . It noted that pursuant to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act owners of nationalised enterprises were to receive compensation within DATE of the date on which a notice of final determination of compensation was served . The compensation was to be in the form of securities and , in exceptional cases , also in cash or other values . The amount was to be determined by special commissions . Despite the fact that the CARDINAL Act contained a clear delegation of legislative powers ( delegacja ustawowa ) , a special ordinance had never been enacted . For those reasons , the commissions had never been formed and the compensation could not have been determined . The impugned legislative omission had occurred in DATE or DATE at the latest . In support of that approach the court referred to ORG resolution of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also observed that in DATE and DATE the ORG had enacted other ordinances to implement different provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court further stressed that the law applicable at the time when the legislative omission had occurred had not imposed tortious liability on the ORG . That situation had not changed when LAW had entered into force in DATE . Consequently , before the date of entry into force of LAW had not been liable for legislative omission . The situation had not changed after that date since LAW could not be considered an independent basis for vindicating that type of claim . The plaintiff \u2019s claim could have been based on LAW since that provision concerned ORG tortious liability for failure to enact legislation . However , section CARDINAL of LAW precluded its application in respect of all events and legal situations that had subsisted before DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the present case , the impugned legislative omission had occurred by DATE at the latest . It was true that it had continued since , however , in deciding which legal provisions were applicable , regard had to be had to the date when the legal situation had begun and not whether it had continued . Consequently , since LAW had not been introduced until DATE , it did not apply to events and situations that had subsisted before its entry into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant company , referring to the same grounds as ORG . It held that the obligation to enact an ordinance pursuant to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act had arisen at the time when that LAW had entered into force and the legislative omission had occurred by DATE at the latest , by which time other ordinances had been enacted . However , the legislative omission could not have given rise to the ORG \u2019s tortious liability since that liability had not been introduced until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicant company . It observed at the outset that the main issue in the case was whether ORG was liable pursuant to LAW for damage caused after DATE by failure to enact a legal act , if such an obligation was provided by LAW and the ORG authority had failed to comply with it even after DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that there was no doubt that under section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW had been obliged to enact an ordinance . It was further not contested by the parties\u2019 that that duty had not been complied with .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning ORG had regard to the following . Firstly , until DATE , the date of entry into force of LAW , the law had not imposed liability on ORG for damage caused by legislative omission . Secondly , LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) should have been interpreted narrowly , so that the ORG was liable only for \u201c an act \u201d and not \u201c failure to act \u201d . Consequently , there was no constitutional right to compensation for legislative omission . Thirdly , the legislature had introduced LAW to LAW in order to tighten the rules governing the ORG \u2019s civil liability . Fourthly , LAW unequivocally precluded the application of LAW in respect of events and legal situations that had subsisted before DATE . Fifthly , the ORG was liable for legislative omission only if there was a legal duty to enact ( under an act or the LAW ) . Such an obligation could not be derived from judicial interpretation . Sixthly , there was no legislative omission if the legislature had enacted a law but it was incomplete or flawed . Lastly , the ORG \u2019s civil liability for damage caused by legislative omission arose only when there was a direct causal link ( adekwatny zwi\u0105zek przyczynowy ) between the legal provision and the ( legislative ) omission .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court concluded essentially reiterating the grounds stated in the DATE Resolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the impugned legislative omission had occurred in DATE or DATE at the latest and had continued since . However , LAW CARDINAL of the LAW could not be considered a legal basis for a claim deriving from an \u201c omission \u201d by public authorities since that provision clearly only covered their \u201c acts \u201d . The provisions of DATE , enabling a plaintiff to seek compensation for legislative omission , had only been introduced on DATE , by virtue of LAW . The terms of LAW were unambiguous : DATE of LAW did not apply to events and situations that had subsisted before its entry into force .

ORG answer in the operative part of the resolution reads :", "\u201c Until the date of entry into force of [ LAW ] the ORG \u2019s failure to issue an ordinance pursuant to section DATE ) and ( CARDINAL ) of [ LAW ] did not constitute a basis for a claim by an owner of a nationalised enterprise for compensation for [ nationalisation ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The resolution contains extensive reasoning , the main thrust of which reads as follows :", "\u201c [ As regards the timeframe for the issue of the ordinance ] , the determination of the beginning of that situation carries with it a certain element of arbitrariness since [ LAW ] does not lay down any term within which the ordinance referred to in section [ CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) should be issued . Assuming that in general the absence of a term is tantamount to a duty to enact a law without undue delay , it can be considered that the discharge of the statutory authorisation , assuming the existence of willingness of the authorised body ( the ORG ) should have taken place in DATE or DATE at the latest . This is supported by the fact that the ORG issued ordinances implementing other provisions ( including section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , a fundamental provision for the interest of the ORG ) .", "[ As regards the ORG \u2019s civil liability for legislative omission ] , ... it should be concluded that before the entry into force of the CARDINAL Constitution the State had not been liable under civil law for the consequences of its legislative inactivity ...", "DATE , marking the entry into force of the LAW , is the relevant date as its constitutes the beginning of the existence in the legal order of , inter alia , LAW , proclaiming the right of \u201c everyone \u201d to compensation for any harm done to him by any act of a public authority in breach of the law ...", "Assuming that LAW does not contain a provision making it possible to draw from it a direct basis for a claim for compensation for the legislature \u2019s inactivity , it must be said that the rules for the ORG \u2019s liability in the sphere of law - making should be established by means of an ordinary statute , determining in a more detailed manner than LAW premises for an effective claim ...", "Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as introduced by [ LAW ] , satisfies the requirement of detailed LOC . The relevant temporal consequences are clearly set out in DATE , evidently indicating the prospective operation of DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . A formulation laying down the non - retroactive nature of the provision is telling in that it refers to \u201c events and legal situations that subsisted before its entry into force \u201d ... In consequence , the assessment of the effects of legislative omission subsisting DATE was governed by [ earlier provisions ] . The relevant LAW , in the version before the amendment , did not include legislative omission as it was based on a completely different premise , namely , the absence of the ORG \u2019s civil liability for the legislature \u2019s acts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , adopted a resolution in reply to a legal question submitted by ORG . It held in particular that legislative omission causing the ORG \u2019s liability for damage only occurred when a legal act had not been enacted despite an obligation arising from a legal provision ( the LAW or another act ) . However , that obligation had to be expressed in a clear and unequivocal manner , excluding the possibility of it having to be determined in the process of judicial interpretation ; such practice could be considered an interference with the legislature \u2019s competences .", "CARDINAL . In a resolution of CARDINAL DATE the ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dealt with the following legal question submitted by the Ombudsman :", "\u201c Is ORG liable for damage caused by legislative omission , if the legislature \u2019s inactivity subsisted before DATE ? \u201d", "The ORG argued in his pleadings that judicial practice on the matter was unclear . ORG answer in the operative part of the resolution reads as follows :", "\u201c ORG is liable for damage caused by failure to enact a legal act , if the obligation to enact that act arose after the date of entry of LAW [ DATE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to its DATE resolution , noting that that approach had been endorsed in its subsequent judgments of DATE ( no . ICSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( no . ICSK DATE ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the latter case the court also held that LAW CARDINAL of the LAW could not be considered a legal basis for a claim deriving from an \u201c omission \u201d by public authorities . A similar approach was adopted in a judgment of DATE ( no . I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The court concluded that it was irrelevant when the damage actually happened or whether it had increased in time , but if the legislative omission occurred before DATE , Articles CARDINAL and DATE of LAW could not be relied on .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( PERSON ) on many occasions confirmed that a situation occurring before the entry into force of the LAW could not be a basis for a claim under LAW for compensation for the unlawful action of a public authority . In particular , the ORG gave such a ruling in judgments of DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) , as well as in decisions of DATE ( Ts CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( Ts CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court heard a constitutional complaint lodged by the company GPE w ORG sp\u00f3\u0142ka akcyjna , challenging the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW in so far as it precluded the application of DATE of LAW in situations that had subsisted before the entry into force of LAW on DATE . The claimant invoked , in particular , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( right to compensation for the unlawful action of a public authority ) read in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL ( rule of law ) , QUANTITY and CARDINAL ( right of ownership ) read in conjunction with LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( protection of ownership ) and LAW ( equality before the law ) and LAW ( right of fair trial ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of ORG decision ( no . ORG CARDINAL ) reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... ORG held that the authorisation included in section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL Act ] not only referred to a regulation in a legal act ( akt podstawowy ) of the fundamental guarantees of property law which \u2013 in accordance with current constitutional standards \u2013 could not be accepted but also did not include any instructions as to the content of an ordinance which was to be enacted DATE . Consequently , in the light of the provisions of the LAW it is difficult to assume that non - fulfilment of the duty to enact an ordinance on compensation for nationalised property derived from [ the CARDINAL LAW ] amounted to \u201c [ an ] unlawful action of a public authority \u201d for which the LAW imposes liability on the ORG . Even if the state of legislative omission still persists , it should at the same time be concluded that the duty is non - enforceable . Thus , it is evident that on the basis of the laws applicable only a statute could regulate compensation for the claimant \u2019s nationalised property . Even so , potential validation ( konwalidacja ) of section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] authorising the enactment of an ordinance would have required a statute . ORG is not competent to authorise this . Accordingly , ORG considers that the assumption that an \u201c unlawful \u201d legislative omission still continues is unwarranted , particularly after the entry into force of the LAW , and in the light of the standards therein . Moreover , in view of the declaratory nature of that authorisation it is not possible to conceive what criteria the [ civil ] court should use DATE to determine the amount of compensation due to former owners of property nationalised in DATE . In summarising this part of the analysis , ORG considered that declaring section CARDINAL of LAW unconstitutional in so far as it precluded the application of the amended provisions of LAW in situations which concerned a failure to enact an ordinance and which arose in the pre - constitutional period and which also continued after LAW entered into force ( the direct application of a new statute ) would not have changed the legal situation of the applicant in the desired sense . In the light of current constitutional standards , it is difficult to accept that the duty imposed on the ORG by section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act has any legal effect . Consequently , it could not be established that there was an \u201c unlawful action of a public authority \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "On a passing note , the ORG noticed that in reality the only temporal rule which would have satisfied the applicant , that is would have given rise to compensation , would have had to be phrased : anyone who has suffered damage as a result of a failure to enact a legal act , notwithstanding when it has occurred and notwithstanding the existence of a current obligation to enact a legal act , may request [ the damage ] to be redressed in accordance with the new provisions , namely LAW . A legal rule of this content would not only be contrary to the rule lex retro non agit , but would also appear to be unacceptable to the rational legislator . It is also absolutely clear that such far - reaching ORG liability could not be derived from LAW , which was also demonstrated above in LAW . ORG stresses that LAW forms part of the legal system and is meant to introduce new civil law provisions into that system .
