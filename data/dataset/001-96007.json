However , the scope of the inviolability , the procedure for lifting it and the shortcomings in its implementation had undermined due respect for ORG .

On DATE ORG adopted a series of judgments in cases concerning the lifting of several MPs\u2019 parliamentary immunity . Those cases gave ORG an opportunity to clarify the scope of parliamentary immunity . The relevant passages of the judgments read as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) Meaning of non - liability and parliamentary immunity", "All democratic countries have granted the members of their legislative assemblies certain privileges and immunities in order to allow them to perform their legislative tasks properly . Quite evidently , the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law .", "Parliamentary immunity is not an aim ; it is a means of enabling MPs to fulfil the nation \u2019s wishes in full by perfectly reflecting the wishes of the people within the ORG .", "Even though LAW is entitled \u2018 Parliamentary Immunity\u2019 , it actually establishes CARDINAL institutions : parliamentary non - liability and parliamentary immunity . The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of ORG of GPE are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the ORG \u2019s work , for the views they express before the ORG or , unless the ORG decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker , for repeating or revealing these outside the ORG .", "The second paragraph of the Article stipulates that a member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election may not be arrested , questioned , detained or tried unless the ORG decides otherwise . The only cases where this provision does not apply are those where a member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty , provided that proceedings were initiated before the election , and cases subject to LAW .", "LAW does not specify on what grounds immunity may be lifted , and LAW do not cover the subject . That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter . The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over DATE show that ORG \u2019s powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited . Furthermore , the fact that immunity has a place in the LAW means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of LAW . There is no doubt that the intention , when immunity was provided for in LAW , was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered , and rightly so , from all worry and pressure . In other words , the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented , even temporarily , from fulfilling their functions by arbitrary criminal proceedings . So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in LAW .", "...", "Provision has been made for decisions of ORG of GPE concerning the lifting of immunity to be scrutinised by ORG with regard to their conformity not only with the LAW but also with LAW ...", "When such decisions of ORG of GPE are scrutinised , attention must be paid to the seriousness of the accusation and whether or not it is politically motivated . In addition , the decision must be in conformity with the rationale behind immunity as a constitutional institution .", "In criminal proceedings an MP whose parliamentary immunity has been lifted is like any other citizen . He enjoys all the guarantees set out in the LAW and laws of GPE . All the principles that apply to citizens likewise apply to him .

Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG , concerning the waiver of parliamentary immunity , states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the exercise of its powers in respect of privileges and immunities , ORG shall seek primarily to uphold its integrity as a democratic legislative assembly and to secure the independence of its members in performance of their duties .", "CARDINAL . Any request addressed to the President by a competent authority of a member ORG that the immunity of a member be waived shall be announced in ORG and referred to the committee responsible .", "CARDINAL . Any request addressed to the President by a member or a former member to defend privileges and immunities shall be announced in ORG and referred to the committee responsible .", "The member or former member may be represented by another member . The request may not be made by another member without the agreement of the member concerned .", "CARDINAL . As a matter of urgency , in circumstances where a member is arrested or has his freedom of movement curtailed in apparent breach of his privileges and immunities , the President , after having consulted the chairman and rapporteur of the committee responsible , may take an initiative to assert the privileges and immunities of the member concerned . The President shall communicate his initiative to the committee and inform ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Parliamentary immunity is not a homogeneous notion . Most NORP states recognise CARDINAL categories of immunity for parliamentarians : firstly , the \u201c non - liability \u201d of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings for opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties ; secondly , their \u201c inviolability \u201d or \u201c immunity in the strict sense \u201d , shielding them from all arrest , detention or prosecution for offences unrelated to their parliamentary duties without the consent of the ORG to which they belong . This comparative law study focuses on the latter aspect of parliamentary immunity ( see ORG Report on the regime of parliamentary immunity , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The precise scope of the inviolability varies considerably from CARDINAL country to another . The very nature of this aspect of immunity results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation . In some GPE there is no such institution ( the GPE , GPE ) . In others its scope is very limited . For example , in the GPE inviolability covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual . In GPE and GPE parliamentary inviolability serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from ORG . It therefore affords them limited protection .", "CARDINAL . That said , most of GPE Parties to the PERSON grant their MPs immunity from criminal prosecution during their term as MPs that goes beyond the exercise of parliamentary functions ( GPE , GPE and GPE DATE if the act does not clearly fall outside the ambit of their political activities \u2013 and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) and/or protection against imprisonment or deprivation of liberty ( arrest or detention in all those countries which provide for immunity from prosecution , as well as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In certain cases MPs are protected from body searches , house searches and interception of their communications ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Such proceedings or measures may be executed only with the consent of the assembly to which the MP belongs , except in GPE , where such decisions lie with the courts .", "CARDINAL . In several GPE the scope of inviolability has been restricted , as witnessed by some recent constitutional reforms . In GPE , for example , since the constitutional reform of DATE , the ORG \u2019s authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought , but only for detention , arrest and other judicial supervision measures . A similar change came about in GPE when LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE did away with the need for the prior authorisation of ORG in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP . In GPE , since the constitutional reform of DATE , senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators .", "CARDINAL . In GPE \u2019s GPE the practice is generally for a new parliament to lift immunity from prosecution for all offences ( with the exception of defamation of a political character ) at the start of the parliamentary term . The aim of this is to protect the reputation of each MP , by ensuring that they attract less media attention if proceedings are brought against them .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of parliamentary inviolability ratione materiae , that is to say the acts it covers , there is a general tendency in the GPE Parties to the LAW for cases of flagrante delicto to be excluded . In such cases the prior authorisation of the ORG concerned is not required , but even this does not necessarily prevent ORG from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures ( GPE and GPE , for example ) . In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from inviolability , or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred ( LAW excludes , in certain circumstances , deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The duration of parliamentary inviolability also varies from CARDINAL country to another . Some countries extend parliamentary immunity to criminal proceedings brought prior to the ORG \u2019s election ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In other countries , even if parliamentary authorisation is not required in order for proceedings initiated prior to the MP \u2019s election to be continued , ORG may , of its own motion or at the request of the interested party , request the suspension of the proceedings or the waiving of restrictive measures during the MP \u2019s term of office ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Parliamentary immunity may be lifted in most countries . The procedure for lifting immunity is generally the same . It is usually provided for in ORG . It is set in motion by a proposal or a request for authorisation by the competent public authority ( in most cases ORG ) , the injured party or the parliamentarian concerned . The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the ORG , either directly or in certain cases through another authority ( the Minister of ORG , the Prime Minister ) , then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee , which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned . It is then for the full ORG to decide , with or without a debate , in private or in public , whether or not to lift immunity . The possibility of appealing against a decision of the ORG to lift immunity exists in very few countries ( GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The possibility for MPs to waive their own parliamentary immunity is not widespread ( GPE and GPE ) and is sometimes limited to minor offences ( summary offences in GPE ) or to specific offences ( defamation in GPE and GPE ) . Under GPE \u2019s LAW MPs have the right to consent to criminal proceedings . In GPE LAW gives MPs the right to consent in writing to be prosecuted or arrested .", "CARDINAL . In most of ORG no provision is made for MPs to forgo their immunity of their own free will because immunity is a privilege granted not to MPs on an individual basis but to ORG , to guarantee its smooth operation . In GPE provisions governing immunity are traditionally a matter of public policy and MPs can not renounce it . Any act that violates parliamentary immunity is considered null and void . The question of immunity must be raised by a judge . A similar approach has been adopted in ORG , where renunciation of immunity has no legal effect .", "CARDINAL . This comparative presentation does not reveal any uniform pattern of existing parliamentary practice . It is worth noting , however , that a majority of NORP countries have recognised parliamentary immunity and incorporated it in their constitutional systems as an essential factor in the smooth functioning of the legislature .", "CARDINAL . There are nevertheless marked differences in the nature and scope of the protection inviolability offers MPs . They reflect the different political and historical experiences of the GPE , and often illustrate the needs that underlie inviolability . It would appear that the scope of this privilege , which is considered as an inextricable part of the separation of powers , the autonomy of ORG or the protection of the parliamentary opposition , is defined in each ORG in keeping with the degree of autonomy necessary for ORG to be able to fulfil its duties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
