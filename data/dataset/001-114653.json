LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect)", "JUDGES": "Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Ineta Ziemele;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was detained at ORG ( hereinafter DATE \u201c the GPE \u201d ) in cell CARDINAL . From DATE he shared the cell with another person , and from CARDINAL to DATE he was held alone . The detention facility contained CARDINAL cells in total .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to the administration of ORG that the conditions of his detention had been appalling . In their letter of reply dated DATE , they informed the applicant that because the cell in which he had been held was situated at semi - basement level , it was technically impossible for it to have a window through which natural light could enter . They also explained that in order to install sinks and toilets in the cells , full - scale renovation would be required , but said that this was precluded owing to a lack of financial resources .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint , the content of which is unknown to the ORG , with ORG . In its reply dated DATE , ORG conceded that some of the applicant \u2019s allegations were true : ORG had indeed not met proper \u201c norms of hygiene and functioning \u201d . They said that the Government had been informed about the fact and that the building of a new facility was planned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further complaint with the ORG , arguing that he had been held in a cell without a sink or toilet . The cell also lacked a window , so there had been no natural light or fresh air .", "CARDINAL . The head of ORG informed the ORG that the building had been constructed in DATE and thus it had been impossible to install toilets and sinks in the cells . He explained that detainees were taken to a communal toilet at the end of the corridor and that \u201c each cell had a bucket for the night \u201d . Detainees could also take drinking water to their cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant \u2019s complaint valid . He noted that in DATE health care specialists had pointed out \u201c over and over again \u201d ( eilin\u012f kart\u0105 ) that the cells lacked sanitary units as well as natural light , although the artificial lighting met domestic legal norms . The old air vents were inadequate and the air conditioning system was ineffective . However , the facility administration was not to blame for the insufficient funding that had precluded the possibility of improving conditions in the facility .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then initiated proceedings before ORG seeking compensation for non - pecuniary damage , arguing that he had been held in degrading conditions at ORG . In particular , his cell had had no built - in toilet , so he had had to use a bucket . Nor did the cell have a sink , so he had suffered from a lack of drinking water . Furthermore , as a result of the inadequate lighting and the lack of fresh air , he had suffered constant headaches and his eyes had become sore . The applicant claimed CARDINAL NORP litai ( MONEY ) in non - pecuniary damages . He also claimed that his rights under LAW had been violated .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the lawsuit , ORG acknowledged that the establishment did not meet the domestic legal hygiene requirements , but argued that its administration was not to blame for the lack of funding that had caused the problem and that the construction of a new remand facility was planned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims as unfounded . The court acknowledged that the conditions at ORG had been unacceptable , particularly as the cells lacked sinks and toilets and inmates had to be taken to a communal toilet and had to take water to their cells . Moreover , not all cells had natural light , the air came through old vents and the air conditioning system was ineffective . Nevertheless , the court held that the facility \u2019s administration could not be held liable for those deficiencies because the ORG had not allocated sufficient financial resources to improve the situation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment , and on DATE ORG granted the appeal in part , acknowledging that the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention had been unacceptable . The court noted that ORG had not challenged the applicant \u2019s claim that while detained , he had had to relieve himself in a bucket at TIME . The court considered that fact degrading . The court also found it established that the applicant had been held in a cell without a sink , and that his cell had had no natural light or adequate ventilation , which had had a negative effect on his mental health ( suk\u0117l\u0117 neigiamus i\u0161gyvenimus ) . On these points the court found that certain domestic regulations on hygiene standards in detention facilities - providing that cells should have natural light and that detainees should be able to use a toilet in conditions that were not degrading - had been breached . The court conceded that degrading conditions of detention could in theory amount to a violation of LAW . With regard to the applicant \u2019s case , the court held that the conditions in which he had been held had \u201c approached the threshold of a violation of LAW \u201d . Nevertheless , the applicant had been held for only a short time , he was DATE and there was no evidence that the conditions at the detention facility had affected his [ physical ] health . Nor was there any indication that the detention facility administration had intended to humiliate the applicant . Certain hardships , such as a lack of privacy , were to be considered unavoidable for those who were deprived of their liberty . In the light of the above - mentioned considerations , ORG held that , in the applicant \u2019s case , the minimum level of severity within the meaning of LAW had not been reached .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage , ORG referred to the case - law of ORG , noting that in some cases the finding of a violation was recognised as sufficient just satisfaction . It also noted that the applicant had instituted court proceedings for damages DATE after the end of his detention in the police facility , by which time the effects of the negative experience would have diminished to a certain extent . Emphasising that in the instant case there had been no violation of LAW , as well as the fact that the poor detention conditions were a result of limited financial resources , ORG rejected in its entirety the applicant \u2019s claim for pecuniary compensation for the non - pecuniary damage he had sustained .", "CARDINAL . When submitting their observations on the admissibility and merits , the Government provided the ORG with a copy of the schedule of ORG , which showed that at the relevant time the inmates were to be taken for an TIME \u2019s walk once a day .", "CARDINAL . The Civil Code provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG - pecuniary damage shall be deemed to be a person \u2019s suffering , emotional distress , inconvenience , mental shock , emotional depression , humiliation , damage to reputation , diminished opportunity to associate with others , etc . , evaluated by a court in pecuniary terms .", "CARDINAL . ORG - pecuniary damage shall be compensated only in the cases provided for by law . Non - pecuniary damage shall be compensated in all cases where it is incurred on account of crime , health impairment or deprivation of life , as well as in other cases provided for by law .

In case no . ACARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG acknowledged that a person who had been detained in improper , unsanitary conditions had sustained non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL .

ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the CPT \u201d ) visited GPE from CARDINAL to DATE . Its report reads as follows :", "\u201c DATE . In its first report to the NORP authorities , drafted following its visit in DATE , the ORG was critical of conditions of detention in police detention centres ; with a view to improving the situation in the establishments concerned , it made a number of specific recommendations .", "In their follow - up report ( dated DATE ) , the authorities acknowledged that of the QUANTITY police detention centres in GPE , CARDINAL ( i.e. , PERCENT ) met \u201c the requirements set forth by Hygiene Norm HN DATE \u201d ; it was considered necessary to secure sufficient resources in order to renovate or replace the other detention centres . Nevertheless , by the time of the DATE visit , the proportion of detention centres which conformed to the requisite standards remained low ( PERCENT ) . As the Seimas ( Parliamentary ) Ombudsman has recently pointed out , \u2018 legal acts have been adopted on the improvement of living conditions of inmates in police commissariat detention establishments , however the real results are expected only in DATE since the implementation of the program directly depends on ORG .", "The DATE visit confirmed that many of the ORG \u2019s key recommendations concerning conditions of detention in police detention centres have yet to be implemented .", "CARDINAL . The material conditions under which detained persons ( in police custody , on remand , or sentenced ) were being held in the police detention centres in GPE and PERSON were totally unacceptable . Detainees were locked up ... with little or no access to natural light and , in many cases , dim artificial lighting . A tap placed directly above the minimally partitioned lavatory was the only source of drinking water . In certain cells , persons were obliged to relieve themselves in a bucket in the direct presence of their cellmates . The ventilation system which had been installed in GPE since the visit in DATE could scarcely counter the effects of the above - mentioned conditions on the air in the cells ...", "The cumulative effect of the very poor material environment and the impoverished regime could be described as inhuman and degrading , especially considering that persons were being held under such conditions for prolonged periods . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After a further visit to GPE from DATE , the ORG delegation noted that efforts were being made to improve conditions in certain police detention centres . Particular mention was made of the recent substantial renovation of the detention facilities at ORG , which had been the subject of severe criticism by the ORG after DATE . During DATE visit , the delegation observed very good material conditions in that establishment . The authorities informed the delegation at the outset of the visit that major renovation had also been carried out in police detention centres at ORG and PERSON . Indeed , when visited by the delegation , the latter establishment was found to offer good detention conditions . The delegation was also informed that renovation work was planned in several other police detention centres , in the context of ORG for DATE \u201d ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG report ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the ORG noted that material conditions in the other police detention centres visited ( PERSON , ORG , ORG , ORG and NORP ) displayed a number of major shortcomings and could in some cases be considered inhuman and degrading . The majority of cells seen by the delegation were in a poor state of repair and filthy . Detainees often had little or no access to natural light , and the cells had dim artificial lighting and poor ventilation . At PERSON , a tap placed directly above the minimally partitioned and unhygienic in - cell toilets was the only source of drinking water . Furthermore , as was the case during previous ORG visits , most detainees in police detention centres were locked in their cells for the majority of DATE , their only diversions consisting of conversing with their cellmates or , in some detention centres , watching TV . For the ORG , \u201c such a state of affairs was totally unacceptable \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG report ) .", "CARDINAL . More generally , the ORG called upon the NORP authorities to step up their efforts to bring conditions of detention in all police detention centres to an acceptable level . In particular , measures had to be taken to ensure first that access to natural light and artificial lighting , as well as ventilation , was adequate ; secondly that all detainees had ready access to drinking water in salubrious conditions and were provided with basic hygiene products ; and thirdly that the state of repair and hygiene in the cells and the communal sanitary facilities was adequate ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG report ) .", "CARDINAL . After a further visit to GPE from DATE , the ORG concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Material conditions of detention in the QUANTITY police detention centres visited ranged from very good ( GPE ) to satisfactory ( Wing CARDINAL at PERSON ) to poor \u2212 and in some areas very poor ( Wing CARDINAL at ORG and GPE ) .", "ORG had been renovated prior to the DATE visit and the ORG \u2019s report commented favourably on the material conditions . The delegation which carried out the DATE visit observed that those conditions remained of a very good standard .", "ORG had been partially refurbished . In the renovated wing of the building ( Wing CARDINAL ) , material conditions were satisfactory on the whole . Nonetheless , access to natural light left something to be desired , and the toilets were insufficiently partitioned . Conversely , conditions in the non - renovated wing ( Wing CARDINAL ) were very poor . The cells were in a dilapidated state , dirty and damp , and the same was true of the mattresses and blankets . Further , access to natural light , artificial lighting and ventilation were limited , and the toilets lacked a partition and were malodorous . As for the electrical installations , they seemed hazardous . The delegation was also informed that , in DATE , the cells were very cold .", "At FAC , the cells were in a poor state of repair and hygiene , and access to natural light and ventilation were inadequate . Moreover , the toilets only had a low partition . In CARDINAL cells ( nos . CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , the windows had been concreted over , and there was therefore no access to natural light and no evident means of ventilation ; the atmosphere in these cells was damp and suffocating . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
