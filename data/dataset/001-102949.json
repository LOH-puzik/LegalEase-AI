On DATE ORG refused to reopen the applicants ' case as it found that the most recent general background information would not lead to a revised assessment of the case . More specifically in its letter to the applicant 's representative it stated as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG still finds that , if returned to GPE , your clients will not risk persecution or outrages as covered by LAW by the Sri NORP authorities , including in connection with arrival at FAC . In this connection , ORG emphasises that your male client stated during the asylum proceedings that he has not been politically active or otherwise been involved in conflicts with the Sri NORP authorities or the NORP . ORG thus emphasises that your male client appears not to stand out in any way at all as he has exclusively been the subject of money demands from the NORP like other fishermen in GPE . In that connection , the ORG refers to the fact that your clients left GPE lawfully using their own GPE national passports . ORG also refers to the fact that it appears from the background material available to the ORG that , in general , individuals who have previously supported the ORG on a lower level are not of interest to the authorities . Thus , generally , only high - profile members of the NORP who are still active and wanted , or individuals wanted for serious criminal offences are of interest to the authorities , see GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE , and ORG to GPE , GPE CARDINAL CARDINAL DATE . Also against that background , ORG finds that your clients will not be at a real risk of persecution or outrages as covered by section CARDINAL of LAW on the part of ORG or the ORG , which are in the factual control of ORG according to GPE , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE . In that connection , ORG observes that your clients ' incidents with the group took place in DATE . Likewise , on the background of the above , ORG finds that the fact that your male client 's cousin has been a member of the ORG for DATE can not warrant a residence permit under LAW according to the background material now available . It should be noted that your male client stated at ORG hearing on DATE about his cousin , V , that he last saw V in DATE at his mother 's sister 's house and did not otherwise have any contact with him . The fact that as ethnic NORP from eastern GPE your clients may risk being questioned and investigated by the authorities upon entry into the country does not lead to a revised assessment of the case under asylum law . In this assessment , consideration has been given to the background information available to ORG , from which it appears that the individuals at particular risk of being detained and investigated upon entry in GPE are young NORP , men in particular , from northern and eastern GPE : those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the LOC , see GPE ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . In that connection , ORG refers to the fact that your clients appear not to stand out at all . Against that background , ORG finds that it has not been rendered probable that the Sri Lankan authorities would take a special interest in your clients upon return . This also applies regardless of the fact that your male client may have scars on his face or on his body . In that respect , please see ORG further observations of CARDINAL DATE to your pleading of CARDINAL DATE in the complaint ORG and ORG v. GPE before ORG . As in its decision of DATE , ORG still finds that the general situation for ethnic NORP in GPE is not of such nature that it in itself warrants a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW . The ORG observes in that connection that it is a condition for a residence permit under section CARDINAL that , upon a specific and individual assessment , the alien is deemed at risk of persecution or outrages . The authority of ORG is restricted to determining asylum - relevant issues , and it is thus outside the ORG 's authority to determine whether an alien who does not meet the conditions of LAW may be issued with a residence permit for other reasons of a more humanitarian nature . Against that background and in accordance with its decision of DATE , ORG still finds that it has not been rendered probable that , in case of return to GPE , your clients would be at a concrete and individual risk of persecution as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , or that your clients would be at a real risk of outrages as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . It should be noted that your clients ' time - limit for departure is still suspended until further notice on the basis of the request of DATE from ORG . If your clients ' basis of lawful residence in GPE lapses , your clients must leave GPE immediately , see section QUANTITY of LAW . As appears from the decision of ORG of DATE , your clients may be forcibly returned to GPE if they do not leave voluntarily , see section GPE , cf . section CARDINAL , of LAW . The decision also comprises your clients ' CARDINAL children . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , asylum is granted to aliens who satisfy the conditions of LAW .

Although the government has gradually reduced the military presence in the camps and has pledged to start the progressive return to their villages of origin of the majority of those in the camps , it is clear that this may take a considerable amount of time .

Previous conversations with the police and in the media , the authorities have openly referred to physical examinations being used to identify whether suspects have undergone military style training . More recent claims from contacts in government ministries suggest that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently . At the very least it appears that the security forces only conduct these when there is another reason to suspect an individual , and are not looking for particular scars as such , but anything that may indicate the suspect has been involved in fighting and/or military training . There is no recent evidence to suggest that these examinations are routinely carried out on immigration returnees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Tamilnet reported that CARDINAL NORP youths were taken into custody by ORG of the Sri Lanka Police at FAC in CARDINAL separate incidents whilst trying to leave GPE .

The Report of Information Gathering Visit , DATE , stated that the frequency of cordon and search operations had not reduced significantly in DATE , though there were fewer large - scale operations than in DATE . In general , young male NORP originating from the north and east of the country were most at risk of being detained following cordon and search operations , with the presence of the risk factors set out above increasing that risk . Those without employment or legitimate purpose for being in GPE were also likely to be seen as suspect . The same report also noted that most sources agreed that there had been few , if any , abductions or disappearances since DATE . There was not a great deal of available information about the profile of NORP targeted for abduction , although it appeared that people linked to the media might be more vulnerable . Police did not generally carry out effective investigations . It went on to note that most sources agreed that there had not been any significant reduction in the number of checkpoints in GPE , whose stated purpose remained to detect and prevent terrorist activity . In general those most likely to be questioned were young NORP from the north and east ; those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the West . However , most sources said that arrests at checkpoints were rare and none had been reported since DATE . It was reportedly fairly likely that someone would be stopped at a checkpoint en route from the airport to GPE . Finally , it clarified that people who wished to live in GPE but did not originate from there must register with the local police station with a national ID card or full passport , and details of planned length and purpose of stay . In theory , whilst anyone was entitled to register to stay in GPE , some sources suggested that young NORP men originally from the north or east of the country could encounter difficulties and face closer scrutiny . The presence of any of the risk factors set out above would also attract greater attention from the police .", "\u201c The significant majority of reported cases of human rights violations in GPE involve persons of NORP ethnicity who originate from the LOC and LOC ... In Government - controlled areas , NORP who originate from the LOC and the LOC , which are , or have been under ORG control , are frequently suspected as being associated with the NORP . For this reason , NORP from the LOC and the LOC are at heightened risk of human rights violations related to the implementation of anti - terrorism and anti - insurgency measures . While this risk exists in all parts of GPE , it is greatest in areas in which the ORG remains active , and where security measures are heaviest , in particular the LOC and parts of the LOC , and in and around GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The country of origin information that ORG has considered indicates that NORP from LOC continue to face a significant risk of suffering serious human rights violations in the region ( and elsewhere in the country ) because of their race ( ethnicity ) or ( imputed ) political opinion . NORP in the LOC are still heavily targeted in the security and anti - terrorism measures described in LAW . Wide scale detention and confinement of NORP from the LOC remains a serious concern . ORG paramilitary elements also continue to operate with impunity against NORP in the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum - Seekers from GPE of DATE , which superseded the DATE Guidelines contained information on the particular profiles for which international protection needs may arise in the current context . It was stated that :", "\u201c given the cessation of hostilities , NORP originating from the north of the country are no longer in need of international protection under broader refugee criteria or complementary forms of protection solely on the basis of risk of indiscriminate harm . In light of the improved human rights and security situation in GPE , there is no longer a need for group - based protection mechanisms or for a presumption of eligibility for NORP of NORP ethnicity originating from the north of the country .

Incidents of ORG involvement in abductions , child recruitment , robberies and repression of dissent are widely documented . It is also reported that ORG forces are responsible for extrajudicial killings , deaths in custody and abductions , which have apparently been carried out with the knowledge and tacit agreement of Government actors and local authorities .
