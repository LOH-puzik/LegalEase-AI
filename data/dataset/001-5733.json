NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr NORP , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant is a sociologist and was at the material time employed by ORG ( Antirasistisk senter ) as a researcher . His application before the NORP relates to the publication of a book in respect of which he was found to have defamed PERSON The facts of the case , as described mainly in the national NORP judgments , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE ORG published a book , of which the applicant was the author , entitled \u201c At the extremity \u201d ( \u201c PERSON ytterst \u201d ) with the subtitle \u201c NORP groupings in GPE \u201d ( \u201c Rasistiske grupperinger i GPE \u201d ) . It was presented as a product of scientific research conducted by a sociologist , listing and describing the most important racist groupings and persons in GPE and presenting in chart form the connections between the various groupings . This included the names of CARDINAL persons , CARDINAL of whom had been convicted of offences of assault , some of murder , and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment .", "The book comprised CARDINAL Chapters entitled : CARDINAL . ORG in GPE , CARDINAL . PERSON - nazism in NORP , CARDINAL . The Race Warriors , CARDINAL . GPE is Ours , CARDINAL . To ORG , CARDINAL . Many Rivers Small , CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s Successors or just Silly People ( this LAW was divided into CARDINAL sections : a. ORG but these are only Appearances , b. Contacts Abroad , c. Words and Contents , d. Methods , e. Consequences ) , CARDINAL . ORG , and CARDINAL . But is that Something to be Concerned About ?", "On the cover of the book , the following is stated about the book \u2019s contents :", "\u201c AT THE EXTREME is the first book to give an insight into current racist groupings in GPE .", "DATE people in GPE laughed at ORG distributing leaflets stating : \u2018 GPE for the NORP - foreigners get out\u2019 . DATE the laughter has calmed down . Since the reunification CARDINAL persons have been killed by ORG .", "Many people wonder whether the same could happen in GPE . Are the racist groupings in GPE PERSON \u2019s successors or are they just a gang of silly fools ?", "No other political issue in GPE has roused people to the extent of the debate on immigration .", "There are DATE CARDINAL racist groupings which are against immigration .", "Who are they ? What do they do ?", "What consequences will this have for NORP society ?", "The answers may be found in this book . \u201d", "The book \u2019s foreword includes the following statement :", "\u201c Many call them racists . They call themselves NORP , PERSON , racists , nationalists or patriots . The labelling may be practical but the substance is more important . The groupings mentioned in this book are described as racists because , by words and deeds , they discriminate and harass individuals and groups on grounds of their ethnic origin , culture or religion .", "People who form part of racist groups are not of any singular kind . They are not monsters , PERSON fans or mad . They are like ordinary people \u2013 almost .", "Their solution to problems of anxiety and discontent , a channel for their hatred DATE is to have somebody to blame : If we get rid of immigrants , we may also be able to get rid of social problems such as narcotics , rape , stabbing and social security fraud ? \u201d", "In LAW , at page CARDINAL , a certain PERSON is mentioned as follows :", "\u201c ACROSS PARTY LINES ELECTORAL INITIATIVE ( PERSON DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the TVI \u201d )", "The above grouping is actually registered as a party . Its leader is Ms I .- M. L. , and it operates from a mailbox at GPE . It is a newsletter party which seldom appears publicly , except for Ms I .- M.L. \u2019s participation in certain TV debates and her leaflets for ORG ( ORG ) . \u201d", "The introduction to LAW stated that there were CARDINAL registered parties hostile to immigrants in GPE and that", "\u201c DATE the parties emerge as an attempt to dress racism with a suit and a tie in order to lure people into believing that it is \u2018 an entirely ordinary party\u2019 on the same line as other established parties . \u201d", "In LAW a. , at page CARDINAL , it is stated :", "\u201c As usual in NORP society , it is men , in particular elderly men , who are the leaders , except for PERSON ( Najonaldemokratene ) and PERSON ( PERSON ) . The average age is lower within the militant groupings , but men lead these too . In the skin head milieus there is a stronger presence of young women than in other groups . \u201d", "Contrary to what is stated above , the ORG was not a registered political party but a grouping of CARDINAL persons . Under LAW of the Parliamentary , County , and LAW DATE ( LAW No . CARDINAL , Valgloven ) , the signature of CARDINAL persons entitled to vote in NORP elections is a prerequisite for the registration of a party by the competent authority , namely the notarius publicus in GPE . The lists of registered political parties are publicised . At present , there are CARDINAL registered political parties in GPE .", "On DATE Ms I .- M.L. instituted proceedings against the applicant before ORG , claiming that the manner in which she had been mentioned in the applicant \u2019s book constituted unlawful accusations of racism which were defamatory and warranted compensation . She felt particularly aggrieved and defenceless against such research , which was on a different level from ordinary public discussion . The risk of being described as a racist made it impossible to express one \u2019s opinions in a public debate . Following the book \u2019s publication , she feared reprisals from the far left and had had to bear derogatory remarks from neighbours . She was of the firm opinion that she was not a racist .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant . While finding that the book had indeed labelled Ms I .- M.L. as a racist it considered that it had been justified . In ORG view the classical lexical definition of racism , which related to the belief that CARDINAL race was superior to another according to physical and mental distinctions , ought to be supplemented by a more modern understanding of the concept . Ms ORG had , by her own words and public connections , handled questions of immigration policy in a manner which , she should expect , would spark off reactions .", "Ms I .- M.L. appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) , which in a judgment of DATE found unjustified defamation within the meaning of LAW .", "ORG observed that , given the book \u2019s title , in particular its subtitle , the comments on its cover page and the foreword , PERSON group , the LAW , was to be perceived as a racist group by the ordinary reader . The description of that group contained no reservation such as that made with respect to ORG . The accusation of racism not only concerned the ORG but also extended to Ms I .- M.L. She was mentioned as the leader of the group and her name was cited twice . The book \u2019s own definition of the concept of racism stated in the foreword should be decisive for the ordinary reader \u2019s understanding of the book . Given the text on the cover page , taking as a starting point NORP PERSON and mentioning that DATE people had been killed by such NORP , the reader would get the impression that the book dealt with clearly racist groups .", "However , while Ms I .- M.L. \u2019s remarks published by ORG about the lack of common traditions between NORP and many immigrants or foreigners were deemed to border on racism , ORG did not find that any of her published statements constituted proof of racism , even though they might be perceived as offensive by some immigrants . Her participation in a certain seminar ( at which representatives of a number of racist groupings had been present ) also fell within her freedom of expression and opinion . The same applied to the fact that , for a short time , she had held a post on ORG interim governing ORG board in GPE . Since these matters did not justify describing her as a racist the applicant had failed to prove that the accusations made against her were true .", "Moreover , while the accusations \u2013 which encompassed allegations of discrimination and harassment on ethnic grounds \u2013 had been expressed in a book written by a researcher for ordinary sale and were serious , the applicant \u2019s investigations into Ms I .- M.L. had been clearly deficient . The information contained in the book about Ms I .- M.L. and her group was erroneous , namely , the allegations that the group ORG had been registered as a political party , that FAC had taken part in television debates and that she had been involved in the distribution of leaflets for ORG . It was clear that the applicant had in part confused Ms I .- M.L. with someone else . In the view of ORG , had the applicant met the requirement of diligence that ought to apply , he would have avoided such errors , with the result that the ORG would have appeared as a particularly marginal group of little public interest . Probably , if the applicant had carried out reasonable research , this group would not even have been mentioned in the book .", "Considering the case as a whole , ORG found that the accusation that PERSON was racist , according to the book \u2019s own definition , must be deemed inappropriate , and constituted punishable defamation .", "Under LAW of LAW DATE ( Skadeserstatningsloven \u2013 Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG ordered the applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG ) to PERSON in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The amount awarded took into account that , to the extent that she felt defamed , she had brought this largely on herself by her affirmations and recommendations . She had expressed views which had been offensive to many immigrants and which , if they were to be accepted , would make their situation difficult in GPE . Regard was also had to the fact that the book had brought the applicant little profit . Finally the applicant was ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL for her costs before ORG and ORG .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the applicant leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
