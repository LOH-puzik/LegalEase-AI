The applicant formed CARDINAL construction companies to build catering and accommodation facilities at the request of the Olympic Games Organisation Committee ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He was the manager of the companies . He held PERCENT of the shares in CARDINAL of the companies , which was the sole shareholder in the other CARDINAL . He also acted as guarantor of virtually all the companies ' debts .", "CARDINAL . As the works were not completed within the agreed period , the ORG suspended payment for them . On DATE the applicant lodged a declaration of insolvency on behalf of the companies with the registry of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an order for the judicial reorganisation of the applicant 's CARDINAL companies . It named PERSON as the insolvency judge , and also appointed a deputy insolvency judge , a judicial administrator and a creditors ' representative . It ordered a DATE observation period during which the judicial administrator was to draw up a report on the companies ' finances and labour force with his recommendations as to whether the companies should continue or cease trading . The observation period was renewed twice .", "CARDINAL . During the observation period , the insolvency judge made various orders , namely : orders for the appointment of an expert on management supervision ( DATE ) , a valuer ( DATE ) and an accountant ( CARDINAL DATE ) ; orders declaring claims time - barred ( CARDINAL orders were made on CARDINAL DATE and others on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) ; orders for the restitution of equipment ( on DATE , DATE and DATE ) ; an order authorising the applicant 's intervention in the management of the hotels ( on DATE ) ; an order dismissing applications for the restitution of equipment ( DATE ) ; orders for an action to be brought against CARDINAL of the other contracting parties and for other measures ( on DATE ) and for the restitution of equipment ( DATE ) ; orders dismissing CARDINAL members of staff ( DATE ) and a further member of staff ( DATE ) ; and lastly an order for the freezing of accounts ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judicial administrator asked ORG to decide whether to accept the applicant 's proposals for its recovery through continued trade .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared at the hearing and gave evidence as the manager of the companies concerned . The judicial administrator and the creditors ' representative also made oral submissions . The judicial administrator presented a report in which he explained to ORG the history of the dealings which had led to the applicant 's filing in insolvency . He then related to the court events during the observation period . He stressed that the applicant 's recovery plan had been accepted by a majority of the creditors . He raised doubts over certain issues and said that it was for the applicant to dispel those doubts by putting up financial and professional guarantees .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided ( on application by ORG ) that before approving the applicant 's proposed recovery plan , it needed to be satisfied that the companies ' continued economic activity would be permanent . For that purpose , it needed financial and professional guarantees from the applicant . It therefore asked him to produce certain additional documents so that it could be sure that the guarantees existed . The applicant lodged an additional file in response to that request . In the light of the new file lodged by the applicant , the administrator filed a supplemental report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the observation period and put the CARDINAL companies into compulsory liquidation . It held that the proposed recovery plan was not accompanied by sufficiently reliable guarantees to ensure that the companies could continue as a going concern . The judgment contained , inter alia , the following passages :", "\u201c Consequently the ORG must find that the proposed plan is not accompanied by the guarantees required to ensure its future economic activity in a difficult sector .", "Pursuant to the provisions of sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , it therefore orders the compulsory liquidation of the aforementioned companies in accordance with the provisions of LAW of that statute and holds as follows .", "FOR THESE REASONS", "The ORG , sitting in public and as a court of first instance ,", "Having examined the insolvency judge 's report ,", "Having examined the judicial administrator 's report ...", "Terminates the observation period ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG reassigned the case to the insolvency judge , decreed that the administrator 's mission had been completed and appointed the creditors ' representative as liquidator of the companies . The insolvency judge sat on the bench that delivered that judgment in his capacity as President of the ORG . He was assisted by the Vice - President of ORG and another judge .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment in its entirety . It delivered its decision after examining the applicant 's recovery plan , the judicial administrator 's report and the liquidator 's submissions . The applicant attended the hearing and made oral observations .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He put forward CARDINAL grounds of appeal based on LAW . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The applicant had argued that ORG had not been impartial because the insolvency judge had sat on the bench of ORG that had ordered the companies ' liquidation after playing an active role in the period of observation of the companies . ORG met the argument as follows :", "\u201c ... the fact that , in accordance with LAW of DATE , the insolvency judge sat on the bench that made the order for compulsory liquidation is not contrary to the provisions of LAW of LAW ; that ground of appeal is unfounded ; ... \u201d", "The applicant 's second ground of appeal read as follows :", "\u201c ... the insolvency judge 's report and accompanying documents were not communicated to the appellants . In that regard the hearing was not fair for the purposes of LAW and the rights of the defence were not respected within the meaning of LAW . A hearing can only be said to be fair \u2013 again for the purposes of LAW if equality of arms is ensured , in other words , if each party is aware of all the matters on which the court will rely in coming to its decision . Among those matters , the insolvency judge 's report plays a paramount role in helping the court to reach its decision . However , it is deemed privileged information to which the debtor is unable to have access ( it is not communicated , does not appear in the official case file which may be communicated and is not read out at the hearing ) . Nor , consequently , may he contest it . The principle of a fair hearing is thus infringed for the purposes of the LAW and the rights of the defence under LAW denied .", "ORG answered that argument as follows :", "\u201c ... LAW DATE provides that the insolvency judge 's report may be presented orally ; that provision is not contrary to LAW . Accordingly , since the applicant has not submitted that the insolvency judge did not present his report orally , this ground of appeal can not succeed ... \u201d", "The applicant also raised a ground of appeal based on the fact that ORG had failed either to summons the other party to a contract to appear or to take evidence from it . ORG dismissed that ground of appeal , holding :", "\u201c ... other contracting parties are only required to be summonsed to appear before the court of appeal when assignment of the contract as part of a plan for the sale of the undertaking is envisaged . There is no provision requiring other contracting parties to be summonsed to appear when an order for compulsory liquidation is made . This ground of appeal is therefore unfounded ... \u201d", "Concurrently , on DATE the applicant lodged an application with the President of ORG for an order for the communication of the insolvency judge 's report . On DATE the President of ORG dismissed the application , holding :", "\u201c ... the insolvency judge 's report is clothed in the secrecy of the deliberations and can not be communicated to anyone . \u201d", "Section DATE \u201c This Act institutes a new procedure of judicial reorganisation proceedings with the aim of preserving undertakings , maintaining their activities and employment and clearing their debts . \u201d", "Judicial reorganisation shall take place in accordance with a plan approved in a judicial decision at the end of an observation period .
