CARDINAL refused to register the applicant as a candidate in the parliamentary elections on account of his failure to pay the electoral deposit , the amount of which was CARDINAL times the tax - free DATE income ( CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) ) . On DATE ORG upheld this decision , noting , inter alia , that the applicant had submitted all the relevant documents to the local electoral commission , but had failed to pay the electoral deposit as required by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged these decisions before ORG , stating that he was unable to pay the deposit as his DATE income ( MONEY ) was less than this sum .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . In particular , the court found that the applicant was free to stand as a candidate for parliamentary elections on condition that he pay the electoral deposit . The court also referred to ORG decision of DATE which stated that the deposit requirement complied with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant Articles of the LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c ...

A citizen of GPE who has attained DATE on the date of elections has the right to vote and , if that citizen has resided in the territory of GPE for DATE , may become a member of the national parliament ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW as worded at the material time established that a NORP citizen who had reached DATE by DATE of the elections , had been resident in GPE for DATE before the elections and was entitled to vote was eligible to stand for election to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW , a NORP citizen who was eligible for election to ORG could put forward his or her own candidature by lodging an application with the competent district electoral commission .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , at the material time a party or block of parties , and independent candidates , were required to pay , respectively , an electoral deposit of CARDINAL times and CARDINAL times the tax - free DATE income . The deposits were returned to successful candidates and parties ( that is , parties which received PERCENT of the national vote ) and money deposited by unsuccessful candidates and parties was forfeited .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provided for ORG funding of part of the expenses incurred by registered candidates during an electoral campaign . Candidates had equal access to ORG funding .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL , the competent district electoral commissions were to print CARDINAL copies of electoral posters for each registered candidate , the cost being borne by the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , ORG - run local television and radio broadcasting companies were to provide each registered candidate with TIME of free air - time to present their programme to the electors . The cost was borne by the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the LAW , replacing the mixed proportional / majority electoral system with party - list proportional representation .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings were initiated before ORG following a constitutional petition ( \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f ) by CARDINAL members of parliament , who challenged section CARDINAL of the DATE Act on the ground that it established a property qualification , which discriminated against less successful citizens and was contrary to LAW . The Speaker of ORG and the President of GPE submitted observations on the issue . The Speaker upheld the disputed provision in principle , but expressed his concern as to the actual amount of the required deposit . The President indicated that he had vetoed the original bill during its passage through ORG on the ground that the proposed amount was excessive . According to the President , once the deposit had been substantially lowered , this measure ceased to violate human rights and freedoms .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the electoral deposit was not a direct or indirect limitation of the right to stand for election , since it did not predetermine the citizen \u2019s right to elect or be elected . The deposit was no more than a precondition for the candidate \u2019s registration by the electoral commission . All candidates had to pay the same amount , irrespective of their financial situation , and thus it could not be considered discriminatory on grounds of property . The electoral deposit was intended both to encourage a responsible attitude towards elections on the part of potential candidates and to prevent an abuse of electoral rights . Moreover , it was aimed at preventing excessive or unreasonable expenditure of the ORG funds allocated to cover candidates\u2019 costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG also indicated that establishment of the actual amount of the deposit fell within the discretionary powers of the political authorities and was thus outside its jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The electoral commission of the single - member constituency no . CARDINAL registered CARDINAL candidates for DATE parliamentary elections ( CARDINAL subsequently withdrew ) , CARDINAL of whom were independent candidates , including CARDINAL professors and a doctor who worked in a public hospital .", "CARDINAL . The electoral laws of CARDINAL member ORG require deposits to be made by candidates for election , although in some this condition applies to electoral lists , not individual candidates . Several democratic States outside LOC have also introduced this requirement ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The sum to be paid is calculated in various ways , for example , by multiplying certain amounts predetermined by law ( such as the minimum wage in GPE , the average wage in GPE ) or by applying a fixed amount ( as in GPE ) . The actual sum for individual candidates currently varies from ORG ( GPE ) to LAW ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Although registered candidates usually receive various forms of support from public funds ( free television air - time , postal services , LOC for meetings , etc . ) , this is not always the case .", "CARDINAL . Deposits are normally refunded if the candidate obtains a certain percentage of the votes cast . Only the laws of GPE , GPE and GPE provide that the deposit is forfeited if the candidate does not actually win a seat .", "CARDINAL . In the PERSON case ( GPE v. Minister for the Environment [ DATE ] IEHC CARDINAL ) , the plaintiff argued before ORG that , since he was unemployed and had virtually no financial resources , he was unable to pay the deposit required for national parliamentary elections and NORP elections ( CARDINAL and QUANTITY respectively ) . In his judgment ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) , PERSON Justice PERSON summarised CARDINAL reasons which had been put forward to justify a deposit system or some equivalent filter :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Excessively ... large numbers of citizens offering themselves for election to membership of PERSON would undermine the democratic nature of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The presence of a large number of names on a ballot paper would serve to confuse the electorate .", "CARDINAL . Voters would be likely to make a choice before reading a long list of candidates to the end and this would not serve democracy .", "CARDINAL . The more unsuccessful candidates there are in an election the more difficult it is to achieve proportional representation so that a major ... increase in the number of candidates would serve to undermine the proportional representation single transferable vote system of election mandated by LAW , LAW , subsection ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The greater the number of unsuccessful candidates the more difficult it becomes for voters to predict the outcome of the election so that their ability to properly manage their vote is lost or impaired .", "CARDINAL . The counting of votes would take longer as the numbers of candidates increased and with more candidates there was a greater scope for more and longer recounts .", "CARDINAL . With many candidates seeking to persuade the electorate within the maximum period of DATE allowed by LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , election campaigns would become disruptive and the electorate could become confused or apathetic .", "CARDINAL . The process of nomination , delivering nominations , and ruling on the validity of nominations would become overwhelmed if large numbers of candidates were to stand for election . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON went on to hold that the deposit system discriminated against persons of reduced means and was thus an attack on their human dignity . Having considered the justifications above , he nevertheless concluded that there was no real evidence that abolishing the deposit system would cause such serious disruption , as those arguments were based on surmise . In conclusion , he ruled that , in the absence of some alternative route to the ballot paper , the deposit system was unjust , unreasonable and arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the deposit system was replaced by a nomination and signatures system .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. GPE ( Attorney - General ) , the plaintiff , leader of ORG , challenged various aspects of NORP electoral law on the ground that they allegedly discriminated against small , unrepresented parties such as his .", "CARDINAL . In ORG , Justice PERSON invalidated the existing deposit rule , according to which MONEY ( ORG ) required from election candidates was only refunded in full to those who obtained PERCENT of the votes cast . Those who obtained less received only ORG CARDINAL of the original deposit . The judge found this to be in violation of LAW ( active and passive voting rights ) , and recommended the full reimbursement of the deposit irrespective of the candidate \u2019s score .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , ORG did not accept the lower court \u2019s equation of fairness with strict equality of treatment in the matter of electoral law . He held that the essential purpose of CARDINAL of the LAW was to guarantee the right to effective representation , rather than ensuring absolute parity . Equal treatment was an important consideration , but not the only one .", "CARDINAL . In the third periodic report of GPE , the NORP delegation stated :", "\u201c With reference to the recent case in which a political organisation had contested the amount by which electoral deposits had been raised , ORG had decided that the size of the increase would prevent people from standing for election and was therefore unconstitutional . The Government had originally amended the law to stop people from standing for frivolous reasons and obtaining large amounts of air - time in exchange for a very modest deposit . In the wake of the ORG ruling , electoral deposits had reverted to the previous amount of QUANTITY . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A political debate concerning the electoral deposit is currently under way in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The deposit was first introduced in DATE in the Representation of GPE , and fixed at MONEY ( GBP ) . The refund threshold was CARDINAL of the votes cast . ORG DATE reduced the threshold to PERCENT , but increased the deposit to GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG , concerned by growing political absenteeism in GPE , published a report entitled \u201c Voting for change \u201d , in which , inter alia , it advocated the abolition of the deposit system . The Commission considered that this requirement clearly disadvantaged small parties and independent candidates ( for example , ORG lost all of its deposits in the DATE and DATE parliamentary elections ) .", "CARDINAL . The government did not support this proposal , considering that the elimination of the deposit would allow anyone to stand for election and gain access , for instance , to free leafleting , without any proper safeguards or deterrent . This could lead to a proliferation of candidates causing administrative complexity and frivolous candidatures . Instead it proposed to simplify the system of deposits ( keeping the deposit for parliamentary elections at GBP CARDINAL ) and to reduce the refund threshold to PERCENT of votes cast .

ORG has offered expert evaluations of the electoral laws of many ORG member GPE . The issue of electoral deposits was CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s concerns when assessing the draft amendments to LAW . The draft joint opinion of ORG and ORG in LOC ( the OSCE / ODIHR ) stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The draft amendments eliminate the requirement of collecting signatures supporting a candidate \u2019s nomination and raise the amounts of electoral deposits . This is acceptable in principle . However , the draft ( amendments to Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , PERSON ) and PERSON ) ) , would raise the electoral deposits significantly ( in case of presidential elections , from CARDINAL to CARDINAL [ times the minimum salary ] ; in case of proportional elections , from CARDINAL and in case of majority elections from CARDINAL times the minimum salary ) . It is recommended that these increased deposit amounts be reconsidered , as it is not apparent that the existing deposit amounts are insufficient to deter frivolous candidates . An unreasonably high electoral deposit also presents a problem under international and NORP standards . It is an established principle that wrongful discrimination includes discrimination against a person on the basis of social or property status . Thus , the amount of an electoral deposit must be considered carefully to ensure that it does not prevent the candidacy of a serious candidate who happens to be economically disadvantaged . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as the NORP authorities followed the ORG \u2019s recommendations , electoral deposits ceased to be a matter of concern for international experts . The Final Opinion on the Amendments to LAW contained the following passage :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The amendments eliminate the requirement of collecting signatures supporting a candidate \u2019s nomination . This is acceptable in principle . Contrary to the various previous drafts , the deposits are not raised in the amended Code ( Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and PERSON ) ) , and remain the same as in previous elections , e.g. in case of presidential elections , at CARDINAL ; in case of proportional elections , at CARDINAL ; and in case of majority elections at CARDINAL times the minimum salary .
