The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is currently in detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was facing proceedings before ORG , sitting as a court of criminal judicature , for drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted bail under certain conditions , including a guarantee of MONEY ( ORG ) . CARDINAL of these conditions stipulated that the applicant could only leave his residence to accompany his son to and from school , and was therefore only authorised to go out , accompanied by his son , TIME and TIME On DATE the applicant signed a declaration stating that he agreed to comply with the above - mentioned obligation and to pay the guarantee in the event that he breached any of the conditions . He further paid the sum of ORG CARDINAL by way of deposit .", "CARDINAL . Following a complaint that the applicant had been seen in PERSON , on an unspecified date , TIME , ORG , by a decision of DATE , held that the applicant had breached CARDINAL of his bail conditions , namely being home by the established curfew . ORG therefore revoked his bail , ordered his arrest and decreed that the ORG CARDINAL deposit he had already paid as well as the ORG CARDINAL guarantee were to be paid to the government .", "CARDINAL . As he was unable to pay the guarantee , proceedings were initiated by ORG under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to convert the debt into imprisonment . As stipulated in LAW not exceed more than one day per EUR CARDINAL ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the guaranteed sum to be converted into a period of detention at the rate of DATE per ORG CARDINAL , namely DATE ( DATE and DATE ) , and the applicant was placed in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted constitutional proceedings , claiming that LAW and the ORG decision of DATE constituted a breach of LAW in that they provided for an excessive and disproportionate punishment . Unlike other similar provisions of the law , LAW did not apply a ceiling on the length of the imprisonment to which a debt could be converted and it therefore gave rise to a degrading punishment in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that the applicant did not complain under ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention that the conditions imposed DATE which he had freely accepted , knowing the consequences they could entail \u2013 had been excessive , but solely under LAW on the ground that the length of his penalty had been \u201c excessive \u201d and disproportionate . It held that the length of imprisonment had been clear as soon as the amount of the guarantee had been fixed ; accordingly , after knowingly accepting these conditions the applicant could not now complain that the penalty was excessive , since it was linked to the amount of the guarantee . Furthermore , the Convention did not afford a right to call into question the length of a sentence imposed by a competent court and in no way had the penalty imposed on the applicant been shown to have reached the threshold required to fall within LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant . It held , however , that ORG had erred in considering his detention as falling within LAW ( a ) , namely , detention following a conviction . His detention had its basis in LAW CARDINAL ( b ) , namely , to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law . It followed that , according to GPE case - law , there should be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the deprivation of liberty and the fulfilment of the obligation . In the present case the applicant had undertaken an obligation knowing the unambiguous and non - arbitrary consequences it entailed , according to a pre - established rate which remained valid up to the date of payment . The fact that no ceiling applied to the provision in question did not affect the proportionality between the obligation and the consequences it entailed . Absolving a person of such an obligation when it had not been fulfilled would render the notion of guarantees against detention futile . This reasoning applied to both LAW . Indeed , the applicant had neither contested the proportionality of the amount specified in the guarantee imposed nor stated that it was beyond his means . It followed that it could not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Notwithstanding that elements of shocking disproportionality could raise an issue under LAW v. GPE , no .
