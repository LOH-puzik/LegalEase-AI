He stated :", "\u201c Realising that the identity check in the village could not be conducted by conventional means without entailing heavy losses among the contingent , ORG , absolutely correctly from a military point of view , decided to employ army aviation and ground attack air forces , artillery and mine - launchers against the fortified positions of the fighters entrenched in the village . Failure to employ these firm and drastic measures in respect of the fighters would have entailed unreasonably high losses among the federal forces in conducting the special operation and a failure to accomplish the operative task in the present case . All this would have demonstrated impotence on the part of the federal authorities , would have called into question the successful completion of the counter - terrorist operation and the reinstatement of constitutional order in GPE . Failure to accomplish these tasks would threaten the security of GPE . Besides , our indecisiveness would have attracted new supporters to the illegal armed groups , who had adopted a wait - and - see attitude at the relevant time . This would have indefinitely extended the duration of the counter - terrorist operation and would have entailed further losses among the federal forces and even higher civilian casualties . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

They thus used the villagers as a human shield , entailing high civilian casualties .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion , the population of ORG should have prevented the fighters ' entry into the village . Had they done so , as had happened earlier in the village of GPE , there would have been no need to conduct such a \u201c severe mopping - up operation \u201d and to deploy aviation and artillery , and thus the unfortunate civilian losses could have been avoided . The losses among fighters , in his estimation , were CARDINAL persons . The rest escaped from the village at TIME , under cover of thick fog .", "CARDINAL . He was asked what measures were taken to ensure maximum security of the civilians during the operation in GPE - Yurt .

Mr Shamanov responded that he had given no such orders , and that the exit was in fact organised by the federal troops under his command . He stated that during his visit he berated the head of the village administration for allowing the situation to deteriorate to such an extent that it had become necessary to involve aviation and artillery . That dialogue could have been understood by those present in a perverse way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned Major - General PERSON , who had headed the operation in LOC . He testified that at the relevant time he had headed a division of ORG troops which belonged to ORG , headed by Major - General PERSON . The situation in the zone of their responsibility in DATE was very difficult , because large groups of fighters were trying to break through from ORG , via the plain , to mountains in the south of GPE . At DATE the OC of the Western Zone Alignment issued an operation order to destroy these groups before they joined up with their supporters in the mountains . He further stated :", "\u201c From Shamanov I learnt that a large group of fighters , having escaped from ORG , had entered ORG . Shamanov ordered me to conduct a special operation in LOC in order to detect and destroy the fighters .", "I drew up a plan of the special operation , which defined units of isolation , units of search , rules of fire in case of enemy fire , positions of ... roadblocks ... CARDINAL roadblocks were envisaged \u2013 one at the exit towards LOC , another \u2013 towards ORG . ... The involvement of aviation was foreseen should the situation deteriorate . The artillery actions were planned ... in advance in order to target the possible bandit groups ' retreat routes and the lines of arrival of reserves to assist the besieged groups .

I did not know the number of fighters in the village , so I ordered that the search be carried out by previously determined groups of special forces from the interior troops , without artillery or aviation support . If there were few fighters , they could be destroyed by the search groups . If their number was substantial , they could be destroyed by tanks shooting directly at specific points , i.e. by pinpoint attacks . And if it was a very big bandit grouping , then it would be impossible to avoid the use of artillery and aviation , because otherwise the personnel losses would be too high .", "The search groups moved out ... they were attacked ... and I ordered them to retreat . CARDINAL group could not withdraw ... Realising that the use of artillery and aviation could not be avoided , I ordered colonel NORP to organise evacuation of the civilians from the village , which he did through the head of the village administration . For that purpose colonel NORP used a vehicle equipped with loudspeakers , through which he was able to inform the population of the houses on the edge of the village about the need to leave . The civilians were leaving the village through the pre - established roadblocks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Major - General Nedobitko then proceeded to describe in detail the fighting on DATE of the operation . On DATE the army used artillery , tanks and a mine - launcher .

When asked if his troops had prevented civilians from leaving through the eastern roadblock , he replied that he did not prevent it , but that the main exit route was through the checkpoint at the western side , i.e. towards ORG . At that checkpoint , servicemen from ORG and ORG checked those leaving the village for possible involvement in the illegal armed groups .", "DATE . The investigator asked what might have been different had the village administration informed the federal forces that the group of fighters in the village was very large . The Major - General responded that he would have allowed the civilians to leave through both roadblocks , as had been done in ORG . But once CARDINAL of his search groups was trapped in the village and had sustained casualties , he could not abandon them and had to do everything possible to save them .

CARDINAL air - ground controllers were questioned . CARDINAL of them , whose identity was not disclosed by the Government , testified that he was employed as a forward air - controller for fighter jets .

The expert report concluded that the actions of the officers of the internal troops involved in the special operation to eliminate illegal armed groups in ORG on DATE were in conformity with ORG and ORG .

The administration and the population of the village were informed about the need to leave the area of the operation and the necessary time was provided for this . A roadblock was established at the village 's western exit , equipped with a filtration point and manned by servicemen from ORG and ORG , located away from the area of the combat operations . The report further suggested that the losses could have been further minimised if additional time had been allocated for the civilians ' departure . However , that same time could have been used by the fighters to prepare more thoroughly for defence of the village , which could have entailed additional losses among federal forces . Finally , the experts reported that it was not possible to reach any definite conclusions about what had prevented the village 's entire population from leaving safely , but that it was probably the fighters .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL roadblocks were established to control the exit . At TIME the artillery proceeded with pinpoint strikes at the clusters of enemy resistance , namely at the edges of the village and in the centre near the mosque . ORG aviation was then deployed .

The majority of civilian injuries were sustained on DATE in the centre of the village , where the fiercest fighting between federal forces and fighters occurred . The command corps of the operation took all possible measures to organise the local population 's departure , which had been disrupted by the actions of fighters who stormed and occupied houses , using civilians as \u201c human shields \u201d . The fighters ' fierce resistance and numerical superiority , as well as a real danger that they would break through the federal forces ' lines toward the mountains , forced the command corps to use aviation and artillery . The strikes were directed at the fighters ' positions . Aviation and artillery were heavily used at the initial stage of the operation on DATE , which caused a massive departure of the local population . Thus , civilians were caught in cross - fire between fighters and federal forces , which explained the heavy losses . As a result of the federal forces ' dynamic action , the majority of the group was destroyed , the village was liberated and the remaining members of the group were dispersed .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under such circumstances the investigation concluded that the command corps ' actions were absolutely necessary to eliminate the danger to society , the state , and to the lives of servicemen and civilians .
