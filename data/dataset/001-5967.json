He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer working with ORG , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE , GPE . The Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE around TIME the applicant was arrested under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) by a military patrol accompanied by an officer of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The applicant was brought to ORG in GPE where he was questioned about his involvement in serious paramilitary activity including the abduction and murder of an individual .", "On TIME CARDINAL DATE an application was made to the Secretary of ORG for an extension order under section PERSON ) of the CARDINAL Act , extending the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE . Notice of the application was given to the applicant , who consulted his lawyer on the terms of the application . No representations were made by the applicant to the Secretary of ORG . The application was granted by the Secretary of ORG .", "At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was given notice that a further application had been made to the Secretary of ORG for an extension order for a further period of TIME in order to check an alibi statement which the applicant had advanced during interview and to await the results of forensic tests . No representations were made by the applicant to the Secretary of ORG , who granted the extension requested .", "On DATE at TIME the applicant was released without charge . His period of detention from arrest was DATE , TIME and TIME .", "While in detention the applicant was never brought before any judicial authority . Throughout the period of detention the applicant was able to have access to a solicitor including before the start of each interview . The applicant saw his solicitor on CARDINAL occasions during his detention . His detention during the first TIME was regularly reviewed by senior police officers not directly involved in the case as required by LAW and LAW issued under LAW of GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE .", "The applicant has drawn attention in his observations in reply to those of the Government to his claim that police officers made intimidating and abusive remarks about his solicitor during his detention and to the fact that she was subsequently murdered on DATE . The applicant also criticises the austerity of the holding conditions in FAC where he was detained .", "In its PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , the ORG held that there had been a violation of LAW in the case of all CARDINAL applicants , who had been detained under LAW of the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE , which was the predecessor provision of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . The applicants had been held for periods ranging DATE and QUANTITY - and - a - half hours and DATE and TIME without being brought before a judicial authority . The ORG found that even the shortest of the periods of detention , namely DATE and TIME , fell outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by the first part of LAW . In the ORG \u2019s view , the undoubted fact that the arrest and detention of the applicants were inspired by the legitimate aim of protecting the community as a whole from terrorism was not on its own sufficient to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of LAW .", "Following that judgment , GPE informed the Secretary General of ORG on DATE that the ORG had availed themselves of the right of derogation conferred by LAW to the extent that the exercise of powers under section CARDINAL of LAW might be inconsistent with the obligations imposed by LAW . Part of that declaration reads as follows :", "\u201c ... Following [ the PERSON and Others judgment ] , the Secretary of ORG for ORG informed ORG on DATE that , against the background of the terrorist campaign , and the over - riding need to bring terrorists to justice , the ORG did not believe that the maximum period of detention should be reduced . He informed ORG that the Government were examining the matter with a view to responding to the judgment . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG further informed ORG that it remained the Government \u2019s wish , if it could be achieved , to find a judicial process under which extended detention might be reviewed and where appropriate authorised by a judge or other judicial officer . But a further period of reflection and consultation was necessary before the ORG could bring forward a firm and final view . Since the judgment of CARDINAL DATE as well as previously , the Government have found it necessary to continue to exercise , in relation to terrorism connected with the affairs of GPE , the powers described above enabling further detention without charge , for periods of DATE , on the authority of the Secretary of ORG , to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation to enable necessary enquiries and investigations properly to be completed in order to decide whether criminal proceedings should be instituted . To the extent that the exercise of these powers may be inconsistent with the obligations imposed by ORG have availed themselves of the right of derogation conferred by LAW and will continue to do so until further notice ... \u201d", "In a further notice dated DATE the GPE informed the Secretary General that a satisfactory procedure for the review of detention of terrorist suspects involving the judiciary had not been identified and that the derogation would therefore remain in place for as long as circumstances require .", "The DATE Act has been renewed DATE ever since .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

All in all there is a real threat that some terrorist activity will continue in GPE ... My conclusion is this , criminals with a terrorist or paramilitary disposition have the means to carry out attacks with explosives and firearms at any time ; furthermore , some of them have maintained an organisation which has structure and influence . \u201d", "As to the continuing use of the power of extended detention , the reviewer reiterated his view expressed in earlier reports , that he favoured judicial involvement in the decision - making process . He noted that the appropriate place to examine this issue thoroughly was in the Consultation Paper which ORG had presented to ORG in DATE .", "The Consultation Paper proposed judicial participation in applications for extension . In their submissions in the instant case , the Government indicated that they envisage the introduction of legislation to include provisions for a form of judicial involvement in extensions of detention .", "An analysis of court remedies relevant to arrest and detention under the prevention of terrorism legislation including section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act is contained in the above - mentioned ORG judgment ( pp .
