In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question , which was supported by evidence from witnesses . They attached importance to the fact that the offences had been committed in an organised criminal group . They further stressed that the applicant , if released , could easily abscond , having access to forged identity documents and being in contact with criminal groups abroad .

On DATE ORG decided to lift the applicant 's detention . The court held that his detention after DATE has lacked a legal basis and had therefore been in breach of procedural criminal law , as ordered and subsequently extended by courts that had not been competent to deal with the case .
