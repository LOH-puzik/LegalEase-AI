MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended LAW to allow ORG to postpone by DATE the levying of taxes on fuel imported into GPE . In TIME of the same day , the leader of the communist majority in ORG ( Mr ORG ) met with the deputy Speaker of ORG ( Mr ORG ) for a meal in the restaurant of a luxury hotel in PERSON . According to the applicant newspaper , sources which preferred to remain anonymous confirmed that the meal had been paid for by \u201c L. \u201d , a major importer of fuel into GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant newspaper published an article entitled \u201c On L. 's money , communists ORG and ORG had a big - time party ( chiolhan ) at ' PERSON \u201d . The article , which included pictures of the CARDINAL MPs next to the text , informed readers about the changes to LAW and about the profits which those changes would bring to a few big fuel importers who had links with ORG , thus allowing unfair competition . The article claimed that the postponement of tax payments constituted a form of credit by the ORG without interest or guarantees and rejected the explanation for the amendment given by a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL paragraph in the article read :", "\u201c One needs to note that , in TIME of the same day , at the ' PERSON ( ... ) hotel , the communists ORG and ORG , putting aside all proletarian decency [ pudoare ] , had a big - time party on the money of the sharks from ' L. ' . Could this party be a simple coincidence ? We do not know . \u201d", "The article went on to expose the legislative plans of ORG and the resulting benefits to big fuel importers at the expense of ordinary workers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Stepaniuc , the leader of the NORP parliamentary faction which had , at the time , CARDINAL votes out of a total of CARDINAL in ORG , lodged an action against the applicant newspaper , identifying the paragraph cited above as defamatory . He did not pay any court fee when lodging his complaint , nor did he appear in court at any stage of the proceedings or delegate any person to represent him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON , the then President of ORG , found that the applicant had essentially stated that Mr ORG \u201c had voted for laws in the interest of some private companies and then had a party on their money \u201d . It denounced the use of pure rumour as a basis for journalism and found that the applicant newspaper had acted in bad faith . The court took note of the \u201c vehement attack \u201d on Mr ORG , the large readership of the newspaper and the \u201c degree of moral and psychological suffering \u201d caused . In addition , the court found that PERSON ORG 's position as a member of ORG and leader of a parliamentary faction \u201c increased the degree of moral damage \u201d which led to the imposition of maximum liability .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted Mr ORG 's claim and ordered the applicant newspaper , pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of LAW , to publish an apology and to pay the plaintiff the maximum damages allowed by law and the court fees ( a total of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) , equal to MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) . According to the applicant newspaper , the court had conducted CARDINAL hearing which lasted TIME and no questions had been put to the applicant newspaper .", "CARDINAL . In its appeal the applicant newspaper submitted that the impugned phrases had amounted to value - judgments which could not be proved and that these opinions had been based on facts , namely the party which had taken place at the hotel in question on the date mentioned in the article , which was not disputed , and the modifications to the law adopted by ORG . Moreover , in view of the length of time that had passed after the publication of the article , it had been impossible for the applicant to prove that the persons had been seen at the hotel restaurant , where they had had a party , or verify the source of payment for it . The applicant newspaper also argued that Judge PERSON lacked independence and impartiality because he was a friend of Mr ORG and had been appointed President of ORG by the ORG parliamentary group . The majority of the defamation cases between PERSON and Mr Stepaniuc had been examined by him personally and his decisions were stereotyped and did not give sufficient reasons . In other defamation cases between LOC and representatives of the Government , Judge PERSON had always ruled in favour of the latter and had awarded them the maximum amount provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that the applicant newspaper had missed the time - limit for lodging its appeal against that judgment but went on to examine the substance of the case . It upheld the lower court 's judgment , finding that its decision had been lawful and reasoned . The court did not respond to the applicant 's complaint about the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON The hearing lasted DATE minutes and the applicant newspaper was not asked any questions .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal in cassation the applicant newspaper relied on LAW and on the distinction which the lower courts had failed to make between value - judgments and factual statements . Moreover , the courts had never heard evidence from the plaintiff , and had not taken into account his public - figure status , which should have limited the scope of interference with the applicant 's freedom of expression , or the special role played by the press in a democratic society . Finally , the lower courts had failed to respond to most of the points raised by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgments of the lower courts , finding that they had been lawful and corresponded to the evidence in the case . No comment was made about Judge PERSON 's alleged lack of impartiality .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the domestic law have been set out in this ORG 's judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no .
