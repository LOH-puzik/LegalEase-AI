The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a property , known as PERSON , in PERSON . She partly owns some of the ground floor shops , and entirely owns the house , from the rest of the ground floor and the basement to the top floors .", "CARDINAL . The property had been damaged during the Second World War and the applicant 's ancestors , from whom she inherited the property , had on DATE applied to ORG to obtain the necessary funding to have the property restored . At the time , the building consisted of DATE town house including a few rooms on the ground floor which were rented out as shops . DATE ORG had paid out a sum corresponding to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , for the premises excluding the shops in respect of which no amount had been paid as a consequence of undefined claims . According to the applicant the sums awarded covered expenses for required temporary works to secure the LOC , as had originally been claimed , and not the entire works to repair the whole of the property . While the Government contended that , despite the payments , the building was left in a state of neglect , the domestic courts acknowledged that the applicant had attempted to reconstruct the damaged area ( page CARDINAL of the Constitutional Court judgment of CARDINAL DATE )", "CARDINAL . In DATE the then ORG issued an order taking control of the property under title of possession and use , that is , a forced temporary taking of property subject to the payment of DATE compensation , known as a \u201c recognition rent \u201d , to the owners .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite this order , the applicant 's ancestors refused to hand over the keys of the building . Thus , the property was left unused until DATE when the building was forced open by the Government , by which time it had deteriorated considerably .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Government commenced works to repair the property with a view to using it as a cafeteria and offices in conjunction with the LOC situated nearby . The Government evicted the tenants of the shops on the ground floor which had been leased on the basis of controlled rents , and a hall in the upper floors was converted into a performance hall for small audiences . Subsequently a theatre restaurant was housed in the basement of the building and another floor was added to house the foundation for NORP patrimony \u201c PERSON \u201d , a Government foundation promoting national heritage , which also serves as a commercial company dealing in publications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a \u201c notice to treat \u201d by which the owner was informed that the compensation offered by way of recognition rent amounted to CARDINAL NORP Liras ( MTL \u2013 approximately QUANTITY ( EUR ) ) . The amount was based on the DATE rental value ( according to rent laws relating to renting of residences \u2013 not commercial LOC \u2013 in force at the time ) increased by PERCENT to allow for inflation . By a judicial letter of DATE the applicant 's ancestors rejected the offer and in DATE the Commissioner of Lands instituted compensation proceedings before ORG ( \u201c LAB \u201d ) . These proceedings were suspended sine die on DATE ( see Annex A for a detailed chronological list of hearings in the proceedings ) . Pending these proceedings , the applicant inherited the property of which she gained possession by public deed on DATE . The applicant submitted that even if these proceedings had been concluded , the ORG would have been unable to establish a fair rent reflecting market values , since it was bound by law to assess rent on the basis of DATE rental values .", "CARDINAL . After repairing the property the Government allocated it and entrusted its management to ORG ( \u201c MTMC \u201d ) , the organ of ORG which administers LOC . It rented the property to a number of commercial entities , including offices , cafeterias , reception halls , a restaurant and a publishing house . According to the Government , the economic income received by the MTMC per year amounted to QUANTITY and the Government had spent ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL restoring the building and meeting its maintenance costs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings in which she brought complaints under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW to the Convention . She complained that the property , estimated at the time to be worth ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , was not used for a public purpose , that she had not been offered fair compensation , that the proceedings pending before the LAB were taking an unreasonably long time to be decided and that she had been discriminated against vis - \u00e0 - vis other property owners who , unlike her , had their properties expropriated by outright purchase and not subject to the less favourable forced rents . She requested the court to grant adequate redress and to award damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) found for the applicant . It declared the taking null and void , as the property was not being used for a public purpose , and therefore contrary to the Convention . It further found a violation of the applicant 's right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time . It considered that the period to be taken into account started running on DATE , the date when the applicant 's right to compensation arose , and had not yet ended DATE . It noted that it had taken the Government DATE to issue a \u201c notice to treat \u201d without which compensation proceedings could not be initiated . This , together with the lack of initiative of the Commissioner of Lands to pursue those proceedings , was enough to allow it to conclude that the applicant had suffered a serious prejudice , incompatible with LAW , over DATE during which she had been left without compensation . It declared that it was not necessary to examine the Article CARDINAL complaint . The issue of payment of damages in respect of the violation of Article CARDINAL ( which depended on the value of the property ) was reserved .", "CARDINAL . The Government appealed against the above - mentioned judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that during the proceedings , lasting DATE , the judges were replaced several times and there had been numerous adjournments ( see Annex B for a detailed chronological list of hearings in the proceedings ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment in part . It held that there had been a violation of LAW to the LAW , in that a proper balance had not been preserved between the private interest and the public need . While it was true that the commercial purposes of the taking appeared to have superseded the original purpose , it was in the light of the compensation offered to the applicant ( ORG CARDINAL yearly rent for a property valued at approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and the fact that she had been deprived of her property for DATE , that she had been made to bear a disproportionate burden . The fact that the property had been refurbished by the ORG had little bearing on this conclusion , although it could be relevant in determining the compensation terms . It declared the Governor 's declaration of DATE null and void and ordered the Government to release the property . ORG , however , found that there had not been a violation of LAW of the length of the proceedings . It was true that the proceedings had been lengthy , the \u201c notice to treat \u201d having been issued DATE after the taking of the property and the proceedings before the LAB having not yet been concluded . However , the court noted that the time to be considered started running after the PERSON took effect in respect of GPE , namely on DATE ( when GPE introduced the right of individual petition ) and the applicant had failed to submit evidence of what had caused the delay after DATE . As to the LAW complaint , the court held that it had been misconceived , since the first - instance court had not examined it . As to the adequacy of compensation , it confirmed that the release of the property was an adequate remedy for the violation of LAW to the LAW , and the reservation of the issue of compensation by the first court was related to the Article CARDINAL complaint , which had not been upheld on appeal . However , it reserved any rights the applicant might wish to assert in respect of compensation for the \u201c possession and use \u201d of the LOC during the relevant period .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date following this judgment , the applicant obtained an eviction order against the Government . However , prior to its enforcement , on DATE , the ORG issued a fresh order , this time under title of public tenure in accordance with ORG ) Ordinance ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . Included in the taking were a number of shops and offices adjacent to PERSON , of which the applicant owned an undivided share together with third parties . The Government offered an DATE recognition rent of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , basing it on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) of the LAW ( see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law \u201d below ) , without indicating what portion of this amount was due for the applicant 's house , of which she was the sole owner .", "According to an architect 's valuation , the present DATE rental value of PERSON , excluding the other adjacent property , amounts to MTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) per year . The market value in the case of sale is estimated to be MTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ; the Government , however , estimate it to be only MTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged ordinary proceedings ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL - ATB CARDINAL ) , complaining that the new taking of the property under public tenure had been unlawful , as it was not permissible under LAW to take property by means of public tenure if it was not already being used by the Government .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the Government the eviction order was suspended pending the outcome of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On the date of introduction of this application the proceedings were still pending . ORG , in its ordinary jurisdiction , gave judgment in the case on DATE . The latter held that the taking of the property by public tenure had been ultra vires and was therefore null and void . An appeal was lodged on DATE and the case is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged further constitutional redress proceedings ( CARDINAL - ATB CARDINAL A ) , claiming that the taking of the property under public tenure breached Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . She claimed that the taking had not been in the public interest as the property was mainly being used for commercial purposes in relation to the Theatre , even though the Government had at their disposal other properties in the vicinity which could have served the same purpose . She also claimed that the inadequate compensation offered by the Government was arbitrary and not in accordance with the law . Compensation for the taking of a property under public tenure had to be calculated on the basis of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW and not section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) , which applied where property taken under \u201c public tenure \u201d was converted by absolute purchase ( see LAW below ) . Although it could be supposed that the ORG 's offer amounted to more than what was applicable by law , it did not reflect the real current market value , since the calculations had been based on rental values applicable in DATE . Even assuming that the offer comprised compensation for PERSON alone and not the adjacent properties , it still represented a fifth of its real value on the market ; therefore , it did not constitute adequate compensation and the applicant was being made to bear an excessive burden . She further claimed that the decision to take her property under public tenure had been arbitrary and discriminatory . At the time CARDINAL other properties had been taken under this title , as opposed to outright purchase . All the properties had already been in the possession of the ORG under a different title and were all related to slum clearance and housing projects , unlike the applicant 's . Finally , she complained that the taking was in breach of LAW , in that she was not given a fair hearing within a reasonable time , as she had no real and effective possibility of having the value of her property determined by a court . Notwithstanding the Constitutional Court judgment in her favour , in these circumstances the applicant remained without an effective remedy .", "CARDINAL . These proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for damage arising from the violation of LAW No . CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( FAC ) to determine the claim ( ORG ) for the compensation due for the violation of LAW No . CARDINAL in accordance with LAW ( \u201c COCP \u201d ) . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) rejected the applicant 's claim . It held that ORG had only reserved the matter of compensation in relation to LAW , of which no violation had been found by ORG , which had also found that declaring the taking null and void was a sufficient remedy for the violation of LAW No . CARDINAL . Thus , ORG judgment of DATE had been final , the applicant 's claims having been decided in their entirety , except for the reservation in respect of payment due for the possession and use of the land for the relevant period , which was subject to ordinary civil remedies . In consequence Article CARDINAL of the ORG did not apply to the present case .", "CARDINAL . That finding was confirmed on appeal by a judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for damage arising from the possession and use of the premises", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings against the Commissioner of Lands ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) for damage arising from the loss of possession and use of the premises in the light of ORG judgment of DATE finding a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . On DATE , the court having established that such a decision had not been taken by any other court and that the domestic courts had particularly stated that such a measure had to be sought before the ordinary domestic civil courts , took cognisance of the case and ordered the submission of the relevant evidence .", "CARDINAL .
