The first and second applicants are a married couple who were born in DATE and DATE . The third , fourth and fifth applicants are their children , a daughter and CARDINAL sons who were born in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants entered the GPE on DATE and applied for asylum . In the course of the proceedings on this asylum application , the first and second applicants were both interviewed by the GPE immigration authorities on , inter alia , their reasons for seeking asylum .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant gave the following account to the immigration authorities . He had become a member of ORG of GPE ( \u201c the PDPA \u201d ) in DATE . During his studies he had volunteered for guard duties at the ORG headquarters in GPE \u2019s fifth district . He had been charged with guarding homes against possible mujahideen attacks and checking traffic at intersections for illegal weapons .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to avoid being sent to the front during his compulsory military service the first applicant had , upon graduating as a construction engineer from ORG , voluntarily reported for duty in DATE to the security battalion of ORG in PERSON Now , a neighbourhood in GPE . After working there for DATE , the first applicant had requested a transfer to GPE \u2019s PERSON prison , where working conditions were better as they were indoors . The first applicant had been stationed in block CARDINAL , where political prisoners were detained . With CARDINAL other colleagues he had been responsible for guarding the block . He had had no contact with the CARDINAL prisoners for whom he had been responsible . His tasks had comprised cell patrol and occasional transport to hospital of prisoners who had fallen ill . He had never witnessed any illtreatment or torture by the NORP authorities of prisoners in that period . He had only once witnessed the ill - treatment of a prisoner , by a \u201c bashi \u201d ( leader ) .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the first applicant had applied for a transfer , which had been granted by the deputy head of the NORP security service ORG Dowlati / PERSON Dowlati ( \u201c ORG / WAD \u201d ) . At DATE the first applicant had started as a construction engineer within the ranks of ORG , which position he had held until DATE , when the mujahideen ended the ORG \u2019s communist regime in GPE . The first applicant had been employed in the buildings department of ORG of ORG , which had been renamed ORG in DATE . For this department / ORG the first applicant and his team of CARDINAL construction workers had constructed CARDINAL buildings for ORG , including an office building for ORG \u2019s FAC . He had also been responsible for the construction of CARDINAL ammunition depots .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had initially declared to the GPE authorities that the highest military rank he had attained was that of lieutenant - colonel , which he later changed to major . He further stated that he had been decorated CARDINAL times for his achievements .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had also been involved in the distribution of party propaganda , delivered to him by ORG of his ORG , with which he also had meetings DATE . In addition , he had organised courses for illiterate labourers .", "CARDINAL . After the fall of the ORG regime in DATE the applicants had fled to ORG , where the first applicant had continued to work as a construction engineer for the municipality until DATE . On DATE after the ORG had taken control of FAC \u2013 the applicants\u2019 home had been raided and searched by CARDINAL armed ORG fighters , who had found , inter alia , the first applicant \u2019s PDPA identity card , some of his medals , and a bayonet . On the suspicion that the applicants had been keeping weapons in their home , the ORG had arrested the first applicant and his brother .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had been incarcerated for DATE and had been questioned several times , during which he had disclosed in detail his past career in the ORG . A nephew or cousin of the first applicant had bribed the ORG commander concerned in order to obtain the applicant \u2019s release , which had been successful but on condition that the first applicant left GPE immediately . On TIME of his release , he was supposed to be executed . A number of his fellow detainees had indeed been executed , and according to the records , so was he \u2013 it was only because of the deal that had been struck with the commander that he had been secretly led away .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant further told the immigration authorities that he had heard from CARDINAL of his relatives in GPE that another nephew or cousin , who had also been a member of the ORG , had been killed in GPE in DATE by soldiers of ORG who were mujahideen or ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of her request for asylum , the second applicant submitted the following account . She had studied educational theory in GPE , after which she had been employed as a teacher at a high school in GPE from DATE . She had joined the women \u2019s organisation of the PDPA at the same time as taking up her duties as a teacher . She had stopped working when her first child was born . Out of fear of the mujahideen she had refrained from seeking employment during the time the family lived in GPE . She had once been beaten on the street for wearing a burka that was judged too short . This had occurred at the time her husband was incarcerated by the ORG . According to the second applicant , her husband had been ill - treated and subjected to forced labour during his incarceration .", "CARDINAL . After the first applicant had been interviewed on his asylum application , on DATE and DATE and DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) issued on DATE a notice of her intention ( voornemen ) to reject the first applicant \u2019s asylum application and to hold LAW against him . The applicant \u2019s asylum claim had been considered in the light of , inter alia , an official report ( ambtsbericht ) , drawn up on DATE by ORG on \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ; ORG ) and concerning in particular the question whether , and if so which , former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations . On the basis of this report , the GPE immigration authorities had adopted the position that LAW could be held against virtually every NORP asylum seeker who , with the rank of third lieutenant or higher , had worked during the communist regime for the ORG or its successor the ORG . In the notice of intent , the Deputy Minister analysed , on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international materials , the nature of the acts imputed to the first applicant in the framework of LAW as well as his individual responsibility under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the official country report of CARDINAL DATE as well as documentation from public international sources such as ORG , ORG , the Deputy Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the ORG , its lawless methods , the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations , and the \u201c climate of terror \u201d which it had spread throughout the whole of NORP society . The Deputy Minister considered that this \u201c climate of terror \u201d was also felt within the ORG itself . Staff members needed to prove their loyalty to the organisation on an almost DATE basis , and a failure to do so put them at risk of being removed from the ORG ; often this entailed death for the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister was of the opinion that the first applicant must have known of the criminal nature of the methods employed by the organisation where he had made a career . Furthermore , relying on the official report of CARDINAL DATE , the Deputy Minister excluded the possibility that the first applicant had remained ignorant of the cruel working methods of the ORG / WAD . She also did not attach credence to the first applicant \u2019s statement that he had not known of any atrocities committed in PERSON Prison , where he had performed guard duty for DATE . On this point , the Deputy Minister referred to a DATE report from ORG as well as to reports drawn up by ORG on this prison , from which it was obvious that PERSON was widely associated with heinous crimes .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister noted in this respect that the first applicant had initially declared that he had witnessed the ill - treatment of a prisoner by an assistant interrogator . No value was attached to the fact that the first applicant had subsequently corrected this initial statement and had submitted that this had concerned an incident amongst detainees . The Deputy Minister considered that the first applicant had had every reason to change his statements into more favourable ones once he learned of the investigation against him to assess whether LAW applied to him . The Deputy Minister also noted that the first applicant \u2019s initial statements had been very detailed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister further noted that the first applicant had been granted permission , after DATE of working as a guard in PERSON Prison , to be transferred to a department more suited to his professional profile . According to the Deputy Minister , this meant that the first applicant \u2019s loyalty must have been found proven beyond any doubt , considering that he had been given his position with the ORG after only a relatively short time in PERSON , that the new position opened up opportunities to be promoted to ( senior ) officer , and that it enabled the first applicant to enter and study several if not many of the ORG \u2019s buildings . The Deputy Minister concluded that there were serious reasons for considering that the first applicant had committed human rights violations , at least during his time in PERSON Prison .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account , inter alia , an anonymised official report drawn up by ORG on DATE ( DPC / AM CARDINAL ) , the Deputy Minister further found it highly implausible that during his DATE of experience as a construction engineer for the ORG the first applicant would not have become aware of certain uses for which ORG buildings had been designed , or at least of to what use they had de facto been put . As torture was systemic in ORG interrogation centres , it should be considered impossible that persons belonging to the higher management of the ORG had not been involved in this or would have been unaware of it . By reaching the rank of lieutenant - colonel the first applicant had entered the higher echelons of the ORG / WAD . Further taking into account that the first applicant had been decorated for his achievements and that he had continued performing his duties until DATE of the communist regime , the Deputy Minister reached the conclusion that the first applicant \u2019s competence and loyalty must have been beyond doubt . Furthermore , due to the applicant \u2019s involvement with ORG , the Deputy Minister concluded that the first applicant must have been aware of human rights violations being committed . With reference to anonymised official reports of DATE ( DPC / AM DATE ) and DATE ( DPC / AM CARDINAL ) drawn up by ORG , the Deputy Minister considered as regards the political affairs departments that , in the relevant part , their main task had been to guarantee continued loyalty to the NORP communist regime by means of the reporting of dubious behaviour of individuals to the ORG . Political affairs departments cooperated closely with the ORG in providing them with information .", "CARDINAL . These considerations led the Deputy Minister to conclude that the first applicant \u2019s personal participation in the human rights violations attributed to ORG was an established fact . Considering the reputation of PERSON Prison and the first applicant \u2019s denial of any human rights violations , the Deputy Minister could not attach any credence to the first applicant \u2019s statements . She found that the first applicant had failed in making plausible ( aannemelijk maken ) DATE on the basis of objective sources or any other means \u2013 his stated ignorance of human rights violations by the ORG / WAD . In terms of the first applicant \u2019s activities for the ORG , the Deputy Minister considered that the first applicant had , for a long time , been of service , albeit in an accessory capacity , to the ORG , and that it would thus not have been able to perform its tasks without the first applicant \u2019s efforts . The Deputy Minister also found that the first applicant had supported the activities of ORG ; although this department had not committed any atrocities itself , it had been an important element in the ORG apparatus .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on the notice of intent on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the first applicant \u2019s asylum application , confirming the reasoning as set out in her notice of intention of DATE and rebutting the first applicant \u2019s written comments . Disagreeing with the first applicant , she considered that the official report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) which to a great extent lay at the basis of her decision , could not be seen as an isolated document , but rather as the product of thorough research based on objective sources . The Deputy Minister attached more credence to the report than the first applicant \u2019s unfounded rebuttals .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister further dismissed the first applicant \u2019s argument that he had been too remotely connected to the human rights violations attributed to specific departments of the ORG / WAD during his time as an engineer in that organisation . Relying on ORG \u2019s \u201c The Exclusion Clauses : Guidelines on their LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the official report of CARDINAL DATE , it was held in this respect that merely supporting an organisation like the ORG may in itself suffice to render applicable LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE sitting in GPE was rejected on DATE . ORG analysed the first applicant \u2019s accountability for the impugned human rights violations on the basis of the prescribed and so - called \u201c personal and knowing participation \u201d test .", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u201c knowing \u201d element , ORG held that the Deputy Minister had not erred in imputing knowledge of the human rights violations committed by ORG to the first applicant in the way she had . In this context ORG found that the official reports issued by ORG , which lay to a great extent at the basis of the Minister \u2019s decision , had been drafted in an unbiased manner , were accurate and objective , and provided the required insight in the relevant information , and therefore that the Minister had been entitled to rely on them . It further found that the first applicant had failed to furnish adequate evidence in support of his allegation that the official report of CARDINAL DATE was inaccurate and that it could not be assumed that he had knowledge of the human rights violations committed in PERSON Prison .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to the ORG , ORG reiterated that according to codified policy DATE LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) \u2013 this notion included , besides personal commission of the impugned human rights violations by the person concerned , the facilitation of the said crimes . Facilitation was defined as a substantial positive effect by means of the person \u2019s conduct on how these crimes had been committed , or a lack of such conduct in preventing these crimes from being committed . ORG found that the first applicant had facilitated the human rights violations committed by the ORG / WAD by having voluntarily chosen to work as a guard in ORG and his subsequent request DATE also made voluntarily \u2013 to start working for the NORP / WAD . In these circumstances ORG concluded that the first applicant had facilitated DATE and thus personally participated in \u2013 the human rights violations attributed to the ORG , despite his having been stationed in PERSON Prison as a conscript rather than as a professional soldier .", "CARDINAL . Considering that LAW did not guarantee a right of residence , ORG also dismissed the first applicant \u2019s argument that the Deputy Minister had erred by not examining his asylum account under that provision .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , which quashed ORG judgment on DATE . As regards ORG finding in relation to LAW held that the Deputy Minister should , wherever possible , avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker is refused a residence permit but can not be expelled to his / her country of origin for reasons based on LAW . For that reason , the decision should demonstrate that the Deputy Minister had examined whether LAW would lastingly ( duurzaam ) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned . This , the ORG found , the Deputy Minister had failed to do in the present case , for which reason it quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case to the Deputy Minister \u2019s successor , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ) for a fresh decision .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was once more interviewed by the immigration authorities on DATE , after which , on DATE , the Minister issued the first applicant with a notice of her intention to reject his asylum application . The Minister reached the same conclusions , based in the relevant part on the same grounds , as the Deputy Minister had reached in her notice of intent of DATE and subsequent decision of DATE in relation to the first applicant \u2019s knowing and personal participation in human rights violations attributed to his former employer \u2013 the NORP / WAD \u2013 and consequent application of LAW against him . The Minister to a large extent used as a basis for her notice a book by a Professor Dr. PERSON entitled \u201c The Pulicharki Prison . A NORP Inferno in GPE \u201d . Prof . PERSON had been detained in PERSON Prison for a considerable time during the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to LAW , the Minister considered , in so far as relevant , that the first applicant had not furnished the required substantial grounds in support of a stated real risk of treatment contrary to LAW in case of his expulsion to GPE . The first applicant \u2019s fear of the mujahideen , the ORG and/or other armed groups not belonging to the Government persecuting the intellectual classes in GPE , based on the first applicant \u2019s background as a former ORG member and former employee of ORG , was dismissed by the Minister as based on mere suspicions . The Minister noted in this regard that the first applicant had declared , during the interview held with him on DATE , that he did not know of anyone specifically looking for him . It was further held that the killing of the first applicant \u2019s nephew or cousin by NORP State agents because of his past support of the communist regime did not constitute an individual fact or circumstance relevant to the first applicant \u2019s claim under LAW and that , furthermore , the source of the said information \u2013 a relative of the first applicant residing in GPE \u2013 was unreliable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister made reference to an official report drawn up by ORG in DATE , according to which former NORP communists and those associated with the communist regime , including former ORG personnel , possibly ran a risk of human rights violations in GPE . She stressed , however , that this did not mean that every person meeting these criteria would run a risk of treatment contrary to LAW upon his / her return to GPE . The Minister underlined in this regard the fact that until DATE the first applicant had not experienced any problems caused by his membership of the PDPA , his past activities for the ORG , or his political convictions after the fall of the communist regime in DATE . The first applicant \u2019s argument that he would run a greater risk of kidnappings and robberies due to his fellow countrymen \u2019s perception of him as a rich person upon his return to GPE was dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted written comments on the notice of intent on DATE . By a decision of DATE , the Minister once more rejected his asylum application . The Minister fully endorsed the reasons for the rejection as set out in the notice of intent and , in addition thereto dismissing the first applicant \u2019s written comments held , in the relevant part , the following .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had , inter alia , argued that block CARDINAL of ORG , where he had worked , had not fallen under the responsibility of the ORG / WAD and had been located in a separate building , hence away from the human rights violations allegedly committed in blocks CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The first applicant had relied on an ORG report in this regard . The Minister held that no support for such a distinction between blocks CARDINAL and CARDINAL on the one hand and block CARDINAL on the other in terms of the commission of human rights violations could be found in the literature and reports written about PERSON Prison . The first applicant also , unsuccessfully , advanced a number of inconsistencies in the book by Prof . PERSON .", "CARDINAL . With reference to ORG official report of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim that he had not been involved in human rights violations committed by the ORG , having regard to his position as a construction engineer in the said organisation . It was found that all officers of the ORG had been involved in its more sinister departments and hence were responsible for the interrogation , torture and execution of suspects . The Minister further considered that , pursuant to the case - law of ORG , she was entitled to rely on the official report as accurate and complete , and that this was not altered by the fact that other reports did not confirm certain findings reached in the official report .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the first applicant had argued that when the Minister had held that the applicants had not experienced any problems in GPE DATE , she had failed to acknowledge that the applicants had been living in GPE , which had been a safe haven for former communists during that particular period of time . According to the first applicant , the Minister had also failed to acknowledge that he had experienced problems in DATE . He had further submitted that his brother had held a high position during the communist regime . The Minister , however , considered that none of these arguments constituted concrete and individual circumstances justifying the acceptance of the existence of a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW upon the first applicant \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected by ORG of The GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch by judgment of DATE . Limiting itself to an analysis of the matter under LAW , ORG held that the first applicant had not sufficiently established that as a result of his membership of the ORG and past activities for ORG he would run a real and serious risk of treatment contrary to the said provision upon his return to GPE . The court underlined that the first applicant had declared , in an interview held with the immigration authorities on DATE , that nobody in GPE was specifically looking for him . Although the first applicant claimed that he had been detained by the ORG in the past , it had not been established that the ORG would still be looking for him or that he had remained an object of the ORG \u2019s negative attention . ORG emphasised in this regard that the first applicant \u2019s detention had taken place during a different political situation .", "CARDINAL . While ORG accepted that , as set out in an official report of ORG of DATE , individuals associated with the former NORP communist regime , including the ORG , ran a possible risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW upon their return to that country , it held that this did not mean that everyone associated with the former regime ran a real and serious risk of that nature . ORG noted that the first applicant \u2019s former position in ORG could not be regarded as one of the high posts mentioned in this official report . The killing of the first applicant \u2019s nephew or cousin and that the second applicant would have had a western lifestyle did not alter ORG finding either .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s further appeal was rejected on DATE by ORG on summary reasoning . It found that the further appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling and that having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , no further reasoning was called for , as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG issued a notice of intention to declare the first applicant an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) in accordance with article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW , following the decision to hold LAW against him in the asylum procedure . This intention was not followed by an actual decision to impose an exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was interviewed by the immigration authorities on DATE and DATE . On DATE the Deputy Minister issued a notice of her intention to reject the second , third and fourth applicant \u2019s asylum application . The latter CARDINAL applicants , being minors , were included in the second applicant \u2019s application for asylum throughout the proceedings . In so far as relevant , it was held that the second applicant \u2019s motives for asylum were to a large extent dependent on the first applicant \u2019s motives . The first applicant \u2019s application having been rejected , the Deputy Minister considered that the second applicant \u2019s asylum claims were to be assessed on their own merits .", "CARDINAL . Referring to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of DATE , the Deputy Minister held that there was no general rule for assessing the risk which family members of individuals sought by the ORG might run in GPE . As a rule of thumb , it could be assumed that such family members would only risk being detained by the ORG as a means of forcing the person concerned to report to the authorities if that person was present in GPE , or was at least suspected to be . Even if it was to be assumed that the first applicant was being sought by the ORG , he had not been in GPE since DATE and , by his own admission , was even believed by the ORG to have been executed . It was unlikely , therefore , that the second applicant would attract the ORG \u2019s attention on account of her husband \u2019s activities .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second applicant \u2019s claim that she had been threatened by the ORG during the search of the family house in GPE , the Deputy Minister considered that any threats uttered had rather been directed at the CARDINAL men \u2013 the first applicant and his brother DATE than at the women present . While it was regrettable that the second applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment after her burka had been judged to be of insufficient length , the Deputy Minister noted that this had been a single occurrence and that there were no indications that the ORG continued to have an interest in her .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW the Deputy Minister considered that the second applicant had not advanced the required substantial grounds for believing that she would run a foreseeable , real and personal risk of treatment contrary to said provision . The single incident about the burka was insufficient for the second applicant to be able to rely on LAW successfully . In this respect the Deputy Minister also had regard to the fact that the second applicant had lived under ORG rule for a relatively long period of time , but other than the aforementioned incident she had not reported any further occurrences relevant in terms of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister , furthermore , considered that the second applicant was to be excluded from the so - called \u201c policy of protection for certain categories \u201d ( categoriaal beschermingsbeleid ) , in force for NORP nationals at that time . The Deputy Minister considered in this regard that the rejection of the asylum application of the second applicant \u2019s husband on the basis of LAW gave rise to a contraindication against the issuing of residence permits to his relatives , since the admittance of the second applicant and the applicants\u2019 children would in all likelihood bring about a protracted de facto stay in the GPE of the second applicant \u2019s husband .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant submitted written comments on the Deputy Minister \u2019s notice of intent on DATE . She was once more interviewed by the immigration authorities on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG , the successor to the Deputy Minister , issued a fresh notice of his intention to reject the second applicant \u2019s asylum application , due to a relevant change of circumstances in GPE .", "CARDINAL . While endorsing the Deputy Minister \u2019s finding as to the existence of a contraindication against the second applicant , the Minister went on to consider that , pursuant to a ORG official report of DATE , the general situation in GPE no longer required the keeping in place of a categorial protection policy . Moreover , after the fall of the ORG regime , the second applicant no longer had a reason to fear persecution at their hands , and DATE as also appeared from the official report of CARDINAL DATE the position of women in NORP society had greatly improved . In this latter context , the Minister considered that gender in itself was not a conclusive factor in an assessment of the risk of persecution in GPE . It was for the second applicant to make a plausible case for believing that she had a well - founded fear of persecution on the basis of her personal circumstances , seen against the background of the general situation in GPE . It was found that she had failed to do so . In this context , the Minister held that the second applicant had always lived in major cities in GPE , where the situation for women had improved , as opposed to the situation in the countryside . The Minister saw no reason to assume that the second applicant , if expelled to GPE , would not again settle in a major city .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister further considered that the second applicant \u2019s membership of the women \u2019s organisation of the ORG , her husband \u2019s membership of the ORG , or his past activities for ORG were not reason enough in themselves to grant the second applicant asylum , since according to the aforementioned official report there were no indications that people had to fear persecution in GPE for the sole reason that they had previously had ties to the communist regime .", "CARDINAL . After receiving the second applicant \u2019s comments on this notice of intent , the Minister rejected the asylum application on DATE , adding that as the second applicant had not demonstrated that she was or had ever been the object of negative attention from the side of either the mujahideen or the ORG , she had failed to establish that she would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected on DATE by ORG of the GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . It agreed with the Minister that the second applicant had failed to establish a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if she was returned to GPE . Her further appeal to ORG was rejected on DATE on summary reasoning . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fifth applicant was born in the GPE to the first and second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant submitted a fresh application for asylum and was interviewed on this new request on DATE . Following a notice of intention notified on DATE , this application was rejected by the Deputy Minister of ORG , again holding LAW against the first applicant . This decision became final after ORG of The Hague had rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE , entailing that the first applicant was under an obligation to leave the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister for Security and ORG , noting that the first applicant had not left the GPE and cancelling the intention of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , issued a notice of intention to impose an entry ban ( inreisverbod ) for DATE on the first applicant . No information has been submitted whether this intention has been followed by an actual decision to impose an entry ban .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , also the second applicant had made a fresh asylum application , also on behalf of her minor children , namely the fourth and fifth applicants . Following a successful appeal to ORG of The GPE against the initial refusal of this request and on the basis of a new policy having entered into force on CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) granted on DATE the second , fourth and fifth applicant temporary residence permit for asylum purposes ( verblijfsvergunning asiel voor bepaalde tijd ) , valid from CARDINAL DATE until DATE . In the letter of CARDINAL DATE notifying this decision , the Minister stated in respect of the adult son ( the third applicant ) that , in so far as he wished to apply for asylum in reliance on the new policy ( ORG ) that there existed a contraindication , namely his criminal record in the GPE , which would be taken into account in the examination of a possible future application .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the third applicant , who had come of age , had made an asylum application on his own behalf which was rejected on DATE by the Minister , who found that , given that he had been convicted twice in the GPE of acts of public violence , the third applicant presented a danger to public order . The Minister rejected the third applicant \u2019s argument that , being a westernised young man and given the deteriorated general security situation in GPE , he would be exposed to a risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if removed to GPE . In so far as the third applicant relied on LAW , the Minister considered that it was open for the third applicant to apply for a residence permit on that basis . The third applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was rejected on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . No information has been submitted as to whether he has sought to challenge the judgment of DATE by lodging a further appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the third applicant made another asylum application , which was rejected by the Minister on DATE . The third applicant \u2019s appeal and accompanying request for a provisional measure were rejected on DATE by the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . To the extent that it was accepted that the fresh application was based on relevant newly emerged facts and circumstances ( \u201c nova \u201d ) warranting reconsideration of the initial rejection as required by CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , the provisional - measures judge did not find that the third applicant qualified for asylum on the basis of the alleged deterioration in the general security situation in GPE or that , for this reason , he would be exposed to a real risk of treatment prohibited by LAW if he were removed to GPE . The provisional - measures judge also accepted the Minister \u2019s decision , given the third applicant \u2019s criminal record , not to grant him a temporary residence permit for asylum purposes on the basis of the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE to grant such a permit to the second , fourth and fifth applicant under the new policy which had entered into force on DATE . In so far as the applicant relied on LAW the judge considered that given the strict separation in the system under LAW CARDINAL between an asylum - based application for a residence permit and a regular application ( reguliere aanvraag ) for a residence permit , it was considered that , if the applicant wished to reside in the GPE on the basis of his family life within the meaning of LAW , he should make a regular application for a residence permit based on his rights under LAW . The provisionalmeasures judge lastly noted that , in the event that the GPE authorities proceeded with the third applicant \u2019s removal from the GPE , he could avail himself of legal remedies to challenge this . There is no indication in the case file that the third applicant availed himself of the opportunity to lodge a further appeal against this judgment with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the third applicant made a regular application for a residence permit on the basis of his family life with his parents and siblings in the GPE . This application was rejected by the Minister on DATE . The Minister noted at the outset that the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . Such a visa entitles the holder to enter the GPE in order to apply for a residence permit for a stay exceeding DATE . The Minister further noted that the third applicant did not fall within CARDINAL of the defined categories of persons who are exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa . As to the third applicant \u2019s reliance on LAW , the Minister noted that his mother and CARDINAL younger siblings held a temporary residence permit for asylum purposes and that his father held no residence permit . Although the Minister accepted that there was family life between the third applicant and each of his parents and his siblings , and that there were objective obstacles to the exercise of family life between the third applicant and his mother and siblings outside the GPE , the Minister did not find that there was a positive obligation under LAW grant the third applicant a residence permit on that basis . In reaching this finding , the Minister considered that a balance had to be struck between , on the one hand , the applicant \u2019s personal interests and , on the other , public interest considerations . The presence of an objective obstacle was a weighty but not necessarily a decisive factor in this balancing exercise , which also includes other factors such as the way in which family life was conducted in the country of origin , whether the minimum income requirements under the applicable immigration rules were met , public order considerations , and the situation in the country of origin . Noting that his father had been refused asylum because LAW had been held against him , and that no obstacle based on LAW for his removal to GPE had been found in the asylum proceedings , that the third applicant had been denied asylum on account of his criminal convictions in the GPE , that the third applicant was an adult , and that his submissions did not disclose that there would be \u201c more than normal emotional ties \u201d between his and his mother and siblings , that his mother and siblings lived separately from his father , and that the third applicant himself lived a wandering existence , staying occasionally with his mother and often with friends , and that also his ties with his father did not go beyond the normal ties between a parent and an adult son , the Minister concluded , in particular having regard to the third applicant \u2019s criminal record in the GPE , that public interest considerations outweighed the third applicant \u2019s personal interests . This decision also constituted a return decision ( terugkeerbesluit ) . The third applicant was informed that he was now under the obligation to leave the GPE within TIME , failing which he would be eligible for removal , and that the submission of an objection ( bezwaar ) to the decision would not have any suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant submitted an objection to this decision to the Minister and requested ORG of The GPE to issue a provisional measure allowing him to await the outcome of the objection proceedings in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE granted the third applicant \u2019s request for a provisional measure , finding that it did not appear that , in his assessment , the Minister had taken into account - given the \u201c guiding principles \u201d formulated in the judgments of ORG August CARDINAL in the case of GPE and DATE in the case of GPE - the duration of the third applicant \u2019s stay in the GPE , the nature and seriousness of the criminal offences of which the third applicant had been convicted , the time that had elapsed since these offences were committed and the third applicant \u2019s behaviour in that period , the social ties established by the third applicant in the GPE , and the possibility of return to GPE . Considering that the Minister had attached decisive weight to the third applicant \u2019s criminal record without looking into the nature and seriousness of the offences concerned and without indicating what weight had been given to the other relevant circumstances on the basis of the \u2018 guiding principles \u201d , the provisional - measures judge concluded that it could not be said that the objection would not have a reasonable chance of success . Consequently , the provisional - measures judge granted the provisional measure and suspended the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE pending the outcome of the objection proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
