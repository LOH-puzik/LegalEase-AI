The explanatory report ( d\u00f4vodov\u00e1 spr\u00e1va ) on the amendment submitted with the bill suggested that the creation of the procedural category of participant in administrative proceedings had been in response to the existing practice whereby , in particular in the area of environmental protection , associations of citizens and associations of legal entities took part in proceedings . Due to the lack of an appropriate procedural framework , for practical reasons such associations had been given the status of parties to the proceedings . However , that was contrary to the rules concerning parties , because the rights and duties of such associations had not been decided upon in the proceedings .
