They were represented before the ORG by Mr P. ORG , of ORG . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The Mulhouse - Rhin - Mines outline development scheme , approved in a prefectoral order of DATE , made provision for the building of an industrial estate in the vicinity of FAC ( whose LOC are situated on land in the NORP municipalities of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the managing director of ORG ( whose memorandum and articles of association were drawn up before a notary on DATE ) submitted a project to the mayor of ORG for the development of industrial , business and service - sector activities on a site within the municipality \u2019s boundaries , adjoining FAC . On DATE ORG gave the mayor its consent for the sale to ORG of municipal land within the area covered by the project . It also gave its approval for , among other things , the municipality to undertake to waive its right of pre - emption over the land which the company intended to use , a special planning area ( zone d\u2019am\u00e9nagement concert\u00e9 \u2013 \u201c PERSON ) to be created on the site and the procedure for revision of the municipality \u2019s land - use plan ( plan d\u2019occupation des sols ) to be initiated .", "By notarial deeds of DATE ORG purchased various plots of land in GPE from the municipality .", "On DATE the town council decided to take steps to create a ZAC , to set in motion the appropriate procedure and to revise the land - use plan accordingly . A public consultation meeting was held on CARDINAL DATE about the proposal to create the ZAC . On DATE , in the light of the findings of the consultation process , the town council formally decided to create the PERSON .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG board of directors had adopted , confidentially , a general development plan in which it was proposed , in particular , to acquire additional land and build a third runway on the same site which the developers of the ORG industrial estate intended to use .", "On DATE ORG submitted its building project to the airport \u2019s board of directors . In a letter to the board dated DATE it had emphasised that the project would not hinder the development of the airport \u2019s activities .", "On DATE the board of directors decided to take the necessary steps to set aside the land it required in order to implement its development plan . On DATE it had decided to apply to the prefect of the d\u00e9partement of ORG to set in motion the procedure by which the development plan could be designated as a \u201c project in the public interest \u201d .", "In an order of CARDINAL DATE the prefect of ORG designated the development plan as a \u201c project in the public interest \u201d and served formal notice on the municipality of ORG to revise its land - use plan to take the project into account . As the mayor of ORG did not reply within the statutory time - limit , the prefect made an order on DATE for the revision of the land - use plan .", "After ORG board of directors had amended its development plan and the statutory DATE period had expired without the above - mentioned orders having been confirmed , the prefect of ORG made further orders on DATE ( designating the plan as a \u201c project in the public interest \u201d and serving formal notice on the mayor ) and DATE ( requiring the revision of the land - use plan ) .", "The municipality of ORG , ORG and ORG applied to ORG , which in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE set aside the decision taken by ORG board of directors on DATE and the prefect \u2019s orders of CARDINAL May and DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "Ruling on a preliminary objection as to admissibility lodged by ORG , the court held that ORG had an interest in seeking to have set aside the decision taken by ORG board of directors on DATE and the subsequent orders , on the ground that prior to that date the municipality of ORG had promised to sell it the land in question .", "As to the merits , the court pointed out that FAC was governed by the PERSON - Swiss treaty signed in GPE on DATE , which provided , among other things , for the building of CARDINAL runways and for the expropriation of CARDINAL ha of land ( Articles I and FAC to the treaty ) , and that under the treaty , although the airport \u2019s board was empowered to draw up plans to expand the airport , its exercise of that power was subject to the limits laid down in the treaty regarding both the airport \u2019s infrastructure and the maximum area of land to be expropriated . Noting that in the instant case the development plan adopted by the airport \u2019s board had exceeded those limits , the court set aside the decisions in issue .", "On DATE ORG board of directors decided to ask the governments concerned to revise the specifications appended to the PERSON - Swiss treaty of DATE in accordance with LAW , and to increase the maximum area that could be expropriated for use by the airport from CARDINAL ha to CARDINAL ha with a view to building a third runway .", "That proposal was agreed to in an exchange of notes ( on CARDINAL and DATE ) between ORG and ORG ; the agreement came into force on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the NORP President issued a decree publishing the agreement .", "On DATE the applicant companies applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat seeking to have the decree annulled . Observing that the ratification of the PERSON - Swiss treaty of DATE had been authorised by a law of CARDINAL DATE , they submitted that in accordance with LAW ( which provides that \u201c ... treaties or agreements ... entailing a financial commitment on the part of the State ... may be ratified or approved only by an LAW of ORG \u201d ) and with the principle that power to enact and amend legislation should be vested in the same authority , such an amendment required the legislature \u2019s intervention and could not be carried out by the simplified method of an exchange of notes . They added that the decree in issue and the agreement published in it contravened LAW ( by which \u201c amendments to the articles of association and specifications following a decision by CARDINAL majority of the serving members of the board may be effected by agreement between the CARDINAL Governments \u201d ) in that they went beyond the purpose of the simplified amendment procedure . The companies further submitted that the exchange of notes published by the decree in issue incorrectly stated that the requirements of paragraph CARDINAL of the specifications appended to the treaty had been satisfied . Whereas paragraph CARDINAL made the procedure laid down in LAW conditional on the production of a detailed description and estimate \u2013 entailing the acquisition by ORG of the land needed for the airport \u2013 a significant portion of the QUANTITY of land corresponding to the maximum area that could be expropriated had not been acquired by ORG . Lastly , they argued that the agreement in issue contravened the treaty \u2019s financial clauses . ORG", "The PERSON d\u2019Etat dismissed the application in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It pointed out that by the PERSON of DATE ORG had authorised the ratification of the PERSON - Swiss treaty of CARDINAL July DATE , which had from the outset provided for the possibility of extending the airport \u2019s LOC , and that ORG should therefore be regarded as having \u201c by that law authorised the expenditure associated with the development and operation of additional structures or facilities designed to compensate for the inadequacy of existing structures or facilities \u201d , so that there had been no breach of LAW . As regards the applicant ORG other submissions , the ORG d\u2019Etat held :", "\u201c Although the applicant companies submit that the agreement of CARDINAL and DATE has a broader purpose than the mere drawing up of an amendment to the specifications appended to the treaty of DATE and that , consequently , it could have not been concluded under the simplified procedure provided for in LAW , the choice of the means by which international treaties and agreements are to be concluded is indissociable from the conduct of diplomatic relations and , accordingly , can not be challenged in proceedings before the administrative courts .", "Nor is it the task of the ORG d\u2019Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , to review the assessment by ORG and ORG of whether the requirement to produce a detailed description and estimate , as laid down in paragraph CARDINAL of the specifications appended to the treaty , was satisfied and whether the expansion of FAC was necessary .", "Lastly , although the applicant companies criticised the content of the exchange of notes published by the impugned decree in relation to the provisions of the treaty of CARDINAL July DATE , it is not for the PERSON d\u2019Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , to rule on the validity of an international undertaking in relation to other international undertakings . \u201d", "\u201c The President of the Republic shall negotiate and ratify treaties .", "He shall be informed of all negotiations leading to the conclusion of an international agreement not subject to ratification . \u201d", "\u201c Peace treaties , commercial treaties and treaties or agreements relating to the organisation of international affairs , or entailing a financial commitment on the part of the ORG , or amending legislative provisions , or relating to the status of persons , or entailing the cession , exchange or acquisition of territory , may be ratified or approved only by an Act of ORG .", "They shall take effect only after having been ratified or approved .", "No cession , exchange or acquisition of territory shall be valid without the consent of the populations concerned . \u201d", "\u201c Treaties or agreements that have been lawfully ratified or approved shall , upon publication , prevail over Acts of ORG , subject , in respect of each agreement or treaty , to its application by the other party . \u201d", "\u201c The Minister for Foreign Affairs shall have sole responsibility for ensuring the ratification and publication of international treaties , agreements , protocols and regulations to which GPE is a signatory or by which GPE is bound .
