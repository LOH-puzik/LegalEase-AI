The applicant was born in DATE and lived in LOC .", "CARDINAL . NORP In TIME on DATE , responding to PERSON 's complaint about having been robbed , the police arrived in a bar and arrested the applicant , a minor at the material time , and PERSON , his acquaintance , and took them to the police station for questioning . The applicant explained that he knew nothing about the robbery and left the police station . It is unclear whether he was officially released .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was arrested when walking down a street . According to the applicant , he was seized by force by CARDINAL policemen dressed in civilian clothes , without any explanations . According to the police officers , they invited him for questioning concerning PERSON 's robbery and he swore at them and attempted to escape , making it necessary to arrest him by force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with refusal to comply with the lawful demands of the police officers , presented before FAC without his parents being informed or a lawyer being appointed , and sentenced to DATE administrative detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police formally initiated criminal proceedings concerning PERSON 's robbery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reviewed the applicant 's sentence after an objection from ORG , reduced it to DATE detention and ordered the applicant 's release . Subsequently ( on DATE ) the President of the NORP ORG of Appeal quashed the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE by way of supervisory review , having found that the applicant should not have been subjected to administrative detention as he was a minor . He did find , however , that the applicant 's malicious insubordination rendered him liable to a fine of CARDINAL hryvnias ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before his release on DATE , the applicant was questioned concerning PERSON 's robbery , in the presence of his mother and a lawyer appointed by the police , and confessed to having participated in the robbery .", "CARDINAL . Following his release , the applicant hired a new lawyer and retracted his confessions . He alleged that he had neither participated in , nor witnessed PERSON 's alleged robbery and that his previous confessions had been made under duress . He further explained that on DATE he had confirmed his confession in presence of his mother and the advocate because the police had threatened that otherwise he would not be released from detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was committed for trial on charges of robbery . On DATE the ORG remitted his case for additional investigation . The parties did not provide any further information concerning the outcome of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , while he was serving his administrative detention sentence he was severely ill - treated by police officers , who tried to make him confess to participating in ORG 's robbery . In particular , he was handcuffed to a radiator and beaten on the head and body with a plastic water bottle . On several occasions the applicant lost consciousness . As a result of the ill - treatment , on CARDINAL and DATE the applicant , who had not been given access to either a lawyer or his parents , wrote self - incriminating statements , dictated by the police . By way of evidence that he was so questioned , the applicant presented copies of his confession statements dated CARDINAL and DATE . These documents contained his and the law - enforcement officers ' signatures only ( no signatures of an advocate or a minor 's legal representative ) and a seal of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , no investigative actions in the applicant 's respect took place during his administrative detention .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he complained to PERSON and ORG that he had been ill - treated by the police , but he was denied referral to a forensic expert to assess his injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG agreed to provide the applicant with the necessary referral . On DATE the applicant underwent a forensic examination and was found to have minor bodily injuries . In particular , the expert found that the applicant suffered from abrasions and bruises on different parts of his body , a haematoma , situational neurosis , cephalalgia and a possible kidney contusion , which could have been sustained on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant received in - patient treatment for his injuries and stress in the GPE ORG . Subsequently ( in DATE ) the applicant also underwent medical treatment for depression and chronic pyelonephritis , conditions which , according to him , were caused by head and kidney injuries sustained at the hands of the police and related stress .", "CARDINAL . On various dates DATE and DATE the applicant 's mother complained about his ill - treatment to various authorities , including the ombudsman and the President of GPE , in various informal ways . However , it appears that no formal action followed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an official request with the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky ORG to institute criminal proceedings in respect of his ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor 's office refused to initiate the criminal proceedings , having found that there was no evidence of illtreatment . It noted , in particular , that on the morning of CARDINAL DATE the applicant had left the police station without authorisation and that at TIME on DATE he had refused to follow the police officers who invited him to report for questioning , had sworn at them , pushed them and attempted to escape . His arrest and the bringing of insubordination charges had therefore been justified . Moreover , during his detention the applicant had never requested medical assistance and upon his release he had signed a document stating that he had no claims against the police . No investigative measures in the applicant 's respect had been taken during the period of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Head of ORG of ORG conducted an internal investigation and concluded that there was no ill - treatment case to answer . In particular , the only force applied to the applicant had been during his arrest and in response to his attempt to escape . He further noted that during the applicant 's detention no investigative action had been taken in his respect . On DATE and DATE CARDINAL other internal investigations were carried out and similar conclusions were reached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky Prosecutor 's Office took a fresh decision refusing to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the applicant 's ill - treatment complaint . It noted that the applicant had fallen to the ground on several occasions while trying to escape . It made no conclusions , however , as to whether or not these falls were the cause of the applicant 's injuries . On the same date that decision was quashed by ORG and the case was remitted for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , having been notified of the decision of DATE in DATE , the applicant appealed against it before ORG . He noted , in particular , that the prosecutor 's office had not questioned him , his relatives or any witnesses to his arrest concerning the events in question . It also failed to respond to his allegation that there was no legal basis for the demand to appear for questioning and his ensuing arrest at TIME on DATE . If the police officers had wanted to question him about P. 's robbery , according to the applicable law they should have issued a summons and informed his parents . This procedure had not been complied with ; the police had unlawfully demanded that he follow them , so he should not have been convicted of insubordination . Further , the prosecutor 's office had not reacted to the fact that the applicant 's administrative detention had been unlawful as he had been a minor at the material time . In addition , the authorities had wrongly stated that no investigative action involving the applicant had been taken during his detention . In particular , on CARDINAL and DATE he had made self - incriminating statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky City Court annulled the decision of DATE . It stated , in particular , that the investigation had been perfunctory and that the prosecution had failed to establish the cause of the applicant 's injuries . It further noted that the allegation that the applicant had not been questioned concerning PERSON 's robbery during his detention contradicted the factual evidence contained in the case - file materials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the ORG again refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant 's ill - treatment allegations , relying on essentially the same arguments as above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively those decisions were set aside by ORG and ORG , and the case was remitted for further investigation . ORG noted , in particular , that the investigation had not determined what legal basis there had been for the police officers ' initial demand of DATE that the applicant report for questioning , or whether the applicant 's reaction vis - \u00e0 - vis the police necessitated his arrest and the use of force against him . Further , the authorities had not questioned the applicant or the medical expert who had examined his injuries and had not verified the police officers ' version that the applicant had fallen several times while trying to escape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also addressed a letter to the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky Prosecutor , alerting him that the investigation was perfunctory and CARDINAL - sided . In particular , it was largely based on the explanations given by the police officers , without any other measures being taken to establish the real facts . It further invited LOC to facilitate \u201c a proper and professional investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG took a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings , which was set aside by ORG on DATE and followed by a new refusal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Regional Forensic Experts Bureau re - assessed the applicant 's injuries as being of ' intermediate gravity ' . In particular , it concluded that his depressive disorders and pyelonephritis could be connected to a traumatic experience in DATE . It further concluded that , in view of their number and location , the injuries concerned could not have been sustained as a result of DATE . It was likely that the injuries at issue had been caused by multiple impacts with blunt objects , such as a fist , a foot or the like .", "CARDINAL . Following this assessment , on DATE the GPE ORG set aside the decision of DATE refusing to initiate criminal proceedings ( which had already been annulled by ORG on DATE ) and ordered further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky Prosecutor 's ORG refused to comply with the court 's instructions , finding that further to the annulment of the decision of DATE by ORG , it had already carried out additional investigations , and its last decision of DATE was valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Odessa Regional Prosecutor 's Office annulled that decision and ordered further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bilgorod - Dnistrovsky Prosecutor 's Office took a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings , relying essentially on the same arguments as in its previous refusals .", "CARDINAL .
