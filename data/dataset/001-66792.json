The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant used to work as a cashier and accountant in a stateowned company .", "CARDINAL . An audit of the company at DATE revealed a cash deficit of CARDINAL old NORP levs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was given a copy of the audit \u2019s final act , which contained the ORG opinion that , inter alia , during the period DATE she had deliberately made false entries in the accounting books and had thus misappropriated funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened a preliminary investigation in respect of the applicant and CARDINAL other employees of the company . It seems that the applicant became aware of the investigation soon after its opening . The case was sent for investigation to ORG . The prosecutor in charge of the case indicated a number of specific facts which the investigator had to establish and ordered that the investigation be completed within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , noting that no investigative steps had been taken until that moment despite its instructions of DATE , directed the investigator immediately to start working on the case and finalise the investigation within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was questioned several times . The investigation authorities also questioned a number of witnesses and gathered documents and other evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c CC \u201d ) with particularly aggravated misappropriation of funds in particularly large amounts , the commission of which had been facilitated by other offences ( making of official documents containing false information and abuse of office ) carrying a lesser penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG for a sixtyday extension of the timelimit for the completion of the investigation . On DATE ORG granted the extension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to extend the time - limit for the completion of the investigation with a further DATE . It stated that all witnesses had already been questioned and a vast amount of accounting and other documents relating to the applicant \u2019s criminal activity spanning DATE had been seized . A graphological expert report had been drawn up in respect of some of these documents . An accounting expert report was in the works , but would not be ready within the time - limit previously set for the completion of the investigation , because it required the processing of a large number of accounting documents . On DATE ORG acceded to this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator reformulated the charges against the applicant and notified her accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator allowed the applicant and her counsel to acquaint themselves with the case file .", "CARDINAL . DATE the investigator concluded his work on the case and sent the file to ORG with the proposal to commit the applicant for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the evidence thus far collected indicated that the misappropriation of funds allegedly committed by the applicant and by CARDINAL of her co - accused was not particularly aggravated . Moreover , in the meantime she had restored part of the money . Accordingly , it decided to prosecute the applicant for nonaggravated misappropriation of funds ( LAW ) . As this offence fell within the jurisdiction of ORG , it sent the file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against CARDINAL of the co - accused , as it found that the minor nature of the offences allegedly committed by them allowed an administrative prosecution . It decided to pursue the case against the applicant and the fourth co - accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE amendments to LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) entered into force , providing , inter alia , that criminal proceedings could be discontinued before the end of the trial with a plea agreement between the prosecution and the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution and the applicant entered into a plea agreement whereby the applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , suspended for DATE , and occupational disbarment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plea agreement was approved by ORG and the proceedings were discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody . As grounds for her detention the investigator cited the seriousness of the offence charged against her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against her detention to ORG . She stated that she had not attempted to abscond or obstruct the investigation during DATE since she had become aware of the criminal charges against her , that she was no longer working as a cashier or accountant and could not , therefore , commit other offences , and that she had undergone gynaecological surgery in DATE and had still not recovered completely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the decision to detain the applicant . It found that she had been charged with a serious offence punishable by more than CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and that \u201c therefore , the [ detention ] [ was ] lawful : it [ was ] based on the imperative provision of LAW ORG \u201d . It further stated that the question whether or not LAW ORG should be applied was to be assessed by the investigator and by the supervising prosecutor . In the applicant \u2019s case the investigator and the supervising prosecutor had not applied LAW of the ORG \u201c in view of the current stage of the proceedings \u201d . It followed that the applicant \u2019s detention was lawful . By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s ensuing appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . A further appeal against the applicant \u2019s detention was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s detention of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant appealed against her detention to ORG . In his written submissions to ORG the applicant \u2019s counsel stated , in particular , that the decision to detain the applicant had been based solely on the gravity of the charges against her , whereas other important factors had not been taken into account . For instance , the applicant had a permanent address where she lived with her husband and QUANTITY daughters . Also , she had known about the criminal charges against her for DATE prior to her arrest but had made no attempt to abscond or obstruct the investigation . Furthermore , the evidence against the applicant was weak , it having been established that CARDINAL other persons had access to keys to the cashier \u2019s office . The prosecutor had blindly followed the conclusions of the auditors who had pointed to the applicant on the sole ground that she had been the person in charge . However , no proof was found that the applicant herself had made false entries in the accounting books . The applicant \u2019s counsel also referred to her medical condition and enclosed medical certificates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the appeal . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c [ The charges against the applicant ] concern a serious offence within the meaning of LAW , that is , an offence under LAW , punishable by DATE imprisonment . In this respect there exists the requirement , under LAW ORG , that detention be imposed .", "... [ The medical certificates submitted by the applicant ] reflect her state of health during DATE . No information concerning her present state of health has been submitted . It follows that at present there exist no circumstances requiring the modification of the measure \u2018 pre - trial detention\u2019 imposed on the [ applicant ] . Therefore the appeal is ill - founded and must be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested the investigator in charge of the case to order a medical examination of the applicant with a view to establishing whether the conditions of detention were dangerous for her health . On DATE upon the investigator \u2019s order the applicant was examined by CARDINAL medical experts . In a report of DATE the experts found that the problems related to the surgery which the applicant had undergone DATE ( in DATE ) did not affect her condition and that she could remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was urgently transferred to a hospital due to pain in her gall bladder . She underwent surgery . On DATE her counsel submitted to ORG a request for her release in view of her poor health . In addition , he argued that there was no risk of the applicant absconding , obstructing the investigation or committing an offence , because she had become aware of the charges against DATE prior to her arrest but had not attempted to commit any of these acts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to comment on the request for the applicant \u2019s release . In particular , the ORG was requested to address the issue whether the applicant \u2019s continuing detention was justified in view of the surgery she had undergone . On DATE ORG ordered ORG to request an expert medical opinion on the above issue . On DATE a group of medical experts was appointed to examine the applicant . The experts found that the applicant needed a convalescence period which was incompatible with the conditions in detention .", "CARDINAL . Following this opinion , on DATE ORG decided to discontinue the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in view of her ill health , which was found incompatible with the conditions in detention . It further found that the applicant \u2019s state of health made it impossible for her to flee , obstruct the investigation or commit an offence . Also , the investigation had almost been completed .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was released from custody and placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the applicant submitted to ORG a request for release . The request was rejected on DATE . ORG held that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had been replaced by house arrest because it had been found that the applicant \u2019s health was incompatible with the conditions in detention and , moreover , the risk of her absconding or re - offending was objectively excluded in view of her illness . Unlike pre - trial detention , house arrest was not incompatible with her state of health , because there she could undergo medical examinations and treatment . The applicant had not requested permission to leave her house for specified periods of time to undergo treatment . Thus , there was no need for her to be released .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant appealed against her house arrest to ORG . She argued that there was no risk of her absconding or re - offending . She also referred to her poor health . By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the appeal , apparently without giving any specific reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator confirmed the applicant \u2019s house arrest of his own motion , without giving reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s house arrest of its own motion , without giving reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s house arrest of its own motion , without giving reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel appealed to ORG against ORG Office \u2019s decision to confirm the house arrest . He stated that it had lasted for DATE and that there was no indication that the applicant would abscond or re - offend . Moreover , all relevant evidence had already been gathered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , apparently before transmitting the appeal to ORG , ORG reviewed the matter and decided to grant bail . It stated that the investigation authorities had sent the case to the prosecution twice and it had been returned for further clarifications each time . As of that time the file was at the investigation and there was no indication that it would be received at ORG any time soon . The further continuation of the house arrest would amount to mere repression , since all relevant evidence had already been gathered and there was no risk of the applicant obstructing the investigation . It also added that the requests for release submitted in DATE were apparently rejected because at that time the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty had not lasted very long .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , read in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL , provides that particularly aggravated misappropriation of funds in particularly large amounts , the commission of which has been facilitated by another offence which carries a lesser penalty , is punishable by DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . By LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG , read in conjunction with LAW , misappropriation of funds in not particularly aggravated cases is punishable by one to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , if its commission has been facilitated by another offence which carries a lesser penalty .", "CARDINAL . The legal grounds for detention pending trial are set out in Article CARDINAL of the ORG , the relevant part of which , as worded at the material time , provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

A \u201c serious \u201d crime is defined by LAW as one punishable by PERCENT DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG practice at the relevant time ( it has now become at least partly obsolete as a result of amendments to the ORG in force since DATE ) was that LAW required that a person charged with a serious intentional offence be detained .
