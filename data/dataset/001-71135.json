He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted , together with PERSON and PERSON , of several offences by ORG ( ORG ) . According to the charges , at TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant , after having had a debt dispute with the victim and being employed by PERSON , had thrown an explosive device into a car parts shop owned by PERSON , a private limited company . A charge of damaging property by use of explosives was brought under LAW . The applicant was also charged with extortion under LAW of LAW . According to the charges , in DATE or DATE he had demanded EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) from T. and P. , the owners of ORG , a private limited company and competitor of ORG , and threatened to destroy the property in their office if they refused to give him the money . The applicant was further charged , under LAW , with unlawful possession of explosives . In DATE or earlier he had acquired , without having the required licence , QUANTITY of gunpowder and kept it unlawfully in his place of residence until DATE . Finally , the applicant was charged under LAW of LAW with unlawfully producing , acquiring , possessing , and transferring an explosive device . At DATE or DATE he had asked PERSON to produce an explosive device for him , which S. had done . The applicant had modified the device in order to increase its power of destruction . Thereafter he had kept the explosive device in his place of residence until DATE . On that date he had been arrested by the police just before he could hand the device over to GPE", "In respect of the charge under LAW , ORG convicted the applicant and PERSON , relying on the following evidence :", "CARDINAL ) an inspection report of the scene of the offence ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP a report of ORG together with a plan of the site of the explosion ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP an expert \u2019s report no . KP-CARDINAL - CARDINAL concerning the explosives ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of witness PERSON ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of GPE , representative of PERSON ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of witness GPE ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of victim P. ;", "CARDINAL) statements of victim T. ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP undercover recordings of PERSON \u2019s conversations ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of anonymous witness \u201c GPE ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of anonymous witness \u201c PERSON \u201d ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP statements of anonymous witness \u201c Tiiu \u201d .", "In addition to the statements given by the anonymous witnesses during the investigation , ORG also questioned them on the request of the defence counsel . The defence put questions to them in writing .", "ORG held that the charge of extortion ( under LAW of LAW ) against the applicant had not been made out . He was acquitted of this charge .", "With respect to the charge against the applicant of unlawful possession of explosives and the charge against him and S. of unlawfully producing , possessing , holding and transferring an explosive device , ORG noted that PERSON had pleaded guilty . According to him , he had made the explosive device on instructions . The guilt of the applicant had also been proved by his own statements and those of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON , several search and seizure reports , expert opinions and other items examined at the court hearing .", "ORG granted the civil claim for damages by PERSON .", "The applicant was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment , less the time he had spent in pre - trial detention .", "Defence counsel for the applicant and PERSON appealed against the judgment of ORG . The applicant \u2019s counsel requested ORG ( GPE ) to acquit the applicant in respect of the LAW charge , mitigate his sentence , put him on parole and dismiss the civil claim . Defence counsel was of the opinion that the applicant \u2019s conviction had been based on assumptions , rather than on the facts established . He alleged that ORG had wrongfully referred to the transcript of PERSON \u2019s taped conversations . According to him , the parties to the proceedings had had no possibility of verifying that the transcript reflected the recording adequately . Counsel found that the statements of the anonymous witnesses did not accord with the rest of the evidence and that a conviction could not be based solely on the anonymous statements . He insisted that the doubts raised by the statements of the anonymous witnesses , which could not be eliminated by other evidence , had to be interpreted in favour of the accused at trial .", "On DATE ORG allowed the appeal in so far as it concerned the civil claim but upheld the remainder of ORG judgment . ORG found that the court of first instance had given reasons for not relying on the statements of the witnesses on behalf of the accused at trial and considering the statements of P. and T. in respect of the explosion as reliable . ORG noted , furthermore , that it had no reason to doubt the reliability and truthfulness of the statements of the anonymous witnesses PERSON , PERSON and GPE . It found that their statements tallied in many respects and accorded with the material evidence ( the inspection report of the scene of the offence and the expert \u2019s report concerning the explosive device ) . ORG stressed that the reliability of the statements of the anonymous witnesses had been controlled by ORG , where they had been heard at the request of the defence counsel . The anonymous witnesses had confirmed their statements given during the preliminary investigation .", "ORG noted that the fact that all parties to the proceedings had not comprehended the voice records concerning PERSON did not eliminate their value as an item of evidence proving the guilt of the accused at trial . Moreover , the case file had included a transcript of the recording . According to the record of ORG hearing , the recording had been heard in the courtroom . ORG agreed with the applicant \u2019s counsel and the prosecutor that the amount of the damage caused to PERSON was unclear and that the civil claim therefore had to be settled in separate civil court proceedings .", "The applicant \u2019s counsel and PERSON appealed against ORG judgment , which was quashed in part by ORG on DATE . ORG quashed the judgment in so far as ORG had upheld ORG judgment convicting and sentencing the applicant and PERSON under LAW . The judgment was also quashed in respect of the applicant \u2019s overall sentence and in so far as the referral of the civil claim of PERSON to a civil court had been concerned .", "ORG pointed out , inter alia , that , as provided by LAW , a voice recording \u2013 but not a written transcript thereof \u2013 could be used as evidence in criminal proceedings . ORG noted that , according to the record of ORG \u2019s hearing , the recording of PERSON \u2019s conversation had not actually been heard at the hearing in the appeal court . ORG had , at the same time , noted that the transcript had corresponded to the recording . ORG found that ORG had failed to comply with the requirements of LAW and LAW , which provided that a criminal case had to be examined thoroughly and objectively and the evidence examined directly .", "As concerned the anonymous witnesses , ORG was satisfied that ORG had directly examined the statements given by them .", "Finally , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s counsel had challenged , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s conviction under LAW of LAW . However , in his appeal to ORG he had only challenged the applicant \u2019s conviction under LAW . In respect of the other offences only a more lenient punishment had been asked for . Accordingly , ORG found that the applicant had no right of appeal in respect of his conviction under LAW of LAW .", "ORG referred the case , in so far as it was quashed , back to ORG .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment in respect of PERSON civil claim . It also modified PERSON \u2019s overall sentence and the date from which the serving of the sentence would be deemed to run .", "ORG found that since the statements of the witnesses P. and ORG tallied and the involvement of PERSON and the applicant in the organisation of the explosion had been proved by other evidence , there was no reason to question their truthfulness . Furthermore , ORG noted that also the statements of the anonymous witnesses tallied and the reliability of these statements was made even greater by the fact that they matched the factual circumstances concerning the explosion . These statements accorded with an additional expert opinion concerning the explosive device . ORG was of the opinion that PERSON \u2019s guilt had also been proved indirectly by the undercover voice recordings made from DATE and the transcripts thereof . The recordings from DATE to DATE and from DATE could not be taken into account as evidence , since they were incomprehensible due to their poor quality .", "ORG concluded that the denial of guilt by PERSON and the applicant had been rebutted by all the evidence overall .", "ORG found that it was unnecessary to rule on the civil claim , since in the meantime , on DATE , ORG had , in separate proceedings , granted a claim by PERSON against PERSON and the applicant .", "Defence counsel for the applicant and PERSON appealed against the judgment of ORG . The applicant \u2019s counsel requested , inter alia , that the applicant be acquitted of the charge under LAW . He found that the courts had based the applicant \u2019s conviction decisively on the statements of the anonymous witnesses . This conflicted with the case - law of ORG and ORG . It had been impossible to ascertain on which grounds the anonymity had been granted with respect to some of the witnesses . Neither the anonymous statements nor the statements by the named witnesses proved that it had been the applicant who had committed the explosion . The applicant \u2019s counsel further requested that the applicant be put on parole in respect of the sentence imposed under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE and ORG judgment of DATE in part . It held that the classification of the offence and the reference to the provision of LAW had to be modified , since the relevant provision had been changed between the time the offence had been committed and the time the courts had decided the case . ORG convicted the applicant under LAW and PERSON under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL [ organiser of the offence ] and CARDINAL of LAW . Both of them were sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "With respect to the anonymous witnesses , ORG found no violation of the law of criminal procedure . It held that ORG had directly verified their statements . The courts had evaluated all the evidence and given sufficient reasons for the conclusions made on the basis of the anonymous statements . ORG reiterated that it did not have power to establish the facts . The fact that the appellants had disagreed with the factual circumstances established by the lower courts was not a question of law which could be dealt with in the review proceedings in ORG .", "ORG noted that by its judgment of DATE the applicant \u2019s conviction under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW had been upheld . That judgment of ORG had become binding on DATE . Therefore , there were no grounds for analysing once again the well - foundedness of the sentence imposed on the applicant pursuant to those provisions .", "Under LAW , as in force at the material time , in order to ensure the security of a victim or a witness or persons close to him or her , the person in question may be granted anonymity . Anonymity is granted in a reasoned order by a preliminary investigator at the request of a witness or a victim , or on the initiative of the preliminary investigator .", "Pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , a judge must preside over court hearings so that all facts are examined thoroughly , from all perspectives and objectively , and the truth is ascertained . When hearing a criminal case a court of first instance must directly examine the evidence by hearing the accused , the victims , witnesses and experts , inspecting physical evidence and disclosing records and other documents . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides that a court judgment must be based only on evidence that has been heard at a court hearing . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that the statement of facts and reasons in a court judgment must set out , inter alia , the facts ascertained in the examination by the court and the evidence on the basis of which the court deems the facts to be established ; the reasons why the court bases its judgment on such evidence and deems other evidence in the case to be unreliable ; the charges on which the court convicts each of the defendants ; and the evidence on which its conclusion is based .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that , after a witness has given testimony , he or she is examined by the participants in the proceedings , including the accused and his or her lawyer . Additional questions may be submitted to a witness to clarify and supplement the testimony previously given by him or her . If a court deems it necessary to hear evidence from a witness who has been granted anonymity , the witness is heard in the absence of the participants in the proceedings on the basis of the questions submitted by them . The content of the testimony has to be disclosed at a court hearing .", "Under LAW , testimony given by a witness during the pre - trial investigation may be disclosed if the witness fails to appear at a court hearing or if the whereabouts of the witness are unknown or if the witness has been granted anonymity ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
