GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Josep Casadevall;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is an anti - nuclear and environmental activist . She has repeatedly used her climbing skills to draw public attention to her protest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE around TIME the applicant and CARDINAL further persons belonging to the ORG organisation , an environmental protection group , climbed on the arch of a railway bridge . The group fixed banners expressing protest against the transport , by train , of radioactive waste from GPE , GPE , to the interim storage facility in GPE , scheduled from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . The members of the group refused to have themselves roped down by the police , who had dissolved their assembly . They were finally roped down by ORG mountain rescue team . The police then arrested TIME at CARDINAL p.m. while the other CARDINAL participants remained at liberty . They further seized the banners and the climbing equipment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME LOC , having heard the applicant and the GPE police , ordered the applicant \u2019s detention for preventive purposes under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of ORG ( PERSON \u00fcber die \u00f6ffentliche PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That detention was to last until the arrival of the \u201c castor \u201d containers in GPE train station and until DATE , TIME at the most .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant , who had been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts , and CARDINAL further persons had let themselves down on a rope on a railway bridge . They had unrolled banners protesting against the castor transport . A commuter train had to be stopped because its passage would have put the protesters at risk .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s detention was indispensable in order to prevent the imminent commission of a regulatory offence of considerable importance to the general public , as required by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of ORG . There was a risk that the applicant would block the forthcoming transport of the castor containers scheduled from DATE by a climbing action . Thereby , she would commit regulatory offences under ORG ( ORG - Bau- PERSON ) and LAW ) which would be dangerous to the public . That risk was also imminent in the applicant \u2019s case as she was known for expressing political protest , including protest against the transport of castor containers , by climbing actions and for being ready to breach the law in that context .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME ORG , having heard the applicant in person at TIME , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the ORG quashed the order of DATE for the applicant \u2019s detention for preventive purposes and ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , having regard to the applicant \u2019s deteriorating state of health , there was no longer a risk that the applicant would commit a criminal or regulatory offence of considerable importance to the general public , as required by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of ORG , in the context of the transport of castor containers to PERSON . Moreover , her continued detention was no longer proportionate in these circumstances . ORG noted that medical doctor C. , who had visited the applicant in detention on the latter \u2019s request , had confirmed that the applicant suffered from serious rheumatism which necessitated her to move continuously and was in a poor mental condition . Her detention in FAC , with little possibility to move , had already led to her joints having stiffened . The doctor had explained that she was not in a position to assess the applicant \u2019s fitness for detention , but that it appeared excluded that the applicant would be capable of carrying out a climbing action in DATE to come .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE at TIME", "CARDINAL . Following her arrest on DATE at TIME the applicant , having been found by a doctor of ORG not to suffer from any health problems , was brought before ORG which ordered her detention at TIME Following ORG decision , the applicant was accompanied home by the police officers from TIME to TIME in order to enable her to take her own clothes and medication . She was detained in a cell in FAC from TIME until DATE at TIME , when she was brought to ORG . The applicant \u2019s small cell , equipped with a mattress and a chair , was lighted at least via a ventilation slot and by electric light .", "CARDINAL . Between the end of the hearing of the applicant by ORG on DATE at TIME and its decision at TIME on DATE , the applicant essentially stayed in the office area of FAC . She went outside for a walk on the banks of the GPE river with the police officers CARDINAL times during that period .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG decision , the police decided to transfer the applicant to ORG which was considered being better equipped for police custody . When the applicant complained about breathing problems during the journey , the police called an ambulance . When both the ambulance crew and a police doctor had found that the applicant did not suffer from health problems , the transfer was continued in the ambulance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in FAC from DATE , TIME until her release on DATE at CARDINAL p.m. Her cell was equipped with a bed , an empty desk , a chair and an open cupboard and had a barred window with frosted glass . In the corridor of the detention wing , which she had to pass to go to the toilet , photographs of shackled persons were exposed . These included a picture of a person subject to ankle and hand cuffs , with both cuffs being tied together by a chain in the person \u2019s back lying on a mattress on the ground .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s detention in FAC , the light in her cell remained switched on throughout the applicant \u2019s first night in that cell . The applicant had climbed on the cupboard in her cell and passed the night thereon , failing to comply with the police \u2019s order to descend . The applicant was taken out for a walk on the premises of FAC , which did not dispose of a closed courtyard , on DATE from TIME until TIME , being loosely shackled to a female police officer . On DATE the applicant was allowed to stay outside on those premises from TIME until TIME , without being shackled ; she climbed on a tree on that occasion . The applicant was supplied with writing material on DATE . She was further allowed to receive CARDINAL visits from a friend and CARDINAL from her doctor C. She was also allowed to telephone her lawyer and her partner several times .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action of DATE under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against the GPE police for a finding that both the order for her detention and the conditions of its execution had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . As regards the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention ORG , endorsing the findings of fact made by ORG in its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as well as its reasoning , confirmed that the detention had complied with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of ORG and LAW .", "CARDINAL . As regards the execution of the detention order against the applicant , ORG considered that the manner in which the detention had been enforced had been lawful and had complied , in particular , with the provisions of LAW ( PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the detention order was executed in the detention wing of ORG until DATE and subsequently in the detention wing of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that her detention cells did not have windows , but only ventilation slots , ORG considered that the equipment of the detention cells had complied with no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) and that there had been enough light . The recommendations of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) were irrelevant here . The photographs of shackled persons exposed in the detention wing of ORG may have been tasteless , but did not render the applicant \u2019s detention unlawful as a result of intimidation .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , there had not been a breach of the right to sufficient TIME \u2019s rest provided by no . CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In GPE , some noise made by a ventilator may have made it more difficult for the applicant to fall asleep , but the police was not obliged to be considerate of individual sensitivities . The fact that the light had remained switched on TIME in GPE had been a consequence of the applicant \u2019s own behaviour . She had insisted spending TIME on the cell \u2019s cupboard the height of which was QUANTITY . The light had therefore been necessary for her own protection . It had not been possible for the police to guarantee that , in case the applicant had fallen down from the cupboard , they would notice it immediately otherwise . According to ORG , the applicant could ask herself whether she would have preferred having been shackled for her protection instead .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court noted that on DATE the applicant had been outside on the premises of ORG from TIME until TIME She had to be shackled as , being an excellent climber , there had been a risk that she would climb on trees or buildings and abscond . The applicant had not , therefore , been \u201c taken for a walk like an animal \u201d on the parking . On DATE the applicant had been outside from TIME until TIME She had not been shackled and had been allowed to climb on a tree . She had not objected to returning to the detention wing afterwards .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the applicant had failed to substantiate that her state of health in detention had deteriorated in a manner so as to render her detention disproportionate already prior to ORG decision of DATE ordering her release . There had not been a written and impartial medical report proving the applicant \u2019s allegation in that respect . The doctor who had visited the applicant in detention and had persuaded the then competent ORG judge to order her release had probably been a sympathiser .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the legality of the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG , endorsing the findings in its decision of DATE , confirmed that the applicant \u2019s detention as such had complied with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG further confirmed that the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention , albeit onerous for the applicant , had complied with the applicable legal provisions and had not been so unacceptable as to render the execution of her detention unlawful .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s detention during TIME in the detention cell in FAC , ORG found that the cell had been uncomfortable , but had complied with no . CARDINAL of ORG in the version then in force ( see paragraph DATE below ) . In that police station there were no detention cells suitable for a deprivation of liberty lasting DATE . Despite this , the police had convincingly explained that transporting the applicant to and back from GPE for the hearing before ORG DATE would have restricted her even more in her liberty of movement . Furthermore , she had not complained to the police about the noise at night emanating from a ventilator .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the GPE police had taken care of the applicant \u2019s well - being after her hearing before ORG ( on DATE from TIME until TIME ) while they waited for ORG decision until TIME with the applicant in an office in FAC in that they had taken her outside CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s subsequent detention in FAC , ORG noted that the applicant arrived at that station on DATE at TIME after the crew of the ambulance called by the police and a police doctor had confirmed her fitness for detention despite the breathing difficulties she had informed the police of . ORG further confirmed ORG finding that the pictures of shackled persons in the corridor of the detention wing \u2013 which included a photograph of a person subject to ankle and hand cuffs \u2013 may have been tasteless . However , it had neither been shown that the pictures had been put up to intimidate prisoners nor that the applicant had been intimidated in a considerable manner by them . Moreover , the court considered that it had been lawful for the police to leave the light switched on during TIME . It noted that the applicant had climbed on a cupboard measuring QUANTITY and had failed to descend on the police \u2019s request . By choosing not to descend her by force and by leaving the light on instead the police had respected as much as possible the applicant \u2019s right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s right to stays outside during her detention in GPE , ORG , endorsing the findings of ORG in this respect , found that the right provided by no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to be allowed to stay outside for TIME in so far as the staffing and infrastructural situation permitted had not been breached . Shackling the applicant to a female police officer on DATE had been necessary in order to prevent the applicant from absconding . The applicant , an excellent climber , had previously shown that she was not ready to comply with the police \u2019s orders and there had not been a closed courtyard as in prison . On DATE the applicant had not been shackled during her time outside and had been allowed to climb on a tree . She had also been able to move within her cell in order to alleviate ailments resulting from her rheumatism .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s right to receive visits in detention , ORG observed that under no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , such visits were permitted in so far as they did not endanger the purpose of the detention and were authorised by the police . The said provision had to be read in conjunction with section QUANTITY of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG noted that ORG had received CARDINAL telephone calls of sympathisers of the applicant , some of whom had insulted the police , which had considerably disturbed the execution of the applicant \u2019s detention . It had not been unlawful in these circumstances for the police not to permit visits by persons who had presented themselves at the police station without having lodged a request for a visit . In any event , the applicant had been visited by CARDINAL persons while in detention , in addition to the CARDINAL visits by her doctor , C. , who had prescribed her necessary medication and had brought a couple of magazines . Her right to receive visits had not been unlawfully restricted in these circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decision of ORG of DATE , confirmed on appeal by ORG on DATE , and against the decision of GPE of DATE , confirmed on appeal by ORG on DATE . She argued , in particular , that her right to liberty , the principle of proportionality and her right to freedom of assembly and of expression had been violated by her long illegal detention in unreasonable conditions in order to prevent insignificant regulatory offences . Her complaint was registered under file no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE addressed to the applicant in person , ORG informed the applicant that her constitutional complaint of DATE against the decisions of ORG of DATE , confirmed on appeal by ORG on DATE , in so far as the decisions concerned the conditions of her detention , had been registered under file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the abovementioned CARDINAL decisions in so far as these decisions concerned the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention , without giving reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . In her letter to ORG dated DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel , referring to the CARDINAL file numbers assigned to the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , the letter of CARDINAL DATE and the decision of CARDINAL DATE , asked for a progress report ; she was informed that it was not possible to indicate when a decision on the complaint under file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL would be taken .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decision of ORG dated DATE , confirmed on appeal by ORG on DATE , without giving reasons ( file no .
