The administrative authority ( PERSON ) of the district of GPE ( GPE ) rejected this appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) , which dismissed his appeal on DATE . Referring to the case - law of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) and to that of ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) of the Land , it ruled that the obligation for men , and not women , to serve in the fire brigade or to make a financial contribution was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Administrative Appeals Court dismissed the appeal which PERSON had filed against the decision of ORG ; it refused him leave to appeal on points of law .", "It pointed out that like ORG it had always held the legislation requiring only the male residents of a municipality to pay a fire service levy to be consistent with LAW . The applicant \u2019s arguments could not persuade it to reconsider its case - law or to refer the question to ORG again . There were no new facts to present to ORG and there had not been a fundamental change in legal opinion on the subject . ORG stated that it endorsed the opinion expressed in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE to the effect that , in view of the risks inherent in service in the fire brigade , there remained objective reasons for imposing the obligation on men but not on women .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant challenged this judgment , which had been delivered on CARDINAL DATE , in so far as it had refused him leave to appeal on points of law , but ORG ( ORG ) dismissed his appeal on DATE .", "In its view , the case raised no issue of principle ( grundlegende GPE ) . On the question whether the imposition of a fire service levy was in breach of the LAW , it concluded that it was not , in conformity with a judgment of ORG of DATE . It would only be possible to refer the matter once again to ORG if there were new facts or a fundamental change in legal opinion . However , ORG had found no evidence of this .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL of LAW [ enshrining the principle of sexual equality ] there had still been no general change in legal opinion ; the fact that the obligation to serve in the fire brigade was limited to the male residents of a municipality still continued to be objectively justified on account of the risks inherent in service in the fire brigade , even though some fire brigade duties were performed by women and recently fire brigades for female volunteers had even been set up .", "Nor does the fact that the L\u00e4nder of Lower Saxony ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of ORG ) and the GPE - Palatinate ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Rhineland- FAC ) make provision for an obligation to serve in the fire brigades regardless of sex constitute a reason for departing from this case - law .
