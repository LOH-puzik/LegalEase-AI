NORP The applicant , who has been granted legal aid , is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by PERSON , Representative of GPE at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he joined ORG in DATE . At that time it was , and apparently it remains , in opposition to the ruling regime . Following a murder attempt in DATE against the ORG President , some members and supporters of the party were reportedly arrested and tortured . Allegedly , the applicant was also arrested during that time . He submitted that he had been tortured by way of blows to his hands , back and head , causing loss of vision in his right eye . He had declined the offer to collaborate with ORG on the party members and their activities . The party has now split into CARDINAL factions : CARDINAL is apparently loyal to the ruling regime , while the other is led by supporters of the former leader of the party , Mr Iskandarov ( see PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , who have been persecuted .", "CARDINAL . Fearing persecution , the applicant left for GPE . Allegedly , in DATE the authorities were looking for him and arrested his brother . The applicant went back to NORP DATE ( allegedly , remaining in hiding ) . In DATE he obtained a new passport from the NORP authorities ( allegedly , through an acquaintance ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE in DATE . It appears that at the time NORP nationals did not require a visa to enter GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the applicant has been living in GPE in an unregistered relationship with PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON have CARDINAL children together , born in DATE and DATE . It appears that PERSON \u2019s first child , who was born in DATE from her previous relationship , has been residing with PERSON and the applicant . PERSON and the children are NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG of GPE granted the applicant a temporary residence permit valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr Ts . informed the GPE office of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) that the applicant had given him several publications about PERSON - ut - GPE , a prohibited organisation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE regional prosecutor applied to ORG , PERSON ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , asking it to classify those publications as \u201c extremist \u201d . The court granted his request . The applicant was not party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG interviewed the applicant , having informed him of his right not to testify against himself . According to the interview record , the applicant stated as follows : in DATE he had studied ORG with his friend , reading together various writings , inter alia , calling for the creation of an NORP Caliphate ; in DATE he learnt that ORG had arrested his friend and some of his relatives ; fearing arrest himself , he had moved to GPE where he obtained a work permit ; there he met CARDINAL NORP nationals who appeared to be supporters of PERSON - ut - GPE ; DATE CARDINAL of them provided the applicant with some publications , which he then gave to Ts .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , an ORG officer told him that the NORP authorities \u201c were looking for him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG wrote to the regional migration authority recommending that the applicant \u2019s residence permit be annulled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authority annulled the residence permit on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was informed that he could seek judicial review of the annulment decision or re - apply for a temporary residence permit in a DATE \u2019s time ; that he was obliged to leave GPE within DATE ; and that if he failed to leave the country he would be deported .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not seek judicial review of the annulment decision . However , he appointed a lawyer and they both considered that given the imperative indication in section CARDINAL of LAW , there would be no prospect of success in claiming reinstatement of the residence permit on account of a risk of death or torture if the NORP authorities became aware of the findings made by ORG in respect of the applicant . Instead , in DATE the applicant decided to attempt to regularise his stay in GPE by applying for refugee status ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . For this purpose , his lawyer obtained access to the case file concerning the residence permit . According to the lawyer , the file contained only the ORG \u2019s letter to the migration authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued the applicant with a \u201c warning \u201d ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) against \u201c unacceptable actions that create a basis for committing crimes falling within the ORG \u2019s competence \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The warning read as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] has expressed his intention to take part in the activities of the international terrorist organisation ORG - ut - GPE , which has been classified as \u2018 LOC by ORG . The indicated actions create a basis for committing crimes under LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant denied membership of ORG - ut - GPE or participation in its activities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged the \u201c warning \u201d , indicating that the ORG \u2019s allegations in respect of the applicant were unsubstantiated ; he had never been a member of the prohibited organisation ; and none of his previous actions or utterances had indicated an intention to take part in the activities of that organisation . The lawyer also challenged the \u201c warning \u201d as being an unsubstantiated and disproportionate interference with the applicant \u2019s private life , exposing him to a risk of removal to NORP and of ill - treatment there on account of the NORP authorities\u2019 awareness of the ORG \u2019s suspicion in respect of him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the \u201c warning \u201d on judicial review . The court stated that Ts . \u2019s and the applicant \u2019s own testimonies confirmed that the applicant had had contacts with people who were implicated in the activities of the prohibited organisation ; as confirmed by Ts . , the applicant had handed over to him publications that had an \u201c extremist \u201d content , as then confirmed by a court . The NORP legislation prohibited dissemination , possession and production of extremist material . In certain circumstances those actions constituted an offence ; an extremist activity was also punishable in criminal law , civil law and otherwise . The \u201c warning \u201d had not violated any of the applicant \u2019s rights or freedoms .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , arguing that nothing in his own statement to the ORG had disclosed an intention to take part in the \u201c activities of the prohibited organisation \u201d or elements of corpus delicti under LAW of LAW ; the impugned events dated back to DATE while the \u201c warning \u201d was meant to concern some continuing activity ; the applicant had no knowledge of the \u201c extremist \u201d content of the publications , which was only subsequently established by a court in proceedings to which he had not been a party . The applicant concluded that in substance the proceedings against him and the resulting \u201c warning \u201d amounted to a finding of criminal guilt without either the benefit of a judicial procedure or the attending safeguards of criminal proceedings , including the presumption of innocence ( Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The appeal court discarded as \u201c farfetched \u201d the arguments under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and endorsed in substance the reasoning of ORG . On an unspecified date , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law . It appears that in DATE ORG of GPE rejected the second appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . After the annulment of his residence permit , in DATE the applicant applied to the regional migration authority seeking refugee status .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted that as an ordinary member of ORG , he had attended meetings and complied with the ORG orders ; after the attempted assassination of the NORP President in DATE , he had been arrested and tortured ( blows to his fingers with a gun handle and blows to his spine and head ) ; he had left for GPE and had then returned to NORP , where he had stayed in different towns until DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE the regional migration authority dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for refugee status and ordered him to leave GPE within DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to a request from the applicant \u2019s lawyer , on DATE the GPE office of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the GPE ORG office \u201d ) issued an information document . Referring to some of the findings made in the DATE ORG report on ORG and some other reports , the ORG office made the following comments :", "\u201c In view of the numerous violations of human rights and fundamental principles of international law by the NORP authorities , the widely used practice of torture and cruel treatment at the hands of law enforcement officers , in particular with the aim of extracting confessions in criminal cases ... the ORG considers that people who are suspected in relation to political activities of a religious nature run a real risk of persecution in the form of torture in GPE ...", "Therefore , having regard to the international instruments ratified by GPE , in no circumstances should PERSON be extradited , as he is seeking asylum on account of a risk of torture if returned to the country of nationality .", "We hope that this information will be taken into account during the examination of your client \u2019s case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review of the refusal to grant refugee status , contesting the reliance on the document of DATE as the migration authority \u2019s only source of information about NORP . He referred to the ORG \u2019s findings in the PERSON judgment mentioned above and a number of other sources .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE . The court stated , inter alia , that had the applicant had genuine reasons for seeking asylum , he would have made an application immediately after his arrival in GPE . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Having been unsuccessful with his application for refugee status ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in DATE the applicant applied to the regional migration authority for so - called \u201c temporary asylum \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authority dismissed the application . On DATE ORG upheld the lower authority \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review of the refusal of temporary asylum . He argued that the migration authority had not assessed whether the ORG \u2019s warning on suspicion that he might commit a criminal offence of an extremist nature substantiated his argument that he was at risk of illtreatment at the hands of the NORP authorities , who were aware of the ORG \u2019s warning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision to refuse temporary asylum . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant . On DATE the same court dismissed a subsequent appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant . The applicant lodged a second appeal on points of law before ORG of GPE , which dismissed that appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully sought an extension of his permission to stay in the country pending appeals against the decision to refuse him temporary asylum . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . It appears that a subsequent appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant was dismissed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Allegedly , the applicant has been subjected to covert supervision by law - enforcement officials wearing plain clothes ; questions about him were raised with his neighbours ; and his relatives in NORP were questioned and their homes searched . Since DATE , the applicant has not left his home , fearing abduction with a view to forcibly transferring him to NORP .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the migration authority about their intention to expel the applicant . No reply has been received .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant has applied to the ORG office for help with resettlement . That request is pending .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on an unspecified date in DATE , officers from ORG arrested his brother ; he was subsequently released but was required to assist the authorities in obtaining the applicant \u2019s return to the country .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant is currently considered as a foreigner \u201c temporarily present in GPE \u201d , which , according to him , gives him an opportunity to move within the region but not to work .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Federal Law no . CARDINAL-FZ of DATE ) provides that a foreigner can be temporarily present on NORP territory for a period specified in a visa or , for foreign nationals not required to obtain a visa , for DATE unless otherwise provided for by the LAW ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW requires that a temporary residence permit be annulled if the foreigner ( i ) has expressed himself in favour of a radical change in the constitutional regime of GPE or , by way of other actions , poses a threat to the security of GPE or its citizens ; ( ii ) has made financial contributions or planned terrorist or extremist acts , has provided assistance to others in the commission of such acts , or has supported terrorist ( extremist ) activities by way of other actions .", "CARDINAL . After the annulment of a temporary residence permit or a residence permit , the foreigner concerned must leave GPE within DATE ; failure to do so will lead to deportation ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "CARDINAL . A decision to deport should be taken by a chief officer of the local migration authority ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG issued by order no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE by ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides that temporary asylum may be granted where ( i ) the foreigner has grounds for acquiring refugee status but only requests a possibility to remain in GPE for some time ; or ( ii ) the foreigner has no grounds for acquiring refugee status but should not be expelled from GPE for \u201c humanitarian reasons \u201d . Having received temporary asylum , the person may not be returned against his will to the country of nationality or the country of habitual residence .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ( Federal Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) provides that , in the absence of grounds for instituting criminal proceedings , the ORG has competence to issue and inform the person concerned of an \u201c official warning \u201d ( \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) about unacceptable actions that create conditions for the commission of certain crimes .
