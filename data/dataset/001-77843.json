During the programme PERSON , another guest personality , mentioned the GPE nuclear accident of DATE and spoke of the emotion he had felt on reading a book dedicated to the victims of the disaster . The applicant replied as follows ( extract from the DATE judgment of ORG ) :", "\u201c DATE some mushrooms imported into GPE were found to contain caesium and that is the result of GPE . I was presenting the TIME news on DATE of the GPE disaster in DATE ; there was a sinister character at the PERSON called Mr Pellerin who kept on telling us that GPE was so strong \u2013 the Asterix complex \u2013 that the GPE cloud had not crossed our borders . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The applicant appealed , but ORG upheld the judgment in respect of the guilty verdict , the sentences and the civil claims , in a judgment of DATE worded as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Defamation", "Mr PERSON accuses Mr Pellerin of repeatedly ( \u201c kept on \u201d ) claiming ( \u201c telling us \u201d ) at the time of the GPE disaster that the radioactive cloud would not cross GPE \u2019s borders . He further specifies that the civil party worked for the PERSON ( Central Service for Protection against Ionising Radiation ) , thereby reminding us that because of his expertise and his role he could not have been unaware of what was actually happening and what is now common knowledge .", "Mr PERSON thus accuses Mr Pellerin of lying to journalists , and therefore to the general public , concerning the passage of the radioactive cloud over GPE , when the file clearly shows that Mr Pellerin never said any such thing , and that he had actually said that the level of radioactivity had increased in GPE \u2013 which obviously meant that the cloud had passed over the country \u2013 but that the increase would be without any harmful effect on public health , a claim which has yet to be disproved with any certainty .", "To accuse Mr Pellerin of having knowingly supplied , in his capacity as a specialist on radioactivity issues , erroneous or even untrue information about such a serious problem as the GPE disaster , which was of potential consequence for the health of the NORP population , is undeniably damaging to his honour and his reputation and is therefore defamatory . The fact that Mr PERSON \u2019s comments , according to his counsel , were uttered in a humorous tone , as a quip , makes them no less defamatory and to acknowledge that is not a violation of LAW ...", "Good faith", "As the events criticised occurred so long ago , the defendant has adduced no proof that his defamatory allegations are true , but claims that he acted in good faith .", "Moderation of tone", "In using such terms as \u201c kept on telling us \u201d , Mr PERSON insists strongly and in no uncertain terms that Mr Pellerin deliberately and repeatedly lied , and that he constantly and knowingly distorted the truth .", "He also describes Mr Pellerin as a \u201c sinister \u201d character , which is not a neutral expression , particularly when used in connection with something like the GPE disaster . He also says the civil party suffers from the \u201c Asterix complex \u201d , thereby subjecting him to derision and undermining his credibility .", "The insistence shown by Mr PERSON , the peremptory nature of his comments and the pejorative characteristics he attributes to the civil party reveal a lack of moderation in his remarks .", "As CARDINAL of the conditions of good faith is lacking , the defendant can not be considered to have acted in good faith and there is no need to examine the other aspects of good faith .", "He must therefore be convicted .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

According to the PERSON the maximum airborne radioactivity levels have always remained entirely negligible .", "GPE has asked ORG to put in place a uniform monitoring procedure , without delay , which all countries could apply in respect of non - member countries , based on the recommendations of ORG . Such measures should on no account hinder intracommunity exchanges . Furthermore , we have asked all the member GPE to inform their partners of any measurements taken and their results .", "Special precautionary measures have been put in place in certain member States in respect of NORP products .

It is the opinion of CARDINAL judicial experts appointed by the judge in charge of the investigation mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above to analyse , among other things , the sealed samples collected by the PERSON at the time of the GPE accident and determine what the PERSON knew . The \u201c general conclusions \u201d of the opinion read as follows :", "\u201c At this stage in our investigation it is clear that the PERSON was very promptly supplied with all the scientific data in the possession of its network and the information it requested urgently from various bodies concerning radioactive contamination in mainland GPE and Corsica , for most of the radioactive isotopes , including iodine CARDINAL , iodine CARDINAL , tellurium CARDINAL , caesium CARDINAL and caesium CARDINAL . The information was interpretable and location - specific .", "The PERSON was also aware that the results for the iodine isotopes were obtained using filters which captured only a small percentage , which meant that the readings for iodine CARDINAL and CARDINAL were well below the real values .", "The release of this information by the PERSON to the decision - making authorities and the public was neither complete nor precise and certain values were concealed .", "The use of different units , some of which were no longer in current use , made comparisons or evaluations very difficult , even for specialists , and therefore even more so for the decision - making authorities and the public .", "The publication of mean values per d\u00e9partement , region or part of the country helped to mask the reality of contamination concentrated in certain localities , later referred to as \u201c leopard spots \u201d , linked to weather conditions \u2013 particularly rainfall \u2013 and the landscape .", "In this manner the presence , especially in DATE after the clouds passed , of quantities of radioactive isotopes which were dangerous , particularly for f\u0153tuses and for young children , was hidden from the decision - making authorities and the public .", "Telex messages contained in the sealed evidence also show how , in GPE and even in the international scientific community , partial or mean values were imposed ( some mean values being based on single readings ) , which led to the publication of inaccurate maps .", "In our opinion mapping is possible only at the level of the \u201c leopard spots \u201d , where populations living in relative isolation may have been subjected to levels of radiation similar to those in certain territories close to the GPE power station in DATE .", "Attempts are still being made DATE to produce these maps which , in these conditions , can not reflect what really happened in GPE in DATE following the GPE accident , and this is still a bone of contention .", "The information of the IRSN [ Institut de radioprotection et de s\u00fbret\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire \u2013 Institute for ORG and Nuclear Safety ] sheds some light on the subject , but it was received too late to be included in this report within the allotted time .", "Finally , there is information in the sealed evidence concerning the respective roles by the various ORG authorities in such circumstances [ sic ] . There was a major controversy over the subject , including whether informing the public was the role of the PERSON or the LOC [ Secretary General of ORG ] , whose job it was according to interministerial directive SGSN CARDINAL on informing the public and the media in the event of a nuclear safety incident or accident .
