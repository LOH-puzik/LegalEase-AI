The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted civil proceedings in GPE , QUANTITY from his place of residence . He sued ORG and ORG in connection with military operations in GPE in DATE . He claimed , in particular , that his property , including his flat , had been destroyed during an attack by federal forces on the centre of ORG in DATE and sought compensation for pecuniary damage . The applicant submitted that the damage had been inflicted as a result of the use by the ORG of hazardous devices ( \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) , namely weapons and military equipment , and that he was therefore entitled to compensation under the relevant provision of law without having to prove that the defendant had been at fault . The applicant also stated that he had endured mental suffering when forced to live in the zone of active military action , and claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage on that account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examined the applicant 's claims . It acknowledged that the applicant 's property had been destroyed as a result of an attack in DATE , but noted that the applicant had failed to prove that his possessions had been damaged by NORP federal troops rather than by rebel fighters , as both parties to the conflict had used weaponry and ammunition of the same standard . The court also noted that under ORG and QUANTITY of LAW of GPE the ORG was only liable in damages for the unlawful acts of its agents . It further held that the military operations in GPE had been launched by presidential and governmental decrees which had been held to be constitutional by ORG and were still in force . Accordingly , the court concluded that the actions of the NORP federal troops in GPE were lawful and dismissed the applicant 's claim for compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a preliminary notice of appeal ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430 ) in which he requested the appellate court to quash the judgment and remit his case for fresh consideration . He also expressed his intention to adduce detailed arguments after acquainting himself with the text of the transcript of the first - instance hearing and obtaining a full copy of the judgment . Thereafter the applicant left for his place of residence .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that he could obtain a full copy of the judgment of DATE and access to his case file at the court registry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied in writing to ORG for a copy of the transcript of the hearing on DATE , and a document that had been adduced by the defendants at the hearing . According to the applicant , he never received a response to his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent another request to ORG , which also remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG forwarded a copy of the judgment of DATE to the applicant and notified him that a hearing of his appeal was scheduled for DATE . The applicant received this letter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant prepared detailed appeal submissions ( \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430 ) , in which he claimed that the first - instance court that the defendants had not adduced any evidence capable of refuting his arguments and that therefore the judgment of DATE was unfounded and should be quashed . He further reiterated that his property had been destroyed during an attack in DATE , and that under national law he was entitled to compensation for pecuniary damage . He also stated that he had endured mental suffering when forced to live in the zone of active military action , and therefore had the right to compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The applicant further argued that once ORG had established that his property had , in fact , been destroyed , it should have indicated who was liable to compensate him for that damage . He claimed in this respect that since the military operations in GPE had been launched by ORG , it was the ORG which should compensate him for his losses . The applicant also insisted that during the military operations the ORG had used hazardous devices , namely heavy artillery and other indiscriminate weapons , and that under national law he was absolved of any obligation to prove that the damage had been caused by the defendants ' fault .", "CARDINAL . At the end of his appeal submissions the applicant provided a list of the documents lodged , namely , CARDINAL copies of his detailed appeal submissions of DATE , a copy of the preliminary notice of appeal dated DATE , a copy of ORG judgment of DATE , a motion to exempt the applicant from payment of the court fee , a copy of a certificate indicating the inflation rate in GPE for DATE and a copy of the summons for the appeal hearing as well as the envelope in which it had been sent marked with the date of receipt .", "CARDINAL .

He then attempted to lodge his detailed appeal submissions at the hearing , but the presiding judge refused .", "CARDINAL . The Government referred to information provided by ORG that the applicant 's appeal of DATE had been accepted and examined by ORG . They did not indicate the date on which the applicant 's appeal had been received and registered by ORG registry .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . The applicant attended the hearing and presented his arguments . ORG held that the conclusions of the court below were correct and well - founded , since the applicant had not adduced any evidence that the actions of the NORP federal troops within the territory of GPE were unlawful or that the alleged damage had been caused by them rather than by rebel fighters . It went on to address the applicant 's argument that the weapons used were hazardous devices and that the damage should therefore be compensated irrespective of the question of fault . ORG noted that this argument could not constitute a ground for quashing the judgment at first instance , as according to a decision of the Plenary of ORG of GPE , firearms could not be regarded as a hazardous device so that a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the shooting would only lie if the defendant was at fault . It concluded :", "\u201c The arguments advanced in the appeal do not point to any circumstances which have not been examined by the [ first - instance ] court or which could rebut the conclusions of the judgment . They seek to re - evaluate the adduced evidence and can not serve as a basis for quashing the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to the President of ORG , complaining about the court 's refusal to examine the detailed appeal submissions he had given to the presiding judge at the court hearing on DATE and requesting that the appeal be registered and a copy of the court 's decision of CARDINAL DATE forwarded to him .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG sent a copy of the requested decision to the applicant without further explanation .", "CARDINAL .

In reply , the ORG submitted a copy of the applicant 's preliminary notice of appeal of DATE and of his detailed appeal submissions of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first document , which is dated and signed by the applicant , bears the stamp of ORG of GPE together with a reference number and DATE of DATE . There are also a number of handwritten notes , dates and signatures on the document which make it clear that it was sent to , and received by , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The copy of the applicant 's detailed appeal submissions , which is dated and signed by the applicant , contains no official stamps or dates to indicate whether they were received by ORG and , if so , on what date . The list of the enclosures at the end of the document has been crossed out and the word \u201c refused \u201d has been inserted by hand nearby . The date of this \u201c refusal \u201d is missing , but the signature is very similar to that of the presiding judge on a copy of the appeal decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL enshrined the right of any party to a dispute and of other participants in proceedings to appeal against a first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provided that , as a rule , an appeal should be brought through the first - instance court that delivered the judgment .
