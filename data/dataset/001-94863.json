The applicant was born in DATE in GPE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a former NORP and ORG officer who served from DATE in the territory of GPE . After the restoration of NORP independence , he was refused an extension of his residence permit in that country . His complaints were dismissed by the domestic courts ; the final judgment was delivered by ORG ( NORP ) on CARDINAL DATE . Subsequently , he lodged an application with ORG , alleging , among other complaints , that his right to respect for his private and family life , guaranteed under LAW , had been violated by the NORP authorities . On DATE this application was declared inadmissible ( see GPE v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances of the applicant \u2019s stay in GPE and the NORP authorities\u2019 refusal to extend his residence permit , as well as a summary of the relevant domestic and international legal provisions may be found in the decision mentioned above . In brief , although the NORP authorities had finally refused to extend the applicant \u2019s residence permit , he \u2013 backed by ORG \u2013 was of the opinion that he was still entitled to stay in GPE under the terms of the agreement concerning social guarantees for retired military personnel of the armed forces of GPE in GPE , concluded on DATE . The agreement provided that retired military personnel , that is persons discharged from the army service and receiving pension could apply for a residence permit in GPE . According to ORG the applicant was dismissed from the military service on DATE for health reasons and excluded from the lists of the military unit on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities , to the contrary , considered that he did not fall under the agreement concerning social guarantees but rather under the treaty on the withdrawal of the NORP troops from the NORP territory , also concluded on DATE , as he had been in the active military service at the time of the conclusion of the treaty . He had only been assigned to the reserve forces on CARDINAL DATE and discharged from the military unit as of DATE . Accordingly , he had been obliged to leave GPE under the treaty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Citizenship and Migration Board ( Kodakondsus- ja GPE \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) ordered the applicant to leave the country on CARDINAL DATE at the latest . He was warned that in the event of failure to comply with the order , he would be expelled immediately . The applicant challenged the order before ORG ( halduskohus ) which , on DATE , dismissed the complaint . The applicant appealed , but his appeal was dismissed by ORG ( ringkonnakohus ) . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was arrested . His immediate expulsion was not possible as he only presented his expired passport on arrest , saying that he did not know where his valid NORP passport was . On DATE ORG decided , at the request of the police , that the applicant was to be taken to a deportation centre for execution of the deportation order . ORG authorised his detention for DATE , starting from DATE , giving him some time to find his valid passport . The Government have submitted to the ORG a copy of the applicant \u2019s NORP passport valid until DATE . The applicant did not present this document in the subsequent proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant he lodged an appeal against ORG decision of DATE but since his detention was subsequently , on DATE , extended by ORG , the appeal became void of substance and had to be withdrawn . According to the ORG the applicant filed a notice of his intention to appeal , as required by the applicable rules of procedure , but he never actually lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL DATE the applicant was detained in the deportation centre in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government in their submissions have described the deportation centre as an institution with a guarded perimeter kept under visual and electronic supervision . It can accommodate CARDINAL persons in rooms designed for QUANTITY persons but as a rule CARDINAL persons are placed in CARDINAL room . The detainees can use eating and rest areas equipped with television , radio , newspapers and literature . There is table tennis equipment and various board games and the detainees have free access to toilets and shower . Washing and drying machines are available . There are CARDINAL periods a day ( totalling TIME ) for outdoor walks . The detainees are served CARDINAL meals a day , including CARDINAL hot meals ; there is a nurse present in the centre TIME a day and , if the need arises , a general practitioner is available . A psychiatrist and a psychologist visit the centre regularly . The detainees can buy additional food and other items through the centre ; they are also allowed to receive parcels , send and receive letters and use the telephone . Furthermore , they can meet consular officials of their country of nationality , defence counsel and ministers of religion . Subject to authorisation they can also be visited by other persons , such as family members .", "CARDINAL . At the request of ORG , the applicant \u2019s detention was extended by ORG once DATE . It was open to the applicant to appeal against the rulings of ORG to ORG and , thereafter , to ORG . He did so in some but not in all cases . On each occasion the higher courts dismissed the appeals .", "CARDINAL . The courts found that the applicant \u2019s detention was lawful and justified for the purpose of ensuring his expulsion . According to the ORG rulings , the applicant had allegedly lost his valid NORP passport and despite the requests by ORG to ORG of GPE in GPE ( \u201c the Embassy \u201d ) the latter had not been able to issue a new travel document to the applicant because of his refusal to fill in the required application forms . ORG was ready to issue the applicant a temporary travel document but according to ORG it was not possible to add an entry permit to such a document . The courts considered that detention was an appropriate measure to motivate the applicant to co - operate with the authorities and avoid a situation where an expulsion order could not be executed merely because of the applicant \u2019s unwillingness . They were of the opinion that the length of the applicant \u2019s detention in the deportation centre depended on him alone . The courts also noted that the applicant \u2019s deportation might be possible under LAW between ORG and GPE on readmission once it entered into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to further extend the applicant \u2019s detention . It found that the length of his detention had become disproportionate and , in the circumstances , unconstitutional . He was released from the deportation centre DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Board and ORG sought possibilities to secure travel documents for the applicant so that he could be removed ; they were in contact with the ORG to that end throughout the applicant \u2019s detention . Furthermore , ORG on several occasions requested the applicant to fill in forms required by the ORG to issue him a passport , but the applicant persistently refused .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s attempts to achieve the applicant \u2019s removal included the following steps .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked ORG to issue the applicant a return certificate . On DATE the ORG replied that the applicant could return to GPE only on the basis of a NORP foreign passport , which he could apply for in person or through a representative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the Board informed the ORG that the applicant refused to fill in the required forms . They requested the ORG \u2019s assistance in issuing documents for the applicant and expressed their readiness to provide the applicant with a temporary travel document . The ORG did not reply to the letters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again reminded the Embassy of the situation and sought their agreement to affix an entry visa to a temporary travel document the ORG was ready to issue . On DATE the ORG replied that this was not possible under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked ORG to request the ORG to provide the applicant with the requisite papers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the ORG \u2019s assistance in issuing documents to the applicant . On DATE the ORG replied that they could issue him a passport upon his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted a request to ORG for the applicant to be readmitted on the basis of the readmission agreement . On DATE the ORG replied that the NORP party was of the view that the applicant did not fall under the readmission agreement as he had a legal basis for residing in GPE ( the NORP agreement of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again asked ORG to request the ORG to provide the applicant with the requisite papers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked ORG to contact ORG to provide the applicant with papers under the readmission agreement . On DATE ORG replied that the NORP authorities did not wish to consider the applicant \u2019s readmission under the readmission agreement and therefore the readmission application concerning him had not been submitted to ORG . A meeting with ORG had been scheduled for DATE . On DATE ORG nevertheless transmitted the readmission application to ORG . On DATE ORG replied that the applicant was not subject to readmission under the readmission agreement as he had a legal basis for residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the ORG and ORG exchanged several notes and memoranda related to the NORP authorities\u2019 refusal to extend residence permits for some retired GPE servicemen . On DATE ORG expressed readiness to hold bilateral consultations to regulate the matter , as proposed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a note to the ORG drawing the NORP authorities\u2019 attention to the fact that on DATE ORG had declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s application related to the NORP authorities\u2019 refusal to extend his residence permit . ORG asked the NORP authorities to take the necessary steps for the applicant \u2019s repatriation and requested their assistance in providing him with papers . On DATE the ORG expressed their readiness to issue the applicant identity documents , provided that the applicant submitted an application in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the ORG to issue the applicant with the documents necessary for his readmission on the basis of the readmission agreement and transmitted a readmission application in respect of him to the ORG . On DATE the ORG replied that retired servicemen of GPE , including the applicant , did not fall under the readmission agreement as they had a legal basis for residing in GPE . They proposed regulating the matter by negotiation , through diplomatic channels . On DATE ORG agreed to hold negotiations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reiterated that the NORP authorities considered that the applicant did not fall under the readmission agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed its position that the applicant was subject to the readmission agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG emphasised that the main aim of the readmission agreement , as stated in its preamble , was to strengthen co - operation in order to combat illegal immigration . Any attempt to apply it to other situations was contrary to the principle of implementing international treaties in good faith . In particular , the readmission agreement was not applicable to the retired servicemen to whom the agreement of DATE concerning social guarantees to retired military personnel applied .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the representatives of ORG repeatedly met NORP officials to discuss possible solutions for the applicant \u2019s case . In connection with the readmission agreement there have also been joint committee meetings to discuss issues related to the agreement and to conclude its implementing protocols . In DATE and DATE the NORP authorities submitted a draft implementing protocol of the readmission agreement to the NORP party ; a copy of the draft protocol was resubmitted to the NORP authorities on DATE . On DATE the Embassy informed the NORP authorities that ORG was ready to hold consultations at expert level concerning the implementing protocols in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG sent the applicant several letters informing him of the NORP authorities\u2019 position in the matter and giving reassurances that the NORP party would try to solve the issues through bilateral dialogue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE the applicant \u2019s release was ordered by a court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG gave him a written reminder that his expulsion order was still in force . Some further measures were applied as DATE the applicant had to reside in his fixed residence , to report to ORG at certain intervals , and to inform ORG of any change in his place of residence or if he left it for an extended period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in misdemeanour proceedings , sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL days\u2019 detention for staying in GPE without a legal basis . The judgment was upheld in substance by ORG . On DATE ORG refused , on procedural grounds , to examine the applicant \u2019s appeal as it had not been drawn up by a lawyer as required by law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Obligation to Leave and Prohibition of Entry Act ( ORG ja sisses\u00f5idukeelu seadus ) , as in force at the material time , defined expulsion as the enforcement of an obligation to leave in the cases and pursuant to the procedure provided by law .", "Section CARDINAL of the Act provided that an order to leave GPE could be issued to an alien who was staying in GPE without a legal basis and that it had to contain a warning of compulsory execution in the event of failure to comply with it . According to section CARDINAL , the compulsory execution was to take place after DATE following notification of the order .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act enumerated the instances where expulsion would not be applied . These included the case where expulsion was no longer feasible .", "Section CARDINAL ) of the Act stipulated that expulsion of an alien had to be completed within TIME of his or her arrest . If it was not possible to complete expulsion within that term , the person to be expelled could be placed in a deportation centre , subject to judicial authorisation , until their expulsion , but for no longer than DATE ( section PERSON ) ) . This term could be extended at the request of ORG by DATE at a time ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the person to be expelled was required to co - operate in the organisation of the expulsion , including co - operating in obtaining the necessary documents for expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an Agreement between ORG and GPE on readmission entered into force . The aim of the agreement is to strengthen the GPE co - operation in order to combat illegal immigration more effectively . LAW , concerning readmission of NORP nationals , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The GPE shall admit , upon application by a Member ORG and in accordance with the procedure provided for in this LAW , any person who does not , or no longer , fulfil the conditions in force for entry to , presence in , or residence on the territory of the requesting Member ORG provided it is established , in accordance with LAW , that such person is a national of GPE .", "The same shall apply to illegally present or residing persons who possessed the nationality of GPE at the time of entering the territory of a Member State but subsequently renounced the nationality of GPE in accordance with the national laws of the latter , without acquiring the nationality or a residence authorisation of that Member ORG or any other ORG .", "CARDINAL . After GPE has given a positive reply to the readmission application , the competent diplomatic mission or consular office of GPE shall irrespective of the will of the person to be readmitted , as necessary and without delay , issue a travel document required for the return of the person to be readmitted with a period of validity of DATE . If , for any reason , the person concerned can not be transferred within the period of validity of that travel document , the competent diplomatic mission or consular office of the GPE shall issue a new travel document with a period of validity of the same duration without delay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of ORG ( case no . CARDINAL ) found that the assessment of the feasibility of expulsion could not be based on the fact that the person concerned did not wish to leave the country and wanted to stay there . An interpretation to the contrary would have been in conflict with the nature of expulsion as a legal concept .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG ( case no . CARDINAL ) noted that both the ORG \u2019s request and the court \u2019s authorisation for detention had to be based on the law in force at the time of the court proceedings . It pointed out , however , that since expulsion proceedings constituted a dynamic process , due attention had to be given to the prospective changes in legal circumstances which would affect expulsion at the time when the person concerned was expected to be expelled ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
