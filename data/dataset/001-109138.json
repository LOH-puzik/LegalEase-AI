On DATE the applicants complained to the regional prosecutor that they received no information concerning the outcome of the investigation into their new allegations .", "CARDINAL .

In respect of the challenged report of DATE , the district prosecutor noted that the expert had admitted that it contained errors but further noted that these had been classified as formal . The prosecutor agreed with the opinion of the regional prosecutor that ORG had most probably attempted to escape . Given that the windows were partly shaded , he could not see the concrete surface below nor could he exactly estimate the height . Thus he might have thought that it would be possible to escape . The prosecutor concluded by stating that this had only been the prosecutor \u2019s personal view and that the victim \u2019s intentions would never be known .", "CARDINAL .

In this decision the court rejected a victim \u2019s claim under LAW contesting a prosecutor \u2019s decision confirming suspension of an investigation of alleged police ill - treatment by ORG . It held that due to the constitutional principle of separation of powers , courts , including ORG , could not interfere with the power of the prosecutor to bring charges or not . It could only review a prosecutor \u2019s decision to the extent that it was arbitrary . It found that the decision of the prosecutor had been sufficiently reasoned and that the prosecutor had proceeded in accordance with LAW procedure .", "CARDINAL . In this decision ORG rejected a victim \u2019s complaint under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW contesting the suspension of an investigation into alleged police ill - treatment . The appellant complained that the investigation had not been independent and impartial because it had been carried out by ORG of the Minister of the ORG and only formally supervised by a prosecutor . The court held :", "\u201c The possibility of interference by ORG with the investigation phase of criminal proceedings must be interpreted restrictively . ORG can correct only the most extreme excesses . ...", "In the past , ORG occasionally stepped out of its now well - established case - law . It did so in instances when the prosecutor had failed to sufficiently reason its decision to reject the complaint against a decision of the police to bring charges ( see nos . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL and III . \u00daS PERSON ) .", "Even after the delivery of these judgments ORG does not consider that it has the power to review conduct of prosecutorial authorities regarding the substantive reasons and justification for bringing charges . It follows that only complaints claiming insufficient reasons for a decision that would suggest arbitrariness by the prosecutorial authorities can be subject to a review by ORG . \u201d", "ORG added that , having reviewed the administrative case file , the investigation by the police authorities had been compatible with the law and that the appellant \u2019s procedural rights had been protected . It did not give any opinion on his complaint that the investigation had not been independent and impartial .", "CARDINAL . By that judgment , the court , on appeal of the accused , quashed a prosecutor \u2019s decision approving the decision of the police to charge the applicant because the prosecutor had failed to examine the appellant \u2019s complaints efficiently and to explain the reasons for the decision . As a general principle , the court held that a decision of a prosecutor must be reasoned and he or she must properly examine the complaints . It added that it did not have the power to review the substance of a decision by a prosecutor to bring charges against an individual or to comment whether a particular criminal investigation was justified ; these were questions that fell exclusively within the power of prosecutorial authorities .", "CARDINAL . In this decision ORG found that a failure by the ORG to carry out an effective investigation , within the meaning of LAW , into an alleged ill - treatment by the police , was not part of personality rights protected by LAW . Thus , civil courts could not review the issue as part of a civil action for the protection of personality rights .", "CARDINAL .
