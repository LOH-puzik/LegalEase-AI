ORG In its election manifesto published on CARDINAL DATE , ORG stated that its political programme included nationalisation of the GPE aircraft and shipbuilding industries . It had made previous statements to that effect in DATE , CARDINAL and DATE .", "At a general election held on DATE , ORG gained office from the NORP and formed a government ; it did not then have an overall majority in ORG . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG announced that the shipbuilding and shiprepair industries would be taken into public ownership and that legislative provisions for safeguarding their assets would be effective from that date ; details of the ORG \u2019s proposals for nationalising those industries were set out in a discussion paper published on DATE .", "A further general election was held on DATE , at which ORG was returned with an overall majority . On DATE , the Queen \u2019s Speech at the opening of ORG referred to the Government \u2019s intention to bring the aerospace industry into public ownership and a statement concerning safeguarding provisions for its assets was made in ORG on DATE . On DATE , the Government published a consultative document relative to their plans for the nationalisation of that industry .", "CARDINAL . ORG The above - mentioned discussion paper and consultative document contained particulars of the companies to be nationalised and stated that \" fair compensation \" would be paid , though without giving details of the compensation terms . Both documents set out the political , economic and social considerations that motivated the nationalisation proposed ; essentially , the Government considered that it would put the industries concerned - which had been in receipt of substantial Government assistance and were heavily dependent on Government contracts - on a sounder organisational and economic footing and bring to them a desirably greater degree of public control and accountability .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the Secretary of ORG announced in ORG the forthcoming introduction of an ORG Bill to give effect to the nationalisation proposals . He indicated , for the first time , the basis on which compensation would be determined , namely by reference to the value of the securities of the companies to be acquired : securities quoted on a recognised ORG were to be valued at their average price during DATE on DATE , whilst the value of unquoted securities was to be determined , by agreement or arbitration , as if they had been quoted during that period . Details of the safeguarding provisions were also given .", "CARDINAL . ORG A PERSON on the lines announced was duly published , providing for the securities of CARDINAL companies to pass into the ownership of public corporations . Although the PERSON received its first reading on DATE , it lapsed at the end of the Parliamentary session due to lack of time . The Government then reviewed the proposed compensation terms ( including the choice of the valuation reference period ) in the light of representations received , but decided not to change them , notably on account of the uncertainty which this would have created , of the extent of share dealings that had taken place on the basis of the terms already announced and of the fact that in the alternative reference periods canvassed share prices were likely to have been distorted by the commitment to nationalisation .", "CARDINAL . ORG A second PERSON , in essentially the same terms as the first , was introduced in DATE . It gave rise to protracted proceedings in ORG , covering such matters as the principle and the scope of the nationalisation measure and the compensation terms . In DATE , the Government themselves announced the exclusion from the ambit of ORG ; this shipbuilding company had become insolvent after DATE and the Government considered that it would be unjustifiable to pay its shareholders the full value of the shares during the compensation reference period .", "Having received its third reading in ORG on DATE , the PERSON passed to ORG where , after further lengthy debates , various amendments were made which were not acceptable to the Government ; in particular , certain shiprepairing and warship - building companies were excluded and a provision was inserted whereby ORG - which was to assess compensation in default of agreement - would have been able to award \" fair compensation \" if it considered that this would not be provided under the statutory formula . The ensuing disagreement between the CARDINAL ORG over the amendments could not be resolved by the end of the session and the second PERSON therefore also lapsed .", "CARDINAL . ORG A third PERSON in the same terms as the second was introduced into ORG on DATE , completed all procedural stages there by DATE and was then introduced into ORG under a special procedure whereby it could pass into law without the assent of that ORG . It received the Royal Assent and came into force on DATE . The compensation terms enacted were essentially identical to those provided for in the first PERSON ; the same applied to the interests to be nationalised , except for the exclusion of ORG and also - following an amendment accepted by the ORG during the proceedings on the third PERSON certain companies whose business consisted solely of shiprepairing . In the final event , CARDINAL companies ( CARDINAL aerospace and the remainder shipbuilding , marine engineering or shipbuilding training ) were listed for nationalisation in LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Parliamentary debates were characterised throughout by opposition concentrated , in particular , on the alleged unfairness of the compensation terms . The criticisms - which were substantially identical to those made by the applicants in the present proceedings and were all withdrawn or rejected after debate - related , inter alia , to the use of a hypothetical ORG method of valuation for unlisted shares ; the choice of the valuation reference period ; the absence of provision for taking account of growth in the companies concerned , or fall in the value of money , after the reference period ; the non - inclusion in the compensation formula of any equivalent of the \" control premium \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; and the fact that the valuation of certain acquired companies might be related to the stock market quotation of their parent ORG shares .", "Government spokesmen , for their part , maintained that the terms were fair . They argued , amongst other things , that it was proper to value securities at a date before they were affected by the possibility of nationalisation ; that the subsequent performance of a particular company would normally have been in prospect at the reference period and hence reflected in the imputed share price ; that it was reasonable that the Government should benefit from any improvements in the companies after the end of the reference period since they accepted the risk of any deterioration , short of bankruptcy ; that it was fallacious to assume that there was a correlation between share values and the rate of inflation ; that the choice of reference period protected shareholders against the subsequent fluctuations in market prices ; that the terms on which compensation was being offered were not those on which a willing buyer acquired control of a company from a willing seller , since this was not a transaction of that kind but a nationalisation by ORG ; and that regard would be had to the quotation of a parent company \u2019s shares only where the acquired company \u2019s activities constituted a \" very substantial \" part of the whole undertaking . The ORG also acknowledged that the settlement of compensation would take some time , but expressed their intention of making payments on account as large and as quickly as possible and within DATE of passage of the companies into public ownership .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE - at which time compensation negotiations were still in progress ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) - , a further general election was held and ORG returned to office . The new Government reviewed , in the light of representations made , the compensations terms contained in LAW but decided not to change them . In a written answer the new Secretary of ORG announced this to ORG on DATE , in the following terms :", "\" We recognise that some previous owners and many members of this ORG and of the public believe that the terms of compensation imposed by the DATE Act were grossly unfair to some of the companies and we share this view . We have explored every possibility to right the injustice done by the previous Government but to our very great regret we have concluded that amending legislation to establish new compensation terms retrospectively would be unjust to the many people who sold shares on the basis of the previous terms . \"", "The new Government also considered , but decided against , any immediate denationalisation of certain of the companies that had passed into public ownership .", "CARDINAL . Sections DATE and CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided that , on a date to be specified by the Secretary of ORG ( \" Vesting Day \" ) , the securities of the companies engaged in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries which were listed in ORG , together with certain other assets appurtenant to their activities , should vest in \" British Aerospace \" or \" British Shipbuilders \" , CARDINAL public corporations established under LAW . The dates subsequently so specified were , for aerospace companies , DATE and , for shipbuilding companies , DATE .", "The LAW also made provision for compensation to be paid to the former holders of securities of the acquired companies , for the safeguarding of the assets of the nationalised undertakings , for the appointment of ORG representatives and for the establishment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the amount of compensation payable was , generally , an amount equal to the \" base value \" of the nationalised securities , less any deduction which was appropriate by virtue of LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . For securities listed on ORG , the \" base value \" was , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the average of their DATE quotations during DATE and DATE ( \" the Reference Period \" , the second date being that of the general election referred to in paragraph CARDINAL , second sub - paragraph , above ) . For securities not so listed and issued before the end of the Reference Period , the \" base value \" was \" such as may be determined by agreement between the Secretary of ORG and the ORG representative \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \" or , in default of such agreement , as may be determined by arbitration under this LAW to be the base value which the securities would have had under section DATE ... if they had been listed \" on the ORG throughout the Reference Period ( section FAC ) ) . The \" base value \" of unlisted securities issued after DATE was , generally , their issue price ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "Among the reasons given by the Government for the choice of this reference period were : the need to avoid a period when the value of the shares was distorted by the prospect of nationalisation ; subject to this , the need to take as recent a period as possible ; and the general decline in share prices DATE , when the compensation terms were announced , making it desirable to choose a period reflecting the mid - point of the share market over DATE .", "In determining the \" base value \" of unlisted securities , ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) was to have regard to \" all relevant factors \" ; when the acquired company was the subsidiary of a company all or part of whose shares were listed on ORG and carried on an undertaking which \" formed a substantial part of the undertakings of the group of companies of which the company and the parent company were members \" , CARDINAL of those factors was the stock market quotation of the parent company \u2019s shares ( section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "During negotiations , the Secretary of ORG , whilst having some scope for judgment , could not offer by way of compensation more than was possible under the statutory formula . ORG , for its part , was in no way bound by the amount offered or contended for in negotiations . In determining compensation , no regard was had to any grants to the nationalised undertakings from public funds .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under section DATE , compensation was not payable until the \" base value \" of the nationalised shares and the amount of any deduction to be made under LAW ( see paragraphs TIME below ) had been determined . However , it was provided that , at any time after DATE , \" such sum may be paid on account of compensation ... as the Secretary of ORG thinks fit ... \" . The payments on account made to the applicants in the present case were unconditional .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( a ) Compensation was to take the form of government stock , known as \" Compensation Stock \" ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Interest thereon was to accrue from DATE ( Schedule CARDINAL ) . The rate of such interest was to be determined by the ORG , as were the conditions as to repayment , redemption and other matters ( section CARDINAL ) .", "( b ) Compensation was not subject to tax on receipt , but disposal or redemption of Compensation Stock gave rise to liability to capital gains tax , the gain being calculated by reference to the cost of acquisition by the shareholder of the nationalised shares . However , by virtue of LAW of LAW DATE , the replacement of ORG by new business assets could give rise to an entitlement to \" roll - over relief \" , whereby liability to tax would be deferred until the new assets , or their successors , were ultimately disposed of . Such relief was available only where the recipient of ORG was a company and where the nationalised concern had been either a subsidiary , PERCENT owned , of that company or a wholly - owned subsidiary of a consortium consisting of CARDINAL or fewer companies ; it could not be claimed by a private individual , regardless of the size of his shareholding in the nationalised concern . These criteria were intended to limit the ambit of \" roll - over relief \" to cases where the shares in the nationalised company had been held as a business asset rather than as a purely financial investment .", "CARDINAL . ORG During the course of the NORP proceedings on the various ORG spokesmen stated that the undertakings to be nationalised were to continue to operate as normal commercial concerns until DATE . And , in fact , all the companies with which the present case is concerned did so .", "Although the undertakings remained private property until DATE , LAW contained a number of safeguarding provisions whose general aim was to ensure that , DATE ( DATE ) and DATE , there was no abnormal action by the existing owners or management which might be detrimental to the public sector . The provisions , whose broad effect is summarised below , did not apply if the action in question had been approved by the Secretary of ORG ; retroactive approval was possible in certain circumstances , notably in respect of \" material transactions \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Government gave assurances that the safeguarding provisions would not be used in such a way as to penalise reasonable action taken in the normal course of business and in good faith .", "CARDINAL . ORG Holders of securities of the acquired companies were entitled to dividends and interest thereon for all periods DATE . However , limits were in effect imposed on the amount of dividends and interest paid pursuant to resolutions passed between the end of the Reference Period and Vesting Day : if the date of the resolution lay between CARDINAL DATE and the \" Safeguarding Date \" ( generally CARDINAL DATE , being the date of the statement in ORG outlining the compensation terms and safeguarding provisions ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the amount of any payments in excess of the permissible maximum fell , under section CARDINAL , to be deducted from the compensation payable for shares under section CARDINAL ; if the date of the resolution was after the Safeguarding Date and before Vesting Day , the directors of the acquired company were personally liable to the relevant public corporation for any such excess ( section CARDINAL ) . For a dividend , the permissible maximum was generally either the net revenue of the company for the period in respect of which the dividend was declared or the amount of the most recent ordinary dividend previously paid ( whichever was the less ) ; for interest , it was the minimum necessary to avoid default on obligations or the carrying over of interest for subsequent payment ( section CARDINAL ) . During the NORP debates , the Government gave assurances that higher payments would be authorised if the circumstances warranted .", "CARDINAL . ORG and NORP were protected against losses occasioned by \" material \" or \" onerous \" transactions entered into by an acquired company DATE . Broadly speaking , a \" material transaction \" was one , such as a special dividend , that involved the direct or indirect transfer of company assets to shareholders and an \" onerous transaction \" was CARDINAL that was unusual or unreasonable and foreseeably caused loss to the company ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . If the transaction had been entered into between CARDINAL DATE and the Safeguarding Date - or in certain cases LAW ( DATE for the shipbuilding industry or CARDINAL DATE for the aerospace industry ) - , the net loss caused thereby to the relevant public corporation fell , under section DATE , to be deducted from the compensation payable for shares under LAW ; if the transaction had been entered into after the Safeguarding Date - or the Initial Date - and before Vesting Day , that corporation could institute proceedings before ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) to recover from the directors or the parties to the transaction the loss caused thereby and , in the case of an \" onerous transaction \" , to have the same declared void ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG There was also a general prohibition on the transfer away by an acquired company of certain assets , coupled with the possibility for the relevant public corporation to institute proceedings before ORG to have the damage suffered as a result of the transfer made good by the directors or the parties thereto ( section CARDINAL ) . If the transfer had been effected after DATE , the corporation could recover the assets , either by acquiring certain additional companies or by acquiring the assets themselves ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Secretary of ORG could in certain circumstances ( notably insolvency ) remove a company from the list of companies to be nationalised ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Questions arising as to the amount of the appropriate deduction to be made from compensation under LAW were to be determined by agreement between the Secretary of ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or , in default of such agreement , by ORG . The latter also had jurisdiction over various other issues arising under the safeguarding provisions .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW ) of the DATE Act provided that a ORG Representative was to be appointed in respect of each acquired company \" to represent the interests of holders of securities of that company in connection with the determination of the base value of those securities \" . He was to be appointed by the holders of the securities at a meeting held within a prescribed time - limit , failing which , by the Secretary of ORG ; he could be removed by resolution passed at a meeting of the security holders ( Schedule CARDINAL ) . His remuneration and expenses were to be met by the Secretary of ORG .", "The raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the institution of ORG Representative was that it was considered essential , in order to prevent negotiations and arbitration being rendered unworkable by a multiplicity of individual claims , that they be conducted , on behalf of the former owners , exclusively by a nominee representing their collective interests . As a result , although the individual shareholders had voting rights at ORG meetings , they had no direct standing in compensation negotiations .", "According to Sir PERSON , the Representative was not obliged to seek the ORG consent before agreeing to compensation in negotiations or to refer the question of compensation to arbitration if so requested by them ; in this applicant \u2019s view , a stockholder had , in practice , no means of ensuring that the Representative complied with his wishes , save for the aforesaid possibility of removal . According to the ORG , stockholders would have had a remedy in the domestic courts against a Representative for failure to comply either with his obligations under LAW or with his common - law obligations as agent . They further maintained that he could not refuse to institute arbitration proceedings if so directed by the stockholders or , probably , a majority of them and that , as a matter of pure practice , he would not agree the quantum of compensation in negotiations without their consent .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act established ORG . For the hearing of any proceedings , the ORG was to consist of a legally - qualified president ( appointed by the Lord Chancellor or , in the case of NORP proceedings , the Lord President of ORG ) and CARDINAL other members ( appointed by the Secretary of ORG after consultation with all ORG ) , CARDINAL being of experience in business and the other in finance .", "Criteria for the selection of members of the ORG - relating to their standing and experience and including a requirement that they should not have any connection with the companies nationalised - were worked out in consultation with ORG , who were also invited to make proposals as to suitable members .", "Members of the ORG were to hold office \" for such period as may be determined at the time of their respective appointments \" .

In assessing the \" base value \" , the ORG could hear argument about the weight to be attached to any relevant factor , but not about the alleged unfairness of the statutory formula , by which it was bound .", "The jurisdiction in relation to \" base value \" and deductions arose only \" in default of agreement \" between the Secretary of ORG and ORG , but the latter was free to refer the question of compensation to the ORG at any moment after Vesting Day . In the view of the Government - which was contested by Sir PERSON - , there was no legal bar to access to the ORG by an individual shareholder , unless and until agreement had been reached in negotiations . Thereafter , he could not seise the ORG even if he considered that the sum agreed was too small under the statutory formula .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On the passing of LAW , Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co. , a leading firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Government to advise them in the compensation procedures , set about valuing the companies concerned by issuing a questionnaire to all of them .

Shortly after the aforesaid announcement , the Minister of State indicated in a series of meetings with ORG that , within the confines of the statutory formula , ORG would be prepared to settle the remaining cases at amounts somewhat beyond those already offered in negotiations .

ORG In the compensation negotiations ORG and their advisers used the following CARDINAL methods of arriving at a hypothetical ORG quotation for unlisted shares .", "( a ) For most of the profitable companies an earnings - based valuation was applied . This method , which involved considering the company \u2019s historic and prospective post - tax earnings ( as at the Reference Period ) and applying thereto an appropriate multiplier ( price / earnings ratio ) assessed by comparison with listed companies , was used in all the cases with which the present proceedings are concerned , other than the Vosper ORG and the Yarrow Shipbuilders cases ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Since stock market quotations are not dependent solely on earnings , the ORG \u2019s accountants , in preparing their valuations , reviewed , where appropriate , the figure arrived at by the above method against the criteria of asset - backing and dividend yield .", "( b ) Where the acquired company was a subsidiary carrying on the main part of the total undertaking of a company all or part of whose shares were listed on ORG , a parent - company - related valuation was employed , in view of section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This method , which involved deducting from the parent company \u2019s average capitalisation during the Reference Period a valuation for the non - vesting elements in the group , or apportioning the capitalisation according to the contribution to group earnings of the vesting and the non - vesting elements , was used in the Vosper Thornycroft and the Yarrow Shipbuilders cases .", "( c ) In certain other cases , where the company acquired was not making a profit , recourse was had to an assets - based valuation , based on the hypothesis of an open - market sale of the assets during DATE .", "( d ) CARDINAL other unprofitable company was valued by a share - capital - related method that is at a discount to the nominal value of its issued share capital .", "CARDINAL .

ORG During the proceedings before the Commission and the ORG reference was made to a number of different methods of valuation of , and of compensating for , property nationalised or compulsorily acquired . The following is a brief outline of those methods .", "CARDINAL . ORG A ORG valuation for listed shares merely involves looking at the price for the shares on ORG on the specified date or dates .", "CARDINAL . ORG The method laid down by LAW for valuing unlisted shares ( the hypothetical ORG valuation ) involved estimating what price the shares would have had on ORG had they been listed during DATE . The estimate would be made by reference to the price of any comparable quoted shares and account would be taken of all information about the company that would have been available to ORG investors during that period . Thus , Messrs. ORG based their valuations primarily on data appearing in the ORG latest published accounts , which covered periods prior to the Reference Period , but they also made certain assumptions as to the interim - and more up - to - date - statements that would have been supplied to the stock market if the ORG shares had been listed . However , questions might arise concerning the precise information that would have been available to investors and the extent to which they might have foreseen an undertaking \u2019s future performance ( see , for example , paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , it is implicit in this method that the company \u2019s shares would be held by a number of different persons ; accordingly , when valuing a wholly - owned subsidiary on this basis , hypothetical assumptions may have to be made as to what its business policies would have been if its shares had been more widely owned .", "CARDINAL . ORG An alternative method is to consider what a single willing buyer would pay a willing seller ( or sellers ) for the whole of the shares in question . Here again , account would be taken of all the information that would be available to a buyer at the relevant time and an estimate would be made by reference to comparable quoted shares . However , this method could differ from the hypothetical ORG valuation method in CARDINAL respects . Firstly , it might be assumed that a single buyer in takeover negotiations might have more complete information than a ORG investor . Secondly , it would not be necessary to assume that the ownership of the shares was different from the reality or to make consequent assumptions as to the company \u2019s business policies . Thirdly , the price payable by a single buyer gaining control of a company would normally be materially higher than the ORG price , since the latter merely represents what would be paid for a small parcel of shares and does not reflect the market value of a controlling shareholding ; guidance as to the additional amount ( the \" control premium \" ) may be obtained from the premiums over previous market prices paid on successful takeover bids which , according to the applicants , averaged PERCENT in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The compensation provisions contained in LAW , whilst from many aspects similar to those contained in previous GPE nationalisation legislation , differed therefrom in the following particular respects :", "( a ) there was no choice of reference periods during which the nationalised shares were to be valued ;", "( b ) the reference period was , with certain exceptions , further removed in time from the vesting dates than the period fixed under earlier legislation , although the latter had always preceded those dates ;", "( c ) there was , in section PERSON ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , an express requirement that when valuing a subsidiary ORG was to have regard in certain circumstances to the stock market quotation of the parent company .", "Furthermore , under earlier measures using share valuation methods a substantial proportion of the securities nationalised had been listed on ORG and thus provided a comparison for valuing the unquoted securities . In the case of LAW , on the other hand , there was no quoted aerospace company and CARDINAL of the acquired shipbuilding companies , which was relatively small , had all its shares listed ; however , a number of the companies nationalised were subsidiaries whose activities formed a substantial part of the business of a parent , such as Vosper and PERSON , whose shares were listed .", "CARDINAL . Subject to the ultimate supremacy of ORG , it is a rule of GPE constitutional law that compensation is generally payable where property is taken by the ORG in the exercise of common - law powers .

PERSON FAC [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
