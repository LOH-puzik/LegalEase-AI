The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently detained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a journalist who had been working since DATE for the DATE newspaper PERSON , which was viewed as the principal publication medium of the \u201c ORG \u201d network and was closed down following the adoption of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL , issued on DATE in connection with the state of emergency ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) . From DATE onwards , he also lectured on comparative politics and NORP political history at a private university in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE leading up to the attempted military coup of DATE the applicant had been known for his critical views on the serving government \u2019s policies .", "CARDINAL . During TIME a group of members of the NORP armed forces calling themselves the \u201c Peace at ORG \u201d attempted to carry out a military coup aimed at overthrowing the democratically elected parliament , government and President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the attempted coup , soldiers under the GPE control bombarded several strategic State buildings , including the parliament building and the presidential compound , attacked the hotel where the President was staying , held the Chief of ORG hostage , attacked television channels and fired shots at demonstrators . During TIME of violence , CARDINAL people were killed and CARDINAL were injured .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the attempted military coup , the national authorities blamed the network linked to PERSON , a NORP citizen living in GPE ) and considered to be the leader of a terrorist organisation known as GPE / PDY ( \u201c ORG / Parallel State Structure \u201d ) . Several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government declared a state of emergency for a period of DATE as from DATE ; the state of emergency was subsequently extended for further periods of DATE by ORG , chaired by the President , most recently with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities gave notice to the Secretary General of ORG of a derogation from LAW CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of CARDINAL of the criminal investigations initiated in respect of suspected members of GPE / PDY , the applicant was arrested at his home in GPE and taken into police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , assisted by his lawyer , was questioned at ORG . During the questioning the applicant denied that he belonged to an illegal organisation . DATE , the GPE public prosecutor sought a judicial order for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on suspicion of belonging to an illegal organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , several editors and columnists of the DATE newspaper GPE , including the applicant , were brought before the GPE CARDINALth ORG . The magistrate questioned the applicant about his alleged acts and the accusations against him . The applicant stated that he had joined PERSON in order to be able to express his opinions ; that he was in favour of a democratic system corresponding to NORP standards ; that he was a secular person ; that he had not been aware of the threat posed by PERSON movement until after the attempted military coup of CARDINAL DATE ; and that he was opposed to any attack on democracy .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing , the magistrate , taking into account the contents of the articles written by the applicant DATE and finding that they had promoted the terrorist organisation in question , even after DATE ordered his pre - trial detention . He noted in that connection that although criminal proceedings had been instituted against ORG ( the editor - in - chief of PERSON ) before the attempted military coup , the applicant had continued to work for the newspaper and within the organisation \u2019s media structure . In the reasons given for ordering the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , the magistrate took the following factors into consideration : the strong suspicions against him ; the nature of the alleged offence and the fact that it was among the offences listed in LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) \u2013 the so - called \u201c catalogue offences \u201d , for which a suspect \u2019s pre - trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion ; the risk of absconding ; the state of the evidence and the risk of its deterioration ; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant \u2019s participation in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against the order for his pre - trial detention . He argued that there was no justification for detaining him . He also contended that his state of health was incompatible with the conditions in the prison where he was being held . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE CARDINALth ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a fresh application for his release . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE CARDINALth ORG rejected the application . In his decision , the magistrate stated in particular that it was an established fact that in order to prepare the ground for a military coup , the instigators needed to create the perception that the leaders of the country concerned were dictators . In his view , the applicant \u2019s articles accusing the President of GPE of being a dictator and calling for him to leave office had contributed to propaganda of that kind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with ORG in respect of several individuals , including the applicant , who were suspected of being part of the NORP / PDY media network , in particular accusing them , under LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW ( \u201c the CC \u201d ) , of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order , ORG and the government by force and violence , and of committing offences on behalf of a terrorist organisation without being members of it . The public prosecutor sought the imposition of CARDINAL aggravated life sentences and a sentence of up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the suspects , including the applicant . As evidence , he produced CARDINAL articles written by the applicant in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor submitted that the articles by the applicants and other individuals being charged in the same criminal proceedings against leading members of GPE / ORG \u2019s media wing could not be regarded as an expression of the ORG opposition to or criticism of the government . In the applicant \u2019s case , the public prosecutor contended that the expressions he had used had gone beyond the limits of freedom of the press in that they had undermined the rights of the official authorities and endangered social peace and public order . The public prosecutor found that the applicant had not hesitated to call for a possible military coup in his articles and , in short , had discharged functions serving the interests of the terrorist organisation in question .", "CARDINAL . During the criminal proceedings , the applicant denied having committed any criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings are currently pending before the GPE CARDINALth ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an individual application with ORG . He complained that he had been placed in pre - trial detention on account of his articles and alleged that this infringed his right to liberty and security and his right to freedom of expression and of the press . He also contended that his state of health was incompatible with the conditions of his continued detention since he was suffering from benign prostate hyperplasia , hyperlipidaemia , hyperuricemia , a multinodular goitre and sleep apnoea . On that account he asked ORG to indicate an interim alternative measure to detention , thus allowing him to be released pending trial .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to apply an interim measure of that kind . In reaching that decision , it noted firstly that the applicant \u2019s health had been regularly monitored from the start of his pre - trial detention , and that there was a ORG hospital inside the prison where he was being held . In that connection , it noted that on DATE , following a request he had made to that effect DATE , the applicant had been examined in prison by a general practitioner and had then been transferred to the urology department of the ORG hospital , where he had undergone a medical examination on DATE , and that his next appointment had been scheduled for DATE . In those circumstances , ORG found that keeping the applicant in pre - trial detention did not currently constitute a danger to his life or health . It added that should there be a change in his health or the conditions of his detention , he would be entitled to make a further application for an interim measure to secure his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court gave a judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which it held , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security and the right to freedom of expression and of the press .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the lawfulness of his pre - trial detention , ORG noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included : ( i ) an article entitled \u201c As if it were a religious war \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , published on DATE ; ( ii ) an article entitled \u201c The President must not remain a spectator \u201d ( \u201c Cumhurba\u015fkan\u0131 Seyirci Kalamaz \u201d ) , published on DATE ; ( iii ) an article entitled \u201c Between PERSON and the LOC \u201d ( \u201c FAC ile ORG \u201d ) , published on DATE ; ( iv ) an article entitled \u201c Yes , both the crime and the punishment are individual \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , published on DATE ; ( v ) an article entitled \u201c This nation is not empty - headed \u201d ( \u201c PERSON De\u011fildir \u201d ) , published on DATE ; and ( vi ) an article entitled \u201c The solution is a government without GPE \u201d ( \u201c PERSON Erdo\u011fan\u2019s\u0131z GPE \u201d ) , published on DATE . After examining the substance of these articles , ORG found that they mainly dealt with matters relating to the \u201c DATE [ DATE ] \u201d criminal investigations . In them the applicant had set out his opinion that the government members implicated in the criminal investigation in question should be brought to justice and that it was the responsibility of the President and the ruling party \u2019s leaders to take action to that end . He had contended that the government \u2019s reaction to the investigation had been unjust . ORG also observed that the applicant had written that if the investigation in question had been carried out on the orders of suspected members of GPE / PDY , they too should be the subject of a criminal investigation . However , he had maintained that it was unfair to accuse all members of the ORG movement . ORG further noted that in the articles in question , the applicant had not argued that the government should be overthrown by force . On the contrary , he had asserted that the ruling party would lose in the next elections . ORG also found that the article published DATE before the attempted military coup suggested that the applicant was opposed to coups d\u2019\u00e9tat . It held that he had been expressing opinions on a topical issue that were similar to those of the opposition leaders . In ORG view , the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of GPE / PDY . It added that the fact that he had expressed his views in PERSON could not in itself be deemed sufficient to infer that the applicant was aware of that organisation \u2019s goals . Accordingly , it concluded that \u201c strong evidence that an offence had been committed \u201d had not been sufficiently established in the applicant \u2019s case . Next , ORG examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of LAW ( providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war , general mobilisation , a state of siege or a state of emergency ) . On this point , it noted firstly that in a state of emergency , the LAW provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in LAW , to the extent required by the situation . It observed , however , that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre - trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence , the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless . Accordingly , it held that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security , as safeguarded by LAW , had been breached .", "CARDINAL . Next , with regard to the complaint concerning freedom of expression and of the press , ORG observed that the applicant \u2019s initial and continued pre - trial detention on account of his articles amounted to interference with the exercise of that right . Taking into account his arguments regarding the lawfulness of his pre - trial detention , ORG held that such a measure , which had serious consequences since it resulted in deprivation of liberty , could not be regarded as a necessary and proportionate interference in a democratic society . It further noted that it could not be clearly established from the reasons given for ordering and extending the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention whether the measure met a pressing social need or why it was necessary . Lastly , it found that it was clear that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press , in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles ( see paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . Regarding the application of LAW , it referred to its findings concerning the lawfulness of his pre - trial detention ( as set out in paragraphs CARDINAL of ORG judgment \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and held that there had also been a violation of freedom of expression and freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the conditions of his detention were incompatible with respect for human dignity , ORG noted that he had access to the treatment required for his condition within the prison where he was being held , and declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not submit a claim for compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage . Accordingly , ORG made no award under that head . The applicant claimed an unspecified sum in respect of the pecuniary damage he had allegedly sustained . ORG found no causal link between the violation established and the damage alleged on that account and dismissed the claim . However , it held that the applicant was to be awarded CARDINAL Turkish liras ( TRY \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) in respect of costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was still in pre - trial detention on the date of delivery of its judgment , ORG decided to transmit the judgment to the GPE CARDINALth ORG so that it could take \u201c the necessary action \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied to the GPE CARDINALth ORG for his client \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE CARDINALth ORG rejected the application , on the grounds that it had not yet received official notification of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE CARDINALth ORG , having observed that ORG judgment had been published on its website , examined of its own motion the question of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . Noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to ORG against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation , and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by ORG in the context of an individual application , it found that ORG did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file . On that account , ORG judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not in compliance with the law and amounted to usurpation of power ( g\u00f6rev gasb\u0131 ) . Regarding the effects of ORG judgments , ORG added that only judgments that were in accordance with the LAW and the law should be deemed to be final and binding . It noted , moreover , that more extensive reasoning could be given to justify keeping the applicant in pre - trial detention and that the file contained sufficient evidence against him in that regard . However , this would create the risk of prejudging the case ( ihsas - \u0131 rey ) , seeing that a detailed explanation of the reasons justifying continued detention could be seen as an expression of the judges\u2019 opinions before they had determined the merits of the case . Accordingly , ORG held that it was impossible to accept ORG judgment . Lastly , reiterating that the judgment in question amounted to usurpation of power , it held , by CARDINAL votes to one , that there was no need for it to give a decision on the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The judge in the minority observed in his dissenting opinion that he agreed with the majority \u2019s conclusion that ORG judgment was not in compliance with the law . However , noting that ORG judgments were final and binding on ORG , he expressed the view that the applicant \u2019s release should be ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection with a view to securing his release .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE CARDINALth ORG unanimously dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection , essentially on the same grounds as the CARDINALth ORG had done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further individual application with ORG . Relying on DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention , he complained mainly that he had been kept in pre - trial detention despite ORG judgment of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
