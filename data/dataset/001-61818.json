The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant founded a company called \u201c ORG \u201d ( hereinafter \u201c FOFE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP FOFE went into liquidation on CARDINAL DATE and was finally dissolved on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the liquidation proceedings the applicant filed his claim against the estate , claiming MONEY ( ORG ; approximately ORG CARDINAL ) , plus interest , in respect of unpaid salaries and other claims related to his employment contract with ORG . As the estate contested most of the applicant \u2019s claims , the parties instituted civil proceedings against each other before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) of GPE . The estate of ORG argued that the applicant had not been an employee of the company but had rather held an executive position as he had owned all its shares , and insisted that the applicant be ordered to reimburse to the estate certain assets he had allegedly transferred from the company to himself before the company was dissolved . The claims made by the parties against each other were jointly considered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that CARDINAL of the main issues in the civil proceedings was whether the applicant had been in an executive position in the company or not .", "CARDINAL . During a preparatory hearing at ORG , on DATE , the representatives of ORG named , among others , PERSON , President of ORG of ORG , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , both former members of ORG and PERSON also its former Executive Director , to give evidence on their behalf . The applicant named PERSON , former Managing Director of ORG , the above - mentioned Mr PERSON , and Mr GPE , to be heard as his witnesses concerning his position in the company .", "CARDINAL . In his written observations of CARDINAL DATE to ORG in respect of the estate \u2019s claims the applicant stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The estate of ORG has called PERSON and PERSON , both of whom were members of its Board of Directors and the latter also its Executive Director , to give evidence . We will also hear them in respect of exactly the same issues on which we will examine Mr J.S.", "With the support of the above - mentioned witnesses we will prove that [ the applicant ] has not had any close connections with ORG since he resigned from its ORG on DATE , and that he has had no decisive position in the company . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At another preparatory hearing , on DATE , ORG repeated that they would call ORG as a witness . The applicant named the witnesses he had named on DATE and further named PERSON who would give evidence about the applicant \u2019s tasks . ORG decided on DATE that ORG would be summoned by the court ex officio .", "CARDINAL . At yet another preparatory hearing in the case , on TIME DATE , ORG repeated their intention to hear ORG as their witness . According to ORG TIME from that last preparatory hearing the applicant had named CARDINAL witnesses , namely Mr GPE , Mr PERSON , Mr ORG and Mr NORP Witness Mr GPE was mentioned in the list of the adverse party \u2019s witnesses only .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter ORG decided that the preparatory stage of the proceedings had ended and that the main hearing would be held that DATE at QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . A.P. failed to appear before ORG on DATE , having informed the court in advance that he would be in GPE at the time of the hearing and would not be available until DATE . The estate of ORG withdrew their request to call ORG as a witness . Thereupon the applicant appointed PERSON as a witness on his behalf and requested that the main hearing be adjourned until DATE . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request , holding , in the light of the other evidence , that the hearing of ORG was not likely to be of assistance for discovering the truth . ORG decision was repeated in its judgment delivered on DATE , in which it was found that the applicant had not been an employee but rather had occupied a leading position in ORG . Most of the applicant \u2019s claims were rejected , with the exception of LAW ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for unpaid salaries . The applicant was , inter alia , ordered to refund ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to ORG in compensation for the assets he had transferred from the company . He was also ordered to pay ORG MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in compensation for ORG \u2019s legal fees and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) , requesting an oral hearing and calling PERSON as his witness . He argued that the hearing of ORG as a former Executive Director of ORG would be necessary for ascertaining the truth in respect of the applicant \u2019s status in the company . He noted that ORG had informed ORG of his journey to GPE at the time of the hearing but had simultaneously given the dates when he would be available . ORG had been summoned by phone to appear before ORG DATE before the hearing of DATE . It had been impossible for him to cancel his business meeting in GPE at such short notice . The applicant alleged that his request to adjourn the hearing in order to call ORG as a witness had been inconvenient for the presiding judge of ORG in respect of the timetable for the drafting of the decision . The hearing of ORG was even more important at this stage as ORG had not found the statement of PERSON to be credible in every aspect . If the court had heard ORG , who would have confirmed that the applicant had not been in any decisive position in FOFE , it would have been difficult for ORG to decide as it did .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld ORG decision on DATE , rejecting the applicant \u2019s request to hold an oral hearing . ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant ] has called CARDINAL witnesses before ORG . In so far as he has called PERSON A.P. , ORG notes that ORG had been appointed as a witness in FAC only during the main hearing . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW a party must not , in a case amenable to settlement , adduce a circumstance or evidence that he has not adduced in the preparation of the case , unless he establishes a probability that he had a valid reason for not doing so . [ The applicant ] has not established such a valid reason for appointing ORG as a witness only at the main hearing . Thus , the appointment of ORG as a witness must be regarded as if it had only taken place during the ORG proceedings . In so far as new witnesses have been appointed and new evidence appearing in the annexes to the applicant \u2019s letter of appeal has been invoked , [ the applicant ] has not established a probability that he was unable to adduce the circumstance or evidence in ORG or that he had a justifiable reason for not doing so . ... No such reason has been established in respect of the written submissions and their annexes submitted by the parties to ORG after the relevant time - limit had elapsed , excluding the parts concerning the proposed stay of execution . In accordance with LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL , and LAW , subsection CARDINAL , as well as LAW , Section CARDINAL , of LAW , ORG leaves the submissions and their annexes unexamined , excluding the request concerning stay of execution , and rejects [ the applicant \u2019s ] request to hold an oral hearing . Thus also the request to return the case to ORG is rejected as being unnecessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant applied to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) for leave to appeal , noting that ORG had refused to call ORG as a witness because it had found that it was unnecessary in the light of the other evidence invoked . ORG had , thus , found that the applicant had not been prevented from calling him had the hearing of his evidence been necessary . ORG had , however , found that the applicant had appointed PERSON as his witness only at a stage of the proceedings when he was already precluded from doing so , i.e. at the main hearing . The applicant had , however , appointed PERSON as his witness already in a preparatory meeting on DATE and repeated the request on CARDINAL DATE in his written observations to ORG . He had also had a relevant reason to request that ORG be heard as the estate of FOFE DATE which had originally called ORG as a witness \u2013 had withdrawn their request only at the main hearing . ORG had been the Executive Director of ORG and , as such , was in the best position to give a statement of the applicant \u2019s position in the company for the period from DATE until the insolvency proceedings . Therefore the applicant found it very important that ORG would hear ORG as a witness or , alternatively , return the case to a lower court in order to hear the witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalk ) , the evidence that is going to be presented and what is intended to be proved with each piece of evidence , must be determined during the preparation of the hearing . This means that the parties must , during the preparatory hearings , name all those persons whom they wish to call as witnesses in the main hearing .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW , a party must not in the main hearing adduce a circumstance or evidence that he has not adduced in the preparation , unless he establishes a probability that he had a valid reason for not doing so . Should the party show a valid reason , however , he may adduce the new circumstance or piece of evidence in the main hearing irrespective of the provisions of LAW , LAW .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of the provisions of LAW , LAW is to ensure compliance with the fair trial requirements . It is a requirement of a fair trial that the adverse party is informed beforehand of each piece of evidence ( including witnesses ) to be presented in the main hearing .", "CARDINAL . There are separate provisions concerning the submission of new evidence before a Court of Appeal in LAW , LAW of LAW . Before the entry into force of the LAW amending LAW ( PERSON ) the said provisions were contained in LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . According to these provisions , in a civil case , the appellant shall not in ORG refer to other circumstances or evidence than those presented in ORG , unless he establishes a probability that he was not able to refer to the circumstance or evidence in the district court or that he had a justifiable reason for not doing so .", "CARDINAL . Even if a party to the proceedings , under LAW , LAW of LAW , has named his witnesses in the preparatory hearing , or had a valid reason for not invoking a certain circumstance or piece of evidence before the main hearing or the court of appeal hearing , the court may refuse to examine such a circumstance or piece of evidence as it considers clearly unnecessary . According to LAW , LAW ( DATE ) of the Code of Judicial Procedure , if a piece of evidence that a party wishes to present pertains to a fact that is not material to the case or that has already been proven , or if the fact can be proven in another manner with considerably less inconvenience or cost , the court shall not admit this piece of evidence .", "CARDINAL .
