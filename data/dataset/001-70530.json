The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She is a journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP language newspaper \u201c The New Order \u201d published an article entitled \u201c Traffic Police \u2013 My Star \u201d signed by the applicant . The article stated inter alia that :", "\u201c ... This is quite a banal story for us regular citizens , and a normal phenomenon for the traffic inspectors . In any event , it serves as a good example of the \u2018 star ORG suffered by the traffic inspectors .", "A person was driving his PERSON on PERSON Street . Let us call him \u2018 Victor\u2019 . When he approached the PERSON cel Mare and GPE crossroads , the traffic lights turned red and , like any normal person , PERSON pressed the brakes . But people who abide by the rules are not always lucky . A luxurious speeding Opel ran into the old PERSON . Both cars were damaged , but the PERSON was damaged more . PERSON stayed at the place of the accident , as any man believing in the strictness of the law would do , awaiting the arrival of the police and their wise and fair verdict . The owner of the \u2018 Opel\u2019 though , aware of his guilt , hit the gas and disappeared .", "Before long a Sergeant of the traffic police arrived and began to take measurements and investigate , making notes in a note book . At the height of the investigation the owner of the ORG arrived , but without his car . He waited until the policeman finished his work , and then said that he would go to ORG to solve the problem .", "At ORG the CARDINAL car owners and the policeman were received by a person of a venerable age with the epaulets of a LOC ( later we found out that he worked in the emergency department ) . The owner of the Opel addressed him in a very friendly way , calling him \u2018 Jora\u2019 . The Sergeant - major PERSON approached the young Sergeant , who investigated the accident , and asked him in a way more like an order than a question : \u2018 How many years have you been working for the Traffic Police?\u2019 DATE ... \u2018 But I worked for DATE ; therefore you should listen to me . Do n\u2019t write anything , let the people come to an agreement themselves and the guilty one ( i.e. the owner of the Opel ) pay to the second one approximately CARDINAL PERSON ( MDL ) . In any event his car is a flea - pit , and there is no need to make a lot of fuss.\u2019", "The owner of the \u2018 flea - pit\u2019 , who can not be considered a wealthy man , almost lost the power of speech when he heard that . How was it possible to offer him such a petty sum for his severely damaged car ? Since the victim would not agree , Sergeant - Major PERSON and the owner of the Opel increased somewhat the amount , bargaining for each leu . Afraid that he would not get anything , PERSON agreed to the sum of MDL DATE . He later had his car fixed by some acquaintances , who laughed at him for being fooled like a boy . PERSON spent a little bit more than MDL CARDINAL for the repair \u2013 a sum that might seem ridiculous to some traffic inspectors . For PERSON though , this is really big money . But it is not the money , that he \u2019s worried about , but the way he was treated at ORG , in particular this Sergeant - Major PERSON , who treated him as a man from the lowest strata , almost as a nonentity . After DATE PERSON went to PERSON and asked for his driver \u2019s licence back . ORG promised to return the driver \u2019s licence , but only on condition that PERSON paid a fine of MDL CARDINAL . PERSON was dumbfounded . \u2013 \u2018 Why should I pay a fine ? What did I do?\u2019 PERSON , answered very furiously : \u2018 Once I say that you should pay , then you should pay , without asking any questions.\u2019", "PERSON , who was very upset about the absurdity of the situation , warned the policeman that he would complain to his superiors . ORG , understanding that there was no way for him to prevail , literally went ballistic . He threw the driver \u2019s licence in PERSON \u2019s face , shouting like a madman .", "- \u2018 He would complain ! Who are you ? Take your documents and get out of here , and pray God not to come back to the Traffic Police , because otherwise you \u2019ll get into big trouble.\u2019", "The man took his driver \u2019s licence and left FAC , meditating on what PERSON could possibly do to him if ever he came back ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE a policeman named GPE lodged a civil action for defamation against the applicant and the publishing office of the newspaper with ORG . Relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , the complainant alleged that the article contained statements which were defamatory of him .", "CARDINAL . DATE several oral hearings were held and several witnesses were heard . The applicant and the newspaper stated that the facts presented in the article were a simple reproduction of the story told by PERSON , the victim of the road accident . PERSON gave evidence to that effect . They further stated that the information contained in the article was not of a defamatory nature and could not harm in any way the reputation of the complainant , particularly since it did not contain his full name , but only a diminutive of his first name .", "CARDINAL . By its judgment of DATE , ORG found that the information contained in the article was defamatory of GPE and did not correspond to reality .
