Bernhauser , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the Graz Regional Court ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) convicted the applicant of partly attempted and partly realised drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . He was found , together with GPE , to have assisted in the shipment of QUANTITY of cocaine from GPE in GPE . The transport route via the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE to GPE had only been interrupted as a result of the seizure of the drugs by the GPE authorities in the port of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also found to have organised the shipment , once again together with GPE , of a further QUANTITY cocaine from GPE , via GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE to GPE in GPE , with the onward transportation by road to GPE being organised by investigators from ORG for Interior Affairs . Finally , the applicant and GPE were found to have attempted by means of those shipments to supply the above - mentioned quantities of illegal substances to contacts in LOC for further distribution .", "CARDINAL . According to the reasoning of the judgment of ORG , the applicant was the contact person of the NORP cocaine ORG group which entered into business with a NORP - Montenegrin buyers\u2019 group with GPE as mediator . GPE was known to ORG ( ORG ) and an informant ( \u201c PERSON ) was placed close to GPE by the GPE authorities . PERSON was well known to the authorities and had had business dealings with GPE in the past . He was not a police officer but was supervised by special agent GPE of the ORG . He had also worked for the ORG and the NORP authorities in a coordinated operation DATE to uncover international drug trafficking in LOC through GPE . Due to the conduct of PERSON , authorities learned in DATE that GPE had contacted an international group that was interested in establishing a NORP infrastructure through which to traffic counterfeit cigarettes and cocaine . The information included details of possible quantities and routes . GPE was looking for somebody who could provide the transport and the storage of the cocaine from GPE , where the drugs should be unshipped , to GPE . NORP authorities were asked by the ORG if they would provide these services to GPE in the course of an undercover operation . DATE and DATE , the NORP police authorities initiated undercover investigations , primarily into the NORP partners to the deal . NORP undercover police officers were introduced to GPE by PERSON and offered the required transport and storage services . GPE and the CARDINAL criminal groups accepted . During the business negotiations , the NORP group as well as the ORG group requested a security in case of loss of the drugs due to the conduct of the NORP authorities . The undercover officers offered a deposit of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL which was presented to the contact persons of the CARDINAL groups . After the security deposit was presented , the cocaine was shipped in LOC in CARDINAL tranches . On DATE the first container left the port of GPE , GPE , with a planned arrival date in GPE , GPE , of CARDINAL or DATE . On board were QUANTITY of best quality cocaine , consisting of QUANTITY of cocaine in pure form . However , the cocaine was seized and secured in the port of GPE , GPE , in the course of a police intervention by the GPE security authorities . The empty container was sent on to GPE . On DATE a second container with QUANTITY of cocaine was shipped . The first container arrived in GPE , GPE , on DATE and was unloaded by NORP undercover police officers . As agreed by the CARDINAL criminal organisations involved , they stored the shipped goods in which the drugs had been hidden , in a storage facility in GPE before passing them on to the group headed by PERSON and other distributors for sale in LOC . On DATE the applicant left GPE for GPE via GPE , and finally arrived in GPE on DATE . The objective of the trip was to have a representative of the NORP group present at the handover of the original freight papers . When the loading should have formally been handed over to the ORG group , the police arrested the applicant and the others .", "CARDINAL . There is no indication that at any point during the trial proceedings before ORG the applicant filed a request that the indictment be declared unlawful and that , as a consequence , all evidence obtained in the course of thereof be excluded from the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG attributed importance to the witness statements of the undercover officers who had explained \u2013 as set out in the reasoning of the judgment DATE credibly and in great detail the structure and organisation of the groups involved , the details of the deal , and the conversations held during the course of planning the crime . The court emphasised that the undercover ORG responsibility had been to put in place the planned infrastructure ( the storage , for example ) , not to simulate drug - purchasing . In view of the international dimension of the drug deal and the involvement of an obviously substantial NORP drug trafficking group , the court found it not abnormal that trust - generating measures such as the payment of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL as a security deposit had to be demonstrated by the undercover officers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s involvement was confirmed , inter alia , by the investigative results of a police officer in GPE who was able to confirm the contacts established early on between GPE and the applicant in LOC .", "CARDINAL . When determining the sentence to be imposed on the applicant , ORG stated as mitigating circumstances the lack of any criminal record of the applicant in GPE , the length of the proceedings , and the fact that the criminal acts had remained attempts only . However , the large quantities of illegal drugs involved were deemed to constitute an aggravating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a plea of nullity to ORG ) . In this plea he did not complain about incitement .", "CARDINAL . In the same submission the applicant lodged also an appeal against the sentence to ORG ( Berufung ) . In the appeal the applicant sought mitigation of the sentence and submitted , inter alia , that the first - instance court , in imposing the sentence , had disregarded the fact that the offences had been prompted by actions on the part of domestic and NORP police authorities . He further stated that the ORG had also approached the NORP police authorities with their plan to help realise a major drug deal , but the latter had declined the proposal as being unlawful . Only then had the ORG proposed the plan to the NORP authorities . The applicant alleged that neither the NORP group nor the presumed NORP buyers had had the intention of organising a drug shipment to GPE . That plan had been created \u2012 in contravention of NORP law \u2012 by the Agent S.F. together with NORP officials from ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) . Those acts on the part of the police authorities exceeded the bounds of simple provocation , especially taking into account that the offences of which the applicant was convicted would not have come to fruition had the NORP authorities not deposited ORG CARDINAL by way of a security deposit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Graz ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and decreased his sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It found firstly that the commercial character of the offences ( gewerbsm\u00e4ssige Begehungsweise ) had to be taken into consideration as an additional aggravating circumstance . As regards the significance attributed by the first - instance court to the length of the proceedings , ORG stated that , while acknowledging the length of the proceedings as a mitigating circumstance , ORG had not clearly quantified the reduction of the sentence related to that mitigating circumstance . Finally , concerning the provocation of the criminal offence that violated the fairness principle of LAW , ORG noted in respect of the co - convicted PERSON as follows :", "\u201c The objection of unlawful incitement , in breach of the principle of a fair trial under the first sentence of LAW , is well founded , as there was incitement to commit an offence , attributable to the ORG . This is especially true since the prosecuting authorities failed to prove that the appellant , although disposed to commit an offence , had not been induced DATE in particular via the provision of the intermediate storage facility for the drugs by the undercover investigators and the support they provided for transporting the drugs to that storage facility \u2013 to commit and continue to commit the specific punishable acts of which he was accused . The unlawful incitement should also be remedied by means of an explicit , measurable reduction in sentence . \u201d", "Applying this reasoning to the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG further found that :", "\u201c The consequent breach of the right to a fair trial also found in the case of the accused PERSON is likewise remedied by the appellate court by means of a reduction in sentence . This was taken into account to some extent by the first - instance court DATE albeit not in quantitative terms \u2013 in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings . The sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , which was otherwise commensurate with the degree of guilt and the seriousness of the offence ( regard being had to the corrected factors considered in determining sentence and the assessment thereof ) , is reduced by DATE for each of the CARDINAL breaches of the Convention , resulting in a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Proceedings ( Strafprozessordnung CARDINAL ) in force until DATE stated that authorities must not , on pain of imposition of a penalty , work towards the production of suspicious facts or the conviction of a suspect by inciting a person to commit , continue with or complete an offence , or by luring a suspect , through the intermediary of an undercover agent , to confess to an offence with the aim of using such confession in court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Police undercover operations were regulated in ORG CARDINALd to CARDINALe of LAW of LAW ( Sicherheitspolizeigesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW the CARDINAL possible remedies against a judgment passed by a bench of judges at ORG are a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) and an appeal against sentence ( GPE ) . A plea of nullity has to be addressed to ORG while an appeal against sentence has to be addressed to ORG . The remedies can be lodged either in the same written submission or separately . If the accused files a single written submission for both remedies , ORG will examine the case first .", "CARDINAL . A plea of nullity before ORG can be based on the specific grounds set out in LAW . The list of grounds for invalidity \u2012 which is exhaustive \u2012 deals with procedural aspects such as the ( alleged ) bias of a judge or a lack of the requisite representation by a defence counsel during the trial , and also aspects of the merits such as misinterpretation of the law .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a plea of nullity can be raised if during the main hearing the court in question has failed to deal with a request from an accused or if a [ procedural ] decision disregarding his request or conflicting with his declared objection has been taken by ORG and there has been a violation of either the law or fundamental procedural principles which seek to safeguard compliance with human rights \u2012 especially LAW \u2012 or other fundamental rights of the prosecution or the defense .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINALb of LAW , a plea of nullity can be raised if there are circumstances in which the act concerned is no longer a punishable offence or can no longer be prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW the plea of nullity has to name separately and specifically the grounds for invalidity about which it is complaining , otherwise ORG will not take these grounds into consideration .", "CARDINAL . If ORG finds CARDINAL or more grounds for invalidity well founded , it quashes the judgment and orders a re - trial .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG has dismissed the plea of nullity and the applicant has also challenged the sentence , ORG will transfer the case file to ORG . In this case , or if the accused has merely filed an appeal against the sentence , ORG will only examine the sentence imposed and not consider alleged errors in proceedings , the law or the establishment of facts by ORG . It may examine only the parameters which relate to ORG decision on the sentence and therefore re - examines the weighing up of mitigating and aggravating circumstances undertaken by the first - instance court . If ORG detects an imbalance in the weighing up of the first - instance court , it readjusts this balance by reviewing the sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
