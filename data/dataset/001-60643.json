The applicant formerly managed \u201c The Godfather Restaurant \u201d in GPE upon GPE , which was operated by a company of which the applicant was a director . Following an inquiry by ORG and ORG and Excise in DATE into the restaurant and the applicant , the company went into liquidation and ownership of the lease of the restaurant was transferred to a new company controlled by the applicant . However , the restaurant was run by a succession of management companies under short - term management contracts . The various companies were all registered for ORG NORP \u201d ) purposes but failed to make any LOC payments or returns to the ORG and Excise authorities . In addition , wages were paid to employees in cash and were not declared to ORG . The resulting loss of ORG was assessed at MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) and the accumulated losses in respect of ORG contributions were assessed at ORG . In DATE the applicant was declared bankrupt as a result of civil proceedings brought by ORG to recover unpaid tax .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and on DATE charged with various offences of fraudulently evading ORG . He was remanded in custody . His applications for bail on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE were refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted legal aid on DATE . The legal aid order covered both the committal hearings and the actual trial . The applicant was represented throughout the proceedings by a ORG ( \u201c QC \u201d ) , who was also a Recorder , a very experienced junior counsel and CARDINAL different firms of solicitors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE upon ORG committed the applicant for trial before ORG at GPE .", "CARDINAL . Preliminary hearings were held on DATE and DATE . At the hearing of PERSON the applicant was indicted with CARDINAL others on CARDINAL counts of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of GPE ( DATE and DATE ) and of taking steps with a view to the fraudulent evasion of ORG ( DATE and DATE ) . The applicant pleaded not guilty .", "CARDINAL . At none of these hearings did either the applicant or his legal team request the provision of an interpreter , nor suggest to the court that the applicant required the services of an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . At the trial on DATE , the applicant , on the advice of counsel , changed his plea to guilty . He was also indicted on another count of cheating the public revenue and pleaded guilty to that charge too . The court was informed that the applicant disagreed on the quantum of the sums which formed the basis of the plea with the consequence that further discussion was needed on this matter with the prosecution . Defence counsel informed the court for the first time that the applicant had :", "\u201c considerable difficulty in communicating , save in very simple concepts , in LANGUAGE . Now for the purpose of consultation we can get by , but one of the difficulties is that his LANGUAGE is very poor and his NORP is very NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Counsel invited the court to direct that an interpreter be present at the subsequent hearing , given that at either a hearing or indeed a plea :", "\u201c ... certain complicated matters might well have to be put before the court , and which he should understand as they are being put \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court granted this request and adjourned for reports to be written and for the parties to reach agreement on the issue of quantum , after convicting the applicant of all charges .", "CARDINAL . At the following hearing concerning sentence held on DATE , the court noted that no professional interpreter was present despite its earlier direction . The applicant 's counsel stated that :", "\u201c ... it appears that no arrangements have been made , in which case I think that we shall have to make do and mend . It may require an occasional adjournment if something needs to be explained . It has been discussed extensively and obviously already with the [ applicant ] and , although he may not follow the detail of the proceedings , he certainly knows the outline of what the prosecution will say . I imagine that their case will very much follow the summary , and he knows the burden of what I intend to say . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial judge asked whether anyone in court who knew the applicant was fluent in both NORP and NORP and could provide interpretation for the applicant . The applicant 's counsel , without consulting his client , pointed out that the applicant 's brother was present , and the court agreed to make use of him , if need be . The applicant 's brother was never requested to translate any statement during the course of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment and disqualified from being a company director for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG seeking leave to appeal against sentence . In his application , the applicant was represented by the same legal team that had defended him at trial . In a letter to ORG , the applicant stated that he had been sentenced on the basis , which was incorrect , that he had pleaded guilty to frauds totalling GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL and that the real amount of the fraud was GBP CARDINAL . The applicant did not maintain in his application that he had been unable to understand the proceedings at the trial or to communicate effectively in court ; nor did he allege in his application that he should have been provided with the services of an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal was refused by the Single Judge on DATE and by the full ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought advice from the President of ORG on what action to take against his defence lawyers but did not receive any reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the Home Secretary , admitting that he had not declared GBP CARDINAL per week for staff wages due to the recession , and claiming that the real amount of the fraud was GBP CARDINAL and not GBP CARDINAL . He further complained that his counsel had failed to secure him the services of an interpreter at the trial on DATE and that this was of \u201c paramount importance \u201d for the purposes of the plea in mitigation . The applicant further observed that his ORG had misled the trial court by stating that his brother would be able to act as a translator , when his brother was unable either to speak or write in LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . The Home Secretary forwarded the applicant 's case to ORG ( \u201c the Commission \u201d ) . The applicant himself applied to the Commission , claiming inter alia that his lawyers should not have allowed him to plead guilty to the GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL fraud , as he had only intended to accept guilt in respect of GBP CARDINAL . Furthermore , his lawyers had failed to ensure the presence of an interpreter both at conferences in preparation for the trial and in court . He maintained that his brother did not speak LANGUAGE well enough and that he had not understood the charges or the legal process . He complained about his counsel , who , he claimed , did not understand NORP but nevertheless did not insist on an interpreter being present at conferences ; renounced the presence of a professional interpreter in court ; did not understand the case ; told him to plead guilty only at the trial , without explaining the consequences to him in detail and gave the court the wrong information that the applicant had accepted liability in respect of the total amount .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it had interviewed the applicant via an NORP interpreter and that it was apparent from telephone conversations between the applicant and the ORG that he did not have a very good command of LANGUAGE . The Commission observed that the applicant 's solicitor and counsel at trial did not accept that he lacked understanding either of the language or of the nature of the case against him . However , the Commission went on to note , inter alia , that", "a ) in the course of the proceedings the applicant 's solicitor had stated in counsel 's brief that the applicant \u201c has a grasp of LANGUAGE but is not very easily understood . At times , he says he wants an interpreter \u201d ;", "b ) the trial judge had seen fit to order the presence of an interpreter ;", "c ) on appeal , the applicant 's junior counsel had informed the court that the applicant did not have much of a command of LANGUAGE ;", "d ) the applicant 's counsel told the ORG that he would have wanted an interpreter present had there been a trial on the basis of a not guilty plea .", "CARDINAL . The Commission accepted that the applicant would have been able to understand the generality of the prosecution case but expressed the view that an interpreter ought to have been present when the prosecution case was explained to the applicant by his own representatives , given the complex nature of the evidence . Furthermore , he should have had the benefit of an interpreter when it came to considering the matter of changing his plea to guilty .", "CARDINAL . The Commission also accepted that the applicant 's brother was not an adequate interpreter , but considered that the lack of an interpreter at the trial was \u201c of much less significance than it was at the earlier stage \u201d . Further , the ORG found that too little time had been spent by the applicant 's lawyers explaining the case to him .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that there were grounds for finding that the plea was uninformed in that the applicant had not fully understood the nature of the case to which he was pleading , partly because of his inadequate understanding of the language , and because of the inadequate explanation of the case given to him by his legal representatives .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the Commission noted that ORG no longer had the power to allow an appeal against conviction if it did not think the conviction was unsafe but was dissatisfied in some way with the trial process , since there was no longer room for the separate notion of an \u201c unsatisfactory \u201d conviction . In the view of the Commission , whilst the applicant 's conviction was arguably unsatisfactory , it could not be said to be unsafe . Since the Commission did not consider that there was a real possibility that , if referred to ORG , the conviction and sentence would not be upheld , it decided not to make such reference .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant was released from prison on licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The leading domestic authorities on the provision of a interpreter are the cases of PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL CrAppR CARDINAL ) and ORG v the ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON Reading CJ , speaking on behalf of ORG , set out the following statement of principle ( pp . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c We have come to the conclusion that the safer , and therefore the wiser , course , when the foreigner accused is defended by counsel , is that the evidence should be interpreted to him , except when he or counsel on his behalf expresses a wish to dispense with the translation , and the judge thinks fit to permit the omission ; the judge should not permit it unless he is of the opinion that by reason of what has passed before the trial , the accused substantially understands the evidence to be given and the case to be made against him at the trial . To follow this practice may be inconvenient in some cases , and may cause some further expenditure of time ; but such a procedure is more in consonance with that scrupulous care of the accused 's interest which has distinguished the administration of justice in our criminal courts , and therefore it is better to adopt it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Reading 's judgment in PERSON was reinforced in the more recent case of ORG v the ORG in DATE . Speaking on behalf of ORG , Lord PERSON stated :", "\u201c Their Lordships have no doubt that the course advocated by Lord Reading CJ in PERSON v PERSON is a highly desirable one and should be followed wherever a foreign defendant , not fully conversant with the language of the proceedings , is represented by counsel . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
