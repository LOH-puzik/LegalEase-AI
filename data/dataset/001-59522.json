On DATE , after PERSON death , the applicant \u2019s mother lodged an application to set aside the decision of DATE . On DATE the Minister for Economic Affairs declared the entirety of the proceedings since the DATE expropriation decision null and void on account of a manifest mistake in law .

In the absence of such a deed , and where no one had been in possession of the property long enough to acquire title to it by adverse possession , the assets of the estate were deemed to comprise only the possession ( posiadanie ) of the property , not the title to it .", "ORG also noted that the appeal had been lodged after the expiry of the time - limit ( DATE after the disputed decision ) set by LAW , but considered that questions relating to property law required special protection and that it would have been detrimental to GPE interests to dismiss the application for being out of time because to do so would have infringed a right which was actually vested in another person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , to which the case had been remitted , ruled that the applicant \u2019s GPE estate should be shared equally between the applicant and his sister . The assets of the estate comprised the disputed property . The decision was identical in substance to the CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
