There , police officers had allegedly taken the applicant to a police station , interviewed him without an interpreter , and held him without food or water for TIME . After his release they had handed him an order to leave the country , which the applicant had thrown away . He had taken a train for GPE , slept in a railway station , received food from a church and , finally , after DATE in GPE , travelled on to GPE . He stated that he had left GPE because the ORG had come to his village and had asked his father to cooperate with them , which he had refused to do . Thereupon , the ORG had kidnapped his father and brother , and the applicant had been afraid that he would suffer the same destiny if he stayed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to his age , the applicant claimed to have been born on CARDINAL December CARDINAL according to the NORP calendar . He stated that in GPE he had been told to say that he was born on DATE , whereas a conversion of his birth date into the Gregorian calendar would give a birth date of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant mentioned that he had a birth certificate showing that he was DATE . However , he was not entirely certain about his date of birth .", "CARDINAL . When asked whether he had lodged an asylum request in GPE , the applicant replied in the negative , stating that he wanted to lodge his asylum application in GPE , not in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request under LAW and declared that GPE had jurisdiction in respect of asylum proceedings pursuant to LAW taken in conjunction with LAW no .

With reference to a number of country reports concerning asylum proceedings in GPE , ORG found that asylum requests could be lodged in GPE at any police station or in the local PERSON . An asylum - seeker had to present himself personally to lodge a request . The NORP authority would first examine the question of the applicability of the Dublin Regulation and would then forward the request to CARDINAL of CARDINAL Territorial Commissions to be dealt with . With regard to access to subsistence in GPE , ORG referred to legislation on the provision to asylum - seekers of shelter or financial support and access to medical treatment in accordance with the relevant ORG directives .

As to the order to leave the country , the embassy explained that an illegal immigrant received an order to leave the country within DATE . If he or she did not leave the country , his illegal presence would become a criminal act which could lead to him or her being detained .

Furthermore , it found the applicant \u2019s story about his stay in GPE contradictory and not credible . With reference to the \u201c effet utile \u201d principle of Community law , it concluded that the applicant had thus not substantiated his claim of a real risk under LAW sufficiently for the sovereignty clause to be engaged under LAW . Furthermore , any possible criticism with regard to the treatment of refugees arriving by boat in the south of GPE would not apply to the applicant as a returner to the north of GPE under that Regulation .", "CARDINAL .
