On DATE the apartment where the applicant was living was searched by the police , with the apparent subsequent approval of ORG . Neither the applicant nor any other representative of the household was present .

On DATE , under an order issued by an investigator and approved by ORG , the applicant was placed DATE preliminary detention as of TIME and held at ORG .

In addition , at the time of his arrest the applicant had apparently attempted to abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the preliminary detention of the applicant for DATE until TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , together with CARDINAL other individuals , was charged with having committed the burglary of CARDINAL DATE . He was remanded in custody upon a decision of an investigator which was confirmed later in DATE by ORG . In ordering the remand in custody , the investigator stated that the applicant lacked a permanent address , that he had committed numerous other burglaries , that he might re - offend and that he might abscond as he had apparently done in DATE when a national arrest warrant had been issued against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , under an order issued by an investigator , the charges against the applicant were amended to include another CARDINAL burglaries and his detention on remand was maintained . In ordering the continued detention , the investigator cited the gravity of the offences with which the applicant had been charged , the likelihood that he might abscond and his personality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against his detention . He maintained that his continued detention was unwarranted as there was no danger that he would abscond or re - offend because , inter alia , he had a permanent address in another city and his brother could pay his bail . The applicant also relied on LAW in his submissions .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on DATE . The court found that the applicant had been charged with a serious offence which warranted mandatory detention . In addition , the court concluded that the applicant might abscond because he did not have any personal identity documents , had no permanent address and was apparently residing in an apartment rented by CARDINAL of his friends . It also found that it was likely that he would re - offend considering the fact that he had perpetrated the offences with which he had been charged during the operational period of a previous DATE suspended sentence . In respect of the arguments pertaining to LAW , the court examined them and found that the applicant 's continued detention was in conformity with the exceptions provided in the said provision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed another appeal against his detention on CARDINAL DATE arguing that there was no longer a danger that he might abscond or re - offend because his brother was willing to pay his bail , support him financially and provide him with employment .", "CARDINAL .

The court found , inter alia , that the applicant had failed to provide evidence that he even had a brother and was unable to indicate where the said brother lived , what kind of business he was running and where .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed his third appeal against his detention arguing that he had been in detention for DATE and that there was no longer a danger that he might abscond or re - offend because his brother was willing to pay his bail , support him financially and provide him with employment .", "CARDINAL . An indictment was filed against the applicant on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL .

For undisclosed reasons the hearing was postponed to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG dismissed the applicant 's third appeal at its hearing on DATE . The court found that the applicant had been charged with a serious offence and that he might abscond because he did not have a permanent address and was residing in an apartment rented by CARDINAL of the co - accused . It also found that it was likely that he would re - offend considering the fact that he had perpetrated the offences with which he had been charged during the operational period of a previous DATE suspended sentence . The decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a fourth appeal of the applicant against his detention filed on an unspecified date , ORG found in his favour on CARDINAL DATE . On appeal by the prosecuting authorities the decision was quashed by ORG on DATE . The latter court found that the applicant might abscond because he did not have a permanent address and was residing in an apartment rented by CARDINAL of his friends . It also found that it was likely that he would re - offend considering his past criminal tendencies and that he lacked employment .", "CARDINAL . The subsequent development of the criminal proceedings is unclear . It is also unknown whether , and when , the applicant was released or granted bail . However , as of the date of the applicant 's submissions of DATE , the case was still pending before the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended , which the Government did not challenge , that as from CARDINAL DATE he was detained for DATE at ORG and was then transferred to ORG where he remained at least until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant 's submission the cells were small , overcrowded and below street level . There was no natural light or fresh air in the cells . Quite often there were rodents and cockroaches . A bucket was provided for the sanitary needs of the detained . There was no hot water , soap or other toiletries . The applicant was not permitted to go out of his cell for exercise . The food provided was of insufficient quantity and substandard . The applicant was not allowed to read newspapers or books .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant 's submission the conditions in the Pazardzhik Prison were slightly better than those in ORG . Similarly , though , the food was insufficient and of the same inferior quality ; the cells were small and overcrowded ; fresh air and light were insufficient and a bucket was provided for the sanitary needs of the detained . Limited exercise was provided in the prison yard .", "CARDINAL . Under ORG , as in force at the relevant time , the police were empowered , on the basis of an order to that affect , to arrest and take a person into custody who , inter alia , had committed an offence or whose identity could not been ascertained due to lack of appropriate personal identity documents ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . A person taken into police custody had the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to appeal against his detention to the domestic courts , which were required to immediately rule on such an appeal ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) . Police custody could not be longer than TIME ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a reported case of DATE , ORG upheld a finding of a lower court that an order for taking a person into police custody had been unlawful due to lack of legal grounds ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , V \u043e\u0442\u0434. \u043d\u0430 ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .

It appears that divergent interpretations of the above provisions were observed in the initial period of their application upon their entry into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG clarified that the amended LAW excluded any possibility of a mandatory detention . In all cases the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the accused and of a real danger of him absconding or committing an offence had to be established by the authorities . The presumption under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL was only a starting point of analysis and did not shift the burden of proof to the accused ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , LAW ORG provided that in the course of an enquiry ( i.e. when there is insufficient evidence to initiate formal criminal proceedings ) a search of LOC could be conducted only in the course of examining a crime scene and if its immediate execution was the only possibility to collect and secure evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , LAW ORG provided that a search of LOC may be carried out if there is probable cause to believe that objects or documents , which may be relevant to a case , would be found in them . Such a search could be ordered by the trial court ( during the trial phase ) or by the prosecutor ( during the pre - trial phase ) ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A search of LOC was to be conducted in the presence of witnesses and the person using them or an adult member of his family . In case the person using them or an adult member of his family could not be present , the search was to be conducted in the presence of the residence 's manager or a representative of the municipality ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There was no special procedure through which a search warrant issued by a prosecutor could be challenged . Thus , the only possible appeal was a hierarchical one to the higher prosecutor ( Article CARDINAL ) , which did not have suspensive effect ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) provides that the ORG is liable for damage caused to private persons by ( a ) the illegal orders , actions or omissions of government bodies and officials acting within the scope of , or in connection with , their administrative duties ; and ( b ) the organs of the investigation , the prosecution and the courts for unlawful pretrial detention , if the detention order has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .

In respect of unlawful searches of LOC , the only reported case dates DATE where ORG examined , on appeal , an action for damages stemming from an allegedly unlawful search and seizure conducted by the authorities in the home of the claimant . In that particular case , the court rescinded the judgment of the lower court and remitted the case solely because the latter court had failed to examine the action under LAW ORG , but had rather examined it as a tort action .

The ORG visited GPE in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . ORG and ORG were visited in DATE . There are also general observations about the problems in all ORG detention facilities in the DATE , DATE and DATE reports .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that most , albeit not all , of the ORG detention facilities were overcrowded . With the exception of CARDINAL detention facility where conditions were slightly better , the conditions were as follows : cells did not have access to natural light ; the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently ; ventilation was inadequate ; the cleanliness of the bedding and the cells as a whole left much to be desired ; detainees could access a sanitary facility twice a day ( morning and evening ) for TIME and could take a DATE shower ; outside of the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilets , detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in buckets inside the cells ; although according to the establishments ' internal regulations detainees were entitled to a \u201c DATE walk \u201d of TIME , it was often reduced to TIME or not allowed at all ; no other form of out - of - cell activity was provided to persons detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity . In particular , the DATE 's \u201c hot meal \u201d generally consisted of a watery soup ( often lukewarm ) and inadequate quantities of bread . At the other meals , detainees only received bread and a little cheese or halva . Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu . Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery \u2013 not even a spoon was provided .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that family visits and correspondence were only possible with express permission by a public prosecutor and that , as a result , detainees ' contacts with the outside world were very limited . There was no radio or television .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the NORP authorities had failed in their obligation to provide detention conditions which were consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that \u201c almost without exception , the conditions in the ORG detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading \u201d . In reaction , the NORP authorities agreed that the ORG delegation 's assessment had been \u201c objective and correctly presented \u201d but indicated that the options for improvement were limited by the country 's difficult financial circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG recommended to the NORP authorities , inter alia , that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided , that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly , that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products ( soap , toothpaste , etc . ) , that custodial staff be instructed that detainees should be allowed to leave their cells during DATE for the purpose of using a toilet facility unless overriding security considerations required otherwise , that the regulation providing for TIME exercise per day be fully respected in practice , that cell lighting and ventilation be improved , that the regime of family visits be revised and that pre - trial detainees be more often transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed . The possibility of offering detainees TIME outdoor exercise per day was to be examined as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . The ORG established that ORG had CARDINAL cells , situated in the basement , and at the time of the visit accommodated QUANTITY detainees , including QUANTITY women in a separate cell .", "CARDINAL . Six cells measuring QUANTITY were designed to accommodate CARDINAL detainees ; the other CARDINAL , intended for CARDINAL occupants , measured CARDINAL - and - QUANTITY . This occupancy rate was being complied with at the time of the visit and from the living space standpoint was deemed acceptable by the ORG . However , all the remaining shortcomings observed in the other ORG detention facilities \u2013 dirty and tattered bedding , no access to natural light , absence of activities , limited access to sanitary facilities , etc . \u2013 also applied there . Even the TIME exercise rule , provided for in the internal regulations and actually posted on cell doors , was not observed .", "CARDINAL . In this report the ORG found , inter alia , that the prison was seriously overcrowded and that prisoners were obliged to spend most of DATE in their dormitories , mostly confined to their beds because of lack of space . It also found the central heating to be inadequate and that only some of the dormitories were fitted with sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that new rules providing for better conditions had been enacted but had not yet resulted in significant improvements .", "CARDINAL . In most investigation detention facilities visited in DATE , with the exception of a newly opened detention facility in GPE , conditions of detention were generally the same as those observed during the ORG 's DATE visit , as regards poor hygiene , overcrowding , problematic access to toilet / shower facilities and a total absence of outdoor exercise and outofcell activities . In some places , the situation had even deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG detention facility , as well as in CARDINAL other places , detainees \u201c had to eat with their fingers , not having been provided with appropriate cutlery \u201d .", "CARDINAL . During DATE visit some improvements were noted in the country 's investigation detention facilities , severely criticised in previous reports . However , a great deal remained to be done : most detainees continued to spend DATE on end locked up in overcrowded cells TIME a day .", "CARDINAL .
