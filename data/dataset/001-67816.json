The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG , implementing government decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , introduced a fine for drivers of illegally parked vehicles and entrusted the task of removing , towing away and impounding such vehicles to ORG , a company based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By order no . CARDINAL of DATE , the mayor of ORG authorised a private company , PERSON , to perform the services of removing , towing away and impounding illegally parked vehicles .", "CARDINAL . A partnership contract was signed on DATE by the city authorities and the company in question , the signatories on behalf of the authorities being the deputy mayor ( hereinafter \u201c FAC \u201d ) and the council \u2019s legal expert ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . In a letter of DATE , the mayor of NORP requested PERSON to cease its activities under the contract and informed it that it was considering terminating the contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , who are journalists by profession , published an article in the local newspaper Telegraf , of which the second applicant was the editor , with the headline \u201c Former Deputy Mayor [ ORG ] and serving judge [ R.M. ] responsible for series of offences in GPE scam \u201d . The names of the former deputy mayor and of the city council \u2019s former legal expert , PERSON , who had subsequently become a judge , were printed in full in the headline and in the article itself .", "CARDINAL . The article , which appeared under the byline of both applicants , was worded as follows :", "\u201c In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG entrusted a commercial company , ORG . , with the task of impounding illegally parked vehicles or trailers ... It was the duty of the city authorities\u2019 specialist departments to lay down the practical arrangements for implementing the council \u2019s decision . But things did not turn out that way . DATE after decision no . CARDINAL was adopted , the city authorities , knowingly breaching the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , illegally concluded a partnership contract ... with ORG . , a company having no connection with the CARDINAL initially chosen . It is worth noting , however , that the contract in question was signed by the deputy mayor , [ FAC ] , in place of the mayor , ... and by a certain [ M. ] instead of the legal expert [ M.T. ] .", "By what miracle did PERSON enter into a partnership with the city authorities when , in decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , the city council had authorised ORG . to provide a straightforward service ? What is striking is that there is no evidence that ORG agreed to give up the task of towing away illegally parked vehicles ! ... The crook [ D.M. ] ( the former deputy mayor , now a lawyer ) granted PERSON \u2019s irresponsible employees the power to decide when a vehicle is illegally parked \u2013 in other words , to treat citizens and their property with contempt . What form did the fraud take ? Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL provide that no partnership contract with a commercial company may be signed without a prior decision by the local council , adopted by a CARDINAL - thirds\u2019 majority of the total number of councillors . Before a contract is signed , it must be referred to all the local council \u2019s specialist committees for their opinion ... The contract with PERSON was negotiated and signed illegally , as the signatories based it on the decision [ of DATE ] , which , as has already been shown , referred to a different company without envisaging any other partnership .", "Given that the city authorities had already signed CARDINAL other contracts before that CARDINAL , the signatories can not claim ignorance of the law , but only an intentional breach of it ! And because any intentional breach of the law pursues an end in itself \u2013 generally that of securing material advantages \u2013 it is clear that in this case the former deputy mayor , a lawyer by profession , received backhanders from the partner company and bribed subordinates , including [ ORG ] , or forced them to break the law .", "ORG detected this blatant fraud , which has generated considerable profits for the briber ( PERSON ) ... The offending company [ ORG ] has never shown that it had adequate means to impound illegally parked vehicles . This explains why large numbers of privately owned vehicles have been damaged and , as a result , CARDINAL of complaints have been made on the subject .", "Furthermore , the alleged partnership contract was valid for DATE , until DATE . From that date [ GPE ] no longer had any right to interfere with ORG private property ! It has nevertheless continued to tow vehicles away and illegally collect money ... It is incomprehensible how the police could have provided it with assistance for DATE .", "Let us briefly consider the conduct of the council \u2019s former legal expert , [ ORG ] , who is now a judge . Either she was ignorant of the law when she signed the contract , in which case it is hard to understand how she can subsequently have been appointed as a judge ( delivering justice on the basis of the same laws which she does not know ) , or she accepted bribes and may continue to do so in future ! It is no surprise that the same judge should have been investigated by ORG for a further illegal act , also committed while she was at the city council ( as we reported at the time ) . Ironically , the ORG \u2019s president did not take any action against her on the ground that the sum received was not ... large enough .", "Apparently becoming aware that the matter was likely to be uncovered , the city authorities\u2019 coordination department ... notified PERSON in writing of the possibility of the contract being terminated on the following grounds : ... \u2018 You have not supplied any documents showing that you have purchased the platform - type equipment necessary for carrying out the activity ORG ( as stipulated in clause CARDINAL of the contract ... ) . In the same letter the city authorities informed PERSON : \u2018 As you have not proved that you have the appropriate equipment , we would assess your contribution to the partnership at the level of your company \u2019s capital , that is CARDINAL lei . Your share in the partnership \u2019s net income will have to be recalculated in relation to the parties\u2019 contributions.\u2019", "Facts are facts , and the documents in our possession speak for themselves of the illegal Vinalex scam . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article was accompanied by a photograph of a police car on the scene as an illegally parked vehicle was being towed away , photocopies of extracts from the partnership contract and from ORG decision of DATE , and certain passages of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning the responsibilities and powers of mayors , prefects and city and county councils .", "CARDINAL . The article was also accompanied by a cartoon showing a man and a woman arm in arm , carrying a bag marked \u201c Vinalex \u201d which was full of banknotes . The CARDINAL characters were depicted as saying to each other :", "\u201c Hey , [ NORP ] [ diminutive form of PERSON first name ] , you \u2019ve done a good job there ! When I was deputy mayor we made quite a bit , enough to go to GPE ... \u201d", "\u201c [ NORP ] [ diminutive form of the former deputy mayor \u2019s first name ] , if you become a lawyer , I \u2019ll become a judge and we \u2019ll have enough to travel round the world ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG of ORG examined a report submitted on DATE by several auditors who had conducted a review of ORG budget for DATE and had made the following findings :", "( a ) NORP The city council \u2019s decision of DATE to award ORG the contract for towing away illegally parked vehicles had not been justified by any bid submitted in writing by the company or by the company \u2019s aims as set forth in its articles of association .", "( b ) NORP The city council had not given its opinion on the partnership contract signed between the city authorities and PERSON , and no expert valuation of ORG \u2019s assets had been carried out or submitted to the council for approval , contrary to the provisions of ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) The distribution of the proceeds among the parties as agreed in the contract PERCENT to ORG and PERCENT to the city council \u2013 had not corresponded to the ORG respective contributions on the date on which the contract had been signed PERCENT by the city council and PERCENT by DATE resulting in a loss of income for the city council .", "ORG considered it necessary to urge the mayor of GPE , as the official responsible for authorising appropriations , to \u201c ensure compliance with the law \u201d as regards the parties\u2019 obligations under the contract and to be more efficient when entering into such partnerships with private entities in future . A formal decision to that effect was adopted on DATE by the head of the department .", "CARDINAL . The applicants produced to the ORG a report dated DATE by the same ORG auditors , which likewise referred to the irregularities described in paragraph CARDINAL above in the signing of the partnership contract between the city authorities and PERSON , and indicated that the contract should be terminated . The applicants did not mention the existence of such a report during the criminal proceedings instituted against them following the publication of the impugned newspaper article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the publication of the article , PERSON instituted proceedings against the applicants in ORG for insult and defamation , offences under LAW and CARDINAL respectively of MONEY . She complained , in particular , of the cartoon accompanying the article , which had depicted her as a \u201c woman in a miniskirt , on the arm of a man with a bag full of money and with certain intimate parts of her body emphasised as a sign of derision \u201d . She submitted that the article , the cartoon and the dialogue between the characters had led readers to believe that she had had intimate relations with ORG , and pointed out that she and the former deputy mayor were both married .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present and , scheduling a further hearing for DATE , directed that they should be brought before the court on that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant stated at the hearing that , as editor , he assumed full responsibility for what had been published in the newspaper . He explained that cartoons were frequently used in the press as a medium for criticism and that he had not intended to damage the claimant \u2019s reputation . In reply to a question from the court , he admitted having known that , by order of the mayor of GPE , PERSON had been authorised to tow away illegally parked vehicles . He stated , however , that he had not thought it necessary to publish that information . Lastly , he stressed that he did not intend to reach a settlement with the injured party and that he was prepared to publish an article in her favour provided that she could prove that what he had published was untrue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to have the case transferred to a court in another county . They also requested an adjournment of the proceedings , arguing that because the claimant was a judge it was impossible for them to find a member of ORG who would agree to represent them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date GPE , in reply to a question from the court , attested that the applicants had not met with a refusal on the part of all of its members and that , in any event , the matter had not been referred to its executive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory decision of DATE , ORG ordered the referral of the case to ORG of First Instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was entered on that court \u2019s list of cases for hearing . Public hearings were held on DATE and on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants did not attend the hearings , although they had been duly summoned . The court summoned them to appear at the hearings on DATE and DATE . The applicants did not comply with the summonses .", "CARDINAL . At the hearings on DATE and DATE , representatives of ORG applied for an adjournment on behalf of the applicants , who were not present . The court allowed the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a member of ORG , GPE , agreed to represent the applicants .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE in the morning , GPE asked the court to consider the case after TIME The court granted his request . However , when it sat to examine the case at TIME and , subsequently , at TIME it noted that neither the applicants nor their counsel were present in the courtroom . It accordingly adjourned the case until CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the court reserved judgment , after noting that neither the applicants \u2013 despite their having been duly summoned DATE nor their counsel had appeared . In a judgment delivered on DATE , the court found the applicants guilty of insult and defamation DATE offences under ORG and CARDINAL respectively of MONEY . It sentenced them to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for insult and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for defamation , and ordered them both to serve the heavier sentence , namely CARDINAL months\u2019 immediate imprisonment . As well as this main penalty , the court imposed the secondary penalty of disqualification from exercising all the civil rights referred to in LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) .", "It also prohibited the applicants from working as journalists for DATE after serving their prison sentences , a security measure provided for in the first paragraph of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Lastly , it ordered them to pay PERSON CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL NORP lei ( ROL ) ( equivalent to MONEY at the exchange rate applicable at the material time ) for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In stating its reasons for the judgment , the court observed , firstly :", "\u201c The ORG notes that the injured party has always been present , both in ORG and in FAC of First Instance , whereas the defendants have generally been absent without justification , despite having been lawfully summoned . In support of her prior complaint , the injured party , PERSON , sought leave to produce documentary evidence . PERSON [ R.M. ] submitted a copy of the DATE edition of the local newspaper ORG , containing the article referred to in her complaint and the cartoon in which she was ridiculed .", "The ORG notes that the defendants and the party liable to pay damages , despite being lawfully summoned , have not attended any hearings , and that only the injured party has been present .", "The ORG notes that the defendants PERSON and PERSON were informed of the charges against them and of the hearing dates , and that they were assisted by a lawyer of their choosing ( who asked the ORG first for an adjournment and subsequently for consideration of the case to be postponed until the second sitting , after TIME ) .", "The ORG observes that the defendant PERSON gave evidence to ORG at a public hearing on DATE , and notes the following from his testimony : the defendant considered that it was not compulsory to have studied at journalism college to work as a journalist ; he refused to reply when asked whether he had had access to any other documents on which ORG decision no . CARDINAL had been based ; he understood by \u2018 series of offences\u2019 the fact of committing several offences ; he understood by \u2018 a multiple breach of the criminal law\u2019 the commission of several offences ; he considered that the injured party , in signing the contract in her capacity as a legal expert at the city council , had infringed a number of the provisions of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; he pointed out that he could not give the precise legal classification of the offences committed by the injured party , as that did not come within his sphere of competence ; he stated that he had said everything there had been to say about the injured party in the newspaper article ; he submitted that cartoons were used everywhere and maintained that he had not ( through the cartoon ) damaged anybody \u2019s reputation ( specifically , that of the injured party ) .", "[ The ORG ] notes that the defendant PERSON stated that he assumed full responsibility for everything published in his newspaper , as its editor ; ... that he stated that he was aware of the constitutional provisions on the right of journalists to impart information to the public ; that he had read the government decision in its entirety but had not published it for lack of space ; that he also stated that he had read the full text of the partnership contract entered into by the city authorities and signed by the injured party , PERSON , but that he did not know whether the government decision had referred to partnership contracts ; ... that the defendant had been aware that ORG had been authorised by order of the mayor of GPE to provide the service of towing away illegally parked vehicles , but that he had not thought it necessary to publish that information in the newspaper ; and , lastly , that he stated : \u2018 In view of the seriousness of the offences committed , I do not think that it was necessary to discuss the matter with the injured party beforehand . Should any documents prove that my statements are unfounded , I am prepared to publish an article in the injured party \u2019s favour.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the documentary evidence on which the injured party intended to rely in support of her allegations , the court observed :", "\u201c Apart from the article published in ORG , the injured party , PERSON , produced ORG decision no . DATE adopted in accordance with government decision no . CARDINAL of DATE in which it was decided to tow away illegally parked vehicles ; order no . CARDINAL of DATE by the mayor of GPE ... authorising the Vinalex company to remove , tow away and impound illegally parked vehicles ( \u2018 The conditions for the performance of these services shall be laid down in the partnership contract to be drawn up\u2019 ) ; government decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , in which mayors were empowered to order the removal , towing away and impounding of illegally parked vehicles by duly authorised specialist companies ; and order no . CARDINAL of DATE by the mayor of ORG , in which PERSON was authorised to provide such services . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard more particularly to the article and cartoon in issue , the court held :", "\u201c ... the article , by the defendants PERSON and PERSON , was directed at the injured party , tarnishing her honour , dignity and public image and injuring her own self - esteem by means of the ( written ) accusations conveyed through signs and symbols targeted specifically at her .", "The ORG considers that these acts took place , that they are punishable under the criminal law , and that they posed a danger to society , not so much because of their practical effect ( physical distortion of outward reality ) but above all because of the psycho - social consequences resulting from the provision of misleading or incorrect information to the public , giving rise to inaccurate judgments about facts and individuals , establishing a false scale of values in view of the role and public impact of the media , and causing psychological trauma to the injured party . In making its assessment , the ORG has had regard to the particular status of the parties to the proceedings : the injured party , PERSON , being a lawyer and a representative of the judiciary , and the defendants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , being representatives of the media .", "The ORG notes that the defendant PERSON , while realising the seriousness of the acts he had committed , irresponsibly stated that he had been \u2018 aware of the fact that PERSON had been authorised by order of the mayor , but did not consider it necessary to publish that order ( as well)\u2019 ...", "The ORG considers that publication of the article in the newspaper can not have been justified by a \u2018 legitimate interest\u2019 in that it was not based on actual facts and the provision of accurate information to the public . It concludes that the defendants ... \u2018 ORG the content of LAW : \u2018 Freedom of expression shall not be prejudicial to a person \u2019s dignity , honour and private life or to the right to one \u2019s own GPE , and of LAW : \u2018 Public and private media shall be required to provide the public with accurate information.\u2019", "It follows from the written submissions filed by the injured party ... that it was always her wish that the criminal proceedings be terminated by a friendly settlement , provided that the defendants agreed to retract the allegations made in the article .", "The ORG notes that the injured party is a public figure and that , following the publication of the article , her superiors and the authority above them asked her to explain herself regarding the trial , particularly in view of the fact that she was due to take the professional examination to obtain permanent status . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants appealed against the first - instance judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , the ORG reserved judgment , having noted that the case was ready for decision and that the applicants had not appeared in court , despite having been duly summoned , and had not stated any grounds for their appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the court , after examining all the aspects of the case against the applicants , as required by LAW , upheld the first - instance judgment , finding it to have been correct . ORG judgment , sent to the archives on DATE , was final and binding and no ordinary appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Procurator - General applied to ORG to have the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE quashed . He submitted the following arguments .", "( a ) The courts\u2019 legal classification of the facts had been incorrect . Pointing out that in the cartoon the applicants had simply highlighted their allegations of corruption on the part of certain city council officials , he accordingly submitted that the facts in issue did not constitute the actus reus of insult as defined in LAW .", "( b ) The amount the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages had been extremely high and had not been objectively justified .", "( c ) Lastly , the requirements of the first paragraph of LAW , by which the courts could prohibit persons who had committed unlawful acts from practising a particular profession on account of their incompetence , lack of training or any other ground making them unfit to practise the profession , were not satisfied in the applicants\u2019 case , as there was no unequivocal proof that the applicants were incompetent to continue working as journalists or that their doing so entailed a potential danger .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the Procurator - General \u2019s application as being manifestly ill - founded , for the following reasons :", "\u201c It has been established from the evidence adduced in the present case that on DATE the accused , PERSON and PERSON , published an article in the NORP newspaper Telegraf entitled \u2018 Former Deputy Mayor [ ORG ] and serving judge [ R.M. ] responsible for series of offences in PERSON , in which it was asserted that in DATE , while she was employed as a legal expert at ORG , the injured party , PERSON [ R.M. ] , had been involved in fraudulent activities on the part of a commercial company , ORG .", "ORG further notes that , alongside the above - mentioned article , the accused published a cartoon in which the injured party was depicted in the company of a man carrying a bag full of money on his back , and that this was likely to tarnish the injured party \u2019s honour , dignity and public image .", "It follows that in publishing the article in ORG , the accused attributed specific acts to the injured party which , had their allegations been made out , would have rendered her criminally liable ; the CARDINAL lower courts were therefore correct in finding the accused guilty of defamation under LAW .", "The fact that the accused published alongside the above - mentioned article a cartoon in which the injured party was depicted in the company of a man carrying a bag full of money , in such a way as to tarnish her honour and reputation , constitutes the offence of insult as defined in LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the amount which the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages , ORG held :", "\u201c ... the requirement for the accused to pay CARDINAL lei for non - pecuniary damage was justified , since it is beyond dispute that in publishing the article on DATE in a mass - circulation newspaper , the accused seriously offended the dignity and honour of the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held , lastly , in relation to the alleged unlawfulness of the temporary prohibition on the applicants\u2019 working as journalists :", "\u201c ... since the application of security measures in circumstances other than those provided for by law does not feature on the exhaustive list of cases in which the law permits the Procurator - General to apply to have a decision quashed , it can not form a legal basis for quashing the judgments in issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
