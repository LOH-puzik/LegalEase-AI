They both found that the permanent reduction of the applicant \u2019s working capacity was not as such a result of a \u201c harmful effect \u201d , rather her suffering emanated from DATE of hard work and her developed age .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation .", "On appeal to ORG in GPE ( GPE i GPE ) , the applicant requested that an oral hearing be held since , alleging that it was impossible for her to obtain a detailed opinion from a doctor in GPE , her counsel wanted to submit oral arguments on her case .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE the court stated as follows :", "\u201d The proceedings before the court are written . According to LAW ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ) the proceedings before the administrative courts may include an oral hearing with regard to a particular issue when there is reason to assume that holding a hearing would be to the advantage of the proceedings or further the speedy determination of the case .

As regards the question of an oral hearing , the court held as far as relevant :", "\u201c Both [ the applicant ] and her representative were present at the meeting , after which ORG made their decision in the case .

Therefore , an oral hearing is unnecessary . \u201d", "The applicant requested leave to appeal and an oral hearing in the leaveto - appeal proceedings .

The term industrial injury refers mainly to injuries that result from accidents or other harmful effects at a person \u2019s place of work .", "Pursuant to chapter CARDINAL , LAW , an industrial injury shall immediately be reported to the employer , who shall report it to ORG . The office shall obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury . A physician shall be attached to the office in order to assist it in medical matters ( the insurance doctor ) . The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as an industrial injury , as well as the degree of reduction of a person \u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment , shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions , the insurance doctor \u2019s assessment of those opinions and any other information pertaining to the matter .", "For an injury to be qualified as an industrial injury a causal link must be established between the accident or the harmful effect in the workplace and the insured ORG health problems . What is meant by \u201c harmful effect \u201c is the influence of a factor that is very likely to cause an injury or illness such as that incurred by the insured person . At the relevant time , the question whether a particular injury or illness incurred by the insured person was to be regarded as an industrial injury was subject to the following special rule of evidence . If the insured person had suffered an accident or had been subjected to some other harmful effect at work , his or her medical problems were presumed to have been caused by the accident or the harmful effect if there were substantial grounds in support of such a conclusion ( chapter CARDINAL , LAW in its wording from DATE until DATE ) .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of ORG ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen , lag CARDINAL:CARDINAL - hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of LAW , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
