The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was the president of a non - governmental organisation known as GPE ( Investors of GPE ) . In DATE he wrote an article entitled \u201c Shares for the NORP of GPE \u201d ( \u201c \u0410\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0430 \u201d ) . The article was about the acquisition of shares in ORG ( a local energyproducing company which was at the time a part of the State holding ORG ) by a group of GPE - based firms . In the article the applicant described the purchase as a crooked deal and alleged that a high - level official from GPE , CARDINAL of the leaders of the progovernment political party , was behind the transaction . The article reads as follows :", "\u201c Shares for the Moor of GPE", "Where are the MONEY [ obtained from ] the placement of shares in ORG ?", "We meant well ...", "Everything started with an advertisement in [ the official DATE ] ORG of DATE , in which ORG informed us about the next step in its exploration of market in the country \u2013 namely , about the official registration of the issue of CARDINAL simple non - documentary nominal shares . [ In that advertisement ORG ] described in great detail the conditions and procedure for the issue of the shares , including the distribution of the shares amongst prospective buyers in the first priority group and the second priority group , explained how to formulate a request for acquisition of shares , and , naturally , indicated the bank account into which payments for the shares should be made . The payments were supposed to go through a commercial bank situated in GPE [ a city in southern GPE ] . In other words , a reputable firm got involved , and , as a consequence , the business was put on a solid footing . At least , that was the appearance that the sponsors of the project wanted to create for those who they hoped would \u201c swallow the bait \u201d and , under the influence of the very promising advert \u2013 published , by the way , in all the mass media of LOC \u2013 would be prepared to play for high stakes .", "At the local level the preparations had started long before the publication of the advert . First of all , the issuer ( the corporation issuing the securities ) took care to develop convincing arguments which would help to get support for their project from public officials . On DATE a consultation meeting took place in the office of the head of LOC [ of GPE ] , where the question of payment of the local taxes due by ORG was discussed . It was no accident that that question was on the agenda of the meeting : by that time the outstanding fiscal debt of the energy industry [ vis - a - vis the local authorities ] , including the carryovers from DATE , amounted to MONEY \u2013 a very significant amount for the District [ budget ] . As a result of the discussion an agreement was reached which provided , in particular , that ( direct quote ) \u201c the administration of LOC discharges ORG from the payment of MONEY in local taxes . In return , ORG transfers [ to the administration ] its shares worth MONEY , at the market rate applicable at the moment of the transfer \u201d . Both parties signed the minutes of the meeting containing that clause . Naturally , among the signatures were those of Mr F.I.T. , the head of the local administration , and Mr G.I.S. , the managing director of GPE . Some time later Mr. PERSON made a similar proposal \u2013 \u201c shares in exchange for taxes \u201d \u2013 to the financial department of the administration of LOC and to the mayor 's office of GPE .", "The plot thickens . At DATE the Duma of LOC adopted the PERSON on investment in the construction of the Ust - Srednekanskaya HydroElectric Power Plant ( HEPP ) . Almost certainly , everyone has heard about the problems with the financing of that \u201c never - ending construction project \u201d , so the desire of the lawmakers to use every opportunity to get the extra funding is quite understandable . As a result , in the new law , driven by the best aspirations , they stipulated that \u201c ... in order to complete the construction of the ORG plant , which is CARDINAL of the most important elements in the fuel and energy system of LOC Kolymaenergo Plc may dispose of the fees as a registered member of the special economic zone , due for the period until DATE , which were earmarked for the special - purpose extra - budgetary fund for social development in LOC .", "Those fees should be considered as a capital investment in the main capital of ORG , in particular to pay for the construction costs of ORG , on condition that a corresponding part of the shares is registered as the property of the FAC \u201d ( end of quote ) . That law was enacted on DATE .", "... But it ended up the same as always", "As the saying goes , \u201c everything looked smooth on paper , but they forgot that in reality it was full of cracks \u201d . The fourth additional issue of shares was registered on DATE , and distribution was supposed to start in DATE . On different dates , all within the period of open distribution of the shares , a number of potential investors concluded standard acquisition agreements with ORG . ORG [ the biggest ORG - controlled energy company at that time ] , for good reason , bought shares for MONEY , thus investing in the construction of the Ust - Srednekanskaya HEPP . However , the situation has since changed , for the worse as regards most of the investors . CARDINAL of the local companies , ORG , expressed an interest in purchasing shares for MONEY . When the director of ORG . Mr PERSON , learned about that offer , he requested that all previous offers and the book where they were registered be destroyed , and decided that henceforth he would take care of the distribution of the shares .", "Very soon , instead of the bank account in ORG indicated in the original issue plan , a new bank account was opened , this time with the PERSON bank ( GPE ) , and , following that , the implementation of the whole scheme , as designed from the very beginning , started . In a very short time , CARDINAL commercial firms were incorporated in GPE : ORG , ORG and ORG Bakkar transferred MONEY to ORG 's account with the PERSON bank ; with that money the recipient [ ORG ] paid for the promissory notes issued by ORG . For those not familiar with of all the subtle details , I should explain that promissory notes , unlike shares , do not need to be secured by any property or financial resources of the company that issued them . That is why any limited company with a charter capital of CARDINAL or QUANTITY and nothing besides , not a bean , can issue promissory notes for MONEY , provided that a buyer comes forward .", "In our case the buyer was ORG , which at that time had an outstanding debt of MONEY owed to its employees , the pension fund and the ORG budget at different levels . The value of the promissory notes was MONEY ; it 's no coincidence that the head of PERSON earlier transferred MONEY to the account with the PERSON bank ( see above ) . And then that amount was passed CARDINAL times through the corresponding bank accounts , with the use of the same photocopied bank payment order . As a result , PERSON purchased , almost for free , a huge number of shares which amount to MONEY of the overall charter capital of GPE .", "It is easy to guess what the reaction of the would - be investors , who suffered both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , was . Numerous legal suits , petitions and complaints were addressed to ORG , ORG of LOC , PERSON and other senior authorities . On DATE an NGO called GPE was created by a group of persons , and it immediately joined in the process of uncovering the truth . The main goal of that ORG consisted in promoting the interests of the investors , shareholders and other interested persons , and protecting their investment in the energy industry of LOC before the courts , social policy institutions or any organisations competent to address their concerns in whatever manner . But they received silence in reply [ to their petitions ] . In particular , the board of directors of GPE kept ignoring them , although it had been Mr ORG , the head of the board , who had approved the [ share ] issue plan .", "As we can read in a letter from CARDINAL of the shareholders of GPE to the head of the management board of GPE , PERSON ( with a copy to the head of the management board of ORG , PERSON . ) : \u201c In the internal audit report , under the heading of \u201c Profits and losses \u201d there is no information about any money received from the shares sold . MONEY were supposed to be transferred to the bank account of ORG . That money was sufficient to pay the outstanding debts of the company , to relaunch normal operations through the bank account of the company and not through [ non - monetary ] \u201c clearances \u201d in which the company was losing CARDINAL of what was due to it .", "\u201c Furthermore , it became known that some of the shareholders , namely PERSON and NORP TEK , had paid CARDINAL of the price [ of the shares they had purchased ] , whereas according to the audit report on the issue of ORG had paid [ ORG ] the full price . Why has this been done ? \u201d [ end of quote ]", "The arguments of the claimant were considered unpersuasive", "That letter was sent as early as DATE ; in DATE a meeting of shareholders took place , but the author of the letter did not get a reply until now . The question formulated at the end of the quote is , most likely , a rhetorical one , because we are all grown - ups and we all understand why it has been done . We also understand that after that scam with the shares came to an end , all our hopes inspired by the promises of the sponsors of the [ share issue ] plan , the hope of getting salary arrears paid , of getting tax paid , of investing in the construction of the Ust - Srednekanskaya HEPP , etc . , all those hopes have vanished .", "A striking example is provided by the situation with the company LOC , which brought proceedings before ORG of LOC , seeking damages from ORG for false advertising . That company [ FAC ] was prepared to buy CARDINAL shares . DATE , on DATE , it made the first payment , but on DATE the money was returned [ to GPE ] since the account indicated in the agreement did not exist and the recipient of the money was not [ amongst the clients of the bank ] ( now we know why DATE the account with the LOC bank was never opened ) . The LOC company immediately sent PERSON all signed documents and asked them to provide new banking details for the bank transfer . However , there was no reply . A new request in similar terms was made on DATE , but , again , to no avail . As a result , on CARDINAL DATE a tort claim was introduced before ORG of LOC , for an amount of MONEY .", "The claimant 's arguments were very convincing . Let us take the manipulation with the bank accounts described above . Whereas most of the potential buyers of the shares of the fourth additional issue tried ( in vain ) to use the account indicated in the issue plan , i.e .. the account that in reality did not exist , those investors for whom PERSON created a most - favoured regime were able to pay for the shares through a secret account in the GPE - based Korvet bank . The decision of the court mentioned that fact ; however , it was interpreted in a peculiar way . Indeed , as the decision established , \u201c ... owing to the absence of the bank account and of a recipient in the bank the money in the amount of MONEY was returned \u201d . To all appearances , that fact is established . However , on the same page , a few paragraphs below , one can read CARDINAL of the arguments which the defendant put forward : \u201c ... in breach of the agreement on the acquisition of shares the claimant had made the payment before the conclusion of the agreement . \u201d On the next page we see the court 's conclusion , which was the central reason for dismissing the tort action : \u201c ... at the moment of conclusion of the agreement the claimant had been required to transfer to the defendant MONEY . The defendant , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the agreement , was to forward to the claimant the documents confirming the payment together with a signed copy of the agreement . However , in breach of the agreement , the claimant only transferred MONEY for the shares \u201d .", "Too many inconsistencies , are there not ? In fact , contrary to what the court established , the payment had been made on DATE , i.e. , after the conclusion of the agreement , which had been signed on DATE . What does this mean ? First of all , it means that the materials in the case file were not duly studied by the court . Furthermore , what difference would it make if the claimant transferred MONEY and not CARDINAL ? Would the correct bank account appear in the issue plan ? Would it allow the company to become the lawful owner of the shares ? Unfortunately , miracles are impossible , especially when nobody wants to produce a miracle . And please pay attention to the phrases which are underlined [ in the quote above ] . It is hard to reconcile the argument of the defendant ( that the payment should have been made after conclusion of the agreement ) and the argument of the court ( that the buyer was under an obligation to send a signed copy of the agreement together with a document confirming payment ) . I will further note that the acquisition agreement required [ the buyer ] to pay MONEY of the overall sum of the transaction , but did not specify whether such payment had to be made in instalments or in one go .", "And that is not the end . In the section \u201c Distribution of the shares amongst buyers in the second priority group \u201d of the issue plan one can read : \u201c Offers from prospective buyers in the second priority group will be accepted [ by ORG ] in chronological order of their receipt \u201d . That means that the dates of receipt of every offer should be registered in a special logbook . However , the requests by the claimant and by the court to produce such a logbook were to no avail . It was only possible to see the record of existing shareholders , in which , under no . CARDINAL , we can see the name of the very same GPE - based firm which obtained , for unclear reasons , preference in buying the shares . Still , it was impossible to get a clear answer to the question whether an offer from GPE to buy shares was registered , and , if so , on what date .", "Ready or not , here I ( do n't ) come ?", "Very shortly [ I will tell ] you about those who stood to gain in this whole obscure story . When the prosecution officials involved in the inquiry into the situation with the shares came to GPE , they were unable to find PERSON , ORG or ORG at the official addresses given , or those people who were mentioned in the documents of ORG . The Moor has done his work , and the LOC has left , without leaving an address or even saying \u201c Goodbye \u201d .", "This is the true situation ; however , criminal investigation no . CARDINAL into the abuse of official position by the managers of ORG was finally closed for lack of the constitutive elements of a crime .", "The decision of ORG of LOC was appealed against by ORG ; in its grounds of appeal all the breaches of the law in the sphere of the advertisement , selling and buying of shares were described in detail . However , ORG again just ignored the arguments of the claimant . None of the facts mentioned above , which clearly spoke against the defendant , were taken into account . As a result , the claimant , together with PERSON , lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG in GPE . As to the discontinuation of the criminal investigation , we will challenge the decision of the prosecution in this respect by all legitimate and civilised means .", "When that dispute started , we informed PERSON . , the head of the management board of ORG , and ORG , of the situation . However , a principle of esprit de corps came into play , and they decided not to wash their own dirty linen in public . As it appears , they want to cover up the affair at all levels .", "If we do not succeed , we will still continue fighting . On DATE our organisation sent to ORG a statement of claim against ORG and ORG and the then head of ORG of GPE , the leader of the \u201c GPE \u201d fraction in ORG , PERSON , the General Director of GPE Mr. PERSON , and the chief accountant PERSON What is our organisation asking for before the court ? First of all , that it declare the advertisement of the fourth issue of shares abusive , and the issue itself invalid . We think that ORG breached the provisions of the federal legislation , in particular , the Standards for the Issue of Shares , ORG of the Rights of Investors and ORG . The legal provisions on which we base our claims are indicated in the statement of claim .", "So far the date of the hearing in this case has not been set ; it will take place in DATE or DATE , after the judge returns from her leave . By the way , the judge took DATE leave DATE after the case had been assigned to her . A similar handling of cases concerning machinations with shares has become almost systemic .", "All this squabbling can not but be detrimental to the investment climate in the region , because ORG is a public limited company and its shares can be purchased by foreign investors as well . And now , when GPE is seeking recognition as a country with a market economy , events of this kind will not help it to acquire weight .", "In the current situation the NGO Investory Kolymy will insist on an objective examination of its civil claims and of the criminal case , in order to protect the rights of investors .", "PERSON ,", "Head of ORG \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the article to a municipally owned newspaper , PERSON , for publication . He produced documents in support of the facts described in the article . Mr PERSON , the editor - in - chief of the newspaper , agreed to publish the article . It was included in issue no . CARDINAL of DATE . That issue , with the applicant 's article in it , had a print run of CARDINAL copies .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , CARDINAL copies of the issue containing the applicant 's article were sent to subscribers and to ORG libraries . CARDINAL copies were given to the distributing company Rospechat to be sold at street distribution points , kiosks and newsstands . However , shortly afterwards those copies were withdrawn from the newsstands and they were later destroyed . According to the Government , the withdrawal was requested by PERSON ( the editor - in - chief ) . They submitted a letter from the editor - in - chief to the head of Rospechat asking the latter to withdraw the copies . The letter is dated DATE ; however , according to the applicant it was backdated . Only the copies that had been sent to libraries and subscribers remained . The ORG submitted that a part of the print run had already been sold , with the result that CARDINAL copies had been withdrawn and destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the editor - in - chief wrote a letter to the mayor of GPE asking the latter to release him from the position of editorinchief because he \u201c was unable to perform his duties in a fully professional manner \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the trade union at the GPE hydroelectric power plant wrote a letter to the editor - in - chief of ORG asking him to explain why issue no . DATE had been withdrawn from the newsstands .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the editor - in - chief replied to that letter explaining that he had not given the relevant order . He claimed that the decision had been taken by the head of the distributing company Rospechat . He , the editor - in - chief , had had to sign a backdated order for withdrawal of the copies , and from a private conversation he had understood that the copies had been withdrawn because of the applicant 's article , which had mentioned the names of certain politicians whom the editor - in - chief described as \u201c untouchable \u201d . After that incident he \u201c [ had taken ] the difficult decision to resign from the position of editor - in - chief of ORG \u201d , because , in his words , \u201c the newspaper was unable to enjoy freedom of speech and of the press , \u201d and he \u201c did not want to deceive readers \u201d . It appears that soon afterwards the editor - in - chief left PERSON and started working as a journalist on a private newspaper .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant tried to publish the article in several regional and central newspapers , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant lodged a formal complaint with the regional prosecutor 's office concerning the withdrawal of the copies . In his submission , the withdrawal amounted to unlawful interference with freedom of the press , a criminal offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that complaint was transmitted to the GPE town prosecutor 's office . The case was assigned to an investigator , who questioned the head of Rospechat and the former editor - in - chief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of Rospechat testified before the investigator that the decision to withdraw the copies had been taken by the former editor - in - chief . On DATE the investigator questioned Mr PERSON , the former editor - in - chief of the newspaper . Mr PERSON confirmed that he had asked Rospechat to withdraw the copies of the newspaper . He explained that he had agreed to publish the article because it concerned an interesting subject and because the applicant had shown him documents which supported the facts described in the article . The editorinchief had thought that the article would arouse public interest and had decided to publish it . However , after fresh consideration , when the newspaper had already been printed and sent out for distribution , he had decided to withdraw it . He had realised that the editorial staff \u201c would have problems \u201d if the article was published . As to his letter of DATE , it had not been accurate , because at the time he had been upset over his own decision to resign from the post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a preliminary inquiry , the investigator decided not to open a criminal investigation . The investigator found that the decision to withdraw the copies had been taken by the editor - in - chief himself without any coercion . The investigator noted , however , that the decision of the editor - in - chief to withdraw the copies had been motivated by the need to avoid lawsuits and litigation which might have followed the publication of the article , and to protect the editorial staff . The investigator concluded that no interference with freedom of the press had occurred .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision before the court . On DATE the ORG examined the materials in the case file and heard evidence from the applicant and the former editor - in - chief ; the latter testified that he had signed the order to withdraw the copies after they had already been withdrawn from sale . After examining the applicant 's complaint , ORG decided to quash the decision of DATE . The court noted that by law the withdrawal of a print run could be ordered only by the judicial authorities . ORG also ordered certain additional investigative measures to be carried out by the investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE town prosecutor ordered an additional inquiry . The case was assigned to another investigator , who questioned the applicant , the former editor - in - chief , the head of Rospechat and a staff member of Rospechat . The applicant testified that when he had learned about the withdrawal of the copies he had called the editor - in - chief , who explained that they had been withdrawn by a decision of Rospechat , and that the head of Rospechat had persuaded him to sign a backdated order for withdrawal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The head of Rospechat testified that the copies had been withdrawn by order of the then editor - in - chief . He also denied putting any pressure on the editor - in - chief .", "CARDINAL . NORP The former editor - in - chief confirmed his previous testimony given to the investigator of the town prosecutor 's office . As to his testimony before ORG , it was his view that the copies had been withdrawn before the order had been signed . Indeed , he had discovered at CARDINAL of the street kiosks that all copies of issue no . CARDINAL had disappeared . However , he had no proof that they had disappeared because they had been withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the staff member of Rospechat confirmed that on an unspecified date she had helped the then editor - in - chief of PERSON to withdraw the copies from the street kiosks .

His reasoning was similar to the reasoning of the previous investigator of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant challenged that decision before the courts . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE .

CARDINAL containing his article reprinted and sold at street kiosks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed his action .
