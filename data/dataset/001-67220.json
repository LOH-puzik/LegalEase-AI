SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant company , which conducted business within the textile industry , was not a member of any employers ' association . Thus , it was not automatically bound by any collective bargaining agreement ( kollektivavtal ) negotiated in the industry , and had not signed any such agreement of its own volition . It had CARDINAL employees CARDINAL of whom were members of ORG ( GPE ; hereinafter \u201c the union \u201d ) , an affiliated member of ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the union requested negotiations with the applicant company with a view to concluding a collective agreement . Such negotiations were held on DATE . TIME of the negotiations stated , inter alia , that the applicant company was not interested in reaching an agreement at that time but would consider the matter . TIME also recorded that the parties had concluded that the salaries paid by the applicant company were higher than the minimum wage stipulated in the collective agreement proposed by the union .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a subsequent written exchange the applicant company stated that it had no intention of concluding a collective agreement with the union .", "CARDINAL . Soon thereafter the union demanded that the applicant company sign the so - called ORG agreement ( ORG ) , a collective agreement specially conceived by the union for employers who were not members of an employers ' association . The applicant company declined , stating that its terms of employment were considerably more favourable to the employees than those stipulated in the ORG agreement , that the existing employment contracts were perfectly adequate and that the employees belonging to the union objected to the union intervening on their behalf . However , it offered to sign a collective agreement with the union incorporating its existing terms of employment . The union rejected this proposal and announced that it might take industrial action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the union gave the applicant company formal notice ( varsel ) that it would take action by ordering the cessation of all work at the company and by imposing a \u201c blockade \u201d on the company from CARDINAL DATE onwards unless an agreement had been reached before that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company instituted proceedings against the union in ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tt ) , claiming that the threatened industrial action was unlawful and that the union should be ordered to withdraw the notice . The applicant company also requested that ORG make an interim order to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the union took the industrial action . It lasted DATE . The notice remained effective , however .", "CARDINAL . Negotiations were thereafter held before ORG ( Statens f\u00f6rlikningsmannaexpedition ) . The union stated that certain parts of the ORG agreement were not negotiable . The applicant company indicated that it was considering joining an employers ' association , ORG ) , to which the union responded that it would not take any further industrial action against the company . However , the applicant company did not join that association and the negotiations broke down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company 's request for an interim order .", "CARDINAL . In the substantive proceedings , the union claimed that ORG had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute and that , instead , it should be referred to ORG ) , whose decision should be final . By a decision of DATE ORG , referring to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Litigation in Labour Disputes Act ( NORP om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i arbetstvister , PERSON ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) and section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet , LOC ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , agreed with the union and transferred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicant company claimed that the composition of the court which would determine the case should be restricted to professional judges \u2013 i.e. without members representing employers ' and employees ' interests \u2013 as it would otherwise not meet the requirement of objective impartiality under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bench of ORG composed of members who did not represent labour market interests rejected the applicant company 's claim , stating that at the main hearing of a case , the composition of the court had to be in accordance with chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing in the case on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company maintained that the industrial action taken by the union was aimed at forcing it to join an employers ' association or to accept the collective ORG agreement drawn up by the union . It stated that CARDINAL union members were employed at the company and both of them had declared that they did not want to take part in the industrial action . The applicant company also claimed that its terms of employment were more favourable than those stipulated in the ORG agreement . Since the means employed by the union were not reasonably proportional to the aim sought to be achieved , the industrial action had violated the applicant company 's right not to join an employers ' association and thus its right to negative freedom of association under LAW . Alternatively , the applicant company asserted that the industrial action conflicted with a general principle of proportionality which it maintained was applicable under NORP law , as it could entail serious economic consequences for the company .", "CARDINAL . For its part , the union claimed that , on the whole , the terms of employment provided by the applicant company were not more favourable than those contained in the ORG agreement although it accepted that the salaries of its CARDINAL members were higher than the minimum salary prescribed by that agreement . The union also stated that the ORG agreement could be adapted to meet the special requirements of the applicant company . It further argued that the ORG was not applicable to the dispute as it only governed relations between individuals and the ORG and LAW was applicable as lex specialis . Alternatively , it asserted that LAW did not afford any protection to a limited liability company and that , in any event , the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) showed that LAW did not confer any right not to sign a collective agreement . As regards the industrial action that had been taken , the union stated that it served the legitimate aims of improving the employment situation for union members and protecting them in various ways and could not be considered disproportionate to those aims . The union also claimed that a general principle of proportionality , as invoked by the applicant company , could not be used to limit the constitutional right to take industrial action . In its submission , the right to take such action against employers who were not bound by collective agreements was in principle unlimited under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found in favour of the union . Noting at the outset that the parties agreed that the industrial action in question was not unlawful under LAW , it went on to examine in detail whether it could involve a violation of the applicant company 's right to negative freedom of association under LAW , which had been part of NORP law since its incorporation into domestic law on DATE .", "First , ORG rejected the union 's preliminary objections as to the applicability of the LAW , as such , to the dispute at hand . It noted , inter alia , that the rules on industrial action in LAW which were based on the constitutional principle that the right to take such action is unlimited unless otherwise provided by law \u2013 prescribed the situations in which such action would be unlawful . Thus , it could not be excluded that further restrictions on the right to take industrial action could follow from other legislation , including the Convention . The provisions of LAW , therefore , did not prevent LAW from being applicable .", "ORG then went on to examine whether the industrial action had violated LAW . It noted that the rationale behind the union 's action was not to force the applicant company to join an employers ' association but to conclude a collective agreement with it which , according to the union , would promote the economic interests of its members . Among other things , the proposed agreement prescribed that compensation be paid for overtime work , which , indisputably , was not the case under the applicant company 's terms of employment . Having regard , inter alia , to the aforementioned judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE , ORG concluded that the industrial action had not violated the applicant company 's rights under LAW . It found also that there was no basis in law for the applicant company 's contention that a general principle of proportionality was applicable in labour disputes .", "CARDINAL . ORG which heard the case and delivered judgment was composed of CARDINAL members . In accordance with LAW , ORG was composed of CARDINAL legally trained and qualified judges and CARDINAL lay assessors . CARDINAL assessor had been appointed because of her special knowledge of the labour market . However , she did not represent any employers ' or employees ' interests . Of the other CARDINAL assessors , CARDINAL had been nominated by employers ' associations ( a director of ORG Confederation ( Svenska Arbetsgivaref\u00f6reningen ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and an employee of ORG representing the ORG employers ) and CARDINAL by employees ' associations ( ombudsmen in the ORG and the joint ORG of Salaried Employees and ORG ( NORP FAC and ORG Centralorganisation ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . The member nominated by the ORG disagreed with ORG judgment and considered that the industrial action in question violated LAW , as the union had failed to show that the terms of employment stipulated by the ORG agreement were more favourable than those provided by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , the union made a further approach to the applicant company with a view to concluding a collective agreement . The applicant company again refused but informed the union that the rules on overtime work set out in the ORG agreement had been introduced at the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the union applied to ORG for a declaratory judgment establishing the union 's right to take immediate industrial action against the applicant company . It also requested the court to take an interim decision on this matter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company opposed the union 's claims and again objected to the composition of ORG . It also requested an order requiring the union to provide security for any damage the company might sustain .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , composed of members who did not represent labour market interests , rejected the applicant company 's challenge to its impartiality on the same grounds as in its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , ORG , by a decision of DATE , granted the union 's request for an interim declaration that the proposed industrial action was lawful . It thus rejected the applicant company 's claims that the union 's application was res judicata on account of its previous judgment and that the requirements under NORP law for a declaratory decision \u2013 whether final or interim \u2013 were not met . It also rejected the applicant company 's claim that the proposed action should be deemed unlawful as the rules on overtime work set out in the ORG agreement had been introduced at the company DATE an assertion which was not confirmed by the union \u2013 and as the CARDINAL union members had been dismissed owing to scarcity of work at the company . Referring to its established case - law , ORG further found that the union , being an organisation , did not have to provide security .", "CARDINAL . The composition of ORG which heard and examined the union 's claims was the same as for the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , including CARDINAL assessors nominated by employers ' associations ( another ORG director and the same employee of ORG ) and CARDINAL by employees ' associations ( a former vice - president of a trade union affiliated to the ORG and a former head lawyer of a trade union affiliated to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The member nominated by the ORG submitted an opinion dissenting from ORG decision , on the ground that it was not perfectly clear that the proposed industrial action was lawful , for which reason the union 's interim request should be rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company complained to ORG domstolen ) , requesting that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE be set aside owing to a grave procedural error ( domvilla ) . It argued that ORG could not rule on the union 's request unless security had been furnished for the applicant company 's potential loss . Alternatively , the applicant company 's negative freedom of association had been breached as a consequence of the union having been afforded procedural privileges in its capacity as an organisation . On DATE ORG refused the applicant company 's request , finding that it had not established any grounds for quashing ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the union proceeded with industrial action on DATE . Supportive industrial action was also taken by other trade unions . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant company joined ORG and thus became bound by a collective agreement . The union 's own industrial action was immediately suspended but supportive action by another trade union lasted over the Easter DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a settlement between the applicant company and the union and the latter 's withdrawal of the application it had lodged on DATE , ORG struck the proceedings out of its list .", "CARDINAL . Due to declining profitability , the applicant company went into voluntary liquidation in DATE . By a decision of DATE the ORG of GPE declared the applicant company insolvent . On DATE the winding up was terminated and the applicant company dissolved .", "CARDINAL . The right to take industrial action is guaranteed under LAW .
