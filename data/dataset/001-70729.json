The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Gaziantep .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL packages of powder ( subsequently found to be starch ) were found in the belly tank of the apparently unladen lorry which the applicant had just brought into GPE . The applicant was arrested , and on DATE he was charged with knowingly being involved in the attempted import of a controlled drug ( diamorphine ) . He was convicted on DATE and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . His application for leave to appeal arrived at ORG on DATE , and leave to appeal and legal aid were granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . As to sentence it found as follows :", "\u201c DATE . ... The points ... are , first , that no diamorphine was imported and that seems to us to be the most important point , namely that this was an offence of attempt and not of actual importation .", "CARDINAL . Second , that the appellant appears to have occupied a lowly position in what was undoubtedly an extensive chain , stretching from source abroad into this country .", "CARDINAL . Third , it is said that there was no evidence that he knew of the quantity involved . However , in that respect , in a massive importation of this kind , it is not usual to investigate how far an appellant was privy to the actual amount involved , bearing in mind that it would obviously have been an extremely substantial importation .", "CARDINAL . Fourth , the point is made that he is isolated from his country of origin , serving a sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Fifth , that his age is DATE , he is of previous good character and family responsibilities also militate for mercy .", "CARDINAL . We attach some slight importance to the fourth element . So far as the fifth is concerned it is not one in which of a case of this kind we regard appropriate and to take into consideration [ sic ] .", "CARDINAL . Finally , counsel has advanced upon us the argument that this appeal has taken , as it undoubtedly has taken , an unconscionably long time to come on , for reasons which are no fault of the appellant or his advisers , but appear to have related to administrative difficulties within this court . He makes reference in that respect to LAW . However , it is not necessary to invoke that Article for the court to take into account , if it considers it appropriate , a delay of that kind .", "CARDINAL . We consider that , absent any reason for reduction of an unusual kind , had this importation been an importation of diamorphine , as the appellant no doubt believed it to be , a sentence of DATE could have been expected . It does appear that , on the basis that it was simply an attempt , the judge reduced the level of sentence to the order of DATE , bearing in mind the appellant \u2019s apparent position in the chain .", "CARDINAL . In our view , a somewhat greater allowance could well have been made , allowing this with the fact that the defendant has spent a time of some anxiety , no doubt , waiting for longer than he should , in order to see whether his sentence would be reduced , we consider that it is appropriate to reduce the sentence of DATE imposed to CARDINAL of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The appeal upon the sentence will be successful to that extent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released after having served CARDINAL of the DATE sentence , and deported to GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
