CARDINAL of the CARDINAL opened fire at point blank range on the police officers . CARDINAL of those officers died instantly and the other was seriously wounded .", "CARDINAL . The police suspected a local unit of ORG ( an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA ) and the IRA later claimed responsibility for the murder . It was also suspected by the police that , on TIME prior to the attack in GPE , the stolen vehicle together with all firearms and ammunition used in the attempted robbery had been stored in a safe house in ORG PERSON .", "As part of the investigation that followed , a number of persons suspected of being members of the local unit of the IRA were arrested and charged , including the applicant \u2019s brother who was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery ( in relation to the ORG incident ) , possession of ammunition and of membership of the IRA . A total of CARDINAL persons were arrested and asked to account for their movements at particular times surrounding the attack , including the remaining members of the applicant \u2019s family except his CARDINAL sisters . All of those persons who were asked to account for their movements did so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant , who resided in the family home in PERSON , Co. PERSON , was arrested under section CARDINAL of the Offences Against LAW CARDINAL ( \" LAW \" ) on suspicion of being a member of the IRA contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . He was questioned on QUANTITY occasions during CARDINAL CARDINAL-hour consecutive periods of detention for which provision is made under LAW . While in detention , he saw his solicitor on CARDINAL occasions : TIME and TIME on DATE prior to his first interview with the police ; TIME and TIME on DATE and TIME and TIME on DATE . That solicitor did not attend the applicant \u2019s interviews with the police .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the interviews , the applicant was cautioned that he was not obliged to say anything , but that anything he did say would be taken down in writing and could be given in evidence . Many of the questions put to the applicant related to the attack in LOC and to his alleged membership of the IRA . On several occasions during those interviews he was also requested to account for his movements during certain periods of time on CARDINAL and DATE immediately before , during and after the incident in LOC . In being so requested , he was informed by the questioning police officers that a failure to provide this information would constitute an offence under LAW for which the potential penalty was CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant was also informed , on certain occasions only , that the initial caution given to him did not apply as he was obliged to respond under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant denied any connection with the events in LOC , indicated that he was in GPE when he heard the news of the murder and otherwise refused to give an account of his movements stating , on CARDINAL occasion , that he had been advised by his solicitor not to answer questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was charged , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , on CARDINAL counts of refusing to give an account of his movements . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed CARDINAL charge , he was convicted on the second charge ( a section CARDINAL request made on DATE ) and no ruling was made on the remaining charge . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to ORG and was released on bail pending the appeal . He appealed on the basis , inter alia , of an overlap in the times referred to in the charge which was dismissed and the charge on which he was convicted . In DATE ORG rejected this part of his appeal . When ORG sat on DATE to hear the applicant \u2019s submissions on sentence , he withdrew that portion of the appeal which was then struck out . The applicant was detained immediately to serve his prison sentence and was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law . By DATE , the ORG guarantees liberty for the exercise , subject to public order and morality , of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions .", "CARDINAL . The Offences Against LAW CARDINAL ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) is described in its long ( explanatory ) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the ORG and , for that purpose , to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the ORG , and to establish ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under LAW or an offence scheduled under Part V of LAW ( the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances\u2019 legislation ) . This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section CARDINAL proclamation ( see the following paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW provides that Part V of that LAW ( which establishes ORG and contains section CARDINAL ) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order , and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect . The proclamation was made in DATE and is still in force . Accordingly , section CARDINAL of LAW has been in force since DATE to date .", "CARDINAL . By section QUANTITY Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of LAW and such offences are to be tried by ORG established under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this LAW , any member of the < police > may demand of such person , at any time while he is so detained , a full account of such person \u2019s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub - section of this LAW or any scheduled offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP If any person , of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub - section of this section is demanded under that sub - section by a member of the < police > , fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading , he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of DATE , the ORG committed to initiating a wide ranging review of , inter alia , LAW with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of LAW which would no longer be required . The Minister for ORG , Equality and PERSON reform has , with Government approval , established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform . The ORG has commenced its work .", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG ) v. PERSON ( DATE IR CARDINAL ) the accused had been arrested under section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Act and had made certain statements to the police . The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest ( section CARDINAL ) , the existence of section CARDINAL of LAW and even though no section CARDINAL requests had actually been made , the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements . Accordingly , the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible . The ORG did not find this argument persuasive since no section CARDINAL requests had in fact been made . It went to point out that , even if section CARDINAL had been invoked by the police , the defence submission was not well - founded because of previous NORP case - law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with NORP law , even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer , were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Garda Siochana ( police ) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by ORG of Ireland in association with ORG . The commentary on section CARDINAL of LAW in the sixth edition ( DATE ) provides as follows :", "\u201c The fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section CARDINAL does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence \u201d", "The judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the above - cited PERSON case and the earlier NORP case - law approved in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON and PERSON v. GPE and the Attorney General ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL NORP ) , CARDINAL individuals had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW for failing to give an account of their movements . ORG rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of section CARDINAL , considering that section CARDINAL constituted a proportionate interference with those ORG right to silence guaranteed by LAW : the objective was to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the ORG ; the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational ; and other legal protections were available to persons in custody under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW which minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by LAW .", "Those protections were listed by ORG : the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest ; the obligatory informing of the suspect of the offences under LAW and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected ; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested ; the right to medical assistance ; the right of access to court ; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right ; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross - examining a person in detention DATE Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees ; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under LAW .", "ORG rejected the appeal ( PERSON and PERSON v. GPE and the Attorney General [ DATE ] FAC ) . It noted that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was silent on the question of the later use of statements made pursuant to requests of the police under that section . While it noted that ORG had suggested in the above - cited PERSON case that information lawfully obtained under LAW might be later used in evidence , ORG expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not .", "ORG pointed out that the right to silence was a corollary to the freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW . The relevant assessment was , therefore , to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to LAW . It noted that LAW was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the ORG and that the proclamation made under LAW remained in force .", "As to whether section CARDINAL restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the ORG was attempting to protect the public , the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish , nevertheless , to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights . However , it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the ORG to protect itself . The entitlement of those , with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime , to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order .", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG ( In the matter of ORG and LAW DATE , DATE CARDINAL ILRM CARDINAL , at CARDINAL ) ORG found that a confession of a bank official obtained by ORG as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under LAW of LAW DATE would not , in general , be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless , in any particular case , the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary . ORG considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to LAW . That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under LAW would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered , in all the circumstances , that it would be just and fair to admit it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
