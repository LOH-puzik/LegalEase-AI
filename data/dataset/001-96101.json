The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was suspected of having supplied large amounts of illegal drugs to other persons for distribution . The pre - trial investigation against the applicant and other suspects was concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the pre - trial investigation , the applicant had been represented by a court appointed counsel , PERSON On an unspecified date prior to the trial PERSON informed ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , which was the court of jurisdiction , of the dates when he would not be available due to other engagements . According to the applicant , the court had then informed PERSON that the trial dates had already been fixed . On DATE PERSON was informed that in such a large case the court would not be able to arrange the trial dates to suit the lawyers ' requests and that a representative should arrange for a substitute to deal with other pending cases . The court asked PERSON whether he would prefer that the applicant be appointed another representative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants in ORG . The prosecution evidence comprised , inter alia , recordings of telephone conversations obtained through police interception .", "CARDINAL . The court 's oral hearing was held in CARDINAL sessions DATE . The applicant appeared in person at CARDINAL of those sessions . At CARDINAL of them he was represented by PERSON and at the other CARDINAL by a different lawyer .", "CARDINAL . During the session of CARDINAL DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants requested access to certain recordings in the possession of the police but not included in the case material . They contended that those recordings concerned business arrangements other than the alleged drugs trading , and other material supporting their innocence . The prosecutor opposed the request , stating that a number of recordings , to the necessary extent , had been included in the case file . He further maintained that recordings of such telephone conversations which did not support the charges had also been included in the file .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to provide the court with further evidence in the matter , the prosecutor called the investigating police officer to the stand . In its TIME , the court summarised his statement as follows :", "\u201c All recordings of telephone conversations pertaining to the offences in question have been included in the pre - trial investigation material available to the parties . Recordings not related to the matter were either destroyed at once or removed later . The threshold for including recordings to the case material has been low . In case of doubt as to whether a given recording was related to the matter or not , it has been attached to the case material . As far as the witness could recall , there had been CARDINAL conversations between [ the applicant ] and [ another defendant ] , of which CARDINAL had been attached to the case material . \u201d", "The witness had also explained that the recordings gathered during the investigation had indeed disclosed a number of other dealings between the defendants concerning , inter alia , procuring and trading in cars and car parts .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the above witness testimony the court rejected the defendants ' request finding that all relevant recordings had been included in the pre - trial investigation material , submitted at the disposal of the court and the parties . The court noted that the police had operated under the duty to include in the case file recordings both for and against the suspects . The court detected no evidence of misconduct by the police . Nor did the evidence support the alleged necessity of gaining access to the remaining recordings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court found the applicant guilty of drugs offences and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . In its assessment , the court relied mainly on recordings of telephone conversations , telephone metering information concerning telecommunications between the defendants and police observations recorded in the pre - trial investigation report .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) claiming that the lower court had refused him the right to submit as fresh evidence recordings of telephone conversations concerning procuring , trading in cars and car parts and attempts by CARDINAL of his co - defendants , ORG , to purchase drugs from sources other than the applicant . Those recordings , favourable to his defence , had not been included in the prosecution evidence . The applicant therefore requested that the police be ordered to provide the court with all the remaining recordings . Later he limited his request to only those recordings involving himself and ORG He also asked for a chronological list of recordings destroyed by the police .", "CARDINAL . In his letter of appeal , the applicant also argued that he had not been given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence as ORG had fixed the dates for its oral hearing without consulting PERSON , who had been forced to send a substitute for CARDINAL sessions . The applicant also criticised the lower court 's assessment of evidence specifying several telephone conversations which the court had allegedly interpreted to his disadvantage in breach of the presumption of innocence . He further maintained that ORG had not given sufficient reasons for its conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to grant the applicant 's request concerning the remaining recordings , referring to LAW in that connection . The court found that an opportunity to have access to those recordings still in the possession of the police was important for building a proper defence . ORG refused , however , the applicant 's request concerning a list of the destroyed recordings . It found that the applicant had not presented sufficient reasons in support of that request and that the fairness of the proceedings would not be compromised if he did not receive such a list .", "CARDINAL . In the subsequent oral hearing , held in CARDINAL sessions DATE and DATE , ORG was presented with the same evidence as ORG . It also received fresh evidence , including recordings of telephone conversations submitted by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . During the oral hearing the applicant contested the fairness of the proceedings . He asserted that the evidence included in the pre - trial investigation material , and presented by the prosecution , was neither reliable nor sufficient as the telephone metering information was erroneous and a number of recordings of telephone conversations had been destroyed . He claimed that the pre - trial investigation had been insufficient in other aspects as well , for instance , not all of ORG 's relevant drug dealings had been investigated . The court was also presented with the argument that part of the evidence had been obtained illegally through unlawful house searches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , upholding ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . As to the arguments concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings , the court observed that the applicant had been given access to a number of fresh recordings , according to his request . The court noted that , pursuant to LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngmedelslag , LAW . PERSON ) as in force at the time of the investigation , the police had been obliged to destroy any information not related to the suspected offence .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to state that the facts of the case did not give any reason to believe that the destroyed recordings had been relevant to the case . As to those recordings submitted by the applicant at the appellate stage the court stated that , firstly , they had not contained any relevant new information and , secondly , they had been irrelevant to the case . Having also received testimony from the investigating police officer , the court did not subscribe to the argument about the alleged insufficiency of the pre - trial investigation . Nor did the court find any other reason to suspect that the fairness of the proceedings had been jeopardised .", "CARDINAL . As to the subject matter , ORG firstly referred to ORG reasoning and stated that the fresh evidence produced on appeal did not contradict the evidence already presented in the case . The court concluded that , while no single piece of evidence as such was sufficient for a conviction , the evidence as a whole was enough for the guilty verdict . It went on to give more specific reasons of its own reflecting the evidence produced before it . The court stated , inter alia , that in assessing the evidence it had taken into account the arguments made against the charges and the fact that the applicant had not been the only person to have supplied drugs to ORG", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) relying to a large extent on his previous arguments . He maintained that the police had destroyed relevant information which would have shown that he had not been the person supplying drugs to his co - defendants . He also contended that ORG had failed to comment on his arguments concerning inadequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence , the errors in and unreliability of the telephone metering information , and the lower court 's insufficient reasoning . He further claimed that ORG had not allowed him to submit telephone metering information as fresh evidence but had permitted the prosecution to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a decision given on DATE the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman ( eduskunnan apulaisoikeusasiamies , riksdagens bitr\u00e4dande justitieombudsman ) found that , during the pre - trial investigation of the above case , the police had searched an apartment occupied by the applicant 's co - defendant CARDINAL times without following the lawful procedure , that is without informing the occupant about the search . During those searches a certain amount of drugs had been found . The Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman issued a reprimand for unlawful conduct to the police officials involved .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section QUANTITY of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that an authority investigating a crime could be granted permission to intercept and record telephone calls made by a suspect using an extension in his possession or another extension presumably used by him , or calls received by a suspect through such an extension , if the information thus obtainable could be assumed to be of vital importance for solving a crime . This permission could only be granted for serious offences listed in the provision , including aggravated drugs offences .", "CARDINAL . LAW , sections CARDINAL of the said Act provided that the head of the investigation or another official by his order was to check the recordings at the earliest convenience and that recordings containing information which was not related to the offence covered by the authorisation had to be destroyed after they had been checked . Recordings which were not to be destroyed were to be retained for DATE after the case had been resolved with legally binding effect or removed from the docket .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW was amended by Act no . CARDINAL , which came into force on DATE . The current provision states that superfluous information obtained through interception of telecommunications but not related to the offence , or pertaining to an offence other than the CARDINAL covered by the authorisation , is to be destroyed after the case has been resolved with legally binding effect or removed from the docket . The Government PERSON ( hallituksen esitys , regeringens proposition , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the amendment stated that , according to the provision in force at the time , superfluous information was to be destroyed as soon as it had been checked . Information supporting the innocence of the suspect could thus also be destroyed as superfluous information . The provision was thus proposed for amendment in order to ensure that all the material would be available for the [ subsequent ] proceedings , where necessary .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act on Public Prosecutors ( laki yleisist\u00e4 syytt\u00e4jist\u00e4 , lag om allm\u00e4nna \u00e5klagare , Act no . ORG ) provides , inter alia , that it is the duty of a prosecutor to see to the realisation of criminal liability in the consideration of a criminal case , the assessment of the charge and the trial in a manner consistent with the public interest and the legal safeguards of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The same principle applies to the conduct of the police , who have the duty , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslag , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to investigate and take into consideration the facts both for and against the suspect .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time ( Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , obliged the police to draw up a report of the pre - trial investigation , if this was necessary for subsequent proceedings . Among other things , the report was to include all documents and recordings obtained during the investigation , if they were deemed relevant to the case . The report was also to include a list of any material obtained in the investigation but not included in the report ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
