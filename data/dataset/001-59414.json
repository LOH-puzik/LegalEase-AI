The flat was duly allocated to me by ORG on DATE . [ A. ] shamefully benefits from the fact that both flats have the same address ( all flats in the same block have the same address ) and prevents me from moving into my flat . In doing so , he is vehemently supported by his wife [ H. ] , who is the principal occupant of another ORG - owned flat ... [ A. ] claims the right to occupy the flat on the basis of a document signed by the head of the housing department of LOC local council on DATE ... stating that [ A. ] does not have to leave the flat until he has been provided with alternative accommodation . However , [ A. ] has had alternative accommodation for a long time , namely his wife \u2019s flat . He has acquired the right to occupy that flat automatically . Why has he not yet vacated the flat [ allocated to the applicant ] ?", "[ A. ] and his wife lied to me when they said they had no place to live and alleged that because of this they would not vacate the flat . I point out that [ H. ] is a public prosecutor ( ! ) . If our newly born democracy has such people to represent the law , it will not outlive its childhood and we can bury it right away . The judiciary should first and foremost ensure that the law is respected and justice upheld in the ORG . But what is our judiciary like ?", "ORG brought an action against [ A. ] on DATE . The first hearing was scheduled for DATE ( ! ! ! ) . Why ? [ A. ] failed to appear .", "For how long will certain groups of people think that they detain all the power in the ORG ( and act accordingly ) ? ...", "It is high time to show the world , before the second free election , that our government and society defend justice .", "I appeal to you .

PERSON was ordered to publish an apology , pay another SKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to each of the plaintiffs and reimburse their legal costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that proceedings were pending before the Bratislava I ORG which concerned ORG \u2019s claim for the flat in issue to be vacated and ORG \u2019s counter - claim . ORG held that the proceedings before ORG raised difficult questions of fact and law .

In ORG view , the opinions of the applicant and of a journalist which had been published in GPE on DATE and CARDINAL DATE had not been substantiated . The court considered that the applicant had also interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 right to protection of their personality by displaying his open letter of CARDINAL DATE in public places or , as the case may be , allowing it to be published . The court held that the letter contained tendentious , distorted and unsubstantiated information which had damaged the plaintiffs\u2019 personal integrity .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the damage had affected PERSON \u2019s health , that , following the publication of the article of CARDINAL DATE , disciplinary proceedings had been brought against her and that , for the same reason , a loan had not been granted to A. , who was a businessman . The family life of the claimants and of H. \u2019s children had also been affected .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and PERSON appealed . The applicant claimed , with reference to the documents included in the case file , that the information contained in his open letter of CARDINAL DATE was true . In particular , he argued that , under the relevant law , A. had no right to occupy the flat in question . He also offered proof that , at the relevant time , PERSON had had a permanent address with his parents and that his wife had had the right to occupy another flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also pointed out that he could not have the contract for the use of the flat signed as the flat had been illegally occupied by A. He therefore maintained that his conclusion that ORG had prevented him from moving into the flat was correct . Finally , the applicant alleged that , in any event , the interference in question had not had any defamatory effect within the meaning of LAW and that ORG had not indicated any relevant damage or circumstance within the meaning of LAW on which its conclusion had been based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed the appeal . It considered that the evidence heard by ORG showed that the information contained in the article of CARDINAL DATE , in the applicant \u2019s opinion published in GPE on DATE and in the applicant \u2019s open letter displayed in public places did not correspond to reality and was objectively capable of affecting the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG recalled that , after the allocation of the flat to the applicant , the relevant authorities had not signed a contract for its use with him as required by the law then in force and that the applicant had not requested that such a contract be signed . ORG therefore considered that the applicant \u2019s allegation that A. had occupied the flat in question unlawfully and that he had shamefully benefited from the fact that his permanent address was the same as that of the flat in question had been tendentious and misleading as the proceedings concerning the right to occupy the flat in issue were still pending before the Bratislava I ORG .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the disclosure , in both the open letter and the opinion of DATE , of ORG \u2019s name and of the fact that she was a public prosecutor had grossly interfered with her right to protection of her personality . It concluded that the way in which the applicant had attempted to resolve his housing problem was inappropriate as he had had other lawful means of seeking redress .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment , ORG referred to the profession of the plaintiffs and found that the compensation the applicant had been ordered to pay was appropriate and corresponded to the non - pecuniary damage DATE had suffered . The applicant was ordered to reimburse to the plaintiffs the cost of the proceedings . The judgment was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a petition with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . He alleged a violation of his constitutional rights , including freedom of expression , in the proceedings leading to ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to review or quash the ordinary courts\u2019 decisions and to award compensation to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently a bailiff started to enforce payment of the sums due by the applicant by attaching CARDINAL of his salary .", "CARDINAL .
