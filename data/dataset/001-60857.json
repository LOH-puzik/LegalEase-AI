On DATE the coins were examined by an expert and inventoried in the premises of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is true that the law requires that a person claiming restitution of movable property should indicate and show where such property is . However , in the present case the plaintiff undoubtedly has no possibility of inspecting the LOC or safes of the former ORG in GPE as he is not allowed to enter those LOC . By insisting that the applicant should show that the coins are at the last known place the court would impose a burden of proof on him which it is practically impossible to fulfil . On the contrary ... ORG neither showed that the former ORG in GPE had transferred the coins to a different authority nor did it propose to take evidence to that effect ...", "The court established that the last time the coins ... had been held in the premises of ORG in GPE to which ORG is a successor , and it has not been shown that the coins were not in those LOC when FAC became operative , i.e. by DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the judgment ORG admitted that the applicant had limited possibilities of locating his father \u2019s property . It therefore took further evidence of its own initiative . In particular , ORG noted that in accordance with the relevant practice the confiscated property should have been handed over to the public prosecutor and , after the relevant judgment had became final , to the financial department of the competent local government authority . ORG therefore examined the criminal file concerning the case of the applicant \u2019s father . It further established that the archives of ORG , of ORG , of ORG and of ORG in GPE contained no document relating to the coins in question . ORG also heard a witness who had worked at ORG of ORG in DATE . However , the latter had no knowledge of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It shared ORG view according to which the applicant had failed to produce evidence that the defendant Ministry was in possession of the coins as required by Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment ORG further stated :", "\u201c The allegation that the movable property in question had been taken over by an employee of ORG in GPE on DATE and that ... it had been examined there by an expert on DATE can not suffice . Since then a considerable period lapsed during which the golden and silver coins in question could have been alienated , destroyed or lost . The legislator , however , explicitly included in LAW ) of FAC the obligation to show where the movable in question is at the moment of the entry into force of that law .", "... it follows from logical and systematic interpretation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW that a restitution claim can only concern the same property which was taken over by the ORG and not a different object of the same kind . Only movable property which can be individually identified by its specific features thanks to which it cannnot be interchanged with other objects is therefore liable to restitution ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
