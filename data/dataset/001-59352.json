Moreover , he had been part of a military system subject to absolute discipline and obedience in which he had undergone intense political indoctrination ; in the event of a successful crossing of the border , the guards on duty knew that an investigation would be conducted by the military prosecutor ( PERSON ) . However , ORG held that , even for a private soldier , it should have been obvious that firing at an unarmed person infringed the duty of humanity ( PERSON ) and that the applicant could have fired into the water without having to fear the consequences of disobeying orders , since it would have been impossible to observe the exact trajectory of the bullets under water .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant then lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "CARDINAL .

The first , second and third appellants [ Mr PERSON , who did not lodge any application with the ORG , PERSON and PERSON ORG ] further submitted that they had been victims of the violation of a right guaranteed by LAW in that they had been convicted , pursuant to the law of GPE , as indirect principals [ mittelbare GPE ] .", "Neither complaint is well - founded .", "CARDINAL . NORP ( a ) LAW CARDINAL of LAW is an expression of the principle of the rule of law ... This principle forms the basis for the use of civil rights and liberties , by guaranteeing legal certainty , by subjecting ORG power to statute law and by protecting trust . In addition , the principle of the rule of law includes , as one of the guiding ideas behind LAW , the requirement of objective justice ... In the sphere of the criminal law , these concerns relating to the rule of law are reflected in the principle that no penalty may be imposed where there is no guilt . That principle is at the same time rooted in the human dignity and personal responsibility which are presupposed by LAW and constitutionally protected by LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL thereof , and to which the legislature must have regard when framing the criminal law ... It also underlies LAW ...", "LAW secures these aims by allowing conviction only for acts which , at the time when they were committed , were defined by statute with sufficient precision as criminal offences . It further prohibits the imposition of a higher penalty than the one prescribed by law at the time when the offence was committed . In the interests of legal certainty and justice , it provides that in the sphere of the criminal law , which permits extremely serious interference with personal rights by the ORG , only the legislature may determine what offences shall be punishable . LAW CARDINAL of LAW thus reinforces the rule of law by strictly reserving law - making to ORG ... The citizen \u2019s trust is earned by the fact that LAW gives him the assurance that the ORG will punish only acts which , at the time when they were committed , had been defined by ORG as criminal offences , and for which it had prescribed specific penalties . That allows the citizen to regulate his conduct , on his own responsibility , in such a way as to avoid committing a punishable offence . This prohibition of the retroactive application of the criminal law is absolute ... It fulfils its role of guaranteeing the rule of law and fundamental rights by laying down a strict formal rule , and in that respect it is to be distinguished from other guarantees of the rule of law ...", "( b ) Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW protects against retroactive modification of the assessment of the wrongfulness of an act to the offender \u2019s detriment ... Accordingly , it also requires that a statutory ground of justification which could be relied on at the time when an act was committed should continue to be applied even where , by the time criminal proceedings begin , it has been abolished . However , where justifications are concerned , in contrast to the definition of offences and penalties , the strict reservation of ORG \u2019s law - making prerogative does not apply . In the sphere of the criminal law grounds of justification may also be derived from customary law or case - law . Where grounds of justification not derived from written law but nevertheless recognised at the material time subsequently cease to be applied , the question arises whether and to what extent LAW likewise protects the expectation that they will continue to be applied . No general answer to that question need be given here , because in the instant case a justification \u2013 based partly on legal provisions and partly on administrative instructions and practice \u2013 has been advanced in circumstances that make it possible to restrict the absolute prohibition of retroactiveness in LAW .", "( aa ) Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW contemplates as the normal case that the offence was committed and falls within the scope of the substantive criminal law of GPE , as shaped by LAW , and that it is being judged in that context . In this normal case the criminal law , having been enacted in accordance with the precepts of democracy , the separation of powers and respect for fundamental rights , and therefore meeting in principle the requirements of objective justice [ materielle PERSON ] , provides the rule - of - law basis [ rechstaatliche NORP ] necessary for the absolute , strict protection of trust afforded by LAW .", "( bb ) This principle no longer applies unrestrictedly in that , as a consequence of reunification , and as agreed in LAW , LAW to LAW , taken together with LAW , provides that GPE criminal law is to be applied when criminal proceedings are brought in respect of offences committed in the former GPE . That rule is a consequence of ORG assumption of responsibility for the administration of criminal justice in the territory of the GPE ; it is accordingly compatible with LAW , since citizens of the former GPE are tried according to the criminal law that was applicable to them at the material time , the law of GPE in force at the time of conviction being applied only if it is more lenient . However , this legal situation , in which GPE has to exercise its authority in criminal matters on the basis of the law of a ORG that neither practised democracy and the separation of powers nor respected fundamental rights , may lead to a conflict between the mandatory rule - of - law precepts of LAW and the absolute prohibition of retroactiveness in LAW thereof , which , as has been noted , derives its justification in terms of the rule of law [ rechtsstaatliche ORG ] in the special trust reposed in criminal statutes when these have been enacted by a democratic legislature required to respect fundamental rights . This special basis of trust no longer obtains where the other ORG statutorily defines certain acts as serious criminal offences while excluding the possibility of punishment by allowing grounds of justification covering some of those acts and even by requiring and encouraging them notwithstanding the provisions of written law , thus gravely breaching the human rights generally recognised by the international community . By such means those vested with ORG power set up a system so contrary to justice that it can survive only for as long as the ORG authority which brought it into being actually remains in existence .", "In this wholly exceptional situation , the requirement of objective justice , which also embraces the need to respect the human rights recognised by the international community , makes it impossible for a court to accept such justifications . Absolute protection of the trust placed in the guarantee given by LAW must yield precedence , otherwise the administration of criminal justice in GPE would be at variance with its rule - of - law premisses [ rechtsstaatliche PERSON ] . A citizen now subject to the criminal jurisdiction of ORG is barred from relying on such grounds of justification ; in all other respects the principle of trust continues to apply , every citizen enjoying the guarantee that if he is convicted it will be on the basis of the law applicable to him at the time when the offence was committed .", "( cc ) GPE has experienced similar conflicts when dealing with the crimes of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In that connection , ORG for GPE , and later ORG , ruled on the question whether an act might become punishable retroactively if a provision of written law was disregarded on account of a gross breach of higher - ranking legal principles . They took the view that there could be provisions and instructions that had to be denied the status of law , notwithstanding their claim to constitute law , because they infringed legal principles which applied irrespective of whether they were recognised by the ORG ; whoever had behaved in accordance with such provisions remained punishable ... ORG pointed out that in such cases the conduct of the offenders was not being judged by criteria which had acquired general validity only later . Nor were the offenders being called upon to answer the charges against them on the basis of criteria not yet valid or no longer valid at the material time . It could not be supposed that the offenders were not already familiar at the material time with the relevant principles , which were indispensable to human coexistence and belonged to the inviolable core of the law ...", "CARDINAL . ORG has so far had to deal with the problem of \u2018 statutory injustice\u2019 [ gesetzliches ORG ] only in spheres other than that of the criminal law . It has taken the view that in cases where positive law is intolerably inconsistent with justice the principle of legal certainty may have to yield precedence to that of objective justice . In that connection it has referred to the writings of PERSON ... and in particular to what has become known as LOC \u2019s formula ... On that point it has repeatedly stressed that positive law should be disapplied only in absolutely exceptional cases and that a merely unjust piece of legislation , which is unacceptable on any enlightened view , may nevertheless , because it also remains inherently conducive to order , still acquire legal validity and thus create legal certainty ... However , the period of ORG rule had shown that the legislature was capable of imposing gross \u2018 FAC by statute ... , so that , where a statutory provision was intolerably inconsistent with justice , that provision should be disapplied from the outset ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The decisions challenged meet the constitutional criterion set forth under CARDINAL .", "( a ) ORG has since further developed its case - law when trying cases of so - called Government criminality [ ORG ] during the ORG regime in the GPE ... That case - law also forms the basis for the decisions challenged here . It states that a court must disregard a justification if it purports to exonerate the intentional killing of persons who sought nothing more than to cross the intra - NORP border unarmed and without endangering interests generally recognised as enjoying legal protection , because such a justification , which puts the prohibition on crossing the border above the right to life , must remain ineffective on account of a manifest and intolerable infringement of elementary precepts of justice and of human rights protected under international law . The infringement in question is so serious as to offend against the legal beliefs concerning the worth and dignity of human beings that are common to all peoples . In such a case positive law has to give way to justice .", "ORG described the relationship between the criteria which together make up ORG \u2019s formula and the human rights protected under international law as being that the criteria of ORG \u2019s formula , which were difficult to apply because of their imprecision , had been supplemented by more specific assessment criteria , since the international human - rights covenants provided a basis for determining when a ORG was infringing human rights according to the convictions of the world - wide legal community .", "( b ) That assessment is in keeping with LAW . It is also supported by this ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE on LAW [ Grundlagenvertrag ] , which acknowledged that the GPE \u2019s practice at the intra - NORP border was inhuman , and that the PERSON , the barbed wire , the \u2018 death strip\u2019 [ Todesstreifen ] and the shoot - to - kill order were incompatible with the treaty obligations entered into by the GPE ...", "( c ) Against the finding that a ground of justification derived from ORG practice and purporting to allow \u2018 border ORG to be killed must be disregarded as an instance of extreme ORG injustice , it can not be objected by the appellants that the right to life and the right to freedom of movement are not unreservedly guaranteed by LAW and that even democratic GPE of the NORP type , based on the rule of law , have adopted legal provisions which expressly provide for the use of firearms under certain circumstances , particularly in connection with the pursuit and arrest of criminals . Admittedly , the wording of the GPE \u2019s legal provisions , in so far as they regulated the use of firearms at the intra - NORP border , corresponded to that of ORG provisions on the use of force [ unmittelbarer PERSON ] . But the findings in the impugned judgments show that , superimposed on those legal provisions , there were orders which left no room for limitation of the use of firearms according to the principle of proportionality , and which conveyed to the border guards on the spot the view of their superiors \u2013 and ultimately of ORG \u2013 that border violators were to be \u2018 annihilated\u2019 if they could not be prevented from crossing the border by other means . Through that subordination of the individual \u2019s right to life to the ORG \u2019s interest in preventing border crossings the written law was eclipsed by the requirements of political expediency . Objectively speaking , this constituted extreme injustice .", "( d ) Nor can the appellants argue that , having accepted that a justification could be disregarded , ORG had still not answered the question whether and in what circumstances the act thus held to be unlawful was punishable ... To establish punishability there is no need here for recourse to supra - positive legal principles [ \u00fcberpositive Rechtsgrunds\u00e4tze ] . Reference need only be made to the values which the GPE itself took as the basis for its criminal law . At the material time Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s LAW absolutely prohibited the intentional taking of human life and marked the seriousness of such offences by prescribing severe punishment . If , for the reasons discussed above , there is no admissible ground of justification for a homicide , the definition of the offences in the above - mentioned provisions of criminal law makes such a homicide a punishable criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL appellants object that it was incompatible with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , applying the law of GPE , to find them guilty of intentional homicide as indirect principals . That objection fails .", "The criminal courts established , on the basis of the provisions in force in the GPE at the material time , that the appellants had rendered themselves liable to punishment through their involvement in the killing of fugitives . ORG expressly endorsed ORG finding that according to those provisions the appellants were guilty of incitement to murder ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s Criminal Code ) . Only at a second stage did ORG apply the law of GPE , in CARDINAL case on the basis of LAW to LAW taken together with LAW ( the place of commission DATE or place of effect DATE rule ) and in the other cases under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW taken together with LAW of LAW , the law of GPE being more lenient than that of the GPE . In neither case were those decisions contrary to LAW Regarding the application of the place - of - commission rule , the ORG [ ORG ] has already ruled on the issue in its decision of CARDINAL DATE and it stands by that decision .", "In view of its protective purpose , LAW does not preclude the application of law more lenient than that applicable at the material time . ORG , in agreement with academic writings ... , took the view that the more lenient law was the law which , on the basis of an overall comparison in the specific individual case , yielded a judgment more favourable to the offender , even if this or that criterion of assessment might appear to be less favourable than criteria laid down by the other law , the decisive factor being the legal consequences of the offence . That conclusion is compatible with the above - mentioned protective purpose of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and can not be questioned on constitutional grounds . \u201d", "As regards more particularly the present applicant , ORG added :", "\u201c The impugned decisions are not open to any serious objections on constitutional grounds .", "ORG regarded it as established that the fourth appellant [ K .- H. W. ] both knew , when firing the fatal shots , that the fugitive was likely to be mortally wounded and willingly accepted that risk . All relevant grounds for excluding guilt were considered on the basis of the case - law of the highest courts and rejected . Criminal responsibility was thus established in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner . That applies also inasmuch as the requirements for acting in obedience to orders ( ORG ) were held not to have been satisfied . The fact that ORG , like ORG , based its examination on LAW , as interpreted by the highest courts , and treated it as being identical in content with LAW of the GPE is a matter for the criminal courts since it concerns the interpretation and application of the criminal law . On the basis of their findings of fact , those courts DATE likewise unobjectionably from a constitutional point of view \u2013 assumed that the ground for exempting the appellant from punishment could be excluded only under the second limb of LAW , because the unlawfulness of the order to use firearms at the border was obvious in the circumstances known to the appellant . According to the settled case - law of ORG , that condition is satisfied where the breach of criminal law is clear beyond doubt ; soldiers are not under any duty to check or make inquiries . What is decisive is rather whether the breach of the criminal law was so obvious that it was plain without further thought or inquiry to an average soldier possessed of the information which the recipient of the order had ( cf . BGHSt CARDINAL at CARDINAL and CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "That interpretation satisfies the constitutional criterion of the principle of guilt ( GPE ) . Admittedly , misgivings as to whether the breach of criminal law was clear beyond all doubt might arise from the fact that the GPE leadership , exercising the authority of the ORG , broadened the justification intended to cover the conduct of the border guards and thereby made that justification available to them . That being so , it is not self - evident that the dividing - line between criminal and non - criminal conduct would be crystal clear to the average soldier , and it would be inconsistent with the principle of guilt to hold that the breach of criminal law was obvious to the soldiers on the sole basis that there had DATE objectively DATE been a serious breach of human rights ; it must therefore be shown in greater detail why the individual soldier , in view of his education , indoctrination and other circumstances , was in a position to recognise that his action undoubtedly contravened the criminal law . The criminal courts did not discuss the facts in detail from this point of view in the initial proceedings . They did , however , show that the killing of an unarmed fugitive by sustained fire ( PERSON ) was , in the circumstances they had found , such a dreadful and wholly unjustifiable act that it must have been immediately apparent and obvious even to an indoctrinated person that it breached the principle of proportionality and the elementary prohibition on the taking of human life . The other explanations given by those courts likewise show sufficiently clearly , in the light of all the reasons stated in the judgments and the reference to statements made in the earlier decisions of CARDINAL DATE ( BGHSt CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) and DATE ( BGHSt CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) concerning cases of the same type , that the principle of guilt has been respected .", "The length of the sentence likewise stands up to scrutiny from the constitutional point of view . In a manner that was both careful and wholly compatible with the LAW , the courts below took all relevant points of view into consideration and weighed them against each other in an acceptable manner . The difference in gravity between the wrong done by the first , second and third appellants as givers of orders and that done by the fourth appellant as the recipient of orders was clearly reflected in the length of the sentences imposed . The special political situation prevailing in the former GPE , in particular , was taken into account in mitigation of the sentence imposed on the fourth appellant , whose prison sentence was suspended on probation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) of DATE , taken together with LAW ( Einigungsvertragsgesetz ) of DATE , provides , in the transitional provisions of LAW ( sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz in PERSON ) ) , that the applicable law is in principle the law of the place where an offence was committed ( PERSON ) . That means that , for acts committed by citizens of the GPE inside the territory of the GPE , the applicable law is in principle that of the GPE . Pursuant to LAW , the law of the ORG is applicable only if it is more lenient than GPE law .", "CARDINAL .
