{"ITEMID": "001-69939", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF ROSENZWEIG AND BONDED WAREHOUSES LTD. v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant is \u201c ORG \u201d , a public company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a licence to run a bonded warehouse in GPE to the applicant company \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the NORP customs office at GPE / PERSON stated in writing that the NORP customs authorities had no objections to the operation of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further permit was given for exporting merchandise via the border crossing in GPE by the Director of the local ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted that it had been repeatedly suggested that the company should pay various bribes to the customs officials if it wished to continue its operation undisturbed . The Government did not respond to this submission .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Director of the local ORG in ORG stated that from DATE on he would revoke the permit of DATE for exporting merchandise via the NORP border crossing . It was argued that the permit of DATE was not in conformity with an agreement with GPE regarding the border crossings and trans - border movements of goods and persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the customs officers ordered that the headquarters of the applicant company be closed and affixed official seals on its door , preventing it thereby from conducting further business . On DATE the applicant company complained to ORG , submitting that there were no legal grounds on which the permit should be revoked and that the letter of CARDINAL DATE was not an administrative decision , which made it impossible to lodge a formal appeal against it .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant company reiterated its complaint and stressed that the director of ORG had failed , despite the company 's repeated requests , to give any legal basis for the revocation of the permit . It was argued that the revocation of the permit breached economic freedom as guaranteed by the LAW , and clearly infringed the terms of a valid licence which the company had received from ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint under LAW about the ORG failure to give a decision following the appeal of CARDINAL DATE . It was submitted that the company had a valid permit given under the provisions of customs law . However , the company 's operation had been de facto rendered impossible by the letter of CARDINAL DATE as it could not run the warehouse if it was not allowed to export merchandise .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaction to this complaint , on DATE ORG informed the applicant company that the permit of DATE was of a temporary character . It was to remain valid only until a bridge in nearby PERSON was to be constructed . After the construction of this bridge had been terminated , the border crossing in GPE was to be used only for small trans - border movement of goods and persons . This was to be understood as allowing for crossing of the border by persons , but taking merchandise out of the country via this crossing did not fall within the ambit of the notion of the \u201c small trans - border movement of goods and persons \u201d and therefore the permit of DATE had to be revoked under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , submitting that the revocation of the exporting permit would practically mean that the company had to stop its business operation , carried out under the valid licence of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant company and the Director of ORG concluded a settlement to the effect that the applicant company would withdraw the appeal it had lodged with ORG against the position taken by ORG in its letter of DATE and the President of the ORG would set aside the decision of the Director of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set the decision of CARDINAL DATE aside and ordered that the question be re - examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the NORP customs office at GPE / Oder confirmed that the NORP customs authorities had no legal objections whatsoever against the operation of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the permit for exporting merchandise by the applicant company via ORG , stating that the GPE border crossing was under NORP law designed only for the socalled \u201c small trans - border movement of goods and persons \u201d and that , therefore , no merchandise could be exported via this crossing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and discontinued the proceedings , considering that the impugned decision had been in breach of applicable provisions of procedural law since it had not been given in any of the types of proceedings on the merits provided for by LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company requested that the legal meaning of this decision be interpreted . It emphasised that it was important for it to have clarified whether the original permit of DATE was still valid . This , on the plain meaning of the text of this decision , was unclear .", "CARDINAL . In an interpretative decision of DATE ORG explained that the fact that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had been set aside was to be understood in such a way as to mean that the legal situation existing before this decision had been given still obtained .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company requested that this issue be re - examined , asking whether the quashing of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , revoking the permit of DATE , was to mean that this permit was still valid .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG held that the purpose of the decision of DATE was not to decide whether the permit of DATE was still valid . It upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to ORG , arguing that the decisions of ORG lacked clarity . The ORG had set aside the revocation of the permit , but did not confirm whether the original permit was valid . Therefore it was impossible to establish what was the actual legal situation of the company as far as the validity of its permits was concerned . The applicant company emphasised that it was de facto treated by the customs authorities as if the export permit of DATE had been effectively revoked .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE . The court found that the decision of DATE lacked clarity in that it did not allow the applicant company to elucidate the fundamental uncertainty as to the legal consequence of this decision . Neither were these doubts dispelled by the decision of DATE in which ORG had failed to explain what was the legal situation of the applicants ' permit to run their business , and in particular , whether it could still rely on the permit of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the decision of DATE was to be understood in such a way that the applicant 's rights stemming from the decision of DATE remained intact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted proceedings in order to have the licence to run the warehouse of DATE set aside , considering that the applicant company had not been conducting its business for a period DATE , without having informed the competent authorities thereof , as required by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the DATE licence to run the warehouse , having found that after DATE the applicant company had ceased its business activities . Under the provisions of LAW , the customs authorities were obliged to withdraw the licence to run the bonded warehouse if the company enjoying such licence was not exercising it for a period DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed . It argued inter alia that it could not have run the warehouse after DATE , given that ORG had withdrawn its permit for exporting merchandise by the applicant company via ORG , which had made it impossible to continue its business operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having re - examined the case , discontinued the appellate proceedings . The office observed that the applicant was wrong in confusing the proceedings regarding the validity of the DATE permit with the present proceedings , in which it was the validity of the earlier licence , granted in DATE , which was at issue . The validity of the DATE licence had not been questioned in the previous proceedings and therefore there were no grounds on which to accept that the applicant was prevented to run its business .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that the proceedings had to be discontinued since on DATE a new ORG Code had entered into force . It provided that various customs licences issued under the old LAW were to remain valid for DATE , during which companies having such licences could lodge new requests to have new licences issued . The applicant company had not submitted such request and the validity of its DATE licence had consequently expired on DATE . Therefore the proceedings would not serve any purpose and should be discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed . It argued , inter alia , that when giving the contested decision , ORG had breached the law in that it entirely failed to take into consideration all circumstances relating to the proceedings concerning the withdrawal of the permit to export . These proceedings , which had lasted from DATE until DATE , had rendered it impossible for the company to continue its business operation . Therefore it was unreasonable to revoke the DATE licence on the ground that the company had ceased its business activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE as not being in compliance with law . It considered that ORG had incorrectly held that the proceedings had become devoid of purpose . At the time when they had been instituted , i.e. on DATE , the applicant company 's licence was still valid . It therefore had a legal interest in clarifying its legal situation and to confirm whether it was still authorised to run its business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to the judgment of DATE , set aside the decision of CARDINAL DATE , revoking the DATE licence to run the warehouse .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company did not resume its operations afterwards . The first applicant submitted that as a result of the withdrawal of the permit and the licence to run the company , described above , it was impossible for him as the principal shareholder and , likewise , for the applicant company , to resume their business operations . It is the withdrawal of those decisions authorising the company to run its business which constitute the basis of the applicant 's claims of pecuniary damage under LAW . The Government did not respond to this argument ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
