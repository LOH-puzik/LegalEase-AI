DATE the first applicant was an employee of the NORP branch of ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) .

On DATE the Bar informed him that he would be disbarred pursuant to that law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought an administrative action , claiming that his dismissal from the Bar would be unlawful . While the applicant did not contest the fact that he had worked for the ORG even following the declaration of NORP independence on DATE , he submitted that thereafter he had worked as an informer for the authorities of independent GPE . Furthermore , throughout his time at the ORG the applicant had allegedly only worked with cases concerning purely criminal investigations , not political persecutions . In the applicant 's view , he had been entitled to be exempted from the employment restrictions , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's claim . The court found that he had indeed worked with criminal investigations while at the ORG , but that he had remained employed there until his retirement in DATE .

Upon the applicant 's appeal , on DATE ORG upheld this decision . The court reiterated that the applicant was not entitled to be exempted under LAW , as he had not ended his ORG employment immediately after DATE .

CARDINAL different positions were listed in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the issue of the compatibility of the LAW with LAW . ORG held in particular that the LAW had been adopted in order to carry out \u201c security screening \u201d measures on former NORP security officers , who were deemed to be lacking in loyalty to ORG . ORG decided that the prohibition on former ORG agents ' occupying public posts was compatible with the LAW . It further ruled that the statutory ban on the holding by former ORG employees of jobs in certain private sectors was compatible with the constitutional principle of a free choice of profession in that the ORG was entitled to lay down specific requirements for persons applying for work in the most important economic sectors in order to ensure the protection of national security and proper functioning of the educational and financial systems . ORG also held that the restrictions under LAW did not amount to a criminal charge against former ORG agents .", "CARDINAL . While the Act does not specifically guarantee a right of access to a court to contest the security intelligence authorities ' conclusion , it was recognised by the domestic courts that , as a matter of practice , a dismissal from employment in the public service on the basis of that conclusion gave rise to an administrative court action ( and a further appeal ) under the general procedure governing industrial disputes and alleged breaches of personal rights by the public authorities , pursuant to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , LAW and LAW as effective at the material time ) .", "CARDINAL . Restrictions have been imposed in many post - communist countries with a view to screening the employment of former security agents or active collaborators in the former regimes . In this respect , international human rights bodies have at times found fault with similar legislation where this has lacked precision or proportionality , characterising such rules as discrimination in employment or the exercise of a profession on the basis of political opinion . The possibility of appeal to the courts has been considered a significant safeguard , although not sufficient in itself to make good shortcomings in legislation ( see NORP and PERSON , ORG .

In DATE the ORG expressed its dissatisfaction with the above texts in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that requirements of a political nature can be set for a particular job , but to ensure that they are not contrary to the LAW , they should be limited to the characteristics of a particular post and be in proportion to its labour requirements . The ORG notes that the above established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs , functions or tasks . The ORG is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for LAW . The ORG recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under LAW , they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proven to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the ORG . LAW does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community . ORG also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the ORG , the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , the ORG considers the exclusions from being a candidate for any civil service position and from being employed by the police are not sufficiently well defined and delimited to ensure that they do not become discrimination in employment and occupation based on political opinion ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "14"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
