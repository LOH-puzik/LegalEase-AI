The applicant dialled the telephone number indicated on the document and was informed that PERSON DATE the head of CARDINAL of the sections of ORG ( Organiz\u0113t\u0101s noziedz\u012bbas apkaro\u0161anas birojs ) \u2013 would like to meet him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that when he arrived at the police station on an unspecified DATE ( possibly CARDINAL DATE ) , PERSON brandished his gun and demanded a promissory note , apparently in the applicant \u2019s possession , entitling him to MONEY ( ORG ) . The applicant refused to hand it over , after which PERSON demanded him to pay USD MONEY instead . The applicant refused to pay .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that following the incident he received threats and anonymous phone calls .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant secretly left his apartment at ORG prospekts CARDINAL and moved to another apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an explosion took place in the stairwell of the ORG prospekts CARDINAL apartment building . GPE , who , according to the Government , was a member of a notorious criminal gang , was injured in the explosion . The Government submitted that the explosion had been CARDINAL of many assassination attempts directed against PERSON , who was eventually assassinated in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left GPE and went to GPE . The ORG submitted that after the expiry of his tourist visa , the applicant applied for asylum there . His asylum request was eventually rejected , and on DATE he was deported back to GPE . The applicant argued that he had travelled to GPE on a \u201c business visa \u201d , which was permanent , and that after spending DATE in GPE he had applied for a \u201c refugee visa \u201d , which would have allowed him to legally seek employment in GPE . The applicant told ORG during the appeal proceedings in the criminal case against PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that he had left GPE voluntarily and legally .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE another explosion took place in a lift at ORG prospekts CARDINAL . Information given by ORG to ORG on DATE suggested that on that date criminal proceedings concerning both the first and second explosions were pending . The applicant had not been granted any procedural status in those proceedings and had not submitted any statements or claims relating thereto . ORG pointed out that , at the time of both explosions , the applicant had no longer been residing at the address in question .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant \u2019s return to GPE he changed his name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was remanded in custody on suspicion of having committed various crimes , none of which was related to the applicant or the alleged incidents of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE PERSON was released on bail and , on the following day , the applicant applied to ORG with a request that PERSON be rearrested or else that the applicant be granted special procedural protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant special procedural protection to the applicant , since such protection was only afforded to persons who were parties to criminal cases , which the applicant was not .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON was also charged in connection with the alleged events of DATE and the applicant was officially recognised as having the procedural status of victim . A trial before ORG took place DATE and DATE . During the trial the applicant gave evidence about the events of DATE and DATE that followed .

He stated that his life had been under threat and on DATE he had been forced to flee to GPE to avoid PERSON taking revenge on him .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its verdict on DATE . It found PERSON not guilty . When assessing the applicant \u2019s statements , the court noted , amongst other things , that a forensic psychological and psychiatric report had revealed that the applicant was an \u201c egocentric with paranoid tendencies \u201d . However , the applicant had not been found to be suffering from a mental disorder . After having assessed the facts of the case and the available evidence , the court came to the conclusion that they were contradictory and did not support the applicant \u2019s allegations . The court took into account , inter alia , the fact that the applicant had not travelled to GPE until DATE after the alleged incidents of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant was sent a NORP translation of the verdict on DATE . The applicant argued that therefore he could not have complied with the requisite time - limit for lodging an appeal .

On DATE ORG examined that request and denied his request for leave to appeal . That decision was subsequently upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to be granted special procedural protection because he had allegedly \u201c been attacked \u201d on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The application was communicated to the respondent Government on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After receiving the applicant \u2019s request for special procedural protection , ORG requested ORG to verify the applicant \u2019s allegations and , after receiving a reply , on DATE granted special procedural protection to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its verdict , convicting PERSON of charges in connection with ORG \u2019s allegations but upholding the first - instance court \u2019s decision to acquit PERSON with regard to the applicant \u2019s allegations . In its verdict ORG indicated that the applicant \u2019s suspicions linking PERSON to the explosions , the armed men near his apartment building and the violent deaths of various individuals were not established by the materials in the case file . ORG agreed with the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the applicant \u2019s leaving GPE DATE after the alleged events could not have been linked to the events in connection with which PERSON had been charged .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that on DATE the applicant had requested ORG to lift his special procedural protection . That request was granted DATE . The applicant contended that he had waived his special protection after being prompted to do so by the police officers who had been assigned to guard him .", "CARDINAL .
