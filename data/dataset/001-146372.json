By an order of DATE , the chambre du conseil of ORG acceded to the Federal Attorney \u2019s request and declared the arrest warrant issued by the GPE ORG enforceable .

Having examined an appeal lodged by the applicant , ORG of ORG delivered a judgment on DATE upholding the aforementioned order and declared the warrant enforceable . Having noted that the extradition concerned acts ( committed outside GPE ) other than those for which the applicant had been prosecuted and convicted in GPE , ORG argued that :", "\u201c There are no serious grounds for believing that the request for extradition was submitted for the purposes of prosecuting or punishing PERSON for considerations of race , religion , nationality or political opinion or that this individual \u2019s situation is liable to be worsened for any of these reasons .", "...", "Nor is there any serious reason to believe that if PERSON were to be extradited he would be subjected to a flagrant denial of justice , acts of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment ; there is no reason to suppose that GPE will not meticulously comply with all the provisions , including Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of ORG concluded with GPE , and every reason to believe that PERSON will be detained in a civilian facility and tried by the ordinary courts , in accordance with conventional procedure .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG . He relied on the risk of treatment incompatible with LAW and the risk of a flagrant denial of justice . He contended that ORG had not assessed the consequences of his extradition to GPE in the light of the general situation in that country or his own specific circumstances , and argued that ORG should have adopted the same line of reasoning as the ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] ( no . DATE ) . He also complained that ORG had not addressed the potential problem under LAW of sentencing a person to an irreducible life sentence . Lastly , he complained of a violation of the ne bis in idem principle .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It ruled that ORG had provided adequate reasons and legal justification for its decision , considering", "\u201c - that the requesting ORG is currently conducting a thorough review of its anti - terrorist policy , stepping up its action against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment , and is on the verge of suspending the special courts and abolishing the unlimited detention without trial of persons captured in the context of international conflict ;", "- that under the terms of the formal guarantees provided in support of the extradition request , the appellant will be tried by an ordinary civilian court in accordance with the normal procedure in force in the requesting ORG , enjoying all the rights and remedies available under the national judicial system ;", "- that the appellant is not liable to a life sentence for the offences for which his extradition has been requested and that the penalties which they carry can be commuted into other penalties with possibilities for release on parole ;", "- that because the evidence relied upon by the appellant lacks any specific aspect affecting his own personal situation , which would have made the risks he alleges more credible , it does not substantiate any serious concern that he could be exposed to a flagrant denial of justice or acts of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE sent to the NORP authorities at the behest of the Federal Attorney responsible for the extradition request , ORG supplied the following additional information :", "\u201c The statutory maximum sentence for a conviction of each of the first CARDINAL of these offenses is life imprisonment and the statutory maximum sentence for the latter CARDINAL offenses is DATE . In addition , GPE , which are the voluntary guidelines that judges may choose to follow in sentencing defendants , call for a life sentence for each of the first CARDINAL of these offenses .", "A life sentence is not mandatory and the court has the discretion to issue a sentence less than life . In issuing a sentence , the court may consider the gravity of the offense and whether any lives were lost or property was damaged . In this instance , PERSON did not succeed in carrying out his plans to kill GPE nationals and to use weapons of mass destruction . Thus , the court in issuing a sentence , in its discretion , may consider that ORG was not successful in carrying out his plans . The court also may consider any mitigating factors , such as whether the defendant acknowledges responsibility for his actions .", "If the court , in its discretion , sentences PERSON to a punishment of less than life , i.e. a term of DATE , PERSON \u2019s sentence could be reduced by PERCENT for good behaviour while incarcerated . This type of sentence reduction is only possible , however , if the original sentence is to a term of DATE , however long , rather than a life sentence . Therefore , if PERSON were sentenced to a term of CARDINAL , DATE , or even DATE , then he could be eligible for a sentence reduction of PERCENT of his original sentence based on his good behaviour while incarcerated . If , however , PERSON is sentenced to life , he would not be eligible for any reduction in his sentence .", "Finally , GPE can apply for a Presidential pardon or sentence commutation . ( A pardon would eliminate the conviction ; a commutation would be an adjustment to the sentence . ) However , this is only a theoretical possibility in GPE \u2019s case . We are not aware of any terrorism defendant ever having successfully applied for a Presidential pardon or sentence commutation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Once the GPE indictment was declared operative , the proceedings relating to the response to the extradition request were commenced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal Attorney forwarded his written opinion to ORG inviting it , in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law , particularly PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) , to issue a positive opinion on the applicant \u2019s extradition . He pointed out that in the case of the first CARDINAL charges , the applicant was liable to a life sentence , while in the case of the other CARDINAL charges he was liable to a DATE prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the applicant took note of the fact that at the hearing on DATE the Federal Attorney had acknowledged a mistake in his observations in the enforcement request proceedings concerning the sentence to which the applicant might be liable following his extradition to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG issued a favourable opinion on the applicant \u2019s extradition , specifying a number of conditions :", "\u201c - extradition may only be granted :", "i. on condition that the death penalty is not imposed on N. GPE or , if GPE can not guarantee this condition , on condition that the death penalty is not enforced ;", "ii . on condition that any life sentence is accompanied by the possibility of commutation of sentence , even if the conviction is based on terrorist acts ;", "- in the event of a request for PERSON re - extradition to a third country , such as GPE , GPE must request the agreement of GPE should GPE send ORG any future request for extradition after PERSON has been handed over to them .", "If the GPE fails to accept these conditions the extradition must be refused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a diplomatic note of CARDINAL DATE the GPE authorities confirmed that the applicant was not liable to the death penalty and assured the NORP authorities that he would not be extradited to any third country without the agreement of ORG . The GPE authorities reiterated that the maximum life prison sentence was not mandatory and that even if all the constituent elements of the criminal offences in question were secured and proved , the court had the discretion to impose a lighter sentence . The note specified that GPE legislation provided for several means of reducing life sentences :", "\u201c Regarding the question of commutation of a life sentence , GPE wishes to make it clear , in the first instance , that if PERSON were convicted , a life sentence is not mandatory ; the court has the discretion to impose a sentence less than life . Also , a defendant has a statutory right to appeal the conviction and sentence , including a life sentence , both directly , and collaterally through a habeas corpus petition . In addition , there are certain statutory bases for reduction of an already - imposed sentence , including where the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of a third party ( Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure CARDINAL(b ) and LAW , LAW , or for compelling humanitarian reasons such as the terminal illness of the prisoner ( LAW , LAW , LAW ) ) .", "In addition to these measures , the defendant may request that his sentence be reduced as an exercise of executive clemency by the President of GPE . The President \u2019s power under LAW , of LAW , \u201c to grant reprieves and pardons \u201d includes the authority to commute ( reduce ) a sentence of imprisonment , including a life sentence . There are established regulations and procedures governing the application process for executive clemency , and ORG has been established in ORG to review all applications for executive clemency and prepare recommendations for the President on those applications . LAW gives the President absolute discretion to grant executive clemency to a defendant . We note that while such discretion has been exercised sparingly , such relief has , on occasion , been granted for serious offenses implicating national security . For example , in DATE , President PERSON commuted the sentences of CARDINAL members of the FALN , a violent NORP nationalist organization responsible for numerous bombings in DATE and DATE , who had been convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery , bomb making , sedition and other offenses . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG adopted a ministerial decree granting the applicant \u2019s extradition to ORG . Having noted that the applicant would in no case be liable to the death penalty , the decree examined each of the other guarantees provided .", "CARDINAL . On the matter of possible life imprisonment , the ministerial decree read as follows :", "\u201c Under GPE Federal criminal law the maximum penalty laid down in respect of the charges \u2013 the offences under A and B \u2013 precludes early release and release on parole . Life sentences as provided for in these CARDINAL provisions of LAW are therefore , from the legal and factual angles , in principle served for the whole of the person \u2019s life .", "...", "In diplomatic note no . CARDINAL of DATE from ORG , the GPE authorities provided a guarantee that ( even ) if an irreducible life sentence were handed down it would be possible to obtain a pardon from the GPE President . This right is set out in LAW of LAW . Furthermore , Presidential pardons have in fact been granted on several occasions in the past , including the recent past , to persons sentenced by the GPE courts , particularly at the Federal level .", "...", "Even if we view it in its historical context , the FALN case shows that in cases likely to fall under the current legislation on terrorism in force since DATE , which cases must objectively be seen as much more serious than those of which the person sought is suspected and which are therefore liable to lead to severer penalties , Presidential pardons can indeed be granted .", "Even though some individuals have since DATE been given irreducible life sentences ... for terrorism or acts linked to terrorism , such cases can not be compared to the PERSON case in terms of their content . All those who have been sentenced to life imprisonment in the GPE without early release or release on parole were charged , prosecuted and finally convicted for active involvement in terrorist attacks which had caused deaths and/or injuries and considerable material damage , for example the attacks on ORG in GPE , GPE , and GPE ) on CARDINAL DATE . ...", "Those offences were manifestly incomparable in extent and nature with those attributed to the person whose extradition has been requested .", "In the aforementioned cases persons , sometimes enormous numbers of people , in addition to GPE nationals , suffered substantial physical and material damage . The person sought in the present case , however , is being prosecuted for having planned and prepared a terrorist attack which was never carried out . He did not succeed , in cooperation with others , in causing human injuries or even material damage .", "It is therefore manifestly plausible that the offences as charged are not such that the maximum applicable sentence laid down in LAW , that is to say an irreducible life sentence , could be called for or imposed .", "A recent survey by LAW shows that of the CARDINAL persons prosecuted since DATE for terrorist offences linked to ORG or other NORP groups or for offences connected with such terrorist offences , CARDINAL have been convicted . Each case involved prosecutions or convictions instigated by Federal attorneys and courts . CARDINAL of the convicted persons were sentenced to imprisonment , while CARDINAL were released on licence or given prison terms corresponding to the period of custody already served . The average length of prison sentences handed down was DATE . CARDINAL of those convicted were sentenced to life imprisonment . The report also points out that the proceedings complied with the right to a fair trial ( \u201c Human Rights First , In pursuit of ORG : Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in ORG DATE Update and Recent Developments \u201d , DATE , DATE pp . ) .", "The statistics show that , objectively , the risk of being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in cases of prosecution for terrorist offences is considerably lower than is commonly thought . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In connection with the applicant \u2019s possible re - extradition to GPE , the ministerial decree continued as follows :", "\u201c By diplomatic note no . CARDINAL of DATE from ORG the GPE authorities clearly indicated that if the NORP authorities applied to GPE for extradition , it would be turned down .", "...", "Given the decision to refuse extradition to GPE , in view of the fact that re - extradition necessitates the agreement of the ORG which authorised the initial extradition , no re - extradition to GPE is possible .", "Since the NORP authority refused extradition to GPE , if GPE were to transmit to the GPE a request for extradition in the future the GPE would also refuse it , and no extradition by GPE to GPE is possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ministerial decision analysed the application of the ne bis in idem principle as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW ( LAW of DATE ) , GPE and GPE ... have mutually undertaken to refuse extradition if the person sought has been acquitted in the requested ORG or has been convicted in the same ORG for the same offence as that for which extradition is being requested . Ratification ... incorporated this agreement into the NORP and GPE legal systems .", "In other words it is not the acts but the legal classification of the acts , namely the offences , which must be identical .", "...", "The facts forming the basis of the offences in question correspond to \u2018 overt acts\u2019 which individually or together function as factual elements supporting the charges . The double jeopardy principle does not exclude the possibility of using or not using these elements .", "In the present case the offences for which the person sought was finally convicted by ORG on DATE do not correspond to the offences listed in charges A to D in the arrest warrant forming the basis for the GPE extradition request . The constituent elements of the respective GPE and NORP offences , their scope and the place(s ) and time(s ) of their commission do not match up .", "...", "Under GPE Federal criminal law an \u2018 overt act\u2019 is a ( factual ) element , an act , a behaviour or a transaction which in itself may not necessarily be classified as an offence ...", "An \u2018 overt act\u2019 is merely a piece of supporting evidence which in itself or in conjunction with other overt acts may help constitute the offence or offences for which the person is being prosecuted , that is to say conspiracy , for instance to kill GPE nationals ( see charge A ) . ...", "Although each of \u2018 overt acts\u2019 nos . CARDINAL , DATE and DATE could be classified as an offence , these acts nonetheless do not constitute offences for which the extradition has been requested . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the decree stated that \u201c extradition will take place after the person sought has complied with the requirements of the NORP courts \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , under another ministerial decree , the Minister for ORG refused the NORP authorities\u2019 request for the applicant \u2019s extradition ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on violations of LAW No . CARDINAL , the applicant lodged an application with the ORG d\u2019Etat for judicial review of the ministerial decree granting his extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG d\u2019Etat hearing on DATE the applicant relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , DATE ) . He deduced from this judgment that the ORG had now adopted a position requiring preventive review of whether a life prison sentence was reducible or not before the prisoner began his sentence , and therefore that the distinction drawn in the PERSON and Others v. GPE judgment , ( ORG . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL and DATE , DATE ) depending on whether the person subject to extradition had been convicted or not was no longer relevant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the application for judicial review . As to the complaint under LAW and the risk of an irreducible life sentence , the PERSON d\u2019Etat reasoned as follows :", "\u201c Even supposing that the applicant is sentenced by the GPE courts to life imprisonment , it should be noted that in its LAW and Others v. GPE judgment of DATE [ the ORG ] ruled that : \u2018 a life sentence does not become irreducible by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in ORG , that \u2018 no issue arises under LAW if a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible ... \u2019 and that \u2018 where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation , remission , termination or the conditional release of the prisoner , this will be sufficient to satisfy LAW .", "In the present case , as in that of PERSON and Others v. GPE which led to [ the ORG \u2019s judgment ] of DATE , the applicant has not been sentenced by a GPE court to life imprisonment , and has still less begun serving such a sentence .", "As in the aforementioned case , therefore , the applicant does not show that in the event of a life sentence , the question will arise whether there is any legitimate penological justification for continuing his imprisonment .", "Moreover , in his most recent submissions the applicant acknowledges that a possible life sentence imposed on him would be reducible de jure . GPE law allows him either to request a review or apply for a Presidential pardon or commutation of sentence , and the applicant does not contend that this power of executive clemency or sentence commutation is accompanied by restrictions comparable to those in issue in the [ ORG \u2019s ] aforementioned judgment of DATE .", "Although the applicant challenges the assertion that such a sentence is reducible de facto , the explanations provided to the opposing party by the GPE authorities do show that the GPE President has already used his power to commute sentences . Therefore , the legal remedy available to the applicant in the event of a life prison sentence is not excluded in practice .", "Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s contention that since DATE terrorist attack it has been inconceivable for the GPE President to grant a pardon to or commute the sentence of a person convicted of terrorism has not been substantiated by any reliable information , nor can it be in view of the relatively short period of time , as compared with a life sentence , which has elapsed since the said attack and any criminal sentences subsequently imposed .", "As in PERSON ... , therefore , it has not been established that the GPE authorities would , when appropriate , refuse to implement the available sentence - reducing mechanisms where there was no legitimate penological justification for continuing the applicant \u2019s imprisonment .", "Any possible life sentence imposed on the applicant would therefore also be reducible de facto .", "Consequently , it is unnecessary to determine whether the opposing party was wrong to consider that the applicant would not necessarily be sentenced to life imprisonment , because , even if he were sentenced to such a prison term , this penalty would not constitute a breach of LAW [ of the LAW ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint under LAW between GPE and GPE , LAW , the ORG d\u2019Etat held that :", "\u201c The GPE authorities request the applicant \u2019s extradition on CARDINAL charges , namely :", "CARDINAL ) Conspiracy to kill GPE nationals outside of GPE ;", "CARDINAL ) Conspiracy and attempt to use of weapons of mass destruction ;", "CARDINAL ) Conspiracy to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation ;", "CARDINAL ) Providing material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation , in violation of the following provisions .", "Again according to the GPE authorities , in order to commit these offences as charged the applicant and CARDINAL accomplices carried out a series of \u2018 overt acts\u2019 , including those for which extradition is being granted to the GPE authorities presented as follows : [ a list of CARDINAL charges follows ] .", "In GPE the charges ( \u2018 in the GPE judicial district and , on related charges , elsewhere in the GPE ) against the applicant are as follows : [ a list of CARDINAL charges follows ] .", "Comparing all the \u2018 overt acts\u2019 for which extradition has been granted to the GPE authorities with all the NORP charges valid \u2018 in the GPE judicial district and ... elsewhere in the GPE , it will be noted that the former have no territorial link with GPE , constituting a set of acts which serve as the constituent elements of the CARDINAL charges presented by the GPE authorities .", "It emerges from the case file that the applicant is wanted by the GPE authorities for a number of offences in respect of which he has not been \u2018 found guilty , convicted or acquitted in the requested State\u2019 and that the \u2018 overt acts\u2019 constitute so many elements to be used by the GPE judicial authorities to establish whether the applicant is guilty or innocent of the CARDINAL charges brought against him . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
