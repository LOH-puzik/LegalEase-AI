Third - party comments were received from CARDINAL GPE - based non - governmental organisation , ORG , which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL of the applicants , Mr Em . GPE and PERSON , are permanent residents at GPE where they are registered . The first had applied and obtained in DATE a housing loan from ORG for the purchase of a constructible plot in GPE . The second had also applied in DATE to benefit from the housing programme in GPE , but his application was turned down because the conditions required were not met .", "In DATE , the CARDINAL applicants , together with other GPE families , all of whom lived until then in PERSON ( LOC ) , moved to the \u201c PERSON \u201d area which is located at the administrative borders of GPE with GPE , in the island of GPE . The applicants proceeded to set up their sheds in a section of a road that was not yet in operation . The surrounding area was being used as an impromptu rubbish tip . According to information from local police , the place where the applicants established themselves belongs to GPE , while CARDINAL family settled in an adjacent plot of land belonging to a private person .", "Various local officials such as representatives from ORG and from GPE , the deputy Prefect of PERSON as well as the commander of ORG visited the place where the applicants had set up their sheds and noted that the living conditions prevailing there were unsavoury and unhealthy . Certain efforts were made by the officials to find alternative sites for accommodation . Police officials eventually proceeded to file on DATE complaints for breach of the ACARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL Sanitary Regulation and in particular because \u201c on DATE the GPE created problems of aesthetics and pollution with rubbish and other old items \u201d .", "It transpires from a document established on DATE by the police ORG that on DATE the owner of the plot of land where CARDINAL family had settled arrived at the office of the First Deputy Director of ORG , accompanied by his lawyer , and requested the police to put an end to the situation created in the area .

CARDINAL of them was the shed that was located on private property while the remaining CARDINAL sheds were located on municipal owned land . The police did not demolish the remaining CARDINAL sheds but warned those living there that should they not leave the area , their sheds would also be demolished .", "On DATE , ORG filed a criminal complaint with ORG on the applicants\u2019 eviction or threatened eviction while it also informed the Chief of the NORP Police of the eviction . In both cases , it called for the launching of criminal and disciplinary proceedings against both police officers and municipal officials who had been involved in the eviction , while it also called upon both the judicial and the police authorities to examine whether the actions of the police officers and municipal officials might have been racially motivated . In particular , the NGO complained of accumulated threats on the part of police officers , waste of alien \u2019s property , breach of domestic asylum and racial discrimination .", "On DATE , the applicants decided to leave GPE and seek to settle elsewhere .", "On DATE , ORG , which had received on DATE , notarized powers of attorney by the CARDINAL applicants , filed a complaint on their behalf .

The ORG noted that the applicants had not respected the time - limit of DATE for lodging the appeal and held that the fact that they had taken knowledge of the decision of ORG belatedly , due to the absence abroad of their representative , did not constitute a case of force majeure or of an absolute impediment to file the appeal within the above - mentioned time - limit ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
