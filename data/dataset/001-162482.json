NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr S. von ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and Mr PERSON , of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The housing estate company \u201c PERSON GPE \u201d ( ORG ) , subsequent to its foundation in DATE , acquired a large area of land just outside GPE . The aim of the company was to develop and divide up the land and sell it to prospective dwellers . The sale of the first plots of land began in DATE . The NORP entrepreneur GPE , a NORP national , personally held PERCENT of ORG \u2019s shares and owned DATE directly or indirectly PERCENT of the shares in another company holding PERCENT of the shares in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after ORG came to power , GPE was forced to leave GPE and to hand over , inter alia , his shares in ORG , amounting to PERCENT of all shares , to representatives of the new regime . By DATE almost all of the total of CARDINAL plots had been sold by ORG .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the community of GPE became part of the former GPE ( GPE ) . No mechanism for restitution of land property was available to GPE at that time .", "CARDINAL . In DATE FAC obtained the reassignment of his shares in GPE , although at that time ORG no longer owned any property of significance .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , upon GPE \u2019s reunification , ORG , Gesetz zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen / Verm\u00f6gensgesetz , ) was introduced and subsequently amended several times , offering the possibility of restitution claims regarding property situated on the territory of the former GPE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Conference on NORP Material Claims against GPE , GPE ( NORP Claims Conference - JCC ) specified a global application for restitution under LAW with the aim of regaining PERCENT of the ownership of a large number of plots of land formerly owned by ORG . The application was made under LAW CARDINAL sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . GPE \u2019s heirs had not asserted their potential claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG transferred all rights concerning the relevant plots of land to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent ORG for ORG ( Landesamt f\u00fcr offene Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) rejected the applicant \u2019s restitution and compensation requests , which had originally been filed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant brought CARDINAL cases before ORG . Some of these concerned restitution , others compensation claims since the plots of land concerned had undisputedly been acquired in good faith by third parties after DATE and restitution was thus ruled out by law , to protect the new owners . CARDINAL of the restitution cases was chosen as a pilot case . The corresponding plot had been sold in DATE and was never resold . Ownership had been passed on by inheritance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action in the pilot case . It held that the ORG counted as the legal successor of GPE and had lawfully ceded the relevant rights to the applicant . Notwithstanding , a restitution claim was ruled out by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , eleventh sentence , of LAW , because the plots had previously been owned by a housing estate enterprise ( \u201c Siedlungsunternehmen \u201d ) . ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that he was treated differently to other groups of victims in the past , because the users or owners who had acquired property before DATE had never been protected . Furthermore , other companies which had divided up land into plots but did not qualify for the narrow definition of \u201c housing estate enterprise \u201d were entitled to restitution . However , ORG considered that the ORG had a wide margin of appreciation as to how victims of the ORG regime should be compensated , and could not find that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , eleventh sentence , of LAW violated LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , mainly endorsing ORG findings . It further held that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , eleventh sentence , of LAW did not infringe LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) since the applicant \u2019s legal predecessor had not previously acquired property rights . It referred to a previous ruling , delivered on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , stating that the relevant DATE version of LAW had not afforded compensation rights to shareholders of a company owning real estate , but only to the owner company itself . Making reference to the spirit and purpose of the amendment in DATE ORG , in the instant case , took the view that ORG compensation claims had been made possible for the first time in DATE by amending section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , fourth sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Even assuming that the applicant \u2019s legal predecessor had already been entitled to compensation claims when the DATE amendment came into force , the legislator had struck a fair balance between the interests concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( case no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It shared ORG view that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , eleventh sentence , of LAW did not infringe the applicant \u2019s right under LAW of LAW .", "It further came to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s right to property under LAW was not violated either . With regard to the legal situation before DATE , ORG pointed out that it was subject to legal debate whether not only companies but also their shareholders had been entitled to immediate restitution claims to property which had been detached from the company in the past . While some legal authors and ORG , in a judgment of DATE , saw this entitlement already guaranteed in the DATE version of LAW , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , thereby supported by other legal authors , took the view that shareholders were given this right to immediate restitution only in DATE . ORG considered that the determination of whether a claim existed was the responsibility of the lower courts ( Fachgerichte ) and that the change of case - law was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable . Although the reasons given by ORG in this regard had been very short and without further illustration of the amendment \u2019s spirit and purpose , it had to be observed that a considerable number of legal authors agreed to its interpretation and for these reasons alone it could not be viewed as untenable ( \u201c unter keinem denkbaren GPE mehr rechtlich vertretbar \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action in CARDINAL restitution cases which had remained pending . On DATE , in a separate judgment , it also dismissed his action in CARDINAL cases in which the applicant had filed for compensation . On DATE ORG found against the applicant in another CARDINAL compensation cases . In all CARDINAL judgments ORG , in its reasoning on the merits , merely referred to its own judgment and the decision of the Federal courts in the pilot case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed . Their content and limits shall be defined by the laws .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG entails obligations . Its use shall also serve the public good .", "( CARDINAL ) Expropriation shall only be permissible in the public interest . It may only be ordered by or pursuant to a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation . Such compensation shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected . In case of dispute regarding the amount of compensation , recourse may be had to the ordinary courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c All persons shall be equal before the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE ( PERSON ) provides that persons whose property was unlawfully expropriated during the time of the GPE are in principle entitled to restitution , unless the property was purchased in good faith by a third party . In such cases , the former owners have a right to financial compensation .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL extends the applicability of LAW in favour of persons persecuted on racial , political , religious or ideological grounds during the time of ORG rule and who , in this context , lost their property by expropriation or sales under duress . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , third sentence , provides that where NORP beneficiaries do not assert a claim , the ORG acts as legal successor in respect to the claim .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a fourth sentence was added to section QUANTITY , which , at the given time , provided as far as relevant :", "\u201c If assets , of which an enterprise has been deprived , which are to be returned or have already been returned according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ... do not belong to the enterprise \u2019s property any more , the beneficiary may claim , by the means of individual restitution , that he or she be granted ownership of these objects in fractional shares equivalent to the stakes of which he or she was deprived ; ... \u201d", "( \u201c PERSON , die mit einem nach \u00a7 QUANTITY . CARDINAL ... zur\u00fcckzugebenden oder einem bereits zur\u00fcckgegebenen GPE entzogen ... worden sind , nicht mehr zum Verm\u00f6gen des Unternehmens , so kann der Berechtigte verlangen , dass ihm an diesen Gegenst\u00e4nden i m Wege der Einzelrestitution in H\u00f6he der ihm entzogenen GPE einger\u00e4umt CARDINAL ; ... \u201d )", "According to the written motivation to the bill , this amendment was made to avoid enterprises expropriated DATE being returned only after having been stripped of their assets ( see ORG documents ( ORG ) , no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Parliament ( GPE ) passed further amendments to LAW which came into force on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , fourth sentence , was supplemented by , inter alia , another CARDINAL sentence , which \u2013 as far as relevant DATE provides :", "\u201c ... such claim shall also exist if the subject - matter of the act of deprivation according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL was a direct or indirect stake in an enterprise ... \u201d", "( \u201c ... dieser Anspruch besteht auch , wenn eine unmittelbare oder mittelbare ORG nach \u00a7 QUANTITY . CARDINAL ist ... \u201d )", "Likewise , a new eleventh sentence was introduced which ruled out the application of the fourth sentence , inter alia , with regard to real estate property used for housing purposes sold for market prices to natural persons by a \u201c housing estate enterprise \u201d ( \u201c Siedlungsunternehmen \u201d ) before DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL C CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the DATE version of section QUANTITY sentence , of LAW already enabled direct claims by company shareholders . While it found that the wording of the provision was unclear , it referred to the purpose of the law , in particular that those who had lost property due to persecution by the ORG regime , with the property remaining on the territory of the former GPE , should receive compensation equal to that awarded to property owners under NORP Allied law after World War II . It took the view that comprehensive compensation for the so - called \u201c aryanisation \u201d of NORP companies was only possible by granting immediate restitution claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in another judgment ( case no . CARDINAL C CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that until DATE , shareholders of companies subject to ORG persecution could not have acquired claims protected under LAW . It held that the typical ORG method of depriving NORP shareholders of their property had not been addressed in the DATE version of the law . Taking as its basis the purpose of the amendment of DATE and the unclear wording in the DATE version of the law , the court concluded that the new provision entitled shareholders of such companies to restitution claims for the first time . It also found that if a right had already existed in DATE which had been taken away by the new legislation , the legislator had managed to find a fair balance between the rights involved . ORG did not make a reference to its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
