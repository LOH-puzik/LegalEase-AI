Appeals on points of law ( dovolanie ) are regulated in Head CARDINAL of that Part .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL an appeal on points of law lies against final and binding decisions of appellate courts if some of the statutory admissibility criterion are met .", "CARDINAL . The general admissibility criterion , i.e. those applicable to both judgments ( rozsudok ) and resolutions ( uznesenie ) , are set out in Article CARDINAL . These comprise situations ( a ) where the courts decided in a matter outside their jurisdiction ; ( b ) where a person who acted as a party to the proceedings lacked legal capacity to be a party to court proceedings ; ( c ) where a party to the proceedings lacked capacity to act in court proceedings and was not duly represented ; ( d ) where the courts decided in a matter which had been res iudicata or which had already been pending in another proceedings ( lis pendens ) ; ( e ) where the proceedings could only commence by way of an action and no such action was actually filed ; ( f ) where the courts prevented a party to the proceedings from acting before them ; and ( g ) where the case was decided upon by an excluded judge or where the composition of the court was incorrect .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the above general admissibility criteria , special admissibility criteria apply if the court of appeal decided in the form of a judgment . These are defined in LAW . Its paragraph CARDINAL provides for an appeal on points of law if the appellate court overturned the judgment of a first instance court . In accordance with its paragraph CARDINAL , an appeal on points of law also lies against a judgment of the appellate court in which the latter did not follow the binding legal view previously expressed in the same matter by the court of cassation . Under paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) , an appeal on points of law is also admissible against a judgment of an appellate court in which it upholds a judgment of a first instance court and , at the same time , it rules that such an appeal is admissible as the case concerns a matter of particular legal importance . Finally , under paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) , an appeal on points of law is also admissible against a second judgment of an appellate court in which it upholds a second judgment of a first instance court if , in the second round , the first instance court decided differently than in its first judgment ( which had been quashed by the first decision of the court of appeal ) because it was bound by the legal view expressed by the court of appeal in its first judgment . This rule applies also to the third and , as the case may be , subsequent judgments of the court of appeal .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) a person who appeals on points of law must be legally represented .", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) the scope of the examination of an appeal on points of law by the court of cassation is in principle limited to the grounds of appeal submitted by an appellant . Except for flaws listed under LAW and flaws that have resulted in an incorrect decision on the merits , the court of cassation does not review ex officio any procedural flaws that have not been complained of by an appellant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
