He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife arrived in GPE . They applied for asylum , and before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) the applicant essentially stated the following . He and his wife are NORP from GPE . His brother , a member of ORG , had disappeared in DATE and the applicant had contacted ORG to inquire about his whereabouts . After the war in DATE , ORG had accused the applicant of being a spy for GPE and had harassed him due to his religious beliefs . In DATE CARDINAL members of ORG had come to his and his wife \u2019s house and physically assaulted his wife . He had tried to scare the intruders by firing into the air . Subsequently , he and his wife had hidden in a NORP neighbourhood in GPE . Since , allegedly , the NORP authorities were unable to protect them , they had decided to leave the country . If returned to GPE , he would risk being killed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s requests for asylum . It noted that , according to the ORG , the general situation in GPE after the armed conflict during DATE and cessation of hostilities was such that NORP citizens who had fled because of the armed conflict were no longer automatically in need of international protection . It held therefore that the general situation in GPE did not in itself constitute a sufficient basis for granting asylum . Turning to the applicant \u2019s individual claims , the ORG found that there was no evidence that he had been accused of being a spy , that he was wanted by ORG or that the alleged threats and assaults were connected to ORG . Furthermore , there was no evidence that the NORP authorities would be unable or unwilling to protect him . Moreover , it noted that nothing indicated that the applicant had controversial political or other affiliations which would make him of interest to any particular group in GPE . Consequently , the ORG concluded that , since the applicant had not substantiated his alleged grounds for asylum , and no other reasons for asylum had been established , his request should be rejected and his deportation to GPE ordered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) against ORG decision . He maintained his claims and added that CARDINAL of the reasons why ORG thought he was a spy was that he had volunteered as a paramedic , which had allowed him to move freely in the area of the armed conflict . If returned to GPE , he would risk being imprisoned or killed by ORG because they considered him to be a spy who had defied ORG and fired at them in his home . He could not report the incident to the police since ORG exerted power over the authorities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . It found that the applicant could have been of some interest to ORG due to his inquiries about his brother , his work as a paramedic and the threats and assaults to which the applicant and his wife had been subjected . However , the court found that the abuse the applicant and his wife feared from ORG constituted criminal acts which fell within the responsibility of the NORP authorities . Since the applicant and his wife had not contacted the NORP authorities , they could not be deemed to have exhausted the protection available in GPE or made it probable that those authorities were unwilling or unable to protect them . Furthermore , the court held that , as the applicant had not been politically active , and his brother \u2019s engagement with ORG dated back DATE , there were no reasons to believe that the applicant would be of any particular interest to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a document alleged to be a NORP judgment by default dated DATE . According to the judgment , the applicant had been convicted , inter alia , of premeditated murder and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , including hard labour .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the submission of the document to entail a request for a stay of the enforcement of the deportation order and a re - examination of its previous decision due to impediments to the enforcement . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG noted that the applicant had not previously claimed that the NORP authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest and that he had not provided any information on how he had obtained the document in question . It therefore had the authenticity of the judgment examined . The examination , which revealed , inter alia , that the document was a copy created using toner technology and that the stamps and signatures on it had been produced by photocopiers or printers , led to the conclusion that there were strong indications that it was not authentic . The ORG accordingly decided that there was no ground for a re - examination of its decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , upheld the ORG \u2019s conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the deportation order became timebarred and shortly thereafter the applicant and his wife again applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicant maintained his previous submissions but made some changes and additions . In particular , he claimed that he had shot and killed CARDINAL of the men who had forced their way into his home in DATE and that that man was the son of a high - ranking ORG politician . Furthermore , due to his alleged conviction in absentia in DATE , ORG had sought him at his GPE and their ORG homes , which showed that he was wanted by ORG . He submitted an arrest warrant dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s new requests for asylum . As concerns the arrest warrant , which allegedly was based on the above - mentioned conviction , it was found to be of a very simple and easily falsified nature . Furthermore , it was undated , seemed to be a copy and was not accompanied by an explanation as to how the applicant had obtained it . In view of this , the Agency concluded that the documents submitted had very low value as evidence and were not sufficient to substantiate the applicant \u2019s asylum claims . The Agency then turned to the oral information submitted by the applicant . It found that , after having been refused asylum in DATE , he had changed his story significantly concerning the alleged incident at his home without providing any reasonable explanation . Moreover , he had failed to give a reasonable explanation as to why he had not mentioned the fatal shooting of the intruder , the conviction and the arrest warrant in the original asylum proceedings . The ORG thus found reason to question whether the alleged incident had occurred at all . It also noted that the applicant and his wife , despite numerous questions , had only submitted very parsimonious and vague answers concerning alleged visits and inquiries by ORG to their parents and other family members . In addition , the ORG noted that the incident had allegedly occurred in DATE and that there was no evidence indicating that ORG would have any particular or current interest in the applicant . Furthermore , the ORG confirmed its previous findings regarding the general situation in GPE . Lastly , in regard to the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s private life within the meaning of LAW , it found that , for the majority of the time , they had resided in GPE illegally and had much stronger links to GPE than to GPE . Thus , they could not be granted leave to remain due to their residence in or connections to GPE . The ORG concluded that no grounds for residence permits had been established and therefore ordered the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He maintained his claims and submitted , inter alia , documents from a lawyer and a security official at the Rafic Hariri FAC which stated that he had been convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and was wanted by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG upheld ORG decision . It agreed with the reasoning of the ORG concerning the probative value of the written evidence submitted and noted that the new documents were of a simple nature and did not substantiate his need for protection . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s accounts of the alleged incident in their home in DATE were incoherent and contradictory . Consequently , it concluded that they had not demonstrated that ORG had any interest in them , that they were exposed to risks against which they could not be protected by the NORP authorities or that they had been persecuted due to their NORP faith or for any other reason . Lastly , it shared the ORG \u2019s reasoning concerning the lack of sufficient links to GPE for granting them leave to remain .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a wellfounded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group , and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has acquired legal force . This is the case where new circumstances have emerged which indicate that there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , or where there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . If a residence permit can not be granted under these criteria , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such re - examination is to be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances relied on by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and that these circumstances could not have been raised previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , the ORG will decide not to grant re - examination ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG released ORG on ORG for DATE . It stated :", "\u201c GPE is a parliamentary republic based on the DATE ORG , which apportions governmental authority among a ORG president , a NORP speaker of ORG ( parliament ) , and a NORP prime minister ...", "NORP authorities maintained control over the armed forces and other security forces , although NORP security and militia forces , the designated terrorist group NORP , and other extremist elements operated outside the direction or control of government officials ...", "The most significant human rights abuses during DATE were torture and abuse by security forces , harsh prison and detention center conditions , and limitations on freedom of movement for NORP and NORP refugees ...", "Other human rights abuses included lengthy pretrial detention ; a judiciary subject to political pressure and long delays in trials ; violation of ORG privacy rights ...", "Despite the presence of NORP and ORG security forces , ORG retained significant influence over parts of the country , and the government made no tangible progress toward disbanding and disarming armed militia groups , including GPE ...", "Authorities failed to observe many provisions of the law , and government security forces , as well as extralegal armed groups such as NORP , continued the practice of extrajudicial arrest and detention , including incommunicado detention . Additionally , the law permits military intelligence personnel to make arrests without warrants in cases involving military personnel or involving civilians suspected of espionage , treason , or weapons possession . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The International Religious Freedom Report for DATE of ORG , released by ORG , contained , inter alia , the following in respect of GPE :", "\u201c The constitution states there shall be absolute freedom of conscience and guarantees the free exercise of religious rites for all religious groups provided the public order is not disturbed . The constitution states there shall be a \u201c just and equitable balance \u201d in the apportionment of cabinet and high level civil service positions among the major religious groups , a situation reaffirmed by ORG , which ended the country \u2019s civil war and mandated equal representation between NORP and NORP in the parliament . Some minority NORP groups complained they were not granted proportionate representation in the cabinet , high level civil service positions , or the parliament . ...", "... Religious leaders of NORP and NORP communities reported places of worship continued to operate in relative peace and security , and that relationships among individual members of different religious groups generally remained amicable .", "...", "Statistics GPE estimates PERCENT of the population is NORP . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE on his mission to GPE , the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief of ORG ( ORG ) set out , inter alia , the following conclusions :", "\u201c In GPE , people are free to confess and practise their religions and beliefs in the way they see fit . Conversion in different directions is possible and indeed a reality \u2013 in stark contrast to the situation in most other LOC countries . People can also bear public testimony to their faith and engage in missionary or dawa activities . Religious diversity is a visible and audible reality , as churches and mosques often stand in close vicinity and the ringing of bells at times intermingles with the NORP call to prayer . Some NORP openly declare themselves as agnostics or atheists , and express critical views on religion in general , which is mostly appreciated as something quite natural in an open society .", "The country \u2019s pluralistic heritage is a counterpoint to the aggressive agendas of sectarian homogenization that haunt some neighbouring countries . Over DATE , a culture of interreligious coexistence has emerged that DATE helps to build resilience against extremist interpretations of religious traditions . Many families comprise persons of different religious orientations . Many people live , learn and work together across confessional lines , a situation that quite naturally fosters the discovery of common interests , values and convictions . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
