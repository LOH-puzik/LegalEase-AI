On CARDINAL DATE the Mayor of GPE granted planning permission ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy i zagospodarowania terenu ) to the HIT company for the construction of a commercial centre . The Mayor found that the planned commercial centre conformed to the local development plan . The decision provided that on one side of the commercial centre the investor was required to erect a minimum QUANTITY high screen between the delivery area of the centre and the neighbouring houses .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicants were not informed about the grant of the planning permission despite the fact that their house was directly adjacent to the area of the future development .

It accordingly held that ORG had erred in its examination of the provisions of the local development plan related to the area on which the commercial centre was to be built . Furthermore , ORG had erred in its assessment of the adverse environmental impact of the commercial centre . The court referred in this respect to ORG judgment of DATE ( case no . PERSON CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see below ) . It noted , among other things , that the delivery area of the commercial centre on the Harcerska street side was to be isolated by a minimum QUANTITY high wall from the neighbouring estate of detached houses .", "CARDINAL .
