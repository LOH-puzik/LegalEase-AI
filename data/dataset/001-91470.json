Pursuant to the said provision , the head of the penal institution may halt letters to inmates that are written in a foreign language without a compelling reason ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the prison authorities alleging that the letters were written by his aunt and cousin who , despite having dual NORP and NORP nationality , were not capable of corresponding in NORP . He further submitted that both of the said relatives had been allowed to communicate with him in NORP on the occasion of previous visits to the GPE prison .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that it was undisputed that the applicant himself had full command of the NORP language and that the senders of the letters had both NORP and NORP nationality and had been residing in GPE for DATE . ORG found that since the applicant had failed to make any submissions as to why the authors of the letters were not capable of corresponding in NORP \u2013 for example personal data relating to their age , the length of their residence in GPE or their language skills - , there was nothing to establish that there existed a compelling reason for them to write in LANGUAGE . The mere fact that it would be easier for them to correspond in NORP could not be regarded as a compelling reason in this regard . ORG further observed that the applicant had extensive contacts with the outside world by means of visits and telephone calls . ORG clarified that the general decision whether the correspondence of the applicant had to be monitored had already been the subject of previous court decisions in DATE and was not the subject of the instant appeal .", "On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant and upheld the decision of ORG . ORG also found that the applicant had not substantiated that there were compelling reasons for the authors of the letters to write in LANGUAGE . It pointed out that should the applicant wish to have the entire correspondence with the said relatives excluded from monitoring , he would be free to lodge a pertinent request with the prison authorities .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Penal Code reads as follows :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL Stoppage of Letters", "The leader of the institution may halt letters ,", "CARDINAL . if the purpose of the imprisonment or the security or order of the penal institution would be jeopardised ,", "CARDINAL . if the transmission of the letters in knowledge of their content constituted a criminal offence or summary offence ,", "CARDINAL . if they contain grossly incorrect or seriously distorting descriptions of prison conditions ,", "CARDINAL . if they contain gross insults ,", "CARDINAL . if they might jeopardise the integration of another prisoner ,", "CARDINAL . if they are drafted in a secret language , illegible , incomprehensible or drafted in a foreign language without a compelling reason .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
