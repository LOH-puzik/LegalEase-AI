The applicant maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the men who had abducted their relative Mr PERSON on DATE had been ORG agents . In support of their allegation they referred to the following : the abduction had taken place in broad daylight , in an area surrounded by ORG cameras , in the presence of witnesses ; the perpetrators had acted openly , without fear of arrest by law - enforcement authorities ; the authorities had wilfully delayed the investigation of the incident by conducting , for instance , the crime scene examination DATE after the ORG complaints about it ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and by taking further steps either belatedly or with major deficiences ( see , for example , paragraphs CARDINAL above ) ; the ORG officer PERSON had been present in the vicinity of the abduction scene during the incident ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) and the applicants had informed the investigators of his and his colleagues\u2019 alleged involvement in the crime ; Mr PERSON had been suspected of involvement in illegal activities and , therefore , the authorities had had motives for his abduction ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . The applicants also referred to a number of abductions allegedly perpetrated by ORG authorities in ORG DATE in similar circumstances , where some of the abducted men had subsequently been found in ORG custody .", "CARDINAL . The Government denied any involvement of ORG agents in the events . In particular , they stated that only in DATE had the first applicant alleged that law - enforcement officers had been involved in the incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG points out that a number of principles have been developed in its case - law as regards applications in which it is faced with the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree . As to the facts that are in dispute , the ORG reiterates its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d in its assessment of evidence ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII ) . Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . In this context , the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see , for example , ORG v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Nonetheless , where allegations are made under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , the ORG must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL , and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterates that it has noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it . Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the ORG is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents , it is for the ORG to argue conclusively why the documents in question can not serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants , or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how the events in question occurred . The burden of proof is thus shifted to the ORG and if they fail in their arguments , issues will arise under LAW ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , and Akkum and Others v. GPE , no . LOC , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) .", "DATE . The ORG notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev the Government produced the relevant documents from the file ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has found the NORP State authorities responsible for a number of extra - judicial executions or disappearances of civilians perpetrated in GPE at DATE and DATE , even in the absence of final conclusions from the domestic investigation ( see ORG and GPE v. GPE , nos . LANGUAGE and QUANTITY , DATE ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINAL-XIII ; Estamirov and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . It has done so taking into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and on the basis of witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time . It has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment , on witness accounts , on other information on security operations and on the undisputed effective control of the areas in question by the NORP military . On that basis , it has concluded that the areas in question were \u201c within the exclusive control of the authorities of the ORG \u201d in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen ( see , mutatis mutandis , Akkum , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred do not warrant an unequivocal conclusion that ORG agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative for the following reasons . As regards the general background , the events complained of took place not in GPE , but in PERSON in DATE , and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving civilian vehicles . Noting that the applicants\u2019 version of the events was based on the statements of those who had not witnessed the abduction themselves , except for the statement of PERSON . , that the video of the abduction had not assisted in the identification of the culprits ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) and taking into account that the abductors drove ordinary vehicles and were wearing balaclavas and civilian clothing , the ORG has little evidence to rely upon . However , bearing in mind that after the events the applicants received information alleging knowledge of their relative \u2019s whereabouts which they submitted to the authorities with a delay varying from DATE to DATE ( see , for example , CARDINAL and DATE above ) , along with the subsequent discovery of the burnt body and the experts\u2019 evaluation concerning its identity ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) , the ORG is not persuaded that the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative by ORG agents is the only possible explanation of the events in question .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the information in the ORG \u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a \u201c security operation \u201d had been carried out in respect of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , it has not been established to the required standard of proof that ORG agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr PERSON ; nor does the ORG consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
