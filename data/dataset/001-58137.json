On DATE the applicant company \u2019s lawyer made a reposici\u00f3n application to ORG , arguing that the application to set aside had been made on behalf of the company , that the fact that Mr DATE \u2019s name appeared in the application had been merely a typing error and that it was clear that the intention had been to apply to set aside on behalf of the applicant company and not of PERSON DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On the other hand , those factors do justify finding , like the ordinary courts , that there was a want of diligence in the proceedings that can not be remedied ; nor must it be overlooked that it would have to be remedied after [ the procedure of formally submitting ] the application to set aside had been completed . That fact makes it impossible for the ORG to hold that there was merely an irregularity , omission or imperfection that could be cured by supplying the missing element . In the instant case , apart from the fact that the omission in question concerned an essential element of the act and related to the person carrying it out , it would have to be cured outside the mandatory time - limits laid down for formally submitting an application to set aside ( Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW ) , and in such cases of late rectification of an essential element of a procedural step subject to mandatory time - limits , this ORG has held that failure to rectify [ the error ] does not infringe the right to effective protection by the courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
