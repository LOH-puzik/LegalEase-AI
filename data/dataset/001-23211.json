THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and detained in ORG . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , then aged DATE , was arrested on DATE , together with another youth NORP aged DATE in connection with the murder of PERSON , aged DATE . The applicant was interviewed in police custody over a period of DATE . He admitted being present on the LOC where the killing had taken place but denied having taken an active part . He said that he left the room on QUANTITY occasions and when he returned the second time , he saw NORP stabbing PERSON . NORP was charged with murder on DATE , the applicant on DATE .", "The prosecution case was that the CARDINAL had acted in furtherance of a joint enterprise and that the murder had been committed as an act of sacrifice to the devil . It was alleged that NORP had plunged a knife into PERSON chest in the presence of the applicant after the applicant had prevented the victim from leaving and had struck him . The applicant and NORP were committed for trial to ORG on an indictment charging them with murder and , in the alternative , manslaughter . His co - accused , NORP , entered a guilty plea to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility . After consideration of medical reports , the plea was accepted by the ORG and NORP was sentenced to committal to hospital under a hospital order subject to a restriction order without limit of time under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "The applicant appeared before ORG on DATE . The evidence of CARDINAL psychiatrists who had examined the applicant was that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia . Counsel acting on the applicant \u2019s behalf submitted that the applicant was unfit to plead or to stand trial by reason of his mental disability .", "On DATE , evidence was heard before the jury from CARDINAL psychiatrists ( CARDINAL for the defence and CARDINAL for the prosecution ) . The trial judge , with the support of both counsel for the prosecution and for the defence , directed the jury to find that the applicant was unfit to plead or stand trial . This finding was in accordance with the R v. PERSON case ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL C & P CARDINAL ) , on the basis that the applicant was unable to instruct his legal representatives to plead to the indictment , to challenge jurors , to understand the evidence or to give evidence in his own defence . Following this finding , and in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG the \u201c DATE LAW ) , a second jury was empanelled in order to determine whether the applicant \u2018 did the act or made the omission charged against him\u2019 ( a \u201c section CARDINAL hearing \u201d ) .", "On DATE , counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant should be entitled to raise the issue of diminished responsibility during the section CARDINAL hearing . The judge made CARDINAL rulings : firstly , that in order to prove that the applicant had committed the act , the prosecution must prove both the actus reus and the mens rea and , secondly , that diminished responsibility could not be raised in a section CARDINAL hearing .", "On DATE , the jury heard evidence concerning the events surrounding the killing , including the applicant \u2019s interviews . The case followed the adversarial procedure of a criminal trial , with evidence being called by each side and subjected to cross - examination , closing speeches and a summing up to the jury . At the conclusion of the evidence , the second jury were satisfied that the applicant had committed the necessary act , and the judge thereupon made an order under the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW that the applicant be committed to hospital without limit of time .", "On DATE , the applicant was granted leave to appeal . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal but certified that the case raised a point of law of general public importance , namely , whether it was open to a person found unfit to plead , and who was subject to a trial of the facts on a charge of murder under section CARDINAL , to raise the defence of diminished responsibility . ORG granted leave to appeal on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the prosecution only had to prove the actus reus and not the mens rea in a section CARDINAL hearing . The only time when mens rea might become relevant would be where there is \u201c objective evidence which raises the issue of mistake or accident or self - defence , then the jury should not find that the defendant did the act unless it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on all the evidence that the prosecution has negatived that defence \u201d . Their Lordships also ruled that the statutory defence of diminished responsibility could not be raised in a section CARDINAL hearing . This decision was taken principally because of the effect of the wording of section CARDINAL of the Homicide Act DATE , which established this statutory defence as being available only as an alternative to a liability for murder . Once unfitness to plead has been determined , the trial can not proceed , the defendant can no longer be \u2018 liable to be convicted of CARDINAL , and that defence is no longer available .", "Lord PERSON , in giving the leading judgment , commented :", "\u201c The purpose of section CARDINAL , in my opinion , is to strike a fair balance between the need to protect a defendant who has , in fact , done nothing wrong and is unfit to plead at his trial and the need to protect the public from a defendant who has committed an injurious act which would constitute a crime if done with the requisite mens rea . The need to protect the public is particularly important where the act done has been CARDINAL which caused death or physical injury to another person and there is a risk that the defendant may carry out a similar act in the future . I consider that the section strikes this balance by distinguishing between a person who has not carried out the actus reus of the crime charged against him and a person who has carried out an act ( or has made an omission ) which would constitute a crime if done ( or made ) with the requisite mens rea . \u201d", "The criminal proceedings are currently stayed against the applicant indefinitely , and ORG has indicated in this case an intention to revive the proceedings if , at any time in the future , the applicant should recover .", "A jury can not make a determination that a defendant is unfit to be tried \u201c except on the written or oral evidence of CARDINAL or more registered medical practitioners \u201d ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . The test for the jury is whether the defendant is able to plead to the indictment , whether the defendant is of sufficient intellect to comprehend the course of the proceedings of the trial , so as to make a proper defence , to challenge a juror to whom he might wish to object , and to understand the details of the evidence ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL C. & P. CARDINAL ) .", "On a finding of unfitness to plead \u201c the trial shall not proceed \u201d ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) , and a further jury must be empanelled to determine \u201c whether they are satisfied , as respects the count or each of the counts on which the accused was to be tried , that he did the act or made the omission charged against him as the offence \u201d ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) . If they are so satisfied , then \u201c they shall make a finding that the accused did the act or made the omission charged against him \u201d ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) . If they are not so satisfied \u201c they shall return a verdict of acquittal as if on the count in question the trial had proceeded to a conclusion \u201d ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) .", "The burden of proof is on the prosecution and , in order to prove that the defendant was guilty of doing the act charged , the prosecution must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt . A finding under this procedure is not a finding of guilt ( NORP v. Southwark ORG ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON , GPE ) .", "Under LAW , if the accused is found unfit to plead and the jury determines that he did the act or made the omission charged , then the court may make CARDINAL of the following orders :", "( a ) an admission order to such hospital as the Secretary of ORG specifies ;", "( b ) a guardianship order under LAW DATE ;", "( c ) a supervision and treatment order ; or", "( d ) an order for the accused \u2019s absolute discharge .", "Where however the offence to which the finding relates is murder , then the court must make an admission order together with an order restricting his discharge without limitation of time . If the jury are not satisfied that the accused did the act or made the omission charged they must return a verdict of acquittal as if on the count in question the trial had proceeded to a conclusion ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) .", "If , while a person is detained under an admission order , the Secretary of ORG is satisfied that he can be properly tried , he may remit the person for trial ( Schedule CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( Insanity and Unfitness to Plead ) Act DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) ) .", "Following the decision in the applicant \u2019s case and the entry into force of LAW DATE , ORG gave leave to appeal to ORG in the case of PERSON and the Secretary of ORG , certifying as a point of law of general public importance the question whether the section CARDINAL procedure was compatible with an accused \u2019s rights under LAW , DATE and CARDINAL(d ) of the Convention .", "In ORG judgment of DATE , Lord PERSON endorsed the views expressed in the applicant \u2019s case by Lord PERSON ( see above ) and referring to the PERSON v. the GPE case ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) in considering whether the section CARDINAL procedure fell within the scope of LAW , held , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is first necessary to know how the issue is classified in domestic law . This test is far from decisive and rightly so , since the ORG seeks the achievement of broadly equivalent standards among the member states of ORG and such aim would be defeated if domestic rules were determinative . But this is the starting point , and it is clear that the domestic law of GPE and GPE does not treat the section CARDINAL procedure as involving the determination of a criminal charge . When a finding of unfitness is made it is provided that the trial ( meaning the criminal trial ) \u201c shall not proceed or further proceed \u201d . Section CARDINAL ) is expressed in terms which make it clear that the task of the jury is not that carried out by a jury in a criminal trial : ... the jury have the power to acquit but they have none to convict . The jury take an oath different from that in a criminal trial . There can be no verdict of guilty . There can be no punishment . In a case such as the present , as the legislation has been amended to make clear , an order of absolute discharge may be made in the absence of any conviction and without consideration of the expediency of punishment . It is true that by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)b of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act DATE references in that Act to a conviction are expressed to include reference to a finding that a person has done the act or made the omission charged , but this was an Act designed to promote the rehabilitation of offenders by enabling them to live down past convictions and the obvious purpose of this provision was to give persons subject to adverse findings under section CARDINALA the benefit of that protection . It is also true that a person found to have done the act or made the omission charged is subject , by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)b of LAW , to the notification requirements of that LAW . But I regard it as clear , as a matter of domestic law , that this provision is designed to protect the public and not to punish the subject of the order . The non - punitive nature of the order was recognised by the Commission in PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CD CARDINAL . The registration order is analogous to a sex offender order or an anti - social behaviour order ...", "CARDINAL . The second PERSON test , and that on which the appellant \u2019s argument depended , directed attention to the very nature of the offence . ...", "CARDINAL . It would be highly anomalous if section CARDINAL , introduced by amendment for the protection of those unable through mental unfitness to defend themselves at trial , were itself to be held incompatible with the Convention . It is very much in the interest of such persons that the basic facts relied on against them ( shorn of issues concerning consent ) should be formally and public investigated in open court with counsel appointed to represent the interests of the person accused so far as possible in the circumstances . The position of accused persons would certainly not be improved if section CARDINAL were abrogated . In my opinion , however , the argument is plainly bad in law . Whether CARDINAL views the matter through domestic or NORP spectacles , the answer is the same : the purpose and function of the section CARDINAL procedure is not to decide whether the accused person committed a criminal offence . The procedure can result in a final acquittal , but it can not result in a conviction and it can not result in punishment . Even an adverse finding may lead , as here , to an absolute discharge . But if an adverse finding leads to the making of a hospital order , there is no bar to a full criminal trial if the accused person recovers , an obviously objectionable outcome if the person has already been convicted . ...", "CARDINAL . ... [ As regarded the third PERSON test ] PERSON for the appellant accepted that he could not rely on this test , because he accepted that the orders which the court could make on a finding by the jury adverse to the accused under section CARDINAL were none of them punitive . But the fact that the procedure can not culminate in any penalty is not neutral . The ORG was referred to no case in which ORG has held a proceeding to be criminal even though an adverse outcome for the defendant can not result in any penalty . It is , indeed , difficult if not impossible to conceive of a criminal proceeding which can not in any circumstances culminate in the imposition of any penalty , since it is the purpose of the criminal law to proscribe , and by punishing to deter , conduct regarded as sufficiently damaging to the interests of society to merit the imposition of penal sanctions . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides for a defence of diminished responsibility to a charge of murder :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where a person kills or is a party to the killing of another , he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mind ... as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing . ...", "( CARDINAL ) On a charge of murder , it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be convicted of murder .", "( CARDINAL ) A person who but for this section would be liable , whether as principal or as accessory , to be convicted of murder shall be liable instead to be convicted of manslaughter . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
