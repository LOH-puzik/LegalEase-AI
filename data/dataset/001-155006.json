The applicant was born in DATE and habitually resides in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant was continuously deprived of his liberty in GPE , mainly within the scope of detention pending trial on various charges pursued against him , partly in parallel and partly consecutively . His overall deprivation of liberty included the following periods .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE he was remanded pending trial on several charges , which included what would later be classified as the charge of conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . On the latter date the prosecution on that charge was removed to be dealt with in a separate set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in the subsequent period would later be set off against a DATE prison sentence imposed on him for the offence of attempting to legalise the proceeds of a criminal activity . He was released from detention in connection with that offence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Immediately after his release from the last - mentioned detention , the applicant \u2019s liberty was again restricted and it later resulted in his being remanded pending trial on the charge of murder , of which he was ultimately acquitted on DATE . In consequence , he was released from detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following his release on DATE , the applicant was immediately re - arrested on DATE , and later remanded pending trial on the charge of conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . This term of detention ended with the applicant \u2019s release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Upon his release on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was immediately re - arrested on DATE , and was later remanded pending trial on another charge of murder . This term of detention ended with the applicant \u2019s release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Upon his last - mentioned release , the applicant was immediately transferred to the detention centre for foreigners ( z\u00e1chytn\u00fd t\u00e1bor ) in LOC , where he was detained until his expulsion to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s prosecution on the first charge of murder ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) commenced in DATE while he was still deprived of his liberty within the scope of detention pending trial on the charge of attempting to legalise the proceeds of a criminal activity ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator informed the public prosecution service ( \u201c PPS \u201d ) that if the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence for attempting to legalise the proceeds of a criminal activity were to be upheld on appeal \u2012 an appeal which was about to be heard \u2012 the applicant would be eligible for release because the DATE term of his sentence would soon be fully covered by the term of his detention . It would therefore be advisable to consider lodging an application for the applicant to be detained pending trial on the murder charge , which the ORG subsequently did .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the applicant \u2019s release from detention in connection with the charge of attempting to legalise the proceeds of a criminal activity , on DATE , he was taken to the LOC and ORG in GPE , where a decision was taken ordering his administrative expulsion , a ban from re - entering GPE for DATE , and detention pending the enforcement of the expulsion order ( zaistenie ) . The applicant was then taken to the detention centre in GPE to await implementation of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the murder trial , a public session ( verejn\u00e9 zasadnutie ) was scheduled to take place before the Bratislava I ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) on DATE with a view to examining questions concerning the detention of the applicant . However , in view of the circumstances described in the foregoing paragraph , on DATE the public session was cancelled and the applicant was summoned for questioning the following day .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicant was seized in the detention centre in LOC by police officers who then brought him to ORG for the questioning that had been ordered .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE of DATE , the applicant was brought before a Chamber of the District Court for the questioning , immediately after which ORG ordered a private session ( neverejn\u00e9 zasadnutie ) with a view to making a decision concerning the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . Following the private session of DATE , on DATE , ORG remanded the applicant in detention pending trial on the murder charge .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately following the pronouncement of the detention order , on DATE , which was a DATE , the applicant stated on the record that he wished to lodge an interlocutory appeal and that he would submit the reasons for his appeal upon receiving the written version of the detention order with reasons . The appeal and its reasons were to be submitted to the court of appeal via the first - instance court , that is to say ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , which was a DATE , the applicant submitted the reasons for his appeal in writing in the LANGUAGE language , stating that he would submit further reasons when the written version of the remand order was served on him . It appears that the applicant \u2019s submission of DATE was received at ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the last - mentioned date , that is to say on DATE , the written version of the detention order was served on the applicant in the NORP language and , on DATE , ORG transmitted the case file to ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) for determination of the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , which again was a DATE , the applicant sent a further written submission in the LANGUAGE language , adding reasons to his appeal . It appears that this submission was received at ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE , that is to say on DATE , ORG determined the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal by dismissing it as unfounded . ORG observed at the outset that the applicant had not submitted any reasons for his appeal either orally or in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW of LAW ( Constitutional law no . PERSON . , as amended ) .", "Relying inter alia on LAW , he contended that ( i ) his arrest and bringing before ORG had been unlawful ; ( ii ) the remand decision had been arbitrary ; and ( iii ) ORG had failed to take account of the reasons for his interlocutory appeal submitted on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "It acknowledged that any tribunal ruling on matters concerning detention on remand was under a duty to examine carefully all submissions made by the person remanded , but pointed out that the applicant \u2019s submissions of CARDINAL and DATE had not been available to ORG when it examined his interlocutory appeal . In addition , matters concerning detention on remand generally require swift determination and courts of appeal were obliged to determine interlocutory appeals in such matters within DATE of the date when the appeal was referred to them for determination . Furthermore , in contrast to case no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant had been heard at first instance . And lastly , he had been represented by a lawyer , but the latter had taken no steps to ensure the effective assertion of his rights .", "Thus , in the circumstances , the decision to dismiss the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal without examining the reasons for it could not be considered arbitrary .", "ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , following his acquittal of the first murder charge and release from detention in connection therewith DATE , the applicant was re - arrested . At TIME that day he was served with a document dated DATE charging him with the offence of conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied for an order for the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial , referring to charges of ( i ) DATE for fraud ; ( ii ) DATE for legalising the proceeds of criminal activities ; ( iii ) DATE for conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group ; and ( iv ) DATE on another count of legalising the proceeds of a criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a pre - trial judge at ORG ( \u0160pecializovan\u00fd trestn\u00fd s\u00fad ) remanded the applicant pending trial . As regards the specific trial in question , he identified it by reference to the charge of conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group and the relevant provisions of LAW ( Law no . QUANTITY . , as amended ) .", "The judge observed that the applicant was a non - national and that , prior to his initial arrest , for DATE he had not been living at his registered permanent residence , but rather at his girlfriend \u2019s address . However , he had not been registered as living there . Furthermore , the applicant had often been travelling abroad .", "Accordingly , the judge held that there was no guarantee that , if left at liberty , the applicant would actually continue to live at his girlfriend \u2019s , as he had submitted he would do .", "The judge also observed that the charges brought against the applicant in the other trials concerned various offences allegedly committed at various times and that even the bringing of these charges had not prevented him from allegedly committing the murder of which he stood accused in CARDINAL of those trials .", "In addition , the applicant had already been convicted with final effect of attempting to legalise the proceeds of a criminal activity ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Therefore , his declaration that he had sufficient means to live on was not a sufficient guarantee that he would not continue offending .", "The judge concluded that there was a need to detain the applicant under LAW ( a ) and ( c ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) in order to prevent his fleeing and continuing to engage in criminal activities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal ( i ) arguing that his arrest had been unlawful because he had not been informed of the reasons for it ; ( ii ) contesting the charge and the reasons for detaining him ; ( iii ) complaining that he had already been deprived of liberty for DATE ; and ( iv ) complaining that his case demonstrated a pattern of arbitrarily remanding and re - remanding him consecutively on various charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal , finding that all formal and substantive requirements for detaining the applicant had been met and that all the applicable time - limits had been observed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a fresh complaint with ORG .", "Relying mainly on LAW , he complained that , on his arrest , he had not been informed of the reasons for it ; that the courts had ignored his argument concerning the unlawfulness of his arrest ; that his detention was in general arbitrary ; and , more concretely , that his case demonstrated a pattern of arbitrarily remanding and reremanding him consecutively on various charges .", "On the last - mentioned count , he contended in particular that ( i ) he had been facing the charges pursued against him in the present trial for DATE ; ( ii ) he had been constantly detained for all those DATE ; ( iii ) throughout that period the authorities had had a sufficient time to pursue the case against him properly ; ( iv ) his previous accumulated detention had to be seen as CARDINAL matter ; and ( v ) there were no adequate grounds for its continuation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It held at the outset that it had no jurisdiction to examine any alleged violations in so far as they concerned the first - instance court because , in line with the principle of subsidiarity , such examination lay within the jurisdiction of the court of appeal .", "ORG found that the report concerning the applicant \u2019s arrest contained references to the charges on which he had been arrested and had been signed by the applicant . There could therefore be no doubt as to his having been informed of the reasons for his arrest .", "Similarly , it was apparent from ORG decision that it had taken note of the applicant \u2019s arguments regarding the lawfulness of his arrest . The fact that ORG had not given a specific answer on that point was not contrary to the applicant \u2019s rights because it had examined the arguments by implication when dealing with the overall lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "As to the remainder of the applicant \u2019s complaint , ORG acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s detention had by then lasted DATE in total . However , in terms of ORG decision , it was necessary to take into account the fact that the contested decision was neither a decision to dismiss his request for release nor a decision to extend his detention . Having taken into account the nature of the contested decision and the reasons behind it , and considering the length of the applicant \u2019s detention in concreto in the case at hand \u2012 that is to say only since DATE \u2012 the ORG came to the conclusion that , at the given time , the length of the applicant \u2019s detention had not yet reached a point of being unconstitutional .", "The decision was served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s release on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been ordered by ORG on DATE . In its decision , it observed that at the initial stage of the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant had been prosecuted for and detained pending trial on various charges , which had then been removed to be dealt with in a separate set of proceedings on DATE and that , in the subsequent period , he had been remanded pending trial partly on the same charges . In this connection , it referred in the following terms to ORG judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) in unrelated case no . II . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL :", "\u201c ... the removal of CARDINAL of several prosecuted offences to a separate set of proceedings is not , as such , contrary to the constitutional guarantees of personal liberty of the person facing the charges . Such a course of action on the part of the prosecuting authorities would , however , conflict [ with those constitutional guarantees ] ... if there were no well - founded reasons for it or if it manifestly served to obtain an extension of the detention beyond the statutory timescale of its duration , or if it otherwise entailed as a consequence the arbitrary keeping of a person in detention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the present case , ORG went on to observe :", "\u201c In the case at hand it is not disputed that there are well - founded reasons for continuing the detention of [ the applicant ] .... However , on the other hand , it must be observed that in the given case doubts may not be completely dispelled that the keeping of the applicant ... in detention for DATE might appear to be an arbitrary and above all self - serving deprivation of liberty in order to obtain his conviction for serious offences , especially since he has been portrayed as the leader of an illegal mafia - type grouping .", "Thus , if the duration of the above - mentioned [ initial ] detention is added to the period of the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE CARDINAL[CARDINAL ] ( DATE ) , it becomes apparent that the maximum permissible duration of his detention for [ CARDINAL of the charges ] has already been exceeded . At the same time , it must be observed that [ the applicant ] is being prosecuted for CARDINAL offences which may not be detached from one another because it is CARDINAL criminal matter for which he is detained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to observe that the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE resulted from his prosecution for the same offences", "\u201c for which he had already been detained from DATE at least until DATE , when that matter had been removed to be dealt with in a separate set of proceedings . Within that period and in that matter , [ the applicant ] was detained for DATE and DATE ... [ He ] is at present detained in the same matter , which is still at pre - trial stage , ( the [ statutory maximum duration ] ) of such detention having been significantly exceeded .", "However , at the same time , the [ statutory maximum duration ] of the whole detention has also been exceeded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Moreover , in the closing part of its decision , ORG observed that :", "\u201c The status of the examined matter is even more complicated , however : after the removal to a separate set of proceedings of a part of [ the charges against the applicant ] , no decision has been identified as having regulated the scope of the applicant \u2019s detention . From later decisions it may be understood that the applicant \u2019s detention was linked to his prosecution for the offence classified as murder , which had earlier been a part of the previously joined proceedings . This status must be accepted as reality ; if the detention of [ the applicant ] were linked to his prosecution for the offences which now form the subject - matter of the present proceedings , the maximum duration of [ his detention ] would have run out substantially earlier . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case no . II . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG found a violation of the \u201c speediness \u201d requirement under LAW in the procedure for the review of the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention in the first murder trial . However , his just satisfaction claim was rejected on the ground that he had failed to substantiate it .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ( case no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s LAW in the context of the dismissal of his request for release from detention pending trial on the charge of conceiving , setting up and supporting a criminal and terrorist group . The grounds were essentially the same as those established by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s LAW in the context of the dismissal of his request for release from detention pending trial on the second murder charge ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It observed that he had been remanded in detention pending trial on that charge as well as on the previous charge immediately after having been released from the previous detention , which had amounted to a recurring pattern . It was noteworthy that the alleged murder had taken place in DATE , although the applicant had not been charged with it until DATE , despite having been detained as early as DATE .", "The applicant had been prosecuted for various offences both in parallel and consecutively . The respective statutory provisions concerning the maximum duration of detention could not be interpreted as authorising detention pending trial for the maximum period in relation to each individual charge . Otherwise , as had occurred in the applicant \u2019s case , a person could be detained for the maximum permissible period repeatedly for consecutively levelled charges ad infinitum , which was not justified by any public interest .", "ORG nevertheless dismissed the applicant \u2019s just expedient nor appropriate \u201d ( \u00fa\u010deln\u00e9 PERSON vhodn\u00e9 ) .", "The written version of ORG judgment was served on ORG on DATE . It was against that court that the complaint was directed and , following ORG judgment , it eventually ordered the applicant \u2019s release on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found a violation of the applicant \u2019s LAW rights in the context of his detention pending trial on the second murder charge \u2012 not only on the same grounds as those mentioned above but also on others \u2012 in CARDINAL further judgments of DATE ( case nos . GPE . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE .
