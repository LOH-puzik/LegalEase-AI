{"ITEMID": "001-60535", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF MIGON v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of aggravated fraud , falsification of documents and issuing bad cheques . By a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that the fact that summonses for questioning had been sent both to his new and to his old address did not in any way infringe his defence rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG of a change of his address . On DATE ORG issued a warrant for the applicant \u2019s arrest , considering that there were strong grounds for believing that he had committed an offence constituting a serious danger to society , and that there was a risk of collusion and absconding as the applicant had failed to comply with certain summonses and had changed his address several times . On DATE the applicant was remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision . He submitted that the nature of the offence was such that all the evidence was contained in documents belonging to his company , which had already been seized by the prosecutor or kept by the banks . The witnesses in the case had already been heard by the prosecuting authorities . Thus , there was no risk of collusion as the applicant was not in a position to alter or suppress evidence . The applicant had usually complied with summonses except on the rare occasions when he had been unwell and had submitted relevant medical certificates , including a certificate drawn up by ORG . There was no risk of his absconding as he had informed the prosecutor of his change of address and could not leave the country as his passport had been confiscated by virtue of a decision given in DATE . The applicant further submitted that the amount he was accused of embezzling was so high solely as a result of the high rate of interest at a time of hyperinflation and that the amount could not be used as an argument in support of the seriousness of the offence concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order . The court first observed that the applicant had on several occasions failed to comply with the summonses without justification . In particular , the case file did not contain any documents showing that there had been justified medical grounds for his absence . Even though he had informed the prosecutor of his change of address , the address he had given appeared to be false as there was a convent at that address . Moreover , it seemed that the applicant did not live there . The court considered that in the light of the financial documents in the case file , the offence of which the applicant was suspected was serious enough to warrant detention on remand , the more so as the value of the embezzled property had been assessed without regard to the sums of statutory interest , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions in his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor appointed an expert in accountancy to analyse certain financial documents belonging to the applicant \u2019s companies that related to his credit applications in order to assess the damage caused by the offences with which the applicant had been charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted medical certificates stating that he had been ill from DATE to DATE . On the same date he also requested to be granted access to the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to authorise the applicant to meet his counsel in the absence of a police officer , considering that the applicant had had an opportunity to see his lawyer in the presence of a police officer each time he had requested to do so . There were no grounds on which to accept that this amounted to an undue restriction on the exercise of his defence rights . The fact that the applicant had not been communicative when talking to his lawyer seemed to stem from the defence tactics which he had adopted in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor refused to allow the applicant \u2019s lawyer access to the case - file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal , arguing , inter alia , that his defence rights had been unduly limited , in particular by the fact that neither he nor the lawyer had had any , albeit limited , access to the case - file , or to any of the evidence gathered so far in the proceedings . The only part of the file to which the applicant had been given access was the statement of charges and the arrest warrant . As a result , the role of his defence counsel had been rendered meaningless .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , finding that no appeal lay against the contested decision , and considering that in any event this decision did not infringe the applicant \u2019s defence rights , given that he would be granted access to the case - file later in the proceedings , at the stage specified in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the decisions infringed his defence rights . The case - file , which so far numbered CARDINAL volumes , had not been made accessible to him or to his lawyer . Any knowledge that they had about the investigations stemmed from the decision to bring the charges against the applicant and from the decision to appoint the expert . This was clearly insufficient to enable them to conduct any effective defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the refusal to allow the applicant to meet the counsel in the absence of a police officer . The court considered that the applicant had not given any ground on which to accept that he was seeking , by any unlawful methods , to jeopardise the investigations against him . Consequently , the contested decision had unduly limited his defence rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s request to be released , holding that the grounds on which the detention warrant had been issued were still valid , and that no new grounds such as to justify his release had been invoked by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to the proper conduct of the investigations , which concerned charges of a large - scale fraud and in which new charges had been brought against new suspects and further developments were to be expected , upheld the refusal to allow access to the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the investigations as , in view of new circumstances which were coming to light , further evidence had to be taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , considering , firstly , that the grounds on which the applicant had been detained were still valid , and , secondly , that a psychiatric examination had to be carried out , and an expert opinion had to be drafted by a certified accountant . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court considered that , in the light of the material gathered so far during the investigations , there were serious grounds for believing that the applicant had committed the offences in question . It was emphasised that the applicant had not questioned this in his appeal . The court also had regard to the fact that the offences in which the applicant seemed to have been involved had been committed on a large scale . Moreover , the offences were serious enough to warrant detention on remand . There was also a risk of collusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court stated in its decision that neither the expert opinion nor the psychiatric report had yet been completed . The expert opinion had to be supplemented by further financial details , which would make it possible to assess the scale of the applicant \u2019s fraudulent banking operations . The court considered that the risk of collusion persisted as the applicant had on several occasions failed to comply with the summonses . The court referred in this connection to its own decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court further commented unfavourably on the considerable delays that had occurred in interviewing the witnesses , as DATE and DATE CARDINAL witnesses had been interviewed , whereas the prosecutor estimated in his submissions to the court that CARDINAL witnesses would have to be heard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , submitting , inter alia , that in the course of the preliminary investigations he had twice changed his address and had on the second occasion informed the prosecutor of the change , and that he in fact had complied with the summonses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG supplemented the charges against the applicant with further multiple charges of obtaining credit under false pretences , forgery of financial documents and issuing of bad cheques .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE as it found that ORG had been justified in reaching the conclusion that there had been a risk of absconding and collusion . The court pointed out that the applicant had changed his address and that he had been trying to obtain a passport from various passport offices . Thus , his past conduct suggested that , if released , he would jeopardise the proper course of the investigations . The court also noted that the serious number of charges brought so far against the applicant and the scale of the offences with which he had been charged , argued in favour of his continued detention . Those factors indicated that in his actions the applicant had overstepped the border between taking a justified business risk and carrying out fraudulent financial operations , punishable under criminal law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested access to the case - file and to the expert opinion prepared by a certified accountant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant access to the expert opinion , stating that the conclusions of the opinion indicated that certain witnesses should be interviewed in connection with further possible offences which , according to the expert report , were likely to have been committed . It would also be essential to question the expert . Therefore , granting the applicant access to the report would be premature as it would be prejudicial to the interests of the investigations . The prosecutor also refused the applicant access to the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision , contending , inter alia , that the prosecuting authorities had not been expeditious enough in questioning the witnesses , and that his defence rights had been breached in that the opinion , which seemed at that stage of the proceedings to constitute an essential piece of evidence , had not been communicated to him . On DATE ORG rejected this appeal on the ground that no appeal lay against the contested decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , pointing out that he had been arrested as he had failed to comply with the summonses and had tried to obtain a new passport after the old one had been invalidated in connection with the criminal proceedings . The taking of evidence had not been completed and certain evidence essential for the case had still to be taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was served with the completed opinion of the accountancy expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , holding in particular that the grounds on which the detention had been ordered and maintained , still applied . The court noted that CARDINAL witnesses had to be interviewed and that documents relating to CARDINAL various bank loans , taken out by the applicant \u2019s companies had to be examined . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers was granted access to the expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused access to the case - file , which numbered CARDINAL volumes , considering inter alia that the investigations were coming to end .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , considering that the charges against the applicant had been sufficiently substantiated by the evidence that had been gathered both at the time of the applicant \u2019s arrest and later in the course of the proceedings . It was true that the investigations had not been conducted speedily enough , given that the applicant was in detention , which necessitated special diligence on the part of investigating authorities . That had also been the result of the particularly serious nature of the offence in question . However , the investigations had been unable to proceed for DATE , while the proceedings concerning the review of the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention had been conducted . The court further stressed that new evidence was coming to light gradually , revealing new aspects of the case and thereby prolonging the investigations . Had the applicant cooperated with the prosecuting authorities , the proceedings would have progressed more quickly . He was not under such an obligation , but he had to be aware that his failure to do so had further prolonged the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave his permission to the applicant to access the case - file of the investigations , considering that this would undoubtedly contribute to the acceleration of the proceedings and would make it possible for the suspect to formulate possible requests for further evidence to be taken . ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention . The court noted that on DATE certain evidence , concerning fraudulent transactions by the applicant \u2019s company had been obtained from CARDINAL of the banks . New witnesses would have to be heard in connection with these transactions . As new evidence had come to light , prolongation of his detention was necessary . Moreover , new charges had been brought against the applicant , which made it necessary to prolong his detention . The court further disagreed with the arguments advanced by the applicant that the charges against him had not been credible and considered that , quite to the contrary , the charges against him had been sufficiently substantiated to justify his further detention , which was also necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings . The court further noted that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s assertions , further documentary evidence had been taken in DATE , even though it was true that no further witnesses had been interviewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to release the applicant . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed that he could not have access to the case - file as it had been sent to ORG for the purposes of a decision to be given as to the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor appointed an expert to examine further accounting documents in the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that from DATE the applicant would be brought from prison to the prosecutor \u2019s office DATE in order to have access to the case - file . The lawyer \u2019s attention was drawn to the fact that the lawyer had so far failed to make use of his right to consult the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG permitted the applicant to make copies of and take notes from numerous documents in the case - file . On DATE ORG refused to give the applicant the copies of the prosecutor \u2019s requests to have the applicant \u2019s detention prolonged which had so far been examined in the proceedings , considering that those documents had not been included into the principal case - file , and that the applicant \u2019s argument that he had to have access to them in order to exercise his defence rights was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bill of indictment was lodged with ORG . The applicant was charged with embezzling a sum of CARDINAL ( old ) NORP zlotys to the detriment of CARDINAL banks , issuing bad cheques and with other economic offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . The DATE ( \u201c old \u201d ) NORP Code of Criminal Procedure applicable at the relevant time , listed as \u201c preventive measures \u201d , inter alia , detention on remand , bail and police supervision .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , as applicable at the material time , provided that detention on remand could be imposed if , inter alia , there was a reasonable risk that an accused would attempt to abscond or to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the due course of proceedings by any other unlawful means , or if an accused had been charged with an offence creating a serious danger to society .", "CARDINAL . At the material time there were CARDINAL types of proceedings enabling a detainee to challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention and thus , possibly , to obtain release . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure he could appeal to a court against a detention order made by a prosecutor . Under LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL he could appeal against a further decision by that court prolonging his detention at the prosecutor \u2019s request . Lastly , LAW an accused could at any time request the competent authority to quash or alter the preventive measure applied in his case . Such an application had to be decided by the prosecutor or , after the bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to deal with the case , by that court , within DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under all the relevant provisions of LAW of DATE read together , a detainee was entitled to appeal against any decision prolonging his or her detention on remand , regardless of whether it had been made at the investigative or judicial stage of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The imposition and prolongation of preventive measures , including detention on remand , were examined by the courts in the course of proceedings held in camera . The presence of the parties at court sessions other than hearings , including sessions held in the proceedings concerning review of detention on remand , was governed by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , which , in so far as relevant , provided :", "\u201c The court pronounces its decisions at a hearing if the law provides for it ; and otherwise , at a court session held in camera . ... \u201d", "\u201c A court session in camera may be attended by a prosecutor ( ... ) ; other parties may attend if the law so provides . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW , after the preliminary investigations were completed and it was decided that there were grounds on which to prepare the bill of indictment , the prosecutor was to grant the suspect access to the case - file , inform him that he was entitled to avail himself of this right personally , and allow his counsel to have access to the file .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the date on which the DATE LAW was extensively amended by the LAW of DATE on amendments to LAW and other criminal statutes , the law did not fix any time - limits concerning detention on remand in judicial proceedings .
