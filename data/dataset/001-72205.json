THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Baka;Antonella Mularoni;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Jean-Paul Costa;Karel Jungwiert;Volodymyr Butkevych;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant came to the GPE in DATE , leaving her CARDINAL sons from a previous relationship , PERSON ( born in DATE ) and PERSON ( born in DATE ) , with her parents . In the GPE she lived with her partner Mr PERSON , who was in paid employment at that time . The first applicant submitted that they had looked into applying for a residence permit allowing her to reside in the GPE with her partner , but that , owing to the unavailability of documents concerning PERSON income , such an application had never actually been made .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant 's son PERSON joined his mother and Mr PERSON . Her other son PERSON remained in GPE with his grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the second applicant , was born to the first applicant and PERSON . The first applicant was invested ipso jure with parental authority ( ouderlijk gezag ) over PERSON . PERSON was recognised ( erkenning ) by PERSON on DATE , as a result of which she obtained NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and Mr PERSON split up in DATE . PERSON stayed with her father , who subsequently applied to ORG ( kantonrechter ) seeking to be awarded parental authority over PERSON . ORG granted the application on DATE . The first applicant subsequently appealed to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) against that decision . ORG requested ORG ( PERSON ) to examine which attribution of parental authority would be in PERSON 's best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for a residence permit which would allow her to reside in the GPE , either DATE depending on the outcome of the proceedings concerning parental authority \u2013 with her daughter PERSON , or in order to have access to her . She also made an application on behalf of her son PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , in its report of DATE , that parental authority should remain with PERSON . In view of the likelihood of the first applicant having to return to GPE , awarding her parental authority over PERSON could lead to a break - off in contact between PERSON and her father and also between PERSON and her paternal grandparents , who were very important to her . It was felt that this would be a traumatic experience for PERSON , who had her roots in the GPE and whose bonding with all the persons concerned had taken place in that country .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG nevertheless quashed the decision of ORG and awarded the first applicant parental authority over PERSON . PERSON lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the first applicant 's application for a residence permit . The first applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision . At the hearing on this objection before an official committee ( ambtelijke commissie ) on DATE , it was stated on behalf of the first applicant that she worked ( illegally , as she was not in possession of a residence permit allowing her to do so ) from DATE and that on DATE PERSON stayed either with her father or with her grandparents . PERSON stayed with her mother on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG dismissed the objection , holding that , even if account was taken of PERSON 's right to reside in the GPE and to be brought up and educated there , the interests of the economic well - being of the country outweighed the interests of the first applicant . Although the first applicant did not claim welfare benefits , she did not pay taxes or social security contributions either , and there were sufficient numbers of nationals of ORG member GPE or aliens residing lawfully in the GPE available to fill the post she was occupying . The general interest also prevailed over PERSON PERSON 's interest in being able to lead his family life with PERSON in the GPE . In this context it was noted that , at the time Mr PERSON started his relationship with the first applicant , the latter had not been entitled to reside in the GPE . He had thus accepted that family life with PERSON might have to be enjoyed elsewhere or in a different manner . It was further noted that PERSON did not make a substantial financial contribution to PERSON 's care and upbringing since he only took care of those expenses on the days PERSON stayed with him and , as he was in receipt of welfare benefits , those costs were borne by public funds .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE in the proceedings concerning parental authority and referred the case to ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , dismissed the appeal against the refusal to grant the first applicant a residence permit . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that LAW did not oblige national authorities to ensure that PERSON 's parents would not have to choose between leaving PERSON with her father in the GPE or letting her go to GPE with her mother . Both these options were considered to be feasible . According to ORG , the fact that PERSON would have to be without either her father or her mother was , strictly speaking , the result of the parents ' choice to conceive a child at a time when the first applicant was not allowed to reside in the GPE . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG in the proceedings concerning parental authority , during which an officer of ORG told the court that the ORG 's report of CARDINAL DATE remained pertinent and that it was in PERSON 's best interests for the status quo \u2013 with PERSON having parental authority over DATE to be maintained . In its decision of DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE awarding parental authority over PERSON to PERSON . ORG accepted that Mr PERSON , supported by PERSON 's grandparents , was sufficiently capable of providing PERSON with the necessary upbringing and care , and that he was indeed doing so in practice . It was of the opinion that the submissions made by the first applicant in support of her argument that PERSON 's interests would be better served if parental authority were awarded to her \u2013 even if this meant PERSON living in GPE without contact with her father and grandparents \u2013 were of insufficient weight compared to the possibilities the father had to offer and was offering . The first applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this decision , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Despite having received a letter dated DATE from the local police informing her that she had to leave the GPE within DATE , the first applicant remains in the GPE . She works from DATE . PERSON stays with her at DATE and with her paternal grandparents during DATE . This arrangement is confirmed in a letter dated DATE written by PERSON 's grandparents to the applicants ' legal representative :", "\u201c The access arrangement we have concluded with [ the first applicant ] , the mother of our granddaughter PERSON , is fully satisfactory for all parties . According to the arrangement , PERSON stays with us during DATE . On DATE TIME we take her to her mother and collect her again late on DATE TIME . No disagreement whatsoever has arisen on this point in DATE . We further confirm that DATE visits of our granddaughter to her mother pass off in a very pleasant fashion and that she enjoys telling us about them . In other words , the close contact with her mother has a beneficial effect on our granddaughter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant applied for a residence permit allowing her to reside in the GPE with her new NORP partner . In this application the first applicant indicated that PERSON was being brought up partly by her grandparents and partly by her new family . The application was rejected on DATE as the first applicant was not in possession of the required temporary residence permit ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . The first applicant did not challenge this decision .", "CARDINAL . The second son of the first applicant , PERSON , has been living with his mother in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Parental authority comprises the duty and the right of a parent to care for and bring up his or her child ( LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) ) . The parent invested with parental authority is the child 's statutory representative ( wettelijk vertegenwoordiger ) and administers the child 's possessions ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act came into force , but this has no bearing on the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The government pursues a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising out of international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . The admission policy for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) . These provided that the spouse , the partner , a minor child born of the marriage or relationship and actually belonging to the family unit ( gezin ) , and a minor child born outside the marriage but actually belonging to the family unit could be eligible for family reunion if certain conditions ( relating to public order , accommodation and livelihood ) were met . In the context of family reunion with other family members ( so - called extended family reunion ) , such other members actually belonging to the family unit might also be eligible if they would otherwise suffer disproportionate hardship .", "CARDINAL . The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( feitelijk behoren QUANTITY ) used in GPE law only partly overlaps with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The alien in question must belong to the family unit with which he or she intends to live in the GPE"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
