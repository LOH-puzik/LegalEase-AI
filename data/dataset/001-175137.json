De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant bought an apartment in LOC . In DATE he lost his regular job and was no longer able to pay for utilities .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the utility provider instituted civil proceedings against the applicant concerning his debt of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The domestic courts allowed the claim . In DATE the judgment was transferred to a bailiff for enforcement . The bailiff decided to direct enforcement against the applicant \u2019s apartment . On DATE he organised a public auction at which the apartment was sold to a third party for LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . On DATE a district court confirmed the transfer of the apartment to the third party .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since that date , the applicant has not had a permanent home . He submitted that he had been living in temporary accommodation , at times in unsuitable conditions , and often in exchange for manual work .", "CARDINAL . DATE the apartment was resold and gifted to different individuals on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings before ORG , arguing that the sale of his apartment at the public auction had been unlawful . The applicant submitted that , in accordance with the domestic law , taking a person \u2019s home in order to enforce a court judgment was only permitted when the debt in question was larger than LTL CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which had not been the case here ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant also submitted that he had owned CARDINAL hectares of land near GPE , so the enforcement should have begun in respect of that property and not his only home ( vienintel\u0117 gyvenamoji vieta ) . In view of the alleged unlawfulness of the sale , the applicant claimed damages jointly from the bailiff and the bailiff \u2019s professional liability insurer . According to the applicant , restitution in integrum was not possible because there was no indication that the third party who had bought the apartment at the public auction had acted in bad faith . Therefore , he claimed LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in damages , an amount corresponding to the market price of the apartment at the time of the submission of the claim .", "CARDINAL . The defendants ( the bailiff and his professional liability insurer ) contested the applicant \u2019s claim . They submitted that the value of the applicant \u2019s land had been insufficient to cover his debt , so the enforcement had had to be directed against the apartment . They also argued that the applicant \u2019s debt ( LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and the enforcement expenses ( LTL CARDINAL ) , taken together , had exceeded LTL CARDINAL , and thus the sale of his apartment had been in accordance with the domestic law . The defendants further argued that the applicant had acted in bad faith \u2013 he had not appealed against the execution writ or the results of the public auction , and he had submitted his claim at DATE because he had been waiting for the market price of the apartment to increase . Therefore , they argued that the applicant could not claim damages corresponding to the market price of the apartment at the time of the submission of the claim , but only the price for which the apartment had been sold at the public auction \u2013 LTL CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It acknowledged that his debt had been below the required threshold of LTL CARDINAL and that the bailiff had erred by calculating the debt together with the enforcement expenses . However , the court considered that this breach had not been such as to warrant the annulment of the sale . Accordingly , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for damages . The court also noted that the applicant had submitted his claim DATE after the sale and on DATE permitted by the time - limit , when the market price of housing was several times higher than in DATE . Therefore , his claim for damages corresponding to the market price of the apartment at the time of the submission of the claim could be regarded as an attempt at unjust enrichment ( vertintinas kaip siekimas nepagr\u012fstai praturt\u0117ti ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG judgment . He and the defendants presented essentially the same arguments as in their pleadings before the first - instance court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the firstinstance judgment and allowed the applicant \u2019s claim in its entirety . The court held that the bailiff had acted in violation of domestic law , firstly by failing to direct the enforcement against the applicant \u2019s land , but also by selling his apartment at a public auction even though his debt had been less than LTL CARDINAL . The court considered that the bailiff had failed to respect the balance between the interests of the debtor ( the applicant ) and the creditor . It held that , because of the material breaches of the relevant law , the sale of the applicant \u2019s apartment had to be declared unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG decided to award the applicant damages from the bailiff \u2019s professional liability insurer . It stated that it \u201c essentially agreed with the amount claimed by the applicant \u201d ( i\u0161 esm\u0117s sutinka su ie\u0161kovo nurodyta suma ) and awarded him LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , after subtracting the amount of his debt ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The bailiff \u2019s professional liability insurer appealed against ORG judgment . It submitted , inter alia , that the amount of damages awarded to the applicant had no basis , and the court should have either ordered restitution in integrum or awarded the applicant the amount for which his apartment had been sold at the auction ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but not its market price in DATE , which had increased significantly since DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested the appeal , arguing that there was no legal obligation for him to ask for restitution rather than for damages , and that the amount of damages was a question of fact which ORG could not examine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the judgment of ORG in part . It upheld the conclusion that the sale of the applicant \u2019s apartment had been unlawful for the reasons established by the lower court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG then reiterated its own case - law that , where the sale of property at a public auction is unlawful because of a bailiff \u2019s actions , restitution in integrum should not be applied ; accordingly , it considered that the most appropriate way of protecting the applicant \u2019s rights was by awarding him damages . However , the court considered that , in line with \u201c the nature of the obligation and the principles of equity , reasonableness and good faith \u201d ( pagal prievol\u0117s esm\u0119 , atsi\u017evelgiant \u012f teisingumo , protingumo ir s\u0105\u017einingumo kriterijus ) , the amount of damages in the applicant \u2019s case had to be assessed at the moment of the unlawful act , that is , the sale of the apartment . According to ORG , the market price of the applicant \u2019s apartment at the time of its sale had been LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . Therefore , ORG awarded the applicant that amount , after subtracting his debt ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the bailiff \u2019s enforcement expenses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
