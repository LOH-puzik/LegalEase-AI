NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in the village of GPE , in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , PERSON was wounded with a knife in the village of GPE . He sustained injuries to the face and abdomen , which were initially categorised as a minor health impairment and later as a severe health impairment . On DATE the ORG district prosecutor ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) opened a pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with an official notice informing him that he was suspected of having injured PERSON while acting together with another unidentified individual and while being under the influence of alcohol . He was suspected of having caused PERSON a minor health impairment , as defined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was questioned and denied having injured A.A.", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the prosecutor questioned the victim , PERSON , and several individuals who had been with him on TIME of the incident . They all stated that that night they had been celebrating a birthday in the house next to the applicant \u2019s . At some point they had decided to go to the applicant \u2019s house to buy more alcohol because they had heard that he was selling it . However , nobody had let them into the house , so they had left . Soon afterwards they had noticed CARDINAL men following them \u2013 CARDINAL of them had been the applicant and the other had been unknown to them at that time . It was the latter who had assaulted PERSON with a knife ; subsequently , in an identification parade , PERSON identified his attacker as S.B.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation in respect of the applicant . The prosecutor \u2019s decision stated that during the investigation it had been established that the applicant had not injured PERSON this had been confirmed by PERSON himself and by other witnesses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The investigation in respect of the applicant was therefore discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence under LAW . The decision stated that a copy of it had been sent to the applicant , who had the right to appeal against it within DATE . He did not lodge an appeal . The applicant later submitted to the domestic courts that he had never received a copy of that decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S.B. became a suspect in the investigation . In the course of the investigation against GPE , the applicant was questioned as a witness once and participated in CARDINAL confrontations with PERSON , PERSON and CARDINAL other witnesses . On each of those occasions the applicant signed to confirm that he had been informed about his rights and obligations as a witness , and had been warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see the contents of the protocol for witness testimonies in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant stated that on TIME of the incident he , his friend PERSON and the suspect , PERSON , had gone to the applicant \u2019s house to get alcohol and cigarettes . At some point PERSON had walked away from the house towards a nearby road and soon thereafter the applicant had heard screams coming from that direction . He had gone there with his car , had seen a group of young men beating up PERSON and had gone back to his house because he had not wanted to get involved . He had not seen PERSON assault anyone , nor had he known whether PERSON had had a knife .", "The applicant repeated a similar account of events , with some changes , in confrontations with ORG , and the latter stated that they agreed with the applicant \u2019s version .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON was charged with causing PERSON a severe health impairment , as defined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned as a witness at a court hearing . He was warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article CARDINAL of LAW and signed an oath . He was asked whether on TIME of the incident PERSON had had a knife , whether the victim and his friends had been armed , and who had attacked whom during the incident . The applicant provided essentially the same account of the events as before ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found S.B. guilty of causing PERSON a severe health impairment , as defined in LAW , and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment . The court considered that the victim , PERSON , and the witnesses who had been with him on TIME of the incident had given consistent statements which it had no reason to doubt ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , their account had been corroborated by police officers and was consistent with the items seized at the scene of the incident . The court also held that the applicant , ORG and PERSON had given conflicting statements and had changed certain details in their statements when questioned on different occasions . Accordingly , the court viewed their testimonies as an attempt to help PERSON avoid criminal responsibility and dismissed them as unreliable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also instructed the prosecutor to consider whether a pre - trial investigation should be opened in respect of the applicant and PERSON for giving false testimony under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG were served with official notices informing them that they were suspected of having given false testimony in the proceedings against PERSON , as set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . When questioned on DATE , ORG admitted his guilt . He stated that he had been afraid to testify against GPE because the latter was a former prisoner who had been carrying a knife and boasting about assaulting people . Therefore , PERSON had been afraid that GPE might seek revenge against him for unfavourable testimony . The following day the prosecutor discontinued the investigation against GPE on the grounds that he had not intended to interfere with the criminal proceedings but that he had been afraid to testify against GPE , which was \u201c understandable \u201d in the light of the serious charges against S.B.", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also questioned on DATE . He explicitly refused a lawyer , denied his guilt and refused to answer questions . On DATE the applicant was informed that the investigation had been completed and that he had the right to acquaint himself with the case file , but he refused to do so . On DATE the applicant was charged with giving false testimony under LAW . The indictment stated that , when questioned as a witness in the criminal proceedings against PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the applicant had lied about not being present at the scene when PERSON had assaulted PERSON and about not knowing whether PERSON had had a knife , whereas it had been established in those proceedings that he had been present and had witnessed the assault .", "CARDINAL . When questioned at the trial , the applicant insisted that the testimony he had given in the criminal proceedings against ORG had not been false . In addition , he submitted that he should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony in those proceedings because he had been questioned not only about PERSON \u2019s actions but also about his own role in the assault . The applicant submitted that he had been suspected of having taken part in the assault ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that even though the investigation against him had been discontinued , the domestic law allowed its reopening if new circumstances emerged ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He further submitted that by giving truthful testimony he might have also revealed information about his possible drunk driving on TIME of the incident or the possible unlawful sale of alcohol . The applicant therefore argued that convicting him of giving false testimony would be contrary to his right not to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor contested the applicant \u2019s arguments and submitted that at the time when the applicant had been called as a witness , it had been established that he had not assaulted PERSON , so he had not been questioned about his own actions . The applicant \u2019s testimony had only been relevant for establishing ORG actions on TIME of the assault , in order to help the authorities determine all the circumstances of the criminal offence , and there had been no intention to reopen the proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of giving false testimony . The court held that the material collected in the proceedings against GPE demonstrated that the applicant had knowingly given false testimony in order to help PERSON avoid criminal liability \u2013 the inaccuracy of his testimony had been established by the court in those proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning his right not to incriminate himself . It held that at the time when the applicant had been questioned as a witness , the investigation against him had been discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that the applicant had been questioned only about PERSON \u2019s actions and not his own . The court also stated that the applicant had not been suspected of any other criminal activity , such as drunk driving or the unlawful sale of alcohol , so his arguments in that respect were also dismissed . The applicant was given a fine of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment . He submitted that he had not been served with a copy of the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the investigation against him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , so he had continued to regard himself as a suspected accomplice to PERSON applicant therefore argued that he had had an obvious interest in the outcome of the proceedings and should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It endorsed the lower court \u2019s arguments that the false nature of the applicant \u2019s testimony in the proceedings against PERSON had been established ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It further stated that it was clear from the case file that before each questioning as a witness , the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties , as required by domestic law , and warned that he would be held criminally liable if he gave false testimony ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) , so he had had no grounds to consider himself a suspect . The court also reiterated that the applicant had been called to testify only about ORG actions which he had seen and not about his own role in the assault . However , ORG found that the lower court had erred when determining the sentence because it had applied an old version of Article CARDINAL of LAW . It therefore changed the applicant \u2019s sentence in line with the version of that provision which had been in force at the time when the applicant had given his last testimony in the criminal proceedings against PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and fined him LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law , again arguing that his right not to incriminate himself had been breached . However , on DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . It reiterated that the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties as a witness and warned about criminal liability for giving false testimony , and that he had been questioned about the actions of PERSON and not about his own actions , so it must have been clear to him that his testimony could not have incriminated him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant part of LAW provides :", "\u201c It shall be prohibited to compel anyone to give evidence against himself , or his family members or close relatives . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
