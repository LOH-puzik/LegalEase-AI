The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a musician and an artistic producer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant published a book entitled \u201c Backstage \u201d ( PERSON ) . A number of passages in the book had to be redacted because of a series of urgent judicial proceedings which had been brought against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a tobacco company , ORG ( GPE ) ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) , launched an advertisement showing CARDINAL packets of Lucky Strike cigarettes in the foreground . There was a lit cigarette on top of CARDINAL of the packets , with a thick black marker pen leaning against the other packet . The following text appeared at the top of the advertisement in large lettering :", "\u201c Look , dear PERSON , how easy it is to write super books . \u201d ( \u201c PERSON mal , lieber PERSON , so einfach schreibt man super ORG . \u201d )", "The words \u201c dear \u201d ( \u201c lieber \u201d ) , \u201c easy \u201d ( \u201c einfach \u201d ) and \u201c super \u201d ( \u201c super \u201d ) were blacked out but were still legible . At the bottom of the advertisement was the phrase \u201c Lucky Strike . Nothing else . \u201d ( \u201c Lucky Strike . Sonst nichts . \u201d )", "CARDINAL . The full - page advertisement was published in the CARDINAL DATE issues of the DATE magazine PERSON and the popular national DATE newspaper ORG , with a circulation of CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively . It was part of an advertising campaign run by the company for the ORG brand ; the campaign , launched in DATE , ran until DATE with CARDINAL variants , showing CARDINAL or more packets of cigarettes with a humorous slogan which often referred to a current event and the individual involved in that event .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request the company gave a written undertaking to refrain from further publication of the advertisement in question with its heading referring to him , but refused to pay him the sum of CARDINAL ( ORG ) which he had demanded for a \u201c notional licence \u201d ( fiktive ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for an order requiring the company to pay him ORG CARDINAL for a notional licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s application . It first of all noted that the use of the forename PERSON in the impugned advertisement was clearly a reference to the applicant \u2019s name . It further noted that although the forename PERSON was very common and several well - known public figures shared it , the advertisement was obviously referring to the applicant in view of its other component elements . ORG observed that the company \u2019s advertising campaign regularly alluded to current events and the persons involved in them . It noted that there was no indication that at the time the advertisement had been published , another individual also called PERSON , like the applicant , had published a book that had had certain passages censored following court injunctions , or that any other book had prompted as much public debate upon publication as the applicant \u2019s book had .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the company was entitled to rely on the right to freedom of expression as safeguarded by LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , a right that also extended to commercial advertising provided that its content contributed to shaping public opinion . In the court \u2019s view , that applied to the impugned advertisement , which had commented humorously on the publication of the applicant \u2019s book and had apparently advised him on how to write \u201c super books \u201d by striking through certain passages before publication . Given that the company had in this way called for the contents of a book to be properly checked prior to publication , the advertisement had , in ORG view , raised a matter of public interest .", "CARDINAL . ORG then pointed out that both the right to freedom of expression and the right to protection of personality rights were protected under LAW and that , in principle , they deserved equal respect . Where a person was used for advertising purposes without his or her consent , the right to protection of personality rights prevailed as a general rule . As everyone had the right to decide whether or not to allow his or her name to be used for advertising purposes , personality rights protected individuals against the unlawful use by third parties of their names in the context of advertising . Inasmuch as the company had argued that the applicant had himself caused the event to which the advertisement referred , that fact was not capable of depriving the applicant of protection , but it could result in a lesser degree of interference and a higher level of protection of freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that when balancing the competing interests in the case , more weight was to be attached to the protection of the applicant \u2019s personality rights than to the company \u2019s right to freedom of expression . It noted in particular that the advertisement had primarily pursued commercial aims , that is to say increasing the sales of a cigarette brand , and that it had above all been intended to entertain the public , without providing any real contribution to shaping public opinion . Lastly , it noted that neither the content of the advertisement ( ORG ) nor the applicant himself had any direct link with the product advertised . It concluded that the applicant was entitled to claim compensation for exploitation of his fame for commercial purposes , having regard , inter alia , to the judicial decisions given in cases concerning a tennis player ( PERSON ) and a politician ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that the damage suffered by the applicant corresponded to what the company and the applicant would reasonably have agreed on as the cost of the licence if a contract had been signed . The purpose of a notional licence was to ensure that anyone using someone else \u2019s personality without permission would not be in a more advantageous position than if he or she had obtained the person \u2019s consent . ORG explained that the cost of such a licence should be freely determined on the basis of all the relevant circumstances , including the following criteria : the person \u2019s fame and brand image ( Imagewert ) , the attention attracted by the advertisement , the extent of its distribution and the role assigned to the person in the advertisement . Applying those criteria and taking account of the amounts awarded in similar cases concerning persons as well known as the applicant had been at the time of publication of the advertisement relating to them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG considered it appropriate to award the applicant LAW . To that end it took into consideration the fact that the advertisement mocking the applicant had taken up a full page in publications such as ORG magazine , and had been seen by CARDINAL readers . However , it also had regard to the fact that the advertisement had included neither a picture of the applicant nor his surname , so that a number of people would have been unable to make a connection between the advertisement and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the findings of ORG as to the existence of unlawful interference and the outcome of the balancing exercise between the competing rights , while pointing out that the fact that the company had used the applicant \u2019s forename for commercial purposes , in order to increase sales of its cigarettes , meant that the protection of the applicant \u2019s personality rights prevailed from the outset . However , it reduced the fee to be paid for the notional licence in accordance with the principle of unjust enrichment to ORG CARDINAL . The advertisement had not been designed to debase the applicant and , on account of its humorous approach had not had any negative impact on him . Moreover , in publishing his book the applicant had deliberately sought the limelight . ORG concluded that there had been an unlawful interference with the applicant \u2019s right to protection of his personality rights , adding that no other conclusion could be reached from the standpoint of the right to freedom of expression in artistic matters , on which the company had relied .", "CARDINAL . As regards pecuniary damage , ORG noted that the peculiar aspect of the case was that the impugned advertisement had , in a humorous manner , used only part of the applicant \u2019s name without his consent , and that it had only been published once in CARDINAL periodicals . Endorsing the findings of the expert whom it had commissioned to assess the damage suffered by the applicant , it deemed it appropriate to set the amount of damages at ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not grant leave to appeal on points of law , holding that the case was not of fundamental importance , given that a decision was not required from ORG in the interests of either the development of the law or consistency in its application .", "CARDINAL . The company applied for leave to appeal on points of law . On DATE ORG granted the application .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( no . I ZR CARDINAL ) ORG quashed ORG judgment . It held that the applicant \u2019s claim was ill - founded because the company had not unlawfully interfered with his right to protection of personality rights or his right to his name , given that the use of his name in the impugned advertisement was covered by freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW . While upholding the findings of ORG as regards the existence of an interference and the possibility of granting a notional licence in accordance with the principle of unjust enrichment , ORG held that ORG had not had sufficient regard to the fact that the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights and the right to one \u2019s name were only protected by ordinary law , whereas freedom of expression enjoyed protection under constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained at the outset that the case before it related solely to interference with the pecuniary components of the rights relied upon , since no infringement of the non - pecuniary components of those rights had been alleged . It pointed out that the rights to protection of personality rights were among the fundamental rights safeguarded by LAW to the extent that they protected non - pecuniary interests , but that the pecuniary components were only protected by civil law and therefore did not prevail over freedom of expression . ORG also observed that the protection conferred by LAW also covered advertising whose content contributed to shaping public opinion , while specifying that that was not only the case where the advertisement referred to a political or historical event , but also where it dealt with questions of general interest . Furthermore , reports with an entertainment purpose could also play a role in shaping public opinion , or indeed , in certain circumstances , could stimulate or influence the shaping of public opinion more effectively than strictly factual information .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the impugned advertisement referred humorously to the fact that the applicant had published a book . It considered that even though the company had merely referred to that event as part of an advertising campaign , it could still rely upon the specific protection of freedom of expression . It held that the fact that the advertisement \u2013 by using the applicant \u2019s forename and alluding to the book which he had published \u2013 had been mainly intended to increase sales of a cigarette brand by capturing the attention of the general public did not mean , as ORG had maintained , that the right to protection of personality rights prevailed in general .", "CARDINAL . ORG continued as follows :", "\u201c In weighing up the competing interests ORG failed to take adequate account of the fact that the only issue at stake in this case was the protection of the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights , such protection being based solely on civil law and not constitutional law . In the case of interference with the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights because a well - known person \u2019s name has been used in an advertisement without his consent , it can not simply ( ohne weiteres ) be maintained that the person \u2019s right to protection of his personality rights will always prevail over the advertiser \u2019s right to freedom of expression . On the contrary , it might be appropriate to tolerate an interference with protection of personality rights resulting from reference to a person \u2019s name if , on the one hand , the advertisement alludes in a derisive , satirical manner to an event involving the person and forming the subject of public debate and if , on the other hand , it does not exploit the person \u2019s brand image ( Imagewert ) or advertising value ( PERSON ) by using his name , and if it does not give the impression that the person identifies with the product advertised or advocates its use ( reference to ORG judgment of DATE , no . I ZR CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the impugned advertisement had not given such an impression . It had concerned a subject of public interest in so far as it referred in a humorous fashion to the events surrounding the publication of the applicant \u2019s book , shortly after that event and in the context of the ensuing debate in the media . The advertisement had therefore been part of the ongoing public debate on the circumstances surrounding the applicant \u2019s publication of his book . ORG emphasised that above and beyond the derisive , satirical allusion to that event , which was already known to the public , the advertisement had been devoid of any degrading or negative content in relation to the applicant . Furthermore , given the absence of any suggestion that the applicant identified in any way with the product advertised , there were no grounds for considering that the advertisement was disparaging towards the applicant simply because it was promoting a brand of cigarettes .", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed , moreover , with ORG that the applicant had sought public attention for his own publicity needs . It found that the applicant \u2019s interest in not being mentioned in the advertisement without his consent carried less weight than the tobacco company \u2019s freedom of expression . There were therefore no grounds for examining whether the company could also have relied on the right to freedom of expression in the artistic field .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that in the absence of a violation of the pecuniary components of his right to protection of his personality rights , the applicant could not claim an entitlement to a notional licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declined to accept for adjudication a constitutional appeal by the applicant ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , adding that no reasons would be given for its decision . The applicant received the decision on DATE .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
