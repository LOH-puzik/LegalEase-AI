He was represented before the ORG by PERSON ORG from PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG Attorney .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant was driving a car near the town of PERSON , where a police officer using a laser speed measurement device identified his speed as QUANTITY . The speed limit was QUANTITY / h . The applicant \u2019s car was stopped and he was asked to undergo a breath alcohol test . CARDINAL police officers conducted the procedure . The electronic device for measuring the level of alcohol in the applicant \u2019s breath gave a reading of QUANTITY mg / l . The applicant was informed that he was charged with committing CARDINAL road traffic offences under LAW , namely the offences of driving in excess of the speed limit and driving under the influence of alcohol , with a blood alcohol content of QUANTITY of alcohol in QUANTITY of breath . He was barred from continuing to drive . CARDINAL reports were prepared on the spot . A report concerning the measurement of the applicant \u2019s speed contained , amongst other information , the specification of the speed measuring device , the date , time and place of the measurement and the results captured by the device , as well as the name of the officer using the device and the identification number of the certificate proving his competence to use the device . The report concerning the breath alcohol test contained , amongst other information , the specification of the device used and the results , and noted that the applicant had agreed with the results . The applicant also signed the report and was given a copy of it . Lastly , the applicant was issued with a written notice indicating the charges and inviting him to submit a written statement in reply within DATE .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a written statement in which he denied committing any offence . He argued that the speed measuring device should not have been used in the dark and that his vehicle did not have the capacity to reach the speed shown by the device . The police must have confused his car with another vehicle or misused the speed measuring device . He further argued that there had been no road signs indicating the speed limit on the road where he had been driving . Moreover , the applicant disputed the credibility of the breath alcohol test and alleged that it had been exposed to factors whose presence or functioning could have interfered with the results , such as the police radio .", "On DATE the ORG issued a decision . The applicant was found to have committed the CARDINAL offences and was given a fine \u2013 combined to cover both offences \u2013 of CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and CARDINAL penalty points . The decision referred to the QUANTITY police reports , which indicated the results of the speed measurement and the breath alcohol test . It rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the misuse of the speed measuring device , noting that the device had been designed in such a way that in the event of any interference , the wrong position being used or a loss of signal no result would be shown . It also referred to the confirmation of ORG that the type of device in question complied with the relevant technical requirements . As regards the breathalyser , the decision mentioned that special tests had been carried out at the request of ORG to verify the effect of mobile phones and radio devices on breathalyser results . The tests proved that there was no such effect . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument concerning the lack of a road sign showing the speed limit , the police explained that the speed limit of QUANTITY applied by virtue of the general rule concerning the speed limit in inhabited areas . Finally , the applicant was ordered to pay CARDINAL SIT ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for the costs of the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for judicial review . He alleged that only a judge could have validly convicted him . He further complained that the time - limit for the submission of the request for judicial review was too short . He denied committing the offences and demanded that the police prove their allegations . In particular , he asked the police to prove that it had been his speed captured by the device , and to supply documents demonstrating the credibility of the laser machine \u2019s results and the method used to measure the level of alcohol in his breath , as well the competence of the officer to handle the speed measuring device .", "The ORG delivered a judgment rejecting the request as unsubstantiated on DATE . The court noted at the outset that the applicant had lodged a \u201c standard \u201d request for judicial review . It found that the procedure had not infringed applicable legislation and , in particular , that the facts had been properly established by the police officers . The court referred to the CARDINAL reports prepared by the officers on the spot , a certificate which demonstrated that the respective police officer had undergone appropriate professional training for the use of the laser device in question and the confirmation of ORG that this type of device complied with the relevant technical requirements . As regards the breath alcohol test , the court noted that the applicant \u2019s conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol had been based on the report indicating the results of the breath alcohol test , which had been signed by the applicant without comment . Since the applicant had agreed with the report , no further steps had been taken by the police to establish the applicant \u2019s level of intoxication . Finally , the court also found that the impugned decision had not violated the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights , as it had been issued in accordance with applicable law and judicial review had been available to him . The court also rejected his complaint concerning the DATE time - limit , stating that this was a statutory time - limit of which he had been informed in the police \u2019s decision . The applicant was ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL for the costs of the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal , alleging a violation of fair trial guarantees \u2013 in particular , that any fine should be imposed by a judicial and not by a police procedure ; that he had been charged and convicted by the police ; and that the guarantees enshrined in Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the LAW had not been provided to him . In addition , he complained that no ordinary appeal lay against the local court \u2019s judgement .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal on DATE . It relied on point CARDINAL of the first paragraph of section CARDINALb of LAW , read together with point CARDINAL of the second paragraph of section LANGUAGE of that Act ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "\u201c Everyone has the right to have any decision regarding his rights , duties and any charges brought against him made without undue delay by an independent , impartial court constituted by law .", "Only a judge duly appointed pursuant to rules previously established by law and by judicial regulations may judge such an individual . \u201d", "\u201c Court hearings shall be public . Judgments shall be pronounced publicly . Exceptions shall be provided by law . \u201d", "\u201c Anyone charged with a criminal offence must , in addition to absolute equality , be guaranteed the following rights :", "- the right to have adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence ;", "- the right to be present at his trial and to conduct his own defence or to be defended by a legal representative ;", "- the right to present all evidence to his benefit ;", "- the right not to incriminate himself or his relatives or those close to him , and to not admit [ his ] guilt . \u201d", "Prior to DATE , proceedings concerning regulatory offences were regulated by ORG DATE ( Zakon o prekr\u0161kih , ORG of GPE no . CARDINAL , as amended ) . Under that law , proceedings were conducted by judges handling minor offences . Appeals against their decisions were dealt with by judicial panels handling minor offences .", "On DATE a new LAW ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d , ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was enacted by ORG . It came into force on DATE and began to be implemented from DATE . As stated in the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to this law , the reform was considered necessary because of the heavy backlogs faced by the courts and the need to simplify and expedite the processing of cases concerning minor offences .", "Under section CARDINAL of the ORG , an \u201c offence \u201d means any act that is against the law , or is in breach of a Government regulation or local self - government ordinance , and which is , as such , designated as a punishable minor offence . While the ORG contains some specific provisions concerning the elements of a minor offence and responsibility for such an offence , it also refers to provisions of LAW , which are to be applied by analogy in minor offence procedure . In addition , the principle of the presumption of innocence is included in the ORG , which in section QUANTITY states that \u201c persons accused of having committed minor offences are innocent until their responsibility is established by a final decision \u201d .", "The ORG provides for sanctions in respect of minor offences , namely a fine , a warning , penalty points ( which can lead to withdrawal of a driving licence ) , a ban on driving , expulsion of a foreigner from GPE and seizure of items ( sections CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "The significant difference between the old and the new system introduced by the ORG is the establishment of a summary procedure ( hitri postopek ) , which is conducted by administrative authorities such as the police or inspectorates .", "An administrative authority may start a procedure upon its own motion or upon request . If a defendant has not had an opportunity to reply to the charges when the offence was recorded or considered by the authority , the latter , before issuing any decision , shall invite the defendant to submit a written reply . The decision should include a short reference to the defendant \u2019s statement and state the facts and evidence on which it is based . It must also include a warning as to the possibility of imprisonment for non - payment ( sections CARDINAL ) .", "Summary procedure is used as a rule for minor offences , subject to the following exceptions : cases where another person has been injured ; offences where an additional sentence can be imposed ; cases where an additional penalty of a driving ban is envisaged ; cases where a pecuniary claim or a minor is involved , or which concern military duties ; or cases where an additional sentence of penalty points which are sufficient to lead to the withdrawal of a driving licence is envisaged ( section CARDINAL of the ORG ) . These cases are dealt with by courts handling minor offences in ordinary judicial proceedings ( redni sodni postopek ) in which LAW is applied by analogy .", "After the summary procedure , judicial review is available . An application for such review is dealt with by a single judge at a court handling minor offences , which is normally a local court ( sections CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "A defendant has the right to lodge an application for judicial review within DATE from the receipt of an administrative authority \u2019s decision concerning a minor offence . By lodging such an application , a defendant renounces the opportunity of paying a reduced fine . In addition , an application , in principle , suspends payment of the fine .", "An application can be lodged on standard appeal grounds ( a violation of procedural or substantive law , erroneous or insufficient establishment of facts , and/or a challenge to the sanction ) . It should be filed with the administrative authority that issued the relevant decision . If the authority considers that the request is well - founded , it may annul or change its decision . If not , it sends the file and any additional evidence to the local court ( section CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "A judge can decide on the admissibility and merits of the application on the basis of the file received from the administrative authority . Under LAW of the ORG , the judge may reject the application in a judgment , if there is no need for further fact - finding and if the grounds for appeal are not established . This is done without hearing the applicant . If the judge finds that the facts were correctly established but that a different sanction should be imposed , he may uphold the application in part and modify the administrative authority \u2019s decision accordingly . If a violation of procedural or substantive law is established or if further fact - finding is required , the judge quashes the decision and decides on the case in ordinary judicial proceedings to which the accused and the authority that issued the impugned decision are parties . In these judicial proceedings , the defendant has a right to be heard orally by the judge , to adduce evidence , to make procedural requests and to appeal against the judgment ( sections CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "An appeal to ORG can be lodged on all grounds against a first - instance court \u2019s decision declaring an application inadmissible and against a judgment by which the administrative authority \u2019s decision has been modified to the defendant \u2019s disadvantage following additional fact - finding . In addition , an appeal can be lodged on all grounds , except factual ones , against a decision imposing a fine higher than the minimum amount or ordering a seizure of items worth QUANTITY .", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( Zakon o varnosti cestnega prometa , ORG no .

Its case - law has been developed on the basis of its jurisdiction to decide on requests for the protection of legality ( zahteva za varstvo zakonitosti ) lodged by the public prosecutor in cases concerning minor offences . According to the extracts from the relevant case - law submitted by the Government , ORG has found that an offender must have the opportunity to defend himself in the proceedings , in particular , to respond to all the factual and legal aspects of the case ( judgments nos . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , IV Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG has also decided that the local courts are not required to examine every piece of evidence put forward by the offender . They must , however , examine evidence whose relevance is sufficiently established ( judgment no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In the context of minor offences which entail a presumption of the vehicle owner \u2019s liability , ORG has found that that the accused must offer convincing and reasonable evidence in his defence . The defendant must specify the evidence and the facts which it is claimed are proved by it ( judgment no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Finally , ORG has found that the local courts must examine every specific argument which refers to significant facts , reply to such arguments and explain its decision taken on those points .
