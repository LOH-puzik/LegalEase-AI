SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants are PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , all NORP citizens who live in PERSON and PERSON in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The applicants were among the CARDINAL applicants in the previous PERSON and Others v. GPE case ( see judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "The applicants live in the alarm zone CARDINAL within a radius of CARDINAL from the nuclear power station at GPE in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG ( Bundesrat ) granted to the GPE nuclear power station the operating licence for a limited period , i.e. until DATE . This decision of ORG was contested before the ORG and led to the judgment in the Balmer - Schafroth and Others case ( cited above ) .", "In DATE the company which operated the nuclear power station , ORG , maintaining economic reasons , filed a request to cancel the limitation of the period of operation , and to obtain a licence for an unlimited period . The application was published in ORG , whereupon CARDINAL persons and CARDINAL organisations filed objections thereto .", "ORG ( Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Verkehrs- und Energiewirtschaftsdepartement ) then requested ORG , a NORP association , to examine in particular the relevance of certain cracks in the inner nuclear casing ( Kernmantel ) of the nuclear power station . In its expert opinion of DATE , numbering CARDINAL pages , the ORG concluded that the cracks endangered neither the possibility to turn off , or to cool , the reactor . The calculations of the growth in the cracks disclosed that in DATE the security would only insignificantly be reduced . Moreover , the producer had considered all possible accident combinations . The report also noted that the control programs and methods were such that they could detect such cracks and determine their size , and to do so within a time - limit before the cracks became dangerous .", "Following this expert opinion , various persons applied to ORG for a complete examination of all welded joints of the nuclear casing . The \u201c GPE association \u201d , an association aiming at the closure of the GPE nuclear power station , requested PERSON , a physicist , to comment on the ORG expert opinion .", "In his reply , dated DATE , the expert PERSON concluded that the \u201c size of the cracks may [ have been ] substantially underestimated \u201d , and that so far the effects of the cracks in the nuclear casing upon the security of the nuclear power station had only insufficiently been examined .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the various objections and prolonged the operating licence for DATE , i.e. until DATE . The decision considered that due to various modernisations the GPE nuclear power station had meanwhile become more secure than when it had been constructed . There were no defaults of a technical nature which would exclude a secure operation of the station . ORG ( GPE f\u00fcr die ORG ) had given the go - ahead , and the ORG expert opinion concluded that the cracks found did not impair the security .", "The decision also noted that LAW ( Atomgesetz ) did not grant a right to an unlimited period of operation . In view of a popular consultative referendum in the GPE of GPE in DATE , in which the populace had in fact expressed itself against the GPE nuclear power station , ORG decided to grant a license for only a limited period of DATE .", "On DATE , the \u201c GPE association \u201d wrote to ORG , requesting a public hearing of ORG as to the conditions for a possible closure of the GPE power station . By letter dated DATE , Mr PERSON , a ORG PERSON ) , refused the request . Annexed to the letter was a statement of ORG dealing , inter alia , with the issue of an earthquake in the GPE area . It was considered that the probability of damage to the nuclear reactor lay between ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL)xCARDINAL - DATE , a figure based on all accidents of nuclear power stations of the world resulting from earthquakes , and that indeed , the GPE nuclear power station had been constructed to withstand earthquakes . The probability of a plane crash on the nuclear power station was negligibly small .", "On DATE the applicants filed with ORG a request for reconsideration of its decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "Under LAW ( a ) of the DATE LAW , a licence from the ORG is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose , nature or scale of such installations . LAW provides that a license must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order , in particular , to protect people , the property of others or important rights . LAW provides that ORG or a body designated by it decides license applications . No appeal lies against its decisions . Section CARDINAL stipulates that nuclear installations and every form of ownership of radioactive nuclear fuels and residues shall be placed under federal supervision ; ORG and the body designated by it shall have the right in executing their supervisory function to issue instructions at any time if that becomes necessary in order , in particular , to protect people , the property of others and important rights ; they are also entitled to supervise compliance with these instructions .", "Under ORG case - law , the safety of nuclear power plants can be considered by the ORG only in the context of its licensing procedures ( see judgments of ORG ( BGE [ Bundesgerichtsentscheide ] CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
