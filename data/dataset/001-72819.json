POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant married PERSON In DATE their daughter PERSON was born . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant moved out of the family home .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) for a residence order in respect of P .. Consequently , access proceedings were instituted .", "In DATE the applicant filed a petition for divorce with ORG .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to make an interim order on access arrangements during the custody and access proceedings . On DATE he also requested that PERSON be divested of parental rights .", "On DATE the applicant was awarded interim access to the child by ORG . This allowed him to visit the child on DATE . PERSON refused to comply with that order .", "On DATE the applicant applied for a court order prohibiting his wife from removing the child from GPE without his consent . On DATE the court refused his request .", "On DATE he requested ORG to change the access arrangements determined on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) dissolved the applicant \u2019s marriage . The court awarded parental rights to both parents . It also limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights : it ordered that ORG \u2019s permanent residence be with her mother , but allowed the applicant to co - decide about the child \u2019s education and health . The court did not specify access arrangements . On DATE the applicant appealed against the divorce .", "On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her .", "On DATE the custody and access case was joined with the case instituted by the applicant \u2019s wife .", "In DATE PERSON left GPE together with the child and settled in GPE . She did not inform the applicant about it and did not give their new address in GPE .", "In DATE the court gave GPE DATE in which to ensure compliance with the access arrangements provided for by the order of DATE . In DATE and in DATE the applicant again amended his application concerning the access arrangements and requested that the court issue a new interim decision to replace that of DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued a decision allowing the applicant to see P. every DATE for TIME at FAC in GPE in her mother \u2019s presence . The mother appealed .", "On DATE the ORG quashed this decision and remitted the case .", "In DATE PERSON married a NORP citizen , changed her name to PERSON and moved to GPE with P .. She did not inform the applicant of her whereabouts . The applicant subsequently established their address with the assistance of the NORP consulate in GPE .", "On DATE the mother submitted that she would agree to report with the child at ORG for an interview if she was granted appropriate protection against the applicant \u2019s aggressive behaviour .", "Following the remittal , on DATE ORG issued its decision . The court dismissed ORG motion that the applicant be divested of his parental rights , and the applicant \u2019s motion that the child reside permanently with him . The court found that NORP was living with her new husband , a NORP citizen , his parents and PERSON in a house with a garden . It had been established by NORP social assistance authorities that PERSON got on well with her new environment and called her stepfather \u201c dad \u201d . P was happy , healthy and well cared for in her mother \u2019s house . In DATE PERSON gave birth to another child . Conversely , the applicant was unemployed , lost his right to social security assistance and lived in his parent \u2019s house . He had been also paying maintenance for another child \u2013 a DATE son . The court considered that P. had every chance of obtaining an upbringing in a functional restructured family composed of her mother , her step - father and CARDINAL - sister . She had a sense of security and stability in her mother \u2019s house and it had been in the child \u2019s interest to stay there . The court did not find any reasons to divest ORG of her parental rights . The fact that she had left GPE without informing the applicant thereof had certainly been an abuse of her parental rights , but could not serve as a ground on which to divest her of her rights in respect of P. \u2019s custody . As to the applicant , there were also no grounds on which to divest him of his parental rights .", "The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He submitted that since DATE the mother had made it impossible for him to have any contacts with P.", "On DATE the ORG upheld this decision . The court repeated the arguments of the first - instance court .", "On DATE the applicant instituted new proceedings in which he again requested ORG to establish access arrangements . On DATE he lodged a further motion asking that full custody rights be restored to him .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion of DATE and refused to award custody to him . The court found , on the basis of new evidence obtained meanwhile from the NORP authorities , that PERSON was well integrated in her new family in GPE . She had no distinct memory of her life with her father before the divorce . Moreover , she received affection from her mother , her mother \u2019s husband and his family . The spouses cared well for her , providing PERSON with the best conditions for her upbringing . The court accepted ORG testimony that she had not deprived the applicant of effective access to the child as it had been the applicant who had made the contacts difficult due to his aggressive behaviour . The court concluded that removing PERSON from her mother \u2019s custody , or even establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant , would harm the health and development of the child .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision .", "On DATE the ORG upheld the contested decision and dismissed his appeal . It noted that having regard to the child \u2019s well - being there were no circumstances which would justify a new decision on access arrangements .", "On DATE the ORG lodged a motion on the applicant \u2019s behalf with ORG to determine access arrangements . It was argued that the question of the applicant \u2019s access to P. had never been settled except for the interim order of DATE . The child \u2019s mother had deprived the applicant and the child of any possibility of contact . The applicant was right in emphasising that PERSON had abused her parental rights by removing the child from GPE without the applicant \u2019s or the court \u2019s permission or knowledge . That had constituted a violation of the domestic regulations and relevant provisions of international law . The ORG stressed that ORG actions had been clearly unlawful .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim access decision allowing him to send letters and presents to P.", "On DATE the ORG established a temporary access arrangement and allowed the applicant to call P. once DATE and to send letters to her . The applicant \u2019s further appeal against this access arrangement was dismissed by the decision of ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG gave a decision on access arrangements . The child would visit the applicant once DATE and he would be allowed to spend DATE with her during DATE . In addition the child would twice a DATE call the applicant . The applicant was allowed to send letters to his daughter .", "The child \u2019s mother appealed against this decision", "On DATE the ORG amended the first instance decision . The court considered that there were no grounds on which to accept that the child should have direct contacts with the applicant . P. had been brought up without any contacts with her father and she did not know him . Furthermore , as it appeared from her statements given in the proceedings before the NORP authorities , she had not been interested in having contact with the applicant . The court held that establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant could harm the child \u2019s health and her development . In conclusion , the court allowed the applicant to send letters and gifts to his daughter .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG imposed fines on ORG CARDINAL ORG for failure to comply with its order of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE PERSON paid the fine which had been imposed on her on DATE . The enforcement proceedings concerning the second fine were discontinued in DATE .", "On DATE the applicant again requested the court to impose a fine on ORG , alleging that she had prevented him from talking to P. on the phone and that she had refused to accept letters he had sent to P.", "On DATE ORG dismissed his request . The court considered that the applicant had failed to contact the mother in order to obtain her telephone number , and that it was not established that the mother had sent back any applicant \u2019s letters .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the first - instance decision . The court considered that it had not been confirmed that PERSON had obstructed the applicant \u2019s attempts to contact his daughter .", "On DATE the ORG in GPE decided to change the divorce judgment insofar as it concerned the custody of P. and granted custody solely to the mother . It considered that the parents were in conflict and that , in any event , the applicant and the child lived far away from each other .
