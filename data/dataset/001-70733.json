{"ITEMID": "001-70733", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ITA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "ACCARDI AND OTHERS v. ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON D\u2019Antonio , are NORP nationals , born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The first CARDINAL applicants are currently in FAC , while the third is in FAC . Mr Accardi was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ; PERSON and PERSON D\u2019Antonio were represented by Mr PERSON , also a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant and the third applicant are the parents of minors NORP and Y , twins born on DATE . The parents live apart . The third applicant lives with the second applicant .", "Following a complaint lodged by the first applicant alleging that X and Y had been subjected to sexual abuse by their mother and the second applicant , ORG decided to place the children in ORG care . In DATE the court ordered that the children be returned to the family of their father , who was living with PERSON at the time . However , in DATE X informed his schoolteacher that Y had been subjected to further abuse , this time by the children \u2019s father . Proceedings were instituted against the CARDINAL applicants on charges of sexual abuse of minors .", "On DATE the ORG investigating judge ( giudice per le indagini preliminari - ORG ) decided to hear evidence from X and Y in camera ( incidente probatorio ) . The hearing took place on DATE in the presence of the investigating judge and a psychologist , PERSON The applicants , their lawyers and the representative of ORG were in an adjacent room behind a CARDINAL - way mirror , enabling them to hear what was being said and observe the conduct of the witnesses . During the hearing PERSON put some of the questions to the children .", "X confirmed having been abused by their mother and the second applicant , and gave details of the sexual abuse to which Y had allegedly been subjected by their father . Y was also questioned by PERSON However , when the psychologist asked her to specify what used to happen with her parents , Y replied that she was too ashamed . The investigating judge then decided to leave the hearing room and follow the questioning from behind the CARDINAL - way mirror . Y subsequently gave some details concerning the abuse perpetrated by the first and second applicants . When she became very upset , the questioning was discontinued .", "On DATE the applicants were committed for trial before ORG .", "The proceedings took place in camera . CARDINAL hearings were held , on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . Numerous witnesses who had been in contact with X and Y at the time of the events were questioned . The court ordered the videotape of the hearing of DATE to be produced .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG sentenced each of the applicants to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The court noted that there were CARDINAL types of evidence that weighed against the defendants . First , there were the statements made by NORP and Y at the hearing on DATE ; second , there was the evidence of the persons questioned during the proceedings , who had second - hand knowledge of the events detailed by the victims , having been taken into their confidence . While the ORG statements ranked first in importance , the hearsay evidence had a role to play in checking the consistency of the versions provided by X and Y with the other particular circumstances of the case .", "In the view of the court , the details provided by X and Y demonstrated that they had indeed been subjected to abuse , as it would have been difficult for children so young to invent details of sexual practices known only to adults . As the videotape of the hearing of DATE showed , X and Y , through their general demeanour and the nature of their replies , displayed signs of profound unease and great distress when confronted with the memory of their painful experiences . Their statements therefore constituted strong evidence in the case against the defendants .", "It further emerged from the evidence given during the proceedings that X and Y had recounted details of the abuse to third parties , such as members of their host family , the first applicant \u2019s live - in partner , a home teacher and a schoolteacher . According to the schoolteacher and to a social worker , X and Y showed signs of disturbed behaviour , a finding confirmed by memoranda from the social services department . This evidence corroborated the children \u2019s statements , with the result that the applicants were found guilty .", "The applicants appealed .", "The first applicant confined himself to challenging the assessment of the evidence and the interpretation of the statements made by X and Y.", "The second and third applicants argued that , in the course of the proceedings at first instance , the court had declined to hear evidence from an expert witness instructed by the defence who would , they contended , have been able to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the children \u2019s statements , in order to establish whether and to what extent those circumstances might have influenced their version of events . Furthermore , the court should have ordered a psychologist \u2019s report on the children to determine whether they showed signs of having been sexually abused . The second and third applicants also requested that the children be questioned again in the presence of child psychology experts , not just about the abuse itself , but also about the existing family relationships .", "According to the second and third applicants , it was likely that the children , whose DATE had been spent in a difficult and precarious situation , had simply witnessed the sexual practices of the adults and later imagined that they had themselves been involved in the acts in question . This explanation was especially plausible , they argued , given that the questions put by PERSON at the hearing of DATE had been of a leading nature . They further submitted that the investigating judge had prevented the parties from asking the children questions .", "The second and third applicants appended a psychologist \u2019s report to their notice of appeal which concluded that , in view of the manner in which they had been obtained , the children \u2019s statements should not have been used as the sole basis for convicting the defendants .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG reduced the third applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE imprisonment . It upheld the remainder of the decision at first instance .", "ORG observed that the versions of X and Y contradicted each other in places . In addition , the children had been vague as to when exactly the abuse had taken place . However , the defence \u2019s argument that the children had confused reality and imagination was unfounded , bearing in mind the nature of the details recounted by X and Y and the signs of distress they had manifested during and after the hearing . Furthermore , the children could not have been expected to open up completely to a psychologist they had just met and to a judge \u2013 the investigating judge \u2013 whom they did not know . Accordingly , the statements made at the hearing of DATE needed to be assessed in conjunction with the details confided by the children to people around them , who had been questioned during the proceedings at first instance . That process placed the contradictions in context and proved that the abuse complained of had been perpetrated by the applicants .", "ORG observed further that there were no grounds for doubting the children \u2019s ability to describe their experiences , and that their statements had been , by and large , consistent . In the light of those considerations , there had been no need for a psychologist \u2019s report on the children , who had already been kept under observation for a long time by a psychologist employed by the social services department . A further hearing would have been no more than a re - run of the hearing of DATE . In that connection ORG stressed that the applicants and their lawyers had taken part in the hearing in question and had had the opportunity of asking the children any questions they considered necessary to their defence , through the intermediary of the investigating judge .", "As to the manner in which the hearing of DATE had been conducted , ORG noted that PERSON had adapted her approach to the degree of participation and cooperation of the children . The psychologist had thus put more specific questions to X , who appeared to be more open than Y.", "The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law .", "The first applicant complained first of all that the questioning of X and Y had been invalid , observing that the questions had been put to the children by PERSON rather than by the investigating judge , and had been put in a leading manner . The first applicant further submitted that ORG had lent excessive weight to the evidence of persons with only second - hand knowledge of the facts , and argued that the reasons given for the judgment of DATE had been illogical and contradictory .", "The second and third applicants objected that their convictions had been unsafe , on the ground that no decisive proof had been produced . They referred in particular to the decision not to question the victims again or to order a psychologist \u2019s report on the children and another one to determine whether X and Y had been fit to give evidence . The second and third applicants also alleged that the reasons given for the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been illogical and contradictory , as their guilt had not been proven beyond any reasonable doubt .", "In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeals , finding that ORG had given logical and correct reasons for its findings on all the points at issue .", "ORG observed that it had been for the trial and appeal courts to decide whether further evidence ( such as the expert reports requested by the defendants ) was required , and that a further hearing of the children had not been necessary . Moreover , the questioning of X and Y had been conducted by the investigating judge , not by PERSON ; the fact that some questions had been put directly by the psychologist was irrelevant . In any event , under NORP law , failure to adhere to the methods laid down for questioning did not invalidate the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
