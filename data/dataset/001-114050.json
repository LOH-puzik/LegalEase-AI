The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant and another individual , GPE , were charged under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of GPE with the criminal offence of unlawfully manufacturing and trading in narcotics . They were accused of being involved in the organisation of drug trafficking which had been carried out by PERSON , who had already been convicted of this in GPE . Another person , PERSON , who had been convicted in GPE ( GPE ) , was involved in the trafficking .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE and during a telephone call on DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed of the investigating judge \u2019s decision to question PERSON as a witness in GPE , where he was being held in a prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge , accompanied by ORG representative and the public prosecutor , questioned PERSON in GPE . PERSON had specified that his participation to the meeting was conditional upon the fact that he would not be compelled to answer questions put by the defence ; as a consequence , ORG representative was unable to put any questions to him .", "CARDINAL . During questioning , PERSON explained that he had met PERSON in DATE in GPE . PERSON later contacted him about transporting a car from GPE to elsewhere in LOC and mentioned people from GPE , including the applicant , who would organise the transport . PERSON and PERSON came together to GPE on DATE and stayed in FAC . They were visited there by the applicant and PERSON On this occasion , PERSON received an envelope from the applicant : he stated that he thought that it contained money for the purchase of a car , but later realised that it was a package of heroin and that he was supposed to smuggle drugs in the future . According to PERSON \u2019s version of events , he came to GPE again on DATE , taking a train from ORG GPE ) to GPE . In GPE he met PERSON , who told him about the first drug transfer from GPE to GPE and gave him a mobile phone with a NORP ORG card . DATE , PERSON met the applicant and PERSON at FAC . They told him where in GPE he had to go , but that plan was never implemented . PERSON subsequently bought a car for a drug transfer from GPE to GPE . His contact with PERSON , who , unlike the applicant , could speak LANGUAGE , was made using the mobile phone which had been given to him during his second visit to GPE . GPE met the applicant and GPE in GPE and GPE , where they told him about a new drug transfer from GPE to GPE . He was again given instructions by PERSON using the mobile phone . PERSON identified both the applicant and PERSON from a series of photographs .", "CARDINAL . The trial court subsequently called : ( i ) witness PERSON , who testified that he had introduced the applicant to ORG in the context of a business involving the sale of apartments ; ( ii ) an undercover agent who was involved in another case and whose testimony was consequently held by the trial court to be inadmissible in the proceedings concerning the applicant ; and ( iii ) an anonymous witness , who also confirmed that the applicant and ORG knew each other because they had both been present at the meeting concerning the sale of certain apartments . The court also admitted as evidence : ( i ) the statement taken from GPE on DATE in GPE ; ( ii ) the guest records of FAC relating to the dates DATE ; ( iii ) the records of phone calls made on the NORP ORG card found in possession of PERSON on the date of his arrest ; and ( iv ) the judgment of ORG concerning the criminal proceedings against ORG", "CARDINAL . That judgment had established that ORG and GPE knew each other and that they had planned a drug transfer from GPE to LOC . Moreover , it had been ORG who had introduced PERSON to the applicant and ORG had further established that on DATE ORG and PERSON had gone to FAC in GPE , where they had met the applicant and GPE , that a second visit to GPE had taken place on DATE , that PERSON had received a mobile phone from GPE which had been used to give him instructions about the drug transfers , that PERSON had delivered drugs in GPE and in GPE and that he had met the applicant and GPE twice in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , the court read out PERSON \u2019s statement of DATE . While the public prosecutor and ORG representative agreed to this , the applicant \u2019s representative objected and requested that PERSON be examined in court . His request was rejected by the court , referring to LAW hereinafter , \u201c the LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant requested that his mother , brother and wife be called to give evidence relating to his state of health and his medical appointments during the period in question . The court rejected the request , finding that the applicant \u2019s state of health could be verified on the basis of his medical records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for being part of a criminal enterprise , together with PERSON and FAC , which had drug trafficking from GPE to LOC as its purpose . The court found that the applicant and his co - accused , PERSON , together with ORG , had organised and assisted the sale of heroin which had been trafficked by PERSON on CARDINAL occasions in DATE . On CARDINAL occasion , QUANTITY of heroin had been trafficked to GPE , and on another occasion , QUANTITY of heroin had been trafficked to GPE . The court also found that the applicant had not attended any medical appointments on the dates on which the alleged acts were committed .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that PERSON should have been examined at trial . The court relied on the fact that PERSON had been sentenced to DATE in prison and that it could not therefore have been expected that the NORP authorities would bring him before a NORP court in order to testify . It also rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that PERSON was mentally ill , finding that his answers had been clear and coherent and that the issue of his mental state had already been assessed by ORG , which had found that his testimony had been fully credible . The court also observed that the defence had been aware that PERSON would not answer questions other than those put to him by the investigating judge or the prosecutor . It further found that PERSON \u2019s representative , who had been present at the examination , had not even attempted to put questions to PERSON , nor had she asked the investigating judge to do so on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . In its reasons for convicting the applicant , the court stated that it had followed the description of the relevant events given by PERSON on DATE , which had been coherent and supported by corroborating evidence . The evidence , including telephone records and train tickets , had supported ORG statement regarding the trips he had taken in order to bring the drugs to GPE and GPE . In particular , the train tickets found on PERSON on the date of his arrest had corresponded to the dates of his alleged meetings with PERSON Moreover , from the date on which he had received the mobile phone from GPE until the date of his arrest in GPE , GPE \u2019s NORP ORG card had recorded that calls had been received from different telephone boxes in the area near GPE , the city where the applicant and PERSON had lived . These phone calls had matched with the dates and locations of the drug transfers which PERSON had allegedly undertaken under the instructions of the applicant and GPE", "CARDINAL . In addition , the court found that PERSON had picked out the applicant and PERSON from CARDINAL photos of different people and \u201c had previously described both of them and stated that he had met them on several occasions \u201d . It further stated :", "\u201c On the basis of the above , the court considers it proven that the accused colluded with ORG and GPE for the purpose of committing criminal offences . The witnesses confirmed that [ the applicant ] had met PERSON , and that [ his co - accused ] had also enquired about him . PERSON indicated the time from which he had been ORG \u2019s friend and from which they had reconnected . Immediately after PERSON \u2019s release from hospital , PERSON contacted him and took advantage of his position . It can also be seen from ORG judgment that ORG was in contact with PERSON on a continuous basis . All CARDINAL of them were together on DATE and CARDINAL DATE in FAC , where they started planning the trafficking . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He alleged that the judgment had been based predominantly on ORG statement , which was of questionable credibility . He submitted that the documents in the case file had shown that PERSON was mentally ill , had been treated in a psychiatric hospital several times , including most recently shortly before his arrest , and that he was easily manipulated . For those reasons , the applicant had requested that the court call PERSON for examination at trial . Referring to LAW , the applicant alleged that his right to examine a key witness should have had precedence over the logistical difficulties and financial consequences connected with the organisation of the witness \u2019s attendance at the hearing . He also complained about the court \u2019s refusal to call his mother , his brother and the representative of his co - accused as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It agreed with the lower court as regards the credibility of PERSON \u2019s testimony . In relation to the fact that PERSON had not been examined at the hearing , it found the following :", "\u201c The court \u2019s decision to read out the testimony of PERSON was made under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , on the well - founded basis that PERSON was serving a DATE prison sentence in GPE . The representative of the accused had been informed of the examination before the NORP court beforehand but decided not to attend . The other examinations of this witness and the final judgment of the NORP court , which have been mentioned already , were sufficient to assess the credibility of this witness . Article CARDINAL of the Convention was not violated because the accused were unable to directly examine this witness , contrary to the appellant \u2019s incorrect contention . The proven credibility of this witness was such that the participation of both accused [ in GPE \u2019s questioning ] could not have affected [ his statement \u2019s ] evidential value ... As can be seen from the written grounds of the judgment , the court also relied on PERSON \u2019s statements obtained in the proceedings before the NORP courts and the final judgment of the NORP court , which were valid evidence because their lawfulness was not questionable as [ a result of the fact that ] the judgments were final . Although PERSON \u2019s representative was unable to put any questions to PERSON ( in accordance with the conditions set by PERSON ) , the rights of the defence were not violated as otherwise the witness would have refused to participate . In this connection , the court rightly found that the [ applicant \u2019s ] representative could have put questions to PERSON through the investigating judge but did not make use of this possibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON lodged appeals on points of law . On DATE ORG upheld their appeals in part in respect of the legal qualification of the offence and reduced their sentences to eight years\u2019 imprisonment each . It dismissed the remainder of the appeals . It found that the applicant \u2019s representative had been given an opportunity to participate in the examination of GPE and should have been aware of the possibility that the witness would not be examined again at trial , as stipulated in section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he could not have afforded his representative \u2019s travel expenses , finding that no request had been made to cover such expenses from ORG funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of his defence rights . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It endorsed the reasons given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( Zakon o kazenskem postopku , ORG no .

ORG held that the \u201c extreme ill - health \u201d of CARDINAL witnesses ( the alleged victims of a crime ) was a \u201c justified and unavoidable derogation \u201d from the principle of direct examination of witnesses . Nevertheless , the accused should have been given the opportunity to question the victims , and in this respect it was enough that he had been invited , during the investigation , to be present at their examination conducted by the investigating judge ( decision Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; see also judgment no . III PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ) . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG considered that it was not possible to refer to a violation of the right to examine the witnesses for the prosecution when the authorities had acted with due diligence in their efforts to ensure that the accused had the benefit of this right ( it is worth noting that in this case , according to ORG , the statements of the victims were not the sole and key evidence against the accused ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that , according to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the records of statements could be read at trial in the event that the witnesses could not be found . If the accused was provided with an opportunity \u201c to be present at the hearing of this evidence \u201d , the statements in question could be read out even without his consent . Furthermore , there was no violation of the procedural rights of the accused if he and his counsel were summoned to attend the examination of a witness who could not give evidence at trial ( see judgment no . I Ips MONEY of CARDINAL DATE , and judgment no . I Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .
