GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "John Hedigan", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr R\u00fcdiger PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicants worked as ballet dancers in and for GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) . At the end of their stage career they were paid a DATE allowance ( \u201c the allowance \u201c ) for former ballet dancers . That allowance was paid by virtue of a set of Regulations enacted by the Minister of Culture ( Anordnung \u00fcber die PERSON in staatlichen ORG der DDR ) of CARDINAL DATE . It accrued after reaching DATE and having worked for DATE as a dancer . It was paid , irrespective of other earnings , by the last employer . Once the former dancer received an old - age or invalidity pension the allowance was paid by ORG ( ORG DDR ) .", "After the NORP reunification the allowance was initially converted into and paid in NORP marks ( ORG ) . On DATE , however , all allowance payments to former ballet dancers were discontinued on the basis of LAW read in conjunction with PERSON , Chapter VIII , Section H , paragraph III , Nr . CARDINAL of LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) of DATE , hereafter referred to as \u201c LAW \u201d ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "In DATE the applicants and several other former ballet dancers of the GPE lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . The latter refused to accept the complaint because the applicants had not exhausted legal remedies .", "CARDINAL . Applicant PERSON", "Applicant PERSON ( A ) worked from DATE as a ballet dancer for a national company of the GPE . In DATE he terminated his career on stage and was subsequently paid an allowance of CARDINAL , MONEY per month until its suspension on DATE .", "On DATE A brought an action with ORG ( ORG ) claiming the continued payment of the allowance . On DATE ORG referred his case to ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) rejected his appeal against the referral .", "On DATE ORG rejected A \u2019s action . It argued that A had no valid claim to any allowance payments beyond DATE . As the German Unification Treaty permanently ended payment of these allowances from that date , it did not recognise the allowance as being a legal claim within the social security system of GPE ( FRG ) .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected A \u2019s appeal ( GPE ) .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) rejected A \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law . It conceded that the wording of LAW was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted as setting DATE either as the final date to qualify for the allowance or as terminating allowance payments permanently from DATE . The legislator had however meant to suspend the allowance payments as of DATE . The allowance was an atypical benefit granted by the GPE and had been paid out of public funds . Under these circumstances a transfer of the allowance into the united NORP legal system would have required an explicit and more precise rule than that actually laid down in GPE . LAW CARDINAL of LAW had to be construed bearing in mind that that provision was intended to lead to the creation of a uniform and united NORP pension system . Accordingly , it was meant to regulate the application of the GPE \u2019s pension schemes for DATE . With the adoption of the PERSON on ORG ( Anspruchs- und ORG , hereafter \u201c transfer law \u201d ) of CARDINAL DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) this purpose had been accomplished . The transfer law did not provide for further allowance payments after DATE but established that DATE which the ballet dancer had worked on stage would be taken into consideration in calculating his DATE pension .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit A \u2019s constitutional complaint . It referred to its leading judgment of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , pursuant to which the pension rights acquired in the GPE fell within the scope of the LAW ) protecting the right to property provided that LAW recognised them as legal claims within the united NORP legal system . Given that LAW prescribed that the allowance would not be transferred into the social and labour legislation of the ORG , however , it did not fall within the scope of LAW . It could accordingly be left undecided whether the allowance could be considered a pension . There had never been a legitimate expectation that the allowance would be transferred into the united NORP legal system , as in the legal system of the GPE , the allowance had already amounted to a preferential treatment . Besides , although the allowance was not based on contributions of the beneficiary , the NORP legislator had in a way allowed for it by establishing in the transfer law that DATE during which a person had been working as a ballet dancer of the GPE and thereby had qualified for the allowance would be taken into account for calculating the pension to be paid to that person .", "The decision was served on A \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "", "CARDINAL . Applicant PERSON", "Applicant PERSON ( V ) worked as a ballet dancer for national companies of the GPE for DATE . In DATE she terminated her stage career and was subsequently paid an allowance of CARDINAL , MONEY per month until its suspension on DATE .", "On DATE V brought an action for declaration ( PERSON ) that , once she was going to receive an old - age or an invalidity pension , ORG ( GPE f\u00fcr ORG ) would be obligated to pay her the allowance in addition to her pension .", "On DATE ORG rejected her action . It argued that V had no valid claim to any allowance payments beyond DATE as ORG put a definitive end to such payments as of that date . The transfer law determined , however , that DATE during which a person had been working as a ballet dancer for the GPE and thereby qualified for the allowance had to be taken into account to calculate the pension of that person . In this way the transfer law integrated the allowance into the pension system of the ORG but did not provide for allowance payments in addition to the pension .", "On DATE ORG of Appeal quashed the decision of ORG and declared V \u2019s action inadmissible .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundessozialgericht ) rejected most of V \u2019s appeal on points of law . It argued that the ORG was not the universal legal successor ( Gesamtrechtsnachfolgerin ) of the GPE and that LAW determined which duties of the GPE had been transferred to the ORG and the L\u00e4nder . The allowance as such had been abolished and would therefore not be paid in addition to a future pension .", "On DATE ORG refused to accept V \u2019s constitutional complaint in a joint decision also dealing with A \u2019s and B \u2019s constitutional complaints . The decision was served on V \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Applicant Bertling", "Applicant PERSON ( B ) worked as a ballet dancer for ORG until DATE . In DATE she terminated her stage career and was subsequently paid an allowance of MONEY per month until its suspension on DATE .", "On DATE B brought an action with ORG ( GPE ) , requesting the further payment of the allowance and a declaration that once she was going to be served an old - age or an invalidity pension ORG would be bound to pay her the allowance in addition to her pension .", "On DATE ORG referred the proceedings to ORG . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s action . On DATE ORG rejected her appeal . On DATE ORG rejected her appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain B \u2019s constitutional complaint in a joint decision also dealing with A \u2019s and V \u2019s complaints . The decision was served on B \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The German Unification Treaty", "As a result of GPE , which became effective on DATE , the GPE acceded to the ORG . The transition from a communist regime to a democratic system of market economy in the new L\u00e4nder raised many issues relating to property rights in GPE , in particular regarding the transfer of former GPE ORG pensions .", "To achieve economic and legal unification , the ORG and GPE concluded several agreements on the fate of GPE legislation , such as LAW of DATE , in which they agreed , inter alia , that vested rights and expectations were transferred to the social security system of the ORG . However , payments made on the basis of special regulations ( Sonderregelungen ) would be checked for the purpose of stopping unjustified or excessive payments ( mit dem Ziel , ... , ungerechtfertigte ORG abzuschaffen und \u00fcberh\u00f6hte ORG abzubauen ) . LAW , besides containing several other declarations , laid down fundamental principles in that connection . It established , inter alia , which parts of GPE law were to be incorporated into the unified NORP legal system .", "LAW reads :", "\u201c The law of the GPE mentioned in Appendix II is to remain in force in the unified system , with the restrictions set out in the Appendix , and provided that that law is compatible with LAW ) and the law of the ORG which is directly applicable . \u201d", "PERSON , LAW , Section H , paragraph III , Nr . CARDINAL inter alia reads :", "\u201c a. The Regulations on the allowance to be paid to former ballet dancers are applicable until DATE .", "b. The Regulations can be amended until that date by a collective agreement ( Tarifvertrag ) or by a collective labour contract ( Betriebsvereinbarung ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Transfer Law", "The PERSON on ORG ( transfer law , Anspruchs- und ORG ) determined how the numerous additional or special pension schemes ( Zusatz- oder Sonderversorgungssysteme ) were integrated into the united NORP pension system .", "Regarding the allowances examined here , it did not provide for them to be paid on top of the regular pension but prescribed that the number of DATE during which a ballet dancer had worked on stage would be taken into consideration for calculating the DATE pension .", "CARDINAL . Decisions of ORG", "On DATE ORG issued CARDINAL leading judgments concerning the method used to deal with former GPE citizens\u2019 pension rights . It determined that the pension rights acquired in the GPE fell within the purview of LAW ( right to property ) , provided that LAW recognised them as a legal claim within the united NORP legal system . It furthermore examined the constitutionality of the transfer law and established which provisions of it were contrary to LAW .", "In all these cases judge ORG had declared himself biased . In DATE ORG had commissioned him to examine the constitutionality of the transfer law . He withdrew from the bench making reference to the expert opinion he had rendered and where he had examined the constitutionality of the transfer law .
