The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and GPE started a company which imported and sold various goods . D.A. , who was the stepson of the applicant \u2019s sister , sometimes worked as a security guard on the company \u2019s LOC and as the applicant \u2019s bodyguard .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE GPE and another individual , ORG , were found murdered in GPE \u2019s flat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , while the applicant was in a car with ORG , the latter threatened him with a firearm . When the applicant tried to escape , D.A. hit him with the barrel of the gun , fired some shots into the ground , took the applicant \u2019s ORG watch and fired at several passers - by , injuring them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the authorities opened a pre - trial investigation into the murder of GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the incident between the applicant and D.A. in the car ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP authorities issued a search warrant in respect of D.A. It appears that he had left GPE and lived in several different countries . In DATE D.A. was apprehended in GPE and subsequently extradited to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was officially notified that he was suspected of having organised the murder of GPE and GPE for personal gain while they were in a helpless state , as set out in LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was suspected that the applicant had acted together with D.A. Further details were subsequently added to that notice in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE D.A. was officially notified that he was suspected of having murdered GPE and GPE for personal gain while they were in a helpless state . D.A. was also notified that he was suspected of having attempted to murder the applicant and several other individuals , as set out in LAW , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecutor decided to separate the pretrial investigation against the applicant and D.A. ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He noted that the investigation concerned CARDINAL criminal offences \u2013 the murder of GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the attempted murder of the applicant and other individuals ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The prosecutor observed that the applicant had been suspected of the former offence and that he had been granted victim status in respect of the latter offence , and the prosecutor considered that CARDINAL person could not have dual status in the same investigation . He also noted that the investigation in respect of D.A. was almost complete and the case would soon be ready for trial , whereas the investigation in respect of the applicant was still ongoing . For those reasons , the prosecutor concluded that it was necessary to separate the investigation against the applicant from that against D.A.", "CARDINAL . D.A. was charged with the murder of GPE and GPE for personal gain while they were in a helpless state ( hereinafter \u201c the first charge \u201d ) and with the attempted murder of the applicant and several other individuals ( hereinafter \u201c the second charge \u201d ) . The criminal case was transferred to ORG for examination on the merits . With regard to the first charge , the applicant had the status of witness , and with regard to the second charge , he had the status of victim .", "CARDINAL . ORG issued its judgment on DATE . It found D.A. guilty of the first charge as set out in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court based its conclusion on multiple witness testimonies , the examination of various material objects , and conclusions delivered by forensic experts .", "CARDINAL . One of the documents examined by the court was a handwritten letter which ORG had addressed to the applicant at some point in DATE . The applicant had received that letter from ORG father and presented it to the police . A forensic examination revealed that the letter had indeed been written by D.A. In the letter , ORG stated that he had killed GPE on the applicant \u2019s orders so that the applicant would get all the profit from their business . D.A. also alleged that the applicant had bought him weapons to carry out unspecified criminal activities for the applicant \u2019s benefit , and had bribed judges and prosecutors in order to help D.A. avoid criminal responsibility for some unspecified offences . D.A. further alleged that the applicant had promised to pay him for the murder , but had still not done so , and that that had been the reason for their conflict in the car ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He threatened to forward the letter to various newspapers if the applicant failed to pay him .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the court , ORG submitted that the contents of the letter were false . He claimed that the applicant had owed him some money for another debt , so he had made up the story in the letter in order to scare the applicant into paying him back . The applicant , who was questioned as a witness in respect of that charge , also denied all the allegations in the letter and stated that he had no connection to the murder .", "CARDINAL . However , the court held that the letter constituted ORG \u2019s confession to the murder . The court considered it unlikely that ORG , who at the time of writing the letter had already been suspected of the murder , would falsely incriminate himself in the letter to the applicant , especially as their relationship at that time had not been friendly . It then stated that several of the allegations in the letter had been proved \u2013 for example , the applicant had admitted to having bought weapons for ORG , and there had indeed been several sets of criminal proceedings against ORG which had eventually been discontinued . The court concluded :", "\u201c As the facts laid out in the letter are consistent and objective , there are no grounds to doubt the truthfulness of the contents of the letter ; the statement in the letter that [ D.A. ] \u2013 upon the orders of the individual in respect of whom a separate pretrial investigation was opened DATE killed [ GPE ] so that all the profit would go to that individual alone , and that all the money which they had jointly owned would belong to the individual in respect of whom a separate pre - trial investigation was opened , must be considered true . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The descriptive part of the judgment also stated that ORG had killed GPE and ORG while acting with unidentified accomplices . However , the court did not take that into account as an aggravating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . As for the second charge against ORG , the court changed its legal classification . The court considered that it had not been proved that ORG had intended to kill the applicant or any of the passers - by ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , it found D.A. guilty of stealing the applicant \u2019s property of high value ( the ORG watch ) while threatening him with a firearm , and of negligently injuring several other individuals in his attempt to escape . D.A. was given a cumulative sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court also allowed the applicant \u2019s civil claim submitted in respect of the second charge in its entirety , and ordered ORG to pay him CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( EUR ) ) in pecuniary damages for the stolen watch .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor , D.A. , the applicant and another victim submitted appeals against ORG judgment of DATE . In his appeal , the applicant argued that the court had de facto found him guilty of having instigated the murder of GPE and GPE , despite the fact that he had not been the accused in that case and had not been able to defend himself . The applicant asked ORG to remove from the descriptive part of the judgment all the passages which alleged his involvement in the murder , in particular those which discussed D.A. \u2019s letter ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG amended the first - instance judgment in part . It held that ORG had erred in changing the legal classification of the second charge , found D.A. guilty of the second charge as it had been originally presented ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and increased the sentence to DATE imprisonment . In addition , the court removed from the descriptive part of the judgment the phrase that D.A. had killed GPE and ORG while acting with unidentified accomplices ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 it held that , without identifying such individuals , inter alia , it could not be determined whether there had been an intention for them to act together .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed ORG \u2019s appeal contesting his guilt in respect of both charges . With regard to the first charge , ORG argued , inter alia , that his letter to the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) should not have been considered evidence of his guilt . In response to D.A. \u2019s arguments , the court stated :", "\u201c D.A. \u2019s guilt in respect of the charge against him \u2013 the murder of GPE and GPE for personal gain while they were in a helpless state \u2013 has been proved by a series of pieces of indirect evidence collected in the case and adequately assessed in the [ firstinstance ] judgment , as well as one of the main pieces of direct evidence D.A. \u2019s letter to [ the applicant ] , allowing [ the court ] to make well - founded conclusions regarding the nature of the convicted individual \u2019s actions and the form of his guilt .", "...", "It is underlined that the principal statements of the letter , assessed together with the other evidence collected in the case , correspond to the events which took place at that time ... The chamber concludes that the facts indicated in ORG \u2019s letter are not made up , he refers to actual events which took place in his life , and there is no indication that he intended to threaten [ the applicant ] with that letter to make the latter pay him money . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s appeal , the court stated :", "\u201c Contrary to what is alleged in [ the applicant \u2019s ] appeal , the first - instance court , while examining the evidence related to [ D.A. \u2019s ] guilt in respect of the murder of GPE and GPE , did not assess [ the applicant \u2019s ] actions relating to the organisation of the murder of those individuals . As can be seen from the case file , on DATE [ the applicant ] was notified that he was suspected of having organised the murder of GPE and GPE ... [ The applicant ] is entitled to exercise his defence rights and defend himself against the accusation in that criminal investigation . Only that investigation can determine [ the applicant \u2019s ] guilt in respect of the criminal offence of which he is suspected ... [ The applicant ] essentially contests his guilt in respect of the part of the judgment in which he does not have the status of either convicted individual or victim ... and his request goes beyond his procedural rights as a witness ... [ The applicant \u2019s appeal ] is thereby dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . D.A. and the applicant submitted appeals on points of law against ORG judgment of DATE . The applicant raised essentially the same arguments as in his previous appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals . In response to the applicant \u2019s submissions , ORG stated that the criminal proceedings in question concerned D.A. \u2019s and not the applicant \u2019s guilt in respect of the murder of GPE and GPE , and the applicant had not had victim status with regard to that charge , so he was not legally entitled to submit an appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with an indictment and charged with having incited D.A. and another unidentified individual to murder GPE and GPE for personal gain while they were in a helpless state , as set out in LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The case was transferred to ORG for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the court , the applicant denied his guilt in respect of the murder . He submitted that all the allegations against him in ORG \u2019s letter had been false , and that ORG had written the letter with the purpose of blackmailing the applicant , which was why the applicant had decided to give it to the police . D.A. was questioned as a witness and gave essentially the same statements as in the previous criminal proceedings , including those relating to his letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . It considered that neither direct nor indirect evidence adequately proved that he was guilty of having instigated the murder of GPE and GPE The court underlined that it had not been proved that the death of GPE , who had been the applicant \u2019s business partner , had been beneficial to the applicant ; on the contrary , after his death , their company had suffered great losses and had eventually ceased operating . In addition , the court considered that the prosecution had not established any motive for the applicant to kill ORG", "CARDINAL . With regard to ORG \u2019s letter , the court stated that , although the letter included facts which were true , some of its other contents appeared to be \u201c characteristic of blackmail \u201d , in particular those which alleged that the applicant had bought D.A. weapons specifically to commit criminal offences , or that he had bribed some officials to help D.A. avoid criminal responsibility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court also considered that D.A. \u2019s threat to forward the letter to the media further indicated that it had been written with the purpose of blackmailing the applicant . Lastly , the court underlined that the applicant had not paid D.A. the money which he had demanded , nor had he destroyed the letter , but had submitted it to the police , which confirmed that the applicant had not been connected to the murder of GPE and GPE", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed against that judgment . He submitted , inter alia , that the contents of ORG \u2019s letter had been examined in the previous criminal proceedings which had been concluded by a final court judgment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) , and the courts in the proceedings against the applicant should have followed that assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s acquittal . In response to the prosecutor \u2019s arguments concerning ORG \u2019s letter , it stated that the courts in the criminal proceedings against ORG had not examined the applicant \u2019s actions in relation to the murder of GPE and GPE , so the prosecutor \u2019s arguments had to be dismissed .", "From the information which the parties submitted to the ORG , it appears that no appeal against that judgment was lodged before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
