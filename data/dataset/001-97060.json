The applicant 's husband rented a new flat and started hindering the applicant 's contact with her son .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant filed for divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) gave an interim order which stipulated that , during the divorce proceedings , the child 's place of residence would be with the applicant . The court ordered the applicant 's husband to pay child maintenance and granted him access to ORG and every other DATE and DATE . The interim order became final and enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the court - appointed guardians to enforce the decision of CARDINAL DATE and to remove the child from his father 's care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the guardians made a first attempt to enforce the court 's order , which failed owing to the attitude of the father who refused to hand J. over to his mother . The guardian refused to call for police assistance or to inform the public prosecutor about the events .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant informed the prosecutor that her child had been kidnapped by her husband . However , on DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings , finding that no offence had been committed . This decision was upheld by ORG on an unspecified DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was unable to assist the same guardian in her next attempt to remove the child from his father 's care , which had been scheduled for DATE . Consequently , it had to be cancelled .", "CARDINAL . Given the subsequent inactivity of the guardians , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , she was informed by the President of ORG that the guardians had received an instruction from a family court judge to cease their attempts to remove the child .", "CARDINAL . Following her second complaint about the court - appointed guardians , on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the President of ORG ( Prezes PERSON ) wrote to the applicant informing her that he agreed that there had been shortcomings in the guardians ' attempts to remove the child from his father 's care and that new measures would shortly be taken . He noted , in particular , that before ordering a forced removal of the child , the applicant 's husband should have been invited to voluntarily hand PERSON over . This had resulted in the unsuccessful enforcement of the court 's order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardians made another attempt to remove the child . However , the applicant 's husband had gone with the child to the adjacent flat . Both the guardians and the police refused to enter that flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's husband to hand over the child voluntarily to his mother within DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the father had failed to comply with this order , on DATE the ORG gave a decision in which it authorised the court - appointed guardians to forcibly remove the child .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE , in the course of the divorce proceedings , the court heard experts who had prepared an expert opinion requested by the court . They testified that the child 's father had been manipulating the child with the aim of alienating him from his mother . The father had also made it difficult for the child to rebuild his relationship with his mother by ensuring that there was no private contact between her and the child . During visits the father was always present . In the best interest of the child , the experts recommended that custody be given to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardians made a fourth attempt to remove the child while he was at school . However , it was unsuccessful because the father had been notified by CARDINAL of the guardians about the plan and thus did not bring the child to school on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The guardians scheduled the next attempt to remove the child for sometime between CARDINAL and DATE ; however , it did not take place as the applicant did not receive formal notification until DATE . On DATE the ORG considered that the late notification given to the applicant had been in violation of the domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the guardians again attempted to remove the child ; however , the child 's father refused to open the door to the applicant and the guardian .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant 's former husband went into hiding with the child , so the guardians could not notify him of the next planned action .

Subsequently , ORG ordered that the applicant 's former husband be heard by ORG ; for an unknown reason this order has never been carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dissolved the applicant 's marriage . The court also decided to award the applicant full parental rights over J. It further found that the best interests of J. required that his place of residence be with his mother . The parental rights of the applicant 's former husband were limited to decisions regarding the child 's health and education . He was ordered to pay child maintenance and authorised to visit J. according to the arrangements set out in the judgment . The court considered that the applicant 's former husband had been manipulating the child and alienating PERSON from his mother and other members of his family .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's husband lodged an appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant 's child has not been attending school . On DATE the applicant was fined for not fulfilling ORG 's educational obligations . It appears that the decision was later quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a reply from the President of ORG to another of her complaints about the guardians ' inefficiency . The President considered that some delays had been caused by the father 's obstructive attitude but also by a lack of co - operation between the applicant and the guardians . Nevertheless , the last action by one of the guardians , which had taken place on DATE , had shown a lack of diligence , and the guardian had been instructed to make better use of the provisions of LAW ( Article DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings concerning the enforcement of the court 's order of DATE . It found that the enforcement proceedings had lost their legal basis in the light of the final judgment pronouncing the applicant 's divorce . On DATE ORG quashed that decision . The court considered that the enforcement proceedings should be continued since parental rights had been awarded to the applicant and she wished the proceedings aiming at the enforcement of the court 's decisions to be continued . Moreover , the child remained in the care of an unauthorised person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG again replied to the applicant 's complaints that the enforcement proceedings were taking too long . The President informed the applicant that he would be personally overseeing the enforcement proceedings . He also stated that \u201c the enforcement is still not effective and incorrect procedural decisions have again been taken , which have led to the proceedings being unnecessarily protracted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the applicant 's former husband applied to be granted custody of J and to change the decision limiting his parental rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , gave a temporary order in which it decided that , until the matter of custody was re - examined on the merits , the child 's place of residence should be with his father . The court pointed to the fact that the child had been living with his father prior to the divorce proceedings and had very few ties with his mother . The court took into consideration that the child , who was DATE , had expressed his preference to live with his father . Moreover , the court considered that J. had been having contact with the applicant and that remaining temporarily with his father would be in his best interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision , complaining that she had not been informed of the proceedings to change the custody order instituted by her former husband and that the decision had been issued without holding a hearing . She maintained that the child 's father had not been properly caring for J. and had not fulfilled the court 's orders .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision and dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court held that it had been necessary to legalise the existing status quo as J. had been in the care of his father since DATE .", "CARDINAL .
