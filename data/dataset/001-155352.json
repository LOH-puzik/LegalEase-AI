In an order dated CARDINAL DATE the urgent - applications judge granted their requests . The judge held that , since no advance directives had been drawn up by PERSON , and in the absence of a person of trust within the meaning of the relevant provisions of LAW , the collective procedure should be continued with his family , despite the fact that the latter was divided as to what should become of the patient . The judge noted that , while PERSON wife had been involved in the procedure , it was clear from examination of the case that his parents had not been informed that it had been applied , and that the decision to withdraw nutrition and limit hydration , the nature of and reasons for which had not been disclosed to them , had not respected their wishes .", "CARDINAL . The judge held accordingly that these procedural shortcomings amounted to a serious and manifestly unlawful breach of a fundamental freedom , namely the right to respect for life , and ordered the hospital to resume feeding and hydrating PERSON normally and to provide him with whatever care his condition required .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a fresh collective procedure was initiated . Dr PERSON consulted CARDINAL doctors , including CARDINAL from outside the hospital ( a neurologist , a cardiologist and an anaesthetist with experience in palliative medicine ) chosen by PERSON parents , his wife and the medical team respectively . He also had regard to a written contribution from a doctor in charge of a specialised extended care facility within a nursing home .", "CARDINAL .

His decision , comprising a reasoned CARDINAL - page report , a sevenpage summary of which was read out to the family , observed in particular that PERSON condition was characterised by irreversible brain damage and that the treatment appeared to be futile and disproportionate and to have no other effect than to sustain life artificially . According to the report , the doctor had no doubt that PERSON had not wished , before his accident , to live under such conditions . Dr PERSON concluded that prolonging the patient \u2019s life by continuing to treat him with artificial nutrition and hydration amounted to unreasonable obstinacy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made a further urgent application to ORG for protection of a fundamental freedom under LAW , seeking an injunction prohibiting the hospital and the doctor concerned from withdrawing PERSON nutrition and hydration and an order for his immediate transfer to a specialised extended care facility in ORG run by the association PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON and PERSON , ORG nephew , intervened in the proceedings as third parties .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting as a full court of CARDINAL judges , held a hearing on DATE . In a judgment of DATE it suspended the implementation of PERSON decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG began by observing that LAW did not prevent GPE from making provision for individuals to object to potentially life - prolonging treatment . It likewise did not prevent the doctor in charge of a patient who was unable to express his or her wishes and whose treatment the doctor considered , after implementing a series of safeguards , to amount to unreasonable obstinacy , from withdrawing that treatment , subject to supervision by ORG , the hospital \u2019s ethics committee , where applicable , and the administrative and criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to find that it was clear from the relevant provisions of LAW , as amended following LAW of DATE and as elucidated by the parliamentary proceedings , that artificial enteral nutrition and hydration \u2013 which were subject , like medication , to the distribution monopoly held by pharmacies , were designed to supply specific nutrients to patients with impaired functions and required recourse to invasive techniques to administer them \u2013 constituted a form of treatment .", "CARDINAL . Observing that Dr PERSON \u2019s decision had been based on the wish apparently expressed by PERSON not to be kept alive in a highly dependent state , and that the latter had not drawn up any advance directives or designated a person of trust , ORG found that the views he had confided to his wife and CARDINAL of his brothers had been those of a healthy individual who had not been faced with the immediate consequences of his wishes , and had not constituted the formal manifestation of an express wish , irrespective of his professional experience with patients in a similar situation . The court further found that the fact that PERSON had had a conflictual relationship with his parents , since he did not share their moral values and religious commitment , did not mean that he could be considered to have expressed a clear wish to refuse all forms of treatment , and added that no unequivocal conclusion as to his desire or otherwise to be kept alive could be drawn from his apparent resistance to the care provided . ORG held that Dr PERSON had incorrectly assessed PERSON wishes .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that , according to the report drawn up in DATE by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON was in a minimally conscious state , implying the continuing presence of emotional perception and the existence of possible responses to his surroundings . Accordingly , the administering of artificial nutrition and hydration was not aimed at keeping him alive artificially . Lastly , the court considered that , as long as the treatment did not cause any stress or suffering , it could not be characterised as futile or disproportionate . It therefore held that Dr PERSON \u2019s decision had constituted a serious and manifestly unlawful breach of PERSON \u2019s right to life . It issued an order suspending the implementation of the decision while rejecting the request for the patient to be transferred to the specialised extended care facility in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL applications lodged on DATE PERSON , ORG and ORG appealed against that judgment to the urgent - applications judge of the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat . The applicants lodged a cross - appeal , requesting PERSON immediate transfer to the specialised extended care facility . ORG and ORG ( ORG , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) sought leave to intervene as a third party .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on the urgent application held on DATE the President of ORG of the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat decided to refer the case to the full court , sitting as a CARDINAL - member ORG .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before the full court took place on DATE . In his submissions to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat , the public rapporteur cited , inter alia , the remarks made by ORG to the members of the ORG examining the bill known as the Leonetti bill :", "\u201c While the act of withdrawing treatment ... results in death , the intention behind the act [ is not to kill ; it is ] to allow death to resume its natural course and to relieve suffering . This is particularly important for care staff , whose role is not to take life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat delivered its ruling on DATE . After joining the applications and granting ORG leave to intervene , the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat defined in the following terms the role of the urgentapplications judge called upon to rule on the basis of LAW of the Administrative Courts Code :", "\u201c Under [ Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] , the urgent - applications judge of the administrative court , when hearing an application of this kind justified by particular urgency , may order any measures necessary to safeguard a fundamental freedom allegedly breached in a serious and manifestly unlawful manner by an administrative authority . These legislative provisions confer on the urgent - applications judge , who normally decides alone and who orders measures of an interim nature in accordance with Article PERSON MONEY of LAW , the power to order , without delay and on the basis of a \u2018 plain and obvious\u2019 test , the necessary measures to protect fundamental freedoms .", "However , the urgent - applications judge must exercise his or her powers in a particular way when hearing an application under LAW ... concerning a decision taken by a doctor on the basis of LAW which would result in treatment being discontinued or withheld on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy and the implementation of which would cause irreversible damage to life . In such circumstances the judge , sitting where applicable as a member of a bench of judges , must take the necessary protective measures to prevent the decision in question from being implemented where it may not be covered by CARDINAL of the situations provided for by law , while striking a balance between the fundamental freedoms in issue , namely the right to respect for life and the patient \u2019s right to consent to medical treatment and not to undergo treatment that is the result of unreasonable obstinacy . In such a case , the urgentapplications judge or the bench to which he or she has referred the case may , as appropriate , after temporarily suspending the implementation of the measure and before ruling on the application , order an expert medical report and , under LAW CARDINAL of LAW , seek the opinion of any person whose expertise or knowledge are apt to usefully inform the court \u2019s decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat found that it was clear from the very wording of the relevant provisions of LAW ( Articles L. CARDINAL , L. DATE and NORP DATE ) and from the parliamentary proceedings that the provisions in question were general in scope and applied to PERSON just as they did to all users of the health service . The PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat stated as follows :", "\u201c It is clear from these provisions that each individual must receive the care most appropriate to his or her condition and that the preventive or exploratory acts carried out and the care administered must not subject the patient to disproportionate risks in relation to the anticipated benefits . Such acts must not be continued with unreasonable obstinacy and may be discontinued or withheld where they appear to be futile or disproportionate or to have no other effect than to sustain life artificially , whether or not the patient is in an end - of - life situation . Where the patient is unable to express his or her wishes , any decision to limit or withdraw treatment on the ground that continuing it would amount to unreasonable obstinacy may not be taken by the doctor , where such a measure is liable to endanger the life of the patient , without the collective procedure defined in LAW and the rules on consultation laid down in LAW having been followed . If the doctor takes such a decision he or she must at all events preserve the patient \u2019s dignity and dispense palliative care .", "Furthermore , it is clear from the provisions of Articles L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL and PERSON of LAW , as elucidated by the parliamentary proceedings prior to the passing of LAW of DATE , that the legislature intended to include among the forms of treatment that may be limited or withdrawn on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy all acts which seek to maintain the patient \u2019s vital functions artificially . Artificial nutrition and hydration fall into this category of acts and may accordingly be withdrawn where continuing them would amount to unreasonable obstinacy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tatwithdraw treatment whose continuation would amount to unreasonable obstinacy had been met . To that end it needed to have the fullest information possible at its disposal , in particular concerning PERSON state of health . Accordingly , it considered it necessary before ruling on the application to order an expert medical report to be prepared by practitioners with recognised expertise in neuroscience . The experts \u2013 acting on an independent and collective basis , after examining the patient , meeting the medical team and the care staff and familiarising themselves with the patient \u2019s entire medical file DATE were to give their opinion on PERSON current condition and provide the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat with all relevant information as to the prospect of any change .", "CARDINAL . The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decided to entrust the expert report to a panel of CARDINAL doctors appointed by the President of ORG on proposals from the President of ORG , ORG and the President of ORG respectively . The remit of the panel of experts , which was to report within DATE of its formation , read as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) to describe Mr. PERSON \u2019s current clinical condition and how it has changed since the review carried out in DATE by ORG ;", "( ii ) to express an opinion as to whether the patient \u2019s brain damage is irreversible and as to the clinical prognosis ;", "( iii ) to determine whether the patient is capable of communicating , by whatever means , with those around him ;", "( iv ) to assess whether there are any signs to suggest at the present time that PERSON PERSON reacts to the care being dispensed to him and , if so , whether those reactions can be interpreted as a rejection of that care , as suffering , as a desire for the life - sustaining treatment to be withdrawn or , on the contrary , as a desire for the treatment to be continued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat also considered it necessary , in view of the scale and the difficulty of the scientific , ethical and deontological issues raised by the case and in accordance with LAW , to request ORG , ORG and ORG , together with Mr PERSON , the rapporteur for the LAW of DATE , to submit general written observations by DATE designed to clarify for it the application of the concepts of unreasonable obstinacy and sustaining life artificially for the purposes of Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL , referred to above , with particular regard to individuals who , like PERSON , were in a minimally conscious state .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat rejected the ORG request for PERSON to be transferred to a specialised extended care facility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The experts examined PERSON on CARDINAL occasions . They familiarised themselves with the entire medical file , and in particular the report of ORG in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the treatment file and the administrative file , and had access to all the imaging tests . They also consulted all the items in the judicial case file of relevance for their expert report . In addition , DATE and DATE they met all the parties ( the family , the medical and care team , the medical consultants and representatives of ORG and the hospital ) and carried out a series of tests on PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the experts sent their preliminary report to the parties for comments . Their final report , submitted on CARDINAL DATE , provided the following replies to the questions asked by the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat .", "CARDINAL . NORP The experts found that PERSON clinical condition corresponded to a vegetative state , without any signs pointing to a minimally conscious state . Furthermore , they stressed that he had difficulty swallowing and had seriously impaired motor functions of all CARDINAL limbs , with significant retraction of the tendons . They noted that his state of consciousness had deteriorated since the assessment carried out in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The experts pointed out that the CARDINAL main factors to be taken into account in assessing whether or not brain damage was irreversible were , firstly , the length of time since the accident which had caused the damage and , secondly , the nature of the damage . In the present case they noted that DATE had passed since the initial head injury and that the imaging tests showed severe cerebral atrophy testifying to permanent neuron loss , near - total destruction of strategic regions such as both parts of the thalamus and the upper part of the brain stem , and serious damage to the communication pathways in the brain . They concluded that the brain damage was irreversible . They added that the lengthy period of progression , the patient \u2019s clinical deterioration since DATE , his current vegetative state , the destructive nature and extent of the brain damage and the results of the functional tests , coupled with the severity of the motor impairment of all CARDINAL limbs , pointed to a poor clinical prognosis .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the tests carried out , and particularly in view of the fact that the course of speech and language therapy carried out in DATE had not succeeded in establishing a code of communication , the experts concluded that PERSON was not capable of establishing functional communication with those around him .", "CARDINAL . The experts observed that PERSON reacted to the care provided and to painful stimuli , but concluded that these were nonconscious responses . In their view , it was not possible to interpret them as conscious awareness of suffering or as the expression of any intent or wish with regard to the withdrawal or continuation of treatment .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat received the general observations of ORG , Mr PERSON , rapporteur for the LAW of DATE , ORG and ORG .", "ORG made clear in particular that , in using the expression \u201c no other effect than to sustain life artificially \u201d in LAW DATE of LAW , the legislature had sought to address the situation of patients who not only were being kept alive solely by the use of methods and techniques replacing key vital functions , but also , and above all , whose cognitive and relational functions were profoundly and irreversibly impaired . It emphasised the importance of the notion of temporality , stressing that where a pathological condition had become chronic , resulting in the person \u2019s physiological deterioration and the loss of his or her cognitive and relational faculties , obstinacy in administering treatment could be regarded as unreasonable if no signs of improvement were apparent .", "PERSON stressed that the LAW was applicable to patients who had brain damage and thus suffered from a serious condition which , in the advanced stages , was incurable , but who were not necessarily \u201c at the end of life \u201d . Accordingly , the legislature , in the title of the LAW , had referred to \u201c ORG rights and endoflife issues \u201d rather than \u201c ORG rights in endoflife situations \u201d . He outlined the criteria for unreasonable obstinacy and the factors used to assess it and stated that the reference to treatment having \u201c no other effect than to sustain life artificially \u201d , which was stricter than the wording originally envisaged ( namely , treatment \u201c which prolongs life artificially \u201d ) was more restrictive and referred to artificially sustaining life \u201c in the purely biological sense , in circumstances where , firstly , the patient has major irreversible brain damage and , secondly , his or her condition offers no prospect of a return to awareness of self or relationships with others \u201d . He pointed out that the LAW gave the doctor sole responsibility for the decision to withdraw treatment and that it had been decided not to pass that responsibility on to the family , in order to avoid any feelings of guilt and to ensure that the person who took the decision was identified .", "ORG reiterated the fundamental prohibition barring doctors from deliberately taking another \u2019s life , which formed the basis for the relationship of trust between doctor and patient . The ORG reiterated its long - standing position according to which the Act of DATE was applicable not only to the various \u201c end - of - life \u201d situations , but also to situations raising the very difficult ethical issue of the \u201c ending of life \u201d in the case of patients in \u201c survival \u201d mode , in a minimally conscious or chronic vegetative state .", "ORG conducted an indepth analysis of the difficulties surrounding the notions of unreasonable obstinacy , treatment and sustaining life artificially , summarised the medical data concerning minimally conscious states and addressed the ethical issues arising out of such situations . It recommended in particular a process of reflection aimed at ensuring that the collective discussions led to a genuine collective decision - making process and that , where no consensus could be reached , there was a possibility of mediation .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place on DATE before the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat . In his submissions the public rapporteur stressed , in particular , the following :", "\u201c ... [ t]he legislature did not wish to impose on those in the caring professions the burden of bridging the gap which exists between allowing death to take its course when it can no longer be prevented and actively causing death by administering a lethal substance . By discontinuing treatment , a doctor is not taking the patient \u2019s life , but is resolving to withdraw when there is nothing more to be done . \u201d", "The PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat delivered its judgment on DATE . After granting leave to ORG , PERSON CARDINAL - sister , to intervene as a third party , and reiterating the relevant provisions of domestic law as commented on and elucidated in the general observations received , the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat examined in turn the ORG arguments based on the LAW and on domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On the first point the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat reiterated that , where the urgentapplications judge was called on to hear an application under LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ( urgent application for protection of a fundamental freedom ) concerning a decision taken by a doctor under LAW which would result in treatment being discontinued or withheld on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy , and implementation of that decision would cause irreversible damage to life , the judge was required to examine any claim that the provisions in question were incompatible with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case before it the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat replied in the following terms to the arguments based on ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention :", "\u201c Firstly , the disputed provisions of LAW defined a legal framework reaffirming the right of all persons to receive the most appropriate care , the right to respect for their wish to refuse any treatment and the right not to undergo medical treatment resulting from unreasonable obstinacy . Those provisions do not allow a doctor to take a life - threatening decision to limit or withdraw the treatment of a person incapable of expressing his or her wishes , except on the dual , strict condition that continuation of that treatment would amount to unreasonable obstinacy and that the requisite safeguards are observed , namely that account is taken of any wishes expressed by the patient and that CARDINAL other doctor and the care team are consulted , as well as the person of trust , the family or another person close to the patient . Any such decision by a doctor is open to appeal before the courts in order to review compliance with the conditions laid down by law .", "Hence the disputed provisions of LAW , taken together , in view of their purpose and the conditions attaching to their implementation , can not be said to be incompatible with the requirements of LAW ... , or with those of LAW", "The PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat also rejected the ORG arguments based on ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , finding that the role entrusted to the doctor under the provisions of LAW was not incompatible with the duty of impartiality flowing from LAW , and that LAW , which applied to criminal convictions , was not relevant to the case before it .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the application of the relevant provisions of LAW , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat held as follows :", "\u201c Although artificial nutrition and hydration are among the forms of treatment which may be withdrawn in cases where their continuation would amount to unreasonable obstinacy , the sole fact that a person is in an irreversible state of unconsciousness or , a fortiori , has lost his or her autonomy irreversibly and is thus dependent on such a form of nutrition and hydration , does not by itself amount to a situation in which the continuation of treatment would appear unjustified on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy .", "In assessing whether the conditions for the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration are met in the case of a patient with severe brain damage , however caused , who is in a vegetative or minimally conscious state and is thus unable to express his or her wishes , and who depends on such nutrition and hydration as a means of life support , the doctor in charge of the patient must base his or her decision on a range of medical and non - medical factors whose relative weight can not be determined in advance but will depend on the circumstances of each patient , so that the doctor must assess each situation on its own merits . In addition to the medical factors , which must cover a sufficiently long period , be assessed collectively and relate in particular to the patient \u2019s current condition , the change in that condition since the accident or illness occurred , his or her degree of suffering and the clinical prognosis , the doctor must attach particular importance to any wishes the patient may have expressed previously , whatever their form or tenor . In that regard , where such wishes remain unknown , they can not be assumed to consist in a refusal by the patient to be kept alive in the current conditions . The doctor must also take into account the views of the person of trust , where the patient has designated such a person , of the members of the patient \u2019s family or , failing this , of another person close to the patient , while seeking to establish a consensus . In assessing the patient \u2019s particular situation , the doctor must be guided primarily by a concern to act with maximum beneficence towards the patient ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat", "CARDINAL . In that connection the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat ruled as follows :", "\u201c Firstly , it is clear from the examination of the case that the collective procedure conducted by PERSON ... , prior to the taking of the decision of DATE , was carried out in accordance with the requirements of Article R. CARDINAL - DATE of LAW and involved the consultation of CARDINAL doctors , although that Article simply requires that the opinion of CARDINAL doctor and , where appropriate , of a second be sought . PERSON was not legally bound to allow the meeting of DATE to be attended by a second doctor designated by PERSON parents in addition to the one they had already designated . Nor does it appear from the examination of the case that some members of the care team were deliberately excluded from that meeting . Furthermore , PERSON was entitled to speak with Mr PERSON , the patient \u2019s nephew . The fact that PERSON opposed a request for him to withdraw from PERSON case and for the patient to be transferred to another establishment , and the fact that he expressed his views publicly , do not amount , having regard to all the circumstances of the present case , to a failure to comply with the obligations implicit in the principle of impartiality , which PERSON respected . Accordingly , contrary to what was argued before the ORG - en - Champagne Administrative Court , the procedure preceding the adoption of the decision of CARDINAL DATE was not tainted with any irregularity .", "Secondly , the experts\u2019 findings indicate that \u2018 PERSON current clinical condition corresponds to a vegetative ORG , with \u2018 swallowing difficulties , severe motor impairment of all CARDINAL limbs , some signs of dysfunction of the brainstem\u2019 and \u2018 continued ability to breathe ORG . The results of the tests carried out from DATE to assess the patient \u2019s brain structure and function ... were found to be consistent with such a vegetative state . The experts found that the clinical progression , characterised by the disappearance of the fluctuations in PERSON state of consciousness recorded during the assessment carried out in DATE by ORG at ORG and by the failure of the active therapies recommended at the time of that assessment , were suggestive of \u2018 a deterioration in the [ patient \u2019s ] state of consciousness since that time\u2019 .", "Furthermore , according to the findings set out in the experts\u2019 report , the exploratory tests which were carried out revealed serious and extensive brain damage , as evidenced in particular by \u2018 severe impairment of the structure and metabolism of the sub - cortical regions of crucial importance for cognitive function\u2019 and \u2018 major structural dysfunction of the communication pathways between the regions of the brain involved in consciousness\u2019 . The severity of the cerebral atrophy and of the damage observed , coupled with the CARDINAL - and - a - half - year period that had elapsed since the initial accident , led the experts to conclude that the brain damage was irreversible .", "Furthermore , the experts concluded that \u2018 the lengthy period of progression , the patient \u2019s clinical deterioration since DATE , his current vegetative state , the destructive nature and the extent of the brain damage , the results of the functional tests and the severity of the motor impairment of all CARDINAL ORG pointed to a \u2018 poor clinical prognosis\u2019 .", "Lastly , while noting that PERSON was capable of reacting to the care administered and to certain stimuli , the experts indicated that the characteristics of those reactions suggested that they were non - conscious responses . The experts did not consider it possible to interpret these behavioural reactions as evidence of \u2018 conscious awareness of suffering\u2019 or as the expression of any intent or wish with regard to the withdrawal or continuation of the treatment keeping the patient alive .", "These findings , which the experts reached unanimously following a collective assessment in the course of which the patient was examined on CARDINAL separate occasions , thorough cerebral tests were performed , meetings were held with the medical team and care staff involved and the entire file was examined , confirm the conclusions drawn by PERSON as to the irreversible nature of the damage and Mr PERSON \u2019s clinical prognosis . The exchanges which took place in the adversarial proceedings before the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat subsequent to submission of the PERSON report do nothing to invalidate the experts\u2019 conclusions . While it can be seen from the PERSON report , as just indicated , that PERSON reactions to care are not capable of interpretation and thus can not be regarded as expressing a wish as to the withdrawal of treatment , PERSON in fact indicated in the impugned decision that the behaviour concerned was open to various interpretations , all of which needed to be treated with great caution , and did not include this aspect in the reasons for his decision .", "Thirdly , the provisions of LAW allow account to be taken of a patient \u2019s wishes expressed in a form other than advance directives . It is apparent from the examination of the case , and in particular from the testimony of PERSON , that she and her husband , both nurses , had often discussed their respective professional experiences in dealing with patients under resuscitation and those with multiple disabilities , and that PERSON had on several such occasions clearly voiced the wish not to be kept alive artificially if he were to find himself in a highly dependent state . The tenor of those remarks , reported by PERSON in precise detail and with the corresponding dates , was confirmed by CARDINAL of Mr PERSON \u2019s brothers . While these remarks were not made in the presence of PERSON PERSON \u2019s parents , the latter did not claim that their son could not have made them or that he would have expressed wishes to the contrary , and several of PERSON siblings stated that the remarks concerned were in keeping with their brother \u2019s personality , past experience and personal opinions . Accordingly , in stating among the reasons for the decision at issue his certainty that PERSON Lambert did not wish , before his accident , to live under such conditions , PERSON can not be regarded as having incorrectly interpreted the wishes expressed by the patient before his accident .", "Fourthly , the doctor in charge of the patient is required , under the provisions of LAW , to obtain the views of the patient \u2019s family before taking any decision to withdraw treatment .
