CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) which was approved by the Minister of Finance in DATE and confirmed by the same minister in DATE , ORG said that ORG belonged to the ORG , since PERSON heirs had failed to prove that they had acquired property rights under title deeds or from adverse possession of the estate . On the basis of that opinion , ORG registered the land possessed by PERSON heirs and subsequently all the plots which had been transferred to third parties by the heirs as public estates . Various sets of proceedings brought against the ORG by PERSON heirs and third parties are still pending in the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Minister of Agriculture decided to extend reafforestation in GPE to a region which included the disputed land .

Other judicial decisions ( judgments no . CARDINAL of ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , and no .
