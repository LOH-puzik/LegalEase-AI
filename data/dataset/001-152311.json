NORP The applicant company , ORG , is a limited liability company created in DATE . It is registered in GPE , GPE . The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agents , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in accordance with LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG , have not availed themselves of this opportunity .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant held a MONEY stake in the applicant company . The other MONEY was held by Fabrika CARDINAL ORG , a NORP limited liability company wholly owned by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another company , PERSON ORG ( \u201c OP \u201d ) , a state - owned limited liability company , was declared insolvent and insolvency proceedings were opened . Following a public auction of part of its property , on DATE the applicant company acquired several greenhouses . However , in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE the auction was cancelled .", "CARDINAL . Pending a new auction , on DATE ORG , represented by its trustee in insolvency , and the applicant company signed a contract pursuant to which the applicant company was appointed guardian of the greenhouses until they were sold . The applicant company undertook to maintain the greenhouses\u2019 equipment and to carry out urgent repair works . In the meantime the applicant company was entitled to use the property and in exchange undertook to pay DATE rent .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the repairs indicated in the contract of DATE , the applicant company carried out substantial works on the greenhouses , which it alleged were necessary for the latter \u2019s proper functioning . On an unspecified date it requested the trustee in insolvency of ORG to reimburse the costs of those works . Initially the ORG included those costs in the list of accepted claims against ORG . Later , however , following an objection by CARDINAL of the other creditors of ORG , which was based on the fact that the costs were substantial , had not been approved by the creditors and had been incurred after the beginning of the insolvency proceedings , in a decision of DATE the ORG removed this claim from the list .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE , ORG upheld the removal , as it was not satisfied that the additional works had been urgent and necessary . Moreover , the works had not been authorised by the ORG and the remaining creditors . ORG considered that a creditor such as the applicant company , with a claim which had not been agreed in the insolvency proceedings , could make that claim in separate civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought a civil claim against ORG and also against ORG , as a representative of the ORG , which owned ORG \u2019s capital . Initially it sought CARDINAL NORP levs ( ORG ) ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) , representing part of the repair costs . In the course of the proceedings it increased its claim to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , claiming that ORG had unjustly enriched itself by that amount . The applicant company did not seek to have its claim included in the list of accepted claims prepared by the ORG , but argued that it was entitled to receive payment prior to the distribution of any amounts obtained through the sale of the property of ORG among the remaining creditors .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG granted the claim against ORG . It found that the applicant company had been unable to claim or receive payment in the course of the insolvency proceedings , and that therefore it was open to it to do so in separate civil proceedings . It went on to say that the repairs had been necessary , that the defendant company had unjustly enriched itself , and that it had had to reimburse the costs of the repairs . It accepted the applicant company \u2019s argument that it had been a \u201c third party \u201d to the insolvency proceedings , and that it was entitled to receive payment outside those proceedings . Thus , the domestic court ordered ORG to pay the applicant company the amount of ORG CARDINAL , plus interest and costs .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s claim against ORG , finding that the latter could not be held liable for ORG \u2019s debts .", "CARDINAL . OP appealed against the above judgment , but its appeal was rejected as inadmissible in a final decision of ORG DATE . As a result , ORG judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG requested the reopening of the proceedings , claiming that it had not been properly summoned to the first CARDINAL hearings in the case , held on DATE and DATE . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the request and reopened the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . After a fresh examination of the case , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG discontinued the proceedings in respect of OP . It held that the claim was precluded by virtue of the provision of the newly introduced section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the CA \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which concerned procedural rights and was therefore applicable to pending proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the proceedings against ORG , the ORG observed that they were still pending .", "CARDINAL . On appeals by the applicant company , on DATE and DATE respectively ORG conclusions were upheld by ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered in addition that the applicant company should have lodged a claim under section CARDINAL of the CA ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) within the insolvency proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company submits that it became aware of ORG decision of DATE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the discontinuation of the proceedings in so far as they concerned ORG , the proceedings continued against ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s claim against ORG . It noted that it had ordered ORG to provide several invoices which it considered relevant . Those invoices had not been presented ( ORG had in the meantime been wound up ) ; accordingly , the domestic court found that the claim had not been proved .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company did not lodge an appeal against the above judgment , as it was entitled to do under domestic law .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company used the greenhouses until DATE , when it was evicted . The greenhouses were sold at a new public auction in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Company insolvency is governed by Part IV of LAW ( \u201c the CA \u201d ) of DATE . Since its enactment in DATE , its provisions relating to company insolvency were amended on numerous occasions .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CA , creditors had to declare their claims against the insolvent company . The trustee in insolvency then prepared a list of accepted claims . Refusal by the trustee to accept a claim and include it in the list could be contested before the insolvency court . A creditor could also object to a decision to accept another creditor \u2019s claim . At the relevant time , the trustee would decide on the matter and then submit the list for approval to the insolvency court .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL of the CA , introduced in DATE and as worded at the time , a creditor whose claim had not been accepted and included in the list could also bring an action for a declaration seeking to establish the existence of the claim . Such an action could be brought within DATE of the entry in the company register of the insolvency court \u2019s decision approving the list of accepted claims . If the claimant was successful , the claim was to be satisfied within the insolvency proceedings . A similar provision existed in the CA until DATE , when it was repealed .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE there was no provision which explicitly allowed or barred the bringing of a civil claim against an insolvent company separately from the insolvency proceedings against that company , and there was no well - established practice of the domestic courts in this regard . Following amendments to the CA of DATE , a bar to such claims was introduced ( initially section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , currently ( CARDINAL ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
