On DATE , ORG rejected the charges against the applicants as it found that the mere fact that PERSON had given evidence that the applicants had visited his shop as customers in DATE and that the van used in the burglary had been seen parked in the parking lot close to the applicants\u2019 apartment did not show that the applicants had committed the offence with which they were charged .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the applicants be convicted as charged .

GPE , cited above , found that :", "\u201c PERSON \u2019s and NORP \u2019s statements concerning the events given during their police investigation and repeated before ORG [ in their own case ] are supported by other evidence presented in the present case . PERSON observed the applicants visit the fur shop and NORP noted the presence of the applicants when the borrowed van was returned to him . Moreover , the first applicant showed an interest in what NORP had told the police . Furthermore , the statements of PERSON and NORP are supported by Y. \u2019s observation of NORP \u2019s van in PERSON close to the applicants\u2019 apartment .", "Even though the applicants did not have an opportunity to put questions to PERSON and NORP , they had an opportunity to submit arguments against their statements , both during the police investigation and also before ORG as well as ORG . The applicants have , nevertheless , denied having ever visited the fur shop , which , taking into account the certainty of PERSON as to the applicants\u2019 identity , tends to diminish the credibility of the applicants\u2019 statements .", "ORG does not find that the changing of ORG statement - or the reasons given for the change - are credible . ORG finds it irrelevant that PERSON has , in a facsimile submitted to ORG , retracted his earlier statement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested leave to appeal from ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , arguing that they should have had a right to examine PERSON and NORP before the courts , as the other evidence was not strong enough to support their convictions .

Furthermore , on DATE of their alleged visit to the fur shop they had both been at an oral hearing before ORG of Espoo , which is situated QUANTITY from PERSON , and could not even in theory have been at the shop at the time mentioned in the judgment .
