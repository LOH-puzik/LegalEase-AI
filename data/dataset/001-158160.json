The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has a son , PERSON , who was born in DATE . The applicant was not married to the child \u2019s mother , PERSON , and the relationship ended DATE after S. \u2019s birth . After the separation , PERSON continued to live with PERSON and the applicant maintained contact with him . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON stopped the applicant \u2019s contact with S.", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG seeking parental rights and responsibilities and residence or , alternatively , residential contact .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and PERSON agreed that the NORP should reside with PERSON and that the applicant should have contact . The agreement was set out in a joint minute of agreement , on the basis of which ORG , in an interlocutor dated DATE , granted the applicant parental rights and responsibilities in respect of S. ; found that the applicant was entitled to residential and non - residential contact with PERSON on a basis and on dates specified in the interlocutor ; and held that PERSON was to consult with the applicant when making decisions of importance with respect to the health , welfare , education and upbringing of S. The interlocutor did not provide for the dates upon which the regular contact was to begin or when during each DATE period it was to occur . It also failed to take into account pre - arranged holidays .", "CARDINAL . Because of the ambiguity in the interlocutor , the relationship between the applicant and PERSON quickly deteriorated . On DATE the applicant lodged TIME at ORG : one to vary the DATE interlocutor by seeking a residence order in respect of S. ; the other seeking a finding that PERSON was in contempt of court for breaching the DATE interlocutor . A curator ad litem was appointed by the Sheriff to represent S. \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted legal aid and was represented before ORG by PERSON ( counsel ) . The instructing solicitors were PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Following a number of procedural hearings , a substantive hearing began on DATE and concluded on DATE , after CARDINAL non - consecutive court days .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE \u2019s decision on the application to vary the DATE interlocutor was issued on DATE . He considered that having regard to S. \u2019s age , the history of the case and the influences at work on PERSON , he would derive no benefit from contact in such circumstances . The Sheriff therefore concluded that there had been a material change in circumstances since the interlocutor of DATE ; that it was in LOC \u2019s best interests that he did not have contact with his father ; and that the interlocutor of DATE required to be recalled .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of ORG . He contested the ORG \u2019s decision and complained , inter alia , that the action had not been concluded within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted legal aid to pursue his appeal . He was represented before ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ( counsel ) . The instructing solicitors were PERSON , for PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Inner House delivered its judgment on DATE . It did not uphold the applicant \u2019s appeal . However , it varied the DATE interlocutor to make it clear that it in turn only varied the DATE interlocutor in respect of contact but did not make any change to the finding that the applicant enjoyed parental rights and that he had to be consulted on matters concerning PERSON \u2019s health , welfare , education and upbringing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a note was prepared by counsel supporting an application for legal aid to pursue an appeal to ORG .

It found that there was no substantive issue of law arising to merit an appeal and that no practical benefit to the applicant could ensue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel and solicitors considered commencing judicial review proceedings in respect of the refusal to grant legal aid . It was decided on the applicant \u2019s behalf that , as the delay involved in judicial review was likely to be extensive and given that legal aid for judicial review proceedings would almost certainly not be granted , no judicial review proceedings would be commenced . Counsel and the solicitors were not prepared to act pro bono in judicial review proceedings since the prospects of success would be low . However , they agreed to act pro bono in pursuing the appeal before ORG without legal aid . ORG waived its fees in respect of the appeal .", "CARDINAL .
