ESTONIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom to receive information);Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Julia Laffranque;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . He is serving a life sentence in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested from the Governor of NORP Prison access to ( i ) the online version of PERSON ( ORG ) , ( ii ) the decisions of ORG and administrative courts , which are available on the Internet , and ( iii ) the HUDOC database of the judgments of ORG . The Governor refused his request . The applicant \u2019s subsequent complaint was dismissed by ORG ; ORG dismissed his further appeal . The applicant then appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Administrative Law Chamber of ORG delivered its judgment on DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) . In respect of NORP legislation and ORG rulings , ORG noted that these were available in the paper version of PERSON ; it considered access to the paper version sufficient and found that the prison \u2019s refusal to grant the applicant access to the online version of PERSON had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG noted that from DATE the primary official version of PERSON had been its online version and that since then CARDINAL \u201c control copies \u201d of each edition had been printed . Despite that fact , the prisons had a duty to ensure that detainees had a reasonable possibility of searching for and familiarising themselves with legal acts .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG considered that the refusal of the prison administration to grant detainees access to the rulings of the administrative courts and of ORG interfered with their right to freely obtain information disseminated for public use . Given that the legislature had not specified any restrictions in this regard in respect of prisoners , their right \u2013 enshrined in LAW ( ORG p\u00f5hiseadus ) \u2013 to obtain information had to be given an equal level of protection as that afforded to persons at liberty . Accordingly , the refusal of NORP Prison to grant the applicant access to the rulings of the NORP administrative courts and ORG had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC \u2013 to which the applicant had been transferred in the meantime \u2013 refused the applicant \u2019s request to be granted access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee ( ORG in GPE ) , www.oiguskantsler.ee ( the Chancellor of ORG , or \u00d5iguskantsler ) ) and www.riigikogu.ee ( ORG , or PERSON ) . According to the applicant , he was involved in a number of legal disputes with the prison administration and needed access to those Internet sites in order to be able to defend his rights in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s complaint was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s complaint in respect of the Internet site www.coe.ee and ordered ORG to grant him supervised access to that site via a computer adapted for that purpose . ORG noted that ORG had afforded its detainees access to the online version of PERSON , the database of judicial decisions , and the Internet sites of ORG . ORG further referred to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Vangistusseadus ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which had entered into force on DATE . It noted that the Internet site of ORG to which detainees had been granted access DATE contained information only in LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE , whereas translations into LANGUAGE of the rulings of ORG were available on the Internet site of ORG in GPE . ORG considered that the burden of having the rulings of ORG translated into NORP could not be placed on the applicant and concluded that he also had to be granted access to the Internet site www.coe.ee . It considered that this Internet site was similar to the database of judicial decisions referred to in section CARDINAL of LAW . In respect of the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee , the court found that access to these sites was not foreseen by LAW ; in any case , the applicant could request information directly from the institutions concerned or from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed both appeals and upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . Both parties challenged ORG judgment before ORG . ORG of ORG referred the case to ORG plenary session on a point of constitutionality . By a judgment of DATE the plenary session of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG appeal . It quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments in so far as these granted the applicant access to the Internet site www.coe.ee .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the Internet sites in question did not fall under the exceptions provided for in section CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Thus , ORG had to determine whether that provision was in conformity with LAW . ORG found that section CARDINAL of LAW interfered with the right \u2013 enshrined in LAW to freely obtain information disseminated for public use . It noted that the aims of imprisonment included the protection of the legal order and steering detainees towards law - abiding behaviour . As the possibility could not be technically excluded that detainees might misuse the right to use the Internet , access to the Internet was prohibited to them by LAW . The exception made in respect of the official databases of legislation and the database of judicial decisions was necessary in order to ensure that detainees were afforded an effective possibility to protect their own rights . It had to be taken into account that the official texts of legal acts were only accessible to detainees via the Internet .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the prohibition of the use of the Internet was necessary primarily in order to restrict detainees\u2019 ability to engage in communication for purposes that did not accord with those of their detention , such as obtaining information that could jeopardise the prison \u2019s security or run counter to the directing of detainees towards law - abiding behaviour . Granting detainees access to any additional Internet site increased the security risk of their obtaining information running contrary to the aims of imprisonment . Moreover , this could create an opportunity for detainees to use the Internet for purposes other than that of freely obtaining information disseminated for public use . Thus , ORG concluded that the prohibition of detainees\u2019 access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee , www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee was justified by the need to achieve the aims of imprisonment and in particular the need to secure public safety .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the proportionality of the restriction ORG considered that the denial of GPE access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee , www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee prevented them from misusing the Internet via these sites and that public safety was thereby protected . Moreover , granting detainees access to these Internet sites could increase the risk of their engaging in prohibited communication ; this in turn would necessitate increased levels of control ( and therefore costs ) . Thus , there were no alternative , equally effective means DATE besides the prohibition imposed by section CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW of achieving the legitimate aim in question . Lastly , ORG noted that detainees were able to contact the PERSON and the Chancellor of Justice by mail and make a request for information ( teaben\u00f5ue ) . Therefore , GPE access to the public information contained on the Internet sites in question was not unduly restricted . Detainees\u2019 access to the Internet site of ORG was guaranteed , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ; those of ORG conventions and treaties that had been ratified by GPE were accessible on the Internet site GPE . ORG noted that it did not doubt that the printed works of ORG were accessible through prison libraries , and nor were detainees prevented from contacting ORG by post . ORG concluded that the restriction preventing detainees from accessing the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee , www.riigikogu.ee and www.coe.ee was one of \u201c low intensity \u201d ; ORG gave more weight to the aim sought by that restriction . It considered that permitting detainees extensive use of the Internet would increase the likelihood of prison authorities losing control over GPE activities , as it could not be completely excluded that via the Internet sites in question detainees could use the Internet for other , unauthorised purposes . Accordingly , the impugned restriction was in conformity with LAW .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges out of CARDINAL delivered a dissenting opinion according to which the applicant should have been granted access to all CARDINAL of the Internet sites in question . They considered that the use of the Internet sites in question did not generally pose a threat to public safety and was in conformity with the aims of imprisonment . It was unclear what additional costs the ORG would have to bear , since DATE in line with the applicable law \u2013 prisons were equipped with computers specially adapted to allow detainees access to the official databases of legislation and judicial decisions , and the prison service exercised supervision over the use of such resources . The information available on the Internet sites in question aided the exercising of the right of recourse to the courts . While it was true that detainees could also avail themselves of the right to make a request for information , this was a more time - consuming avenue and , particularly in the case of the Internet site of the Chancellor of ORG , required knowledge of which information was available on such Internet sites . No request for information under LAW ( NORP teabe seadus ) could be made to ORG in GPE . The rulings of ORG available in the HUDOC database \u2013 which was accessible to detainees \u2013 were not in NORP ( unlike the unofficial translations published on the Internet site www.coe.ee ) , and it could not be presumed that detainees had sufficient command of LANGUAGE or LANGUAGE to be able to read them . The printed works of ORG that were available in prison libraries did not include all the information that was published on the Internet site of ORG in GPE . Thus , the CARDINAL dissenting judges concluded that the restriction in question was unconstitutional ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
