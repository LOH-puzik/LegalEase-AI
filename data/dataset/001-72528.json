GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in PERSON in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was the managing partner of the PERSON ( henceforward referred to as \u201c R - Company \u201d ) . In DATE the R - Company rented commercial LOC from another company ( \u201c the lessor \u201d ) , in order to operate its business . In DATE the R - Company became insolvent . By agreement of DATE the applicant acceded to the lease as from DATE . As from DATE the R - Company got into arrear with CARDINAL months\u2019 rent . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the lessor sent ORG a request for payment . By letter to both ORG and the applicant of DATE the lessor terminated the lease without notice ( fristlose PERSON ) . By DATE the applicant had paid the arrears of rent .", "The lessor lodged an action for eviction with ORG ( ORG ) , alleging that he had sent the applicant CARDINAL requests for payment on DATE and DATE . As the applicant contested this , ORG decided to take evidence by hearing the lessor \u2019s secretary as a witness .", "By judgment of DATE ORG , following a public hearing , ordered the applicant \u2019s eviction from the LOC . That court found that the lessor had proved that he had posted the letters to the applicant . It did not attach credence to the applicant \u2019s claim that he had not received these letters .", "By letter of DATE the applicant , who was represented by counsel , submitted his reasons for appeal , claiming that ORG assessment of the evidence was contrary to the case - law of ORG . According to the applicant , the mere fact that the witness had posted the letters to the applicant did not suffice to prove that he had actually received them . In this respect , he submitted several possibilities as to how the letters could have been lost before reaching their destination .", "By letter of DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) informed the applicant of its intention to reject the appeal without a hearing pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( PERSON , see relevant domestic law below ) . It further invited the applicant to submit written comments within DATE .", "ORG , following a preliminary assessment , found that the applicant \u2019s appeal lacked prospect of success . It considered that , according to the terms of the tenancy agreement , it would have been sufficient to inform the applicant about the arrear payments . The applicant had been duly informed by letter of CARDINAL DATE . Even though this letter had not been directed to the applicant , but to ORG , the applicant had undisputedly received it .", "In any event , the appeal lacked prospect of success as ORG assessment of the facts had neither been contrary to the law nor to the case - law of ORG . The applicant had not submitted that ORG had wrongly established the facts .", "By letter of DATE the applicant requested ORG to abstain from applying section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure and to hold an oral hearing on his appeal . He stated that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL should only be applied if an appeal was manifestly ill - founded . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , the applicant further pointed out that LAW granted a right to an oral hearing in appeal proceedings , which could only be dispensed with if this was justified by the special features of the proceedings involved . ORG had based its letter on different facts than ORG . Under these circumstances , it was necessary to hold a fresh oral hearing . The applicant further denied having gained any knowledge of the content of the letter of DATE , as he had transferred this letter unopened to ORG administrator in insolvency . He further maintained that ORG assessment of the evidence had not been in accordance with the law .", "On DATE ORG , by unanimous decision , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . ORG stated that the appeal had no prospect of success , that the matter at issue was not of fundamental importance , and that is was not necessary to allow the appeal in order to safeguard a consistent application of the law . It found , first , that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL did not require that an appeal was manifestly ill - founded . Notwithstanding , the applicant \u2019s appeal was manifestly ill - founded . ORG noted that the applicant had conceded having received the letter of CARDINAL DATE . By sending this letter , the lessor , who did not know about ORG insolvency , had taken the necessary steps to inform the applicant about the arrears of rent . It did not matter whether the applicant had gained knowledge of the content of that letter , as he had been in a position to do so .", "Referring to the reasons set out in its letter of DATE , ORG confirmed that ORG assessment of the evidence had not been contrary to the law .", "With respect to LAW , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c This provision [ section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ] is closely linked to the examination of the admissibility of the appeal by the court , as can be seen in the context with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s references to LAW are not suited to compel the ORG to hold an oral hearing irrespectively of the appeal \u2019s prospect of success . Within the ambit of LAW , the necessity of an oral hearing in appeal proceedings does not arise , if only the admissibility of the appeal is at issue , if the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal are irrelevant for the decision or if the appeal can adequately be dealt with on the basis of the content of the case - file ( see PERSON / Gummer , Commentary to LAW , DATE . , \u00a7 CARDINAL , marginal note CARDINAL ) . It follows that LAW contrary to the defendant \u2019s point of view \u2013 does not require a public hearing in every case in which an appeal is not manifestly ill - founded , but leaves sufficient room for the application of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . It does not require a specific degree of lack of prospect of success . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging a violation of his rights under LAW and LAW . He further requested ORG to suspend his eviction from the business premises by interim measure .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication for lack of prospect of success . That court found that ORG interpretation of the law did not violate the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights . In particular , it neither violated the applicant \u2019s right that his case be adjudicated by the competent judge ( ORG gesetzlichen Richter ) , nor was the limitation of access to the appeal proceedings disproportionate .", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "According to the former Code of Civil Procedure , appeal proceedings against a decision given by a court of first instance allowed a complete review of both facts and law .", "On DATE , reform legislation entered into force ( ORG ) , which was aimed at facilitating and thus expediting civil proceedings , inter alia by strengthening the position of the first instance courts and by unburdening second instance proceedings . Following this legislation , appeal proceedings are primarily devised as a means of controlling and rectifying errors made by the courts of first instance .", "The relevant provisions as in force since DATE read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "Grounds of appeal", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) An appeal can only be lodged on the ground that the decision is based on a violation of the law ... or that the facts which are relevant according to section CARDINAL justify a different decision .", "... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "Examination of admissibility , decision on rejection", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG has to establish on its own motion whether the appeal is admissible ( statthaft ) and whether it has been lodged in accordance with the formalities and time - limits as prescribed by law . If any of these prerequisites is lacking , the appeal has to be rejected as being inadmissible . The decision is taken by court - order which is subject to an appeal on points of law .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG promptly rejects the appeal by unanimous decision if it is convinced that", "CARDINAL . the appeal does not have prospect of success ,", "CARDINAL . the legal matter is not of fundamental importance and", "CARDINAL . the development of the law or the safeguarding of consistent jurisprudence do not necessitate that a decision be given by the court of appeal .", "The court of appeal or its presiding judge have to inform the parties of their intention to reject the appeal and the reasons thereof and has to give the appellant the opportunity to submit observations within a set time - limit . The decision pursuant to sentence one has to be reasoned , if the reasons for the rejection are not included in the letter of information pursuant to sentence CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) The decision given pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL , sentence one is not subject to an appeal . \u201c", "Section CARDINAL", "Scope of examination by ORG", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG has to base its hearing and decision on :", "CARDINAL . the facts established by the first instance court , unless there are concrete indications that raise doubts as to the correctness or completeness of the establishment of the relevant facts which warrant a fresh establishment ;", "CARDINAL . new facts , as long as it is admissible to consider these .", "... \u201d", "In case ORG rejects an appeal by judgment following an oral hearing , the appellant may , subject to certain provisions , file a request to be granted leave to appeal on points of law to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
