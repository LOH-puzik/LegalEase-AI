The publication in question had been distributed to members of ORG in DATE and produced as evidence during libel proceedings brought by the applicant against the magazine ORG .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law was lodged against ORG judgment but an application by the prosecution for its appeal on points of law to be declared immediately admissible was dismissed by the President of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the end of the investigation , the case file was sent to ORG at ORG , who filed his final application on DATE . In that application , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG submitted that the applicant had no case to answer in respect of his involvement in the organisation of the transports of DATE , DATE and DATE , that the prosecution of PERSON had lapsed , that the remaining charges should be altered to aiding and abetting abduction and false imprisonment and that the applicant should be committed for trial at FAC for the transports of DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE . ORG did not charge the crime of aiding and abetting murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE more associations applied to have their civil - party applications formally noted ; that was done in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE committing the applicant for trial .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings in ORG of ORG against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons on the charge of crimes against humanity following criminal complaints lodged together with civil - party applications by CARDINAL individuals and CARDINAL associations ended with a judgment delivered by ORG on DATE in which it committed the applicant for trial at ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears from that DATE judgment that DATE and DATE CARDINAL persons of NORP origin , including a large number of children , were deported in QUANTITY trainloads to FAC , where most of them died , either as the result of inhuman treatment or because they were exterminated . Some of the transports were dispatched after mass arrests among the NORP population .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , inter alia , that the unlawful arrests and imprisonment ordered by the NORP authorities had allegedly been carried out with the active assistance of the applicant , who was at the time the secretary - general of the LOC prefecture and who , by virtue of the extensive powers delegated to him by the regional prefect , had authority not only over the administrative departments of the prefecture but also over the police and gendarmerie , the M\u00e9rignac Camp authorities and the departments set up as a result of the war , such as ORG . It further noted that the applicant had allegedly been fully aware of the anti - NORP policy conducted by the Vichy government and that , as soon as he took office , he had apparently been \u201c convinced that the arrest and imprisonment of NORP and their deportation to the LOC were leading them inescapably to their deaths ... , even though he might have remained unaware of the ... circumstances ... and the technical methods used ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the active contribution that the applicant was said to have knowingly made through his personal actions to the commission of criminal acts by units of the SIPO - SD ( ORG ) , an organisation declared criminal by ORG on DATE , had formed part of a concerted plan carried out on behalf of NORP GPE , an LOC country pursuing a policy of ideological hegemony . It held that the applicant could not rely on the instructions given on DATE by the NORP authorities in GPE [ Message by Lieutenant Colonel PERSON broadcast by the ORG on DATE , urging civil servants working in metropolitan GPE to stay at their posts , to do the work that they were asked to do and to sabotage it only if it was contrary to the interests of the nation and such sabotage could be carried out without risk . It was also recommended that civil servants should act alone and not even confide in their best friends ] , nor on duress , the requirements of the law , the orders of his hierarchical superiors or the responsibility of his own subordinates to absolve himself of his own responsibility . It also considered that his membership of the Resistance , on which he relied , did not mean that he could not have assisted the acts perpetrated by the NORP against the NORP .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG ordered the applicant 's indictment for the offences of aiding and abetting unlawful arrest , false imprisonment , murder and attempted murder amounting to crimes against humanity in respect of CARDINAL police raids and CARDINAL transports of deportees , and committed him for trial at FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment . He pleaded in particular that the proceedings had been null and void , complaining that they had been unfair primarily because of their excessive length , the result of which had been that documents that would have been in his favour had disappeared and witnesses for the defence had died . He also challenged ORG decision to commit him for trial for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity on the ground that , in his opinion , individual complicity in the case of such a crime , which was mainly attributable to an institution or an organisation , presupposed that the individual concerned subscribed to the hegemonic and racial ideology of the criminal institution . The applicant maintained that he had never belonged to the NORP organisations condemned by ORG and that the acts of which he stood accused had been committed in the performance of his duties as secretary - general of LOC , an organ of ORG , which in his view did not have a hegemonic ideology with the goal of racial extermination . He submitted that for the purposes of the GPE law , which formed the basis of his prosecution , ORG and the NORP organisations should be regarded as separate entities from ORG , to which crimes against humanity could not therefore be attributed retrospectively . Consequently , he considered that neither could such crimes be attributed to persons who had performed purely administrative duties in the departments for which he was responsible . He also maintained that , contrary to what ORG had asserted , the fact that he had belonged to the Resistance was sufficient to rule out his participation in a concerted plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law . Noting that it was the first authority before which the complaint that the proceedings had been unfair had been raised , it declared that complaint inadmissible . It further ruled \u201c that the appellant [ had ] no interest in criticising the reasons given in the judgment for dismissing the complaint of a violation of LAW of LAW , seeing that excessive length of criminal proceedings [ did ] not affect their validity \u201d . ORG also considered that there was nothing inadequate or contradictory about the reasons ORG gave for classifying the offences as aiding and abetting unlawful arrest , false imprisonment and murder or attempted murder , constituting crimes against humanity . It pointed out that indictment divisions had the ultimate authority to assess whether facts amounted to an offence , the role of ORG being merely to \u201c verify , supposing the facts to be established , whether their classification [ justified ] sending the case for trial \u201d . It considered that that had been so in the instant case and that \u201c consequently , the grounds of appeal must be rejected , particularly in so far as they refer[red ] to the last paragraph of LAW , which [ required ] neither that a person aiding and abetting crimes against humanity should have subscribed to the policy of ideological hegemony of the principal perpetrators nor that he should have belonged to one of the organisations declared criminal by ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In an application of DATE ORG asked for the applicant to be placed under judicial supervision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG placed the applicant under judicial supervision , with certain obligations . On DATE ORG recorded that the applicant had withdrawn his appeal on points of law against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken into custody in FAC , pursuant to the arrest warrant included in the judgment of ORG committing him for trial .", "CARDINAL . The trial in ORG opened on DATE . The applicant 's lawyer immediately applied for his client 's release , pleading his extreme old DATE ) and his poor state of health following a triple heart bypass operation in DATE . ORG ordered an expert medical report , which was delivered to it on DATE and from which it appeared that the applicant 's state permitted imprisonment but only in a specialist cardiology unit . TIME , the applicant had to be admitted to hospital for TIME .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , in the light of the expert report , ORG ordered the applicant 's release . That decision triggered protests from the civil parties , some of whom threatened to withdraw from the trial , and their protests were given extensive press coverage . The prosecution appealed on points of law against the judgment ordering the applicant 's release .", "CARDINAL . The trial , which was initially expected to DATE , lasted DATE ( from DATE to DATE ) . The proceedings were interrupted on a number of occasions , mostly because of the applicant 's state of health . During the trial , which had a case file containing over CARDINAL folders , CARDINAL documents were produced in evidence . There were hearings on DATE , during which CARDINAL witnesses were heard , TIME were given over to the public prosecutor 's address , TIME to the civil parties ' submissions and TIME to the defence submissions . The court 's deliberations lasted TIME .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , that is on DATE following the opening of the trial , the applicant 's lawyer filed written submissions in which he argued that the trial should be declared not to satisfy the requirements of a fair hearing , particularly as the excessive length of the proceedings had made it impossible to hear certain witnesses ; sought to have the proceedings declared null and void ; and sought a ruling that the prosecution was barred . When arguing against the application for the proceedings to be declared null and void , the prosecutor referred in particular to the work carried out by the most recent investigating judges , who had made CARDINAL journeys to consult archives , seized and studied CARDINAL documents , taken evidence from CARDINAL witnesses and held CARDINAL interviews with civil parties .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the application for the proceedings against the applicant to be halted , on the following grounds :", "\u201c While it is true that many of the defence witnesses have now died or are incapable of travelling , it must be recognised that the same applies to the prosecution witnesses and that from this point of view and in general the parties are on an equal footing .", "The exceptional length of the proceedings which brought PERSON before ORG is not excessive when it is considered that the complexity of the case , linked for the most part to the long time that has elapsed since the commission of the offences of which the defendant is accused , the number of those offences , the broad time - span over which they were reported , the age of the witnesses and the fact that they were so scattered , required the investigating judges to carry out a very large number of investigations , which they were often forced to conduct themselves because of the very nature of the facts . Added to these problems were others stemming from the widely dispersed documentary sources and the obstacles sometimes encountered in gaining access to them .", "Contrary to what has been alleged , the trial at ORG is not that of a ORG or an administrative authority but that of a man entitled to rely on the presumption of innocence \u2013 a principle with constitutional status which can not be impaired in the judges ' minds by the media excesses denounced by the defence \u2013 a man accused of having personally committed acts which , in the words of the indictment , constituted the serious crime of ' aiding and abetting crimes against humanity ' .", "Lastly , in reply to the argument put forward by ORG defence counsel that the judgment delivered on DATE by ORG was ' in complete contradiction not only with LAW ... but also with LAW , it should be pointed out that it is not for an assize court to assess whether a decision of ORG is in conformity with the applicable rules of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE the proceedings were adjourned because the applicant was hospitalised with bronchitis caused by an infection .", "CARDINAL . In another interlocutory judgment ( of DATE , not produced ) ORG dismissed the applicant 's application for it be formally noted in the record that an NORP historian , who was an expert on the ORG regime , had in his witness statement of DATE expounded political and historical ideas not directly connected with the facts of which the applicant was accused . The applicant considered that there had been a violation of the principle that hearings in ORG must be oral , as the person concerned was not a \u201c witness \u201d , not having witnessed any of the offences of which he stood accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer applied to have the correspondence between the occupying NORP authorities and the prefecture DATE admitted in evidence .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the trial had to be adjourned once again on account of the applicant 's poor state of health , which had been confirmed by a medical report .", "CARDINAL . When the proceedings resumed on DATE the applicant 's lawyer filed written submissions in which he applied for further inquiries into the facts to be made with a view to producing in court the whole of the police intendant 's archives held by the PERSON archive office instead of the results of selective seizures which did not make it possible to assess exactly what powers had been exercised by the various actors at the prefecture DATE . In a judgment of DATE ORG decided to defer its examination of that application .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the trial was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG authorised the projection of CARDINAL video recordings of evidence given by CARDINAL witnesses during the trial of PERSON in GPE in DATE , that of the writer ORG on the conditions of detention in ORG in GPE and that of PERSON , former Chairman of the ORG des droits de l'Homme ( Human Rights League ) , on the conditions in GPE , near GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , which focused on the transport of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor , with the President 's authorisation and on the basis of the documents in the file , about events preceding that transport , in particular those connected with the organisation of the transport of CARDINAL DATE , which was mentioned in the judgment whereby the applicant was committed for trial but not in the indictment . The applicant 's lawyer immediately filed written submissions seeking to have a formal note of these matters added to the record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , CARDINAL of the civil parties ' lawyers , published a press release revealing a distant family tie between the President of ORG and some of the persons whom the applicant was accused of deporting . He criticised the President for failing to report the fact that the mother and CARDINAL sisters of his aunt by marriage had been part of the DATE transport .", "CARDINAL . No application for the judge to withdraw was filed , however , either by the civil parties or by the defence , because LAW only provides for that possibility if the judge is a blood relative or a relative by marriage of CARDINAL of the parties up to the degree of second cousin inclusive , which was not so in the instant case . The President of ORG announced that he could not even remember the name of his uncle 's wife , and that his uncle had died when he was a child . He did not consider it necessary to withdraw from the proceedings of his own motion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took formal note at the applicant 's request that the public prosecutor had questioned him on DATE , with the authorisation of the President of the ORG , about events preceding the transport of CARDINAL DATE in respect of which the applicant had been indicted in ORG judgment and , in particular , about the organisation of the transport of DATE , which had not been mentioned in the indictment .", "CARDINAL . In another interlocutory judgment delivered on DATE ( not produced ) , however , it refused to allow an application by some of the civil parties for a formal note to be made in the record that those questions were directly connected with the facts mentioned in the indictment in relation to the applicant 's powers . It noted that it was not its task , \u201c if it wished to avoid prejudging the merits of the case and thereby infringing the provisions of LAW , to rule on any direct relationship that might exist between these facts and those referred to in the indictment with regard to PERSON powers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( not produced ) ORG dismissed the applicant 's application of DATE for further inquiries into the facts to be made with a view to producing the whole of the police intendant 's archives in court , on the ground that , in view of the evidence taken at the hearing , the requested measure did not appear necessary for establishing the truth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer applied to have added to the file a copy of the criminal complaint that he had just lodged against Mr PERSON , the chairman of CARDINAL of the civil - party associations , on the basis of LAW of LAW , which prohibited publication before a final judicial decision of comments intended to exert pressure with a view to swaying a trial court 's decision . He criticised Mr GPE for the content of a number of interviews he had given concerning the revelation of the family tie between some of the victims and the President of ORG , to whom PERSON had imputed bias in the defendant 's favour , and impugned the fact that only disciplinary proceedings had been brought by the public prosecutor 's office against Mr PERSON 's son , who had made the revelation in DATE .", "DATE . The proceedings were adjourned from DATE , following the death of the applicant 's wife .", "CARDINAL . In a further interlocutory judgment ( of DATE , not produced ) ORG dismissed an application by the applicant for a question to be put as to whether he knew of a concerted NORP plan to exterminate the NORP and whether he was prepared to participate in such a plan , on the ground that such a question was included among those intended to establish whether he was guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity .", "CARDINAL . It also refused to allow a subsidiary question to be put as to whether the applicant 's resignation , which would have curtailed his Resistance activities , would have changed the system for the extermination of NORP in GPE , on the ground that as it was not possible to assert a legal interest , there was no reason to raise the question of his resignation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a CARDINAL-page judgment delivered after deliberations lasting TIME , ORG , replying to CARDINAL questions , found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting the unlawful arrest and false imprisonment of NORP deported in the transports of DATE , DATE , and DATE and DATE , offences that constituted crimes against humanity . He was acquitted of the charges of aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and stripped of his civil , civic and family rights for DATE . In a judgment of DATE ( not produced ) ORG ruled on the civil claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law against his conviction and on DATE he filed further pleadings containing CARDINAL grounds of appeal , CARDINAL of which referred expressly to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a telegram of CARDINAL DATE ORG at ORG requested that the applicant be notified of his obligation to surrender to custody prior to the hearing in ORG scheduled for DATE . Notice thereof was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG of ORG an application for exemption from the obligation to surrender to custody , which he withdrew on DATE , making a fresh application to ORG . On DATE ORG ruled that it had no jurisdiction to make such an order . The applicant appealed on points of law . On DATE he again applied to ORG for exemption from the obligation to surrender to custody . He relied on LAW , his age ( DATE ) and his state of health .", "DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG first dealt with an application by the applicant for a declaration that LAW should be deemed null and void by virtue of LAW . It said :", "\u201c Although the provisions of LAW ... have been incorporated into the NORP legal system in accordance with LAW and although the courts have jurisdiction to determine , in an individual case , whether a statutory provision conforms with the requirements of the LAW , it is still necessary for that provision to serve as the basis on which the case is submitted to them .", "In the instant case LAW gives ORG jurisdiction only to deal with a specific matter of judicial administration , namely applications for exemption from the obligation to surrender to custody .", "The task of enforcing the obligation to surrender to custody lies exclusively with ORG , as it alone can decide what consequences shall flow from a failure to surrender to custody . It is therefore ORG task to rule on applications for LAW not to be applied to cases submitted to it and , where it has allowed such an application , to decide not to declare that the applicant has forfeited his right of appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to dismiss the application for exemption from the obligation to surrender to custody , holding that , in view of the length of the sentence imposed , the security provided by the applicant seemed inadequate ; that the medical certificate he had produced did not indicate a significant deterioration in his state of health since the expert opinion of DATE ; and that his state of health did not appear to preclude detention in a hospital unit , the arrangements for which were a matter for the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not surrender to custody and left GPE to take refuge in GPE . However , the NORP authorities ordered him to leave GPE , on a date not indicated in the case file .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , after a public hearing during which the applicant 's lawyers submitted their observations on his grounds of appeal , ORG held that the applicant had forfeited his right to appeal against ORG judgment of DATE , pursuant to LAW , on the ground that \u201c the appellant , who [ had been ] sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE , [ had ] not surrendered to custody and [ had ] not been exempted from that obligation \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
