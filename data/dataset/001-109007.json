ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and claimed asylum DATE on the basis of his fear of General PERSON ( a warlord of NORP ethnicity also referred to as \u201c General PERSON \u201d who currently holds the position of the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of ORG , President PERSON ) , his commanders and their sons . The applicant claimed that his father had worked as a local police commissioner in Saripool province in northern GPE and as an adviser to General PERSON ( another warlord of NORP ethnicity who is considered to be General PERSON \u2019s rival ) . The applicant claimed that in DATE , with his father \u2019s assistance , General PERSON had helped the ORG attack General PERSON thereby killing many of his commanders and removing General PERSON from his position as the dominant power holder in the central area of northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed that , in DATE , he had been arrested by the ORG and then released after the payment of a bribe .", "CARDINAL . Most significantly , the applicant claimed that , after he had been reappointed as military commander of most of the northern provinces of GPE in DATE , General PERSON had arrested and ill - treated the applicant and his father . The applicant had managed to escape but General PERSON had killed his father . The applicant had fled GPE in fear not only of General PERSON but also his troops and the sons of the commanders who had previously been killed in DATE by General PERSON . He claimed that , while General PERSON had security in GPE as a member of the new NORP Government , in contrast he would have no similar protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused the applicant \u2019s asylum application . The applicant appealed against the refusal of his asylum claim claiming that his return to GPE would violate , inter alia , ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a determination of the DATE , his appeal was allowed by an Adjudicator at the then ORG ( \u201c IAA \u201d ) who found that the applicant \u2019s account of events had been consistent and that the applicant was a credible witness . The Adjudicator accepted that his father had been a high - ranking member of the military and that the applicant and his father had both faced difficulties and suffered ill - treatment in GPE as a result of his father \u2019s political opinion and activities for General PERSON . The Adjudicator found that , given the objective country information and the fact that the applicant \u2019s father had been a conspicuous high - ranking officer , the applicant would be at risk in GPE ( the capital of GPE in northern GPE and the most important NORP city in GPE ) from General PERSON and that the NORP authorities would not be able to offer him adequate protection there . The Adjudicator also stated that , given the general insecurity and lawlessness of local warlords , he was minded to believe that there was , albeit marginally , a likelihood that the applicant would also be at risk in GPE . Finally , he found that , even if no such risk arose in GPE , given the applicant \u2019s age and the general circumstances there it would be unduly harsh to expect him to relocate there upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG subsequently sought permission to appeal to the then ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG allowed the Secretary of ORG \u2019s appeal and found that the ORG findings on internal flight had been unsustainable . In coming to that conclusion , the ORG had before it a report prepared by PERSON , an expert on GPE , which had predicated the applicant \u2019s safety in GPE on the basis of his ability to maintain a low profile there . PERSON had considered that , while it was not possible to establish with certainty that the applicant would be targeted by his father \u2019s enemies , the applicant would have to take that possibility seriously . PERSON had concluded that it was unlikely that the applicant would experience a serious threat from General PERSON or his political party but had considered that \u201c some local commanders might [ have an interest in him ] , depending on the past actions of [ the applicant \u2019s ] father and especially if it was not possible to target the father directly , because he is already dead or because he has sought refuge elsewhere . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After examining PERSON report , the ORG found that \u201c as the son of a person whose father was involved with General PERSON , the risk DATE is very low unless General PERSON was unable to exact revenge on his father . \u201d Due to the fact that the applicant \u2019s father had already been killed by General PERSON , the ORG considered that revenge had been exacted , and the applicant would not therefore be at risk .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , noting that General PERSON himself was resident in GPE , the ORG considered that the applicant could also safely internally relocate to GPE where single young men would be relatively safe . The ORG found that the possibility of an attack upon the applicant by General PERSON or his followers in GPE was \u201c remote \u201d and that anyone in GPE on General PERSON \u2019s behalf would not be interested in pursuing his former enemies because they were defending his office and leading members of his political party in the city .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the ORG did not accept that there was any evidence that General PERSON or his commanders would be interested in pursuing the family members of his former enemies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was refused permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was detained at ORG pending his removal from GPE . Removal directions to GPE were cancelled for unknown reasons . On DATE , the applicant was admitted to hospital before being released to his home address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted further representations to the Secretary of ORG based upon a report dated DATE by Dr PERSON , an expert on GPE . That report summarised the background to and the security situation prevailing in GPE at that time . In respect of the risk from General PERSON , the report stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... the primary risk to S.S arises from the fact that his father may have facilitated the successful entry of General PERSON into GPE through the provision of strategic , logistics and technical support , drawing on his experience gained while working within ORG of the former ORG of DATE . General PERSON may , therefore , have good reason to continue to feel aggrieved over the actions of ORG \u2019s father and may , subject to considerations of his own power and influence within the current NORP government , have an interest in targeting S.S. , notwithstanding that FAC \u2019s father may already have been killed by his militia . It is important to note , in this regard , that General PERSON has a reputation for serious human rights abuses and for particular ruthlessness . He would , therefore , have no hesitation in killing S.S. if other considerations did not dictate otherwise . It should be noted in this regard that , although President PERSON has maintained a certain distance from General PERSON because of his human rights record , ORG has sought respectability and this has been rewarded through various defence - related posts of a largely honorary nature . It is therefore difficult to assess whether General PERSON would risk undermining this by actively seeking ORG It should nonetheless be noted that his decision to imprison CARDINAL of ORG prisoners , in DATE , in conditions which were likely to lead to their deaths and to do so under the watch of GPE forces showed little regard for his international reputation . It would also not be difficult for General PERSON to arrange for ORG to be killed without this being traced back to him .", "On the other hand , some of his commanders may be influenced solely by their desire to avenge [ General ] PERSON \u2019s treachery and , while [ General ] PERSON may be too well protected to represent an easy target , may see an opportunity through S.S. \u2019s inability to protect himself , to act out their revenge . It should be stressed that it would be difficult for FAC to escape detection if he was being actively targeted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report commented that the applicant would be entirely vulnerable in GPE if General PERSON or his supporters were to actively target him . In addition , the report commented upon the ORG \u2019s findings of CARDINAL DATE and did not agree that PERSON report had necessarily indicated that the risk to ORG was a low one . The report stated :", "\u201c ... it should be noted that there has been , for DATE , a pronounced labelling process in GPE so that people have been identified with members of their families who have taken particular political positions or brought harm to others by virtue of the power they wielded . The individual is thus identified by association with his relatives and it is common practice for revenge attacks to be undertaken against male relatives if the original perpetrator of the action is no longer alive or to be found . It is also important to note that the desire to take revenge can pass through the generations , particularly if the original action which led to such a desire was especially serious . Given that the technical , logistics and strategic support provided by ORG father may have been of significant benefit in enabling General PERSON to capture and subsequently facilitate the entry of the ORG into GPE , those who may seek to avenge his role may regard it as sufficiently serious to take revenge against FAC , as his son . I do not regard paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON report as necessarily indicating that the risk to ORG of being actively targeted by some local commanders is a low one . As he notes , the wishes of such commanders to actively target FAC is dependent on the past actions of his father . As these actions were of a potentially very serious nature , the risk to ORG may be a high one . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report also set out that , in Dr PERSON \u2019s view , ORG may be at risk from the ORG on account of the CARDINAL of ORG fighters who had died in GPE after General PERSON had withdrawn his allegiance from the ORG . However , PERSON clarified that the possibility of a revenge attack upon the applicant from the ORG had to be set against the fact that the ORG had not killed him when he claimed that they had arrested him and imprisoned him during their period of control of FAC DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused the applicant \u2019s representations as not amounting to a fresh asylum claim because some of the points he had raised had already been considered in his earlier claim and the remaining points would not have created a realistic prospect of success before an immigration judge . It was not accepted that the applicant had shown that the ORG would have the motivation , means or opportunity to target him in GPE , an area outside of their control , particularly in light of the fact that they had not harmed him when they had detained him in DATE .", "CARDINAL . It was further not accepted that General PERSON would still be interested in actively targeting the applicant due to , inter alia , the manner of his escape from detention in DATE ; the passage of DATE since his arrest by General PERSON ; the fact that General PERSON would now have other priorities ; and the fact that General PERSON had already gained revenge by killing the applicant \u2019s father . Furthermore , it was noted that the ORG had , DATE , assessed the risk to the applicant as low and it was considered that the risk to him DATE would be even lower .", "CARDINAL . In addition , relying on the reasoning of the ORG determination , the Secretary of ORG did not accept that , even if General PERSON was interested in the applicant , he would be able to harm him in GPE . In particular , as General PERSON reportedly lived in GPE and was able to protect himself there , there was no reason to suggest that the applicant would not be able to do the same . It was therefore considered that the applicant had failed to show that his circumstances were more likely to cause him to be harmed than any other ordinary citizen .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it was not accepted that the applicant would be destitute in GPE as he was no more vulnerable than any other citizen and had shown great resourcefulness in GPE where he had picked up transferable skills which would be of benefit to him upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to grant the applicant permission to apply for judicial review , stating that it was not arguable that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision not to treat the applicant \u2019s further submissions as a fresh claim was unlawful or irrational , or that those submissions had not been given anxious scrutiny .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , set up to consider unresolved asylum cases , gave further consideration to the applicant \u2019s case and decided that it would not be appropriate for the applicant to be granted leave to remain in the GPE bearing in mind , inter alia , his age ( because it was not unreasonable to expect the applicant at DATE to adapt to life back in GPE ) ; the fact that , even though he had been in GPE for DATE , he had been without valid leave to remain throughout that period ; his lack of strong ties or family in GPE ; his past failure to maintain contact with immigration authorities ; and the lack of any compassionate or compelling circumstances in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG set removal directions to GPE for the applicant scheduled to take place on DATE . Those removal directions were deferred when , on DATE , ORG granted the applicant an injunction to prevent his removal from GPE , pending the hearing of his renewed application for judicial review at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused permission to apply for judicial review further to the renewed permission hearing , thus discharging the injunction . ORG noted that there was no new evidence other than PERSON report which was of a qualified nature and demonstrated only the conditional nature of the risk to which the applicant would be subject in GPE . In that regard , he stated :", "\u201c In particular , it was only a risk if General PERSON or his senior supporters decided to target the [ applicant ] in GPE . [ The applicant \u2019s counsel ] relied on the passage of time since the [ ORG ] \u2019s decision , but it is significant that there is nothing in Dr PERSON \u2019s report to suggest that what was said in the [ ORG ] \u2019s decision about the risk being low , unless the ORG had been unable to exact revenge on the father , was changed . What PERSON states is that he does not accept PERSON report as necessarily indicating that the risk of actively being targeted by local commanders is a low one , and the risk of being targeted may be a high one . These are examples of the qualified nature of his report .", "Given those qualifications , and the limited extent to which the recent report departs from the earlier expert report submitted on behalf of the claimant , I do not consider that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision that there was no realistic prospect of success before the ORG ... was ORG unreasonable or otherwise flawed on public law grounds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an application before the ORG and requested an interim measure under LAW to stop his removal to GPE the following day .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Acting President of the Section to which the application was allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and to indicate to the Government that the applicant should not be expelled until further notice .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , on DATE , DATE after the applicant lodged his application before the ORG , he applied to ORG for an injunction to prevent his removal and permission to appeal against ORG refusal to grant permission to apply for judicial review . On DATE , ORG refused his application for an urgent injunction to stop his removal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of his application , the applicant \u2019s representatives had obtained a supplementary expert report from PERSON dated DATE . PERSON set out examples of human rights abuses committed by General PERSON and concluded that , if he sought to avenge the actions of an individual who had acted against his interests , he would have no hesitation in killing him or members of his family .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report further set out the power struggle between General PERSON and General PERSON and the significance of General PERSON \u2019s actions in removing General PERSON from his position of power in DATE . The report went on to state :", "\u201c Whilst there is no objective documentation to establish whether ORG \u2019s father was instrumental in [ General ] PERSON \u2019s successful entry into ORG in DATE , any such involvement , if it was significant to the final outcome would , in my view , be sufficient to justify a very considerable desire on [ General ] PERSON \u2019s part for revenge . Given this , I would regard it as a reasonable possibility that [ General ] PERSON would seek to take revenge against S.S. , even though revenge has already been exacted against the father .", "...", "... it should be noted that ORG has provided evidence of a direct link , by virtue of his position as the son of his father , to a serious grievance which [ General ] PERSON will inevitably hold against [ General ] PERSON . While it is never possible to provide evidence that the potential perpetrator of targeted violence will opt to give expression to a grievance that he hold , there is a reasonable probability in this case , based on the severity of the original grievance that , subject to ORG \u2019s father having played a significant role in facilitating the entry of [ General ] PERSON into GPE in DATE , [ General ] PERSON would have an interest in targeting S.S. , who is clearly identified with a specific grievance , albeit indirectly through his father .", "... it is not my experience , in monitoring developments in GPE , that the passage of time will necessarily lessen the desire to exact vengeance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also considered that , in PERSON view , the applicant would be particularly exposed to targeted violence from the ORG if , as was likely , he was unable to afford accommodation in GPE . It further stated that the ORG may have an additional interest in the applicant given his association with General PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for permission to appeal on the papers , taking the view that the supplementary expert report did not undermine ORG decision . ORG stated that :", "\u201c The issue for me is whether Beatson J , in the light of the information then ( and arguably now ) available was wrong to refuse permission to review judicially the SSHD [ Secretary of ORG for ORG ] \u2019s decision to certify .", "Unfortunately , to my mind , PERSON latest report does not truly seem to be providing new material , post dating or undermining PERSON decision . Rather this proposed appeal is an attempt to reargue the material available before ORG in a different form . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed his renewed application for permission to appeal further to an oral hearing . PERSON , with whom both PERSON and ORG agreed , stated that he had given both PERSON first and supplementary reports anxious scrutiny but did not consider that the supplementary report was any different in substance to his first report . He stated that :", "\u201c It is true that later in the report ... PERSON uses the expression \u201c reasonable probability \u201d rather than \u201c reasonable possibility \u201d , but , looking at the substance of the matter , PERSON is in my view doing no more than to repeat in different language the assessment of the risk that he had proffered in his first report . He relies upon no new developments in GPE from which it is to be inferred that the enthusiasm of General PERSON to exact vengeance upon the applicant for the activities of his father is likely to have increased over time , rather than , as would perhaps be expected , to have waned as other priorities and imperatives have emerged .", "...", "In my judgment PERSON second report contains no material which could properly lead this court to reach a conclusion different from that reached by Beatson J. \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE , provides a right of appeal against an immigration decision made by the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL . Appeals in asylum , immigration and nationality matters were , until DATE , heard by ORG at the ORG . LAW DATE provided that , with the permission of the ORG , a party to an appeal could apply to the ORG against an ORG determination on a point of law . LAW DATE provided that where the ORG had determined an appeal under LAW , a party to the appeal could bring a further appeal on a point of law to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .

In the country guidance determination of TIME and Others ( GPE \u2013 PERSON - i - Islami ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE , the ORG held , inter alia , that , subject to an individual \u2019s personal circumstances , it was unlikely to be unduly harsh ( or unreasonable ) to expect them to relocate to GPE if they had established a real risk of serious harm in ( and restricted to ) areas outside GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the country guidance determination of ORG ( ORG \u2013 PERSON - i - Islami \u2013 risk ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE , the ORG held , amongst other matters , that :", "\u201c Where the risk to a particular appellant is confined to his home area , internal relocation to GPE is in general available . It would not be unduly harsh to expect an appellant with no individual risk factors outside his home area to live in GPE and assist in the rebuilding of his country .", "If an appellant establishes a wider risk , extending beyond the home area , internal relocation is not necessarily available and sufficiency of protection will depend on his individual circumstances and characteristics . In particular", "( a ) internal relocation outside GPE is unlikely to provide sufficiency of protection as the areas outside GPE remain under the control of local warlords , and the population is suspicious of strangers ; and", "( b ) the safety of internal relocation to GPE is a question of fact based on the particular history of an individual appellant and of the warlord or faction known to be seeking to harm him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In the country guidance determination of ORG ( LAW ) : Indiscriminate violence ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , promulgated on DATE , the then ORG held that there was not in GPE such a high level of indiscriminate violence that substantial grounds existed for believing that a civilian would , solely by being present there , face a real risk which threatens the civilian \u2019s life or person , such as to entitle that person to the grant of humanitarian protection , pursuant to ORG ) and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides as follows :", "\u201c When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim .

As regards the scrutiny of fresh asylum claims and the power of the courts to review such scrutiny , ORG in PERSON ( ORG ) v SSHD [ CARDINAL ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) has held :", "\u201c Accordingly , a court when reviewing a decision of the Secretary of ORG as to whether a fresh claim exists must address the following matters . First , has the Secretary of ORG asked himself the correct question ? The question is not whether the Secretary of ORG himself thinks that the new claim is a good one or should succeed , but whether there is a realistic prospect of an adjudicator , applying the rule of anxious scrutiny , thinking that the applicant will be exposed to a real risk of persecution on return ... The Secretary of ORG of course can , and no doubt logically should , treat his own view of the merits as a starting - point for that enquiry ; but it is only a starting point in the consideration of a question that is distinctly different from the exercise of the Secretary of ORG making up his own mind . Second , in addressing that question , both in respect of the evaluation of the facts and in respect of the legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts , has the Secretary of ORG satisfied the requirement of anxious scrutiny ? If the court can not be satisfied that the answer to both of those questions is in the affirmative it will have to grant an application for review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Given the breakdown in the traditional social fabric of the country caused by DATE of war , massive refugee flows , and growing internal migration to urban areas , a case - by - case analysis will , nevertheless , be necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE Guidelines further stated :", "\u201c The well - established practice of blood feuds is rooted in traditional NORP culture . Blood feuds are conflicts between opposing families , tribes and armed factions , and are often initiated in reaction to perceived violations to the honour of women , property rights , and land or water issues . According to the practice , individuals associated with the family or tribe of the individual seen as the wrongdoer are targeted by the victim \u2019s tribe or family members . Revenge is sought through killing , physically injuring or publicly shaming the perpetrator or individuals related by family or tribe .", "Blood feuds can be long - running conflicts , lasting for generations , with a cycle of retaliatory violence between parties . Solving a dispute through a formal justice mechanism does not normally put an end to a blood feud . Particularly among NORP , blood feuds can be settled through a formal decision of a jirga \u2013 generally an all - male community - based dispute resolution mechanism . A peaceful compromise , such as a bad dadab marriage , may sometimes prevent a dispute from spiralling into a blood feud .", "In light of the foregoing , ORG considers that persons involved in , or targeted because of , a blood feud may , depending on the circumstances of the individual case , be at risk on account of membership of a particular social group .
