Since a copy of that certificate had not been made available to ORG , the second applicant was considered to be in breach of electoral law in that he had failed to inform it of a change in his employment . As to the second applicant 's membership in the ORG , the ORG noted that he had been in possession of an appropriate document and had enclosed it with his complaint to the ORG , but he had only done so on DATE , that is after the expiry of the registration period on DATE . As a new ground for refusal , the ORG found that the second applicant had printed certain campaign materials which had not been paid for from his election fund .", "CARDINAL .

The [ first - instance ] court correctly determined that he should have indicated , as his current position , that of professor ... Because it is precisely that position which defines , in the spirit of the labour law , the substance of the employment contract between [ Skuratov ] and the educational institution , which corresponds to its organisation chart and which determines the nature of his professional duties ... At the same time , the fact of acting in another position may only be of a temporary nature , that is until the person has been approved in that position or has been reassigned to his old one ...", "ORG also considers that , as the right of a candidate to indicate his party membership and status in his application form carries a corresponding obligation to submit a document confirming that information ... officially certified by the standing governing body of the political party , such document can not be replaced by the list of that party 's candidates in single - mandate constituencies signed and sealed by the Chairman of the party 's central committee and addressed to ORG ...", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a failure to submit documents required for registration of a candidate under that law is a ground to refuse registration of that candidate ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

[ T]he first - instance court was also justified in referring to the fact that neither the Labour Code nor the Graduate and Post - graduate LAW provided that the office of acting head of a department was a permanent one ...", "As ORG correctly determined in its judgment , the right to apply to a court with an application for annulment of a candidate 's registration ... is vested ... in political parties and electoral blocs ...

As to the specific electoral rights and interests of the claimant ( who had also submitted and registered a federal roll of candidates to ORG ) , in the instant case they are affected by the inclusion of the candidate Skuratov in the federal roll of candidates of the ORG because that candidate had not complied with the formal requirements that applied in an equal measure to all candidates , political parties and electoral blocs and made possible the exercise of the right to stand for election . Such interests of the claimant are envisaged in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , according to which members of ORG of GPE are elected by citizens of GPE in general , equal and direct elections ; political parties and electoral blocs stand for election to the State PERSON members on equal grounds in accordance with the procedure established by the present federal law ... \u201d ( original emphasis )", "CARDINAL .
