SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading punishment;Inhuman punishment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 13+3 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 3 - Prohibition of torture;Degrading punishment;Inhuman punishment)", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . He is serving a life sentence in the PERSON prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was taken to a police station . In the course of the night he was questioned about the violent death of his stepfather . He was tested for alcohol in his blood and biological samples were taken from him . A police investigator accused the applicant of murder . The applicant was suspected of having stabbed his stepfather CARDINAL times on DATE , as a result of which the latter had died . At the request of the public prosecutor the applicant was formally arrested at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE a judge of ORG remanded the applicant in custody with effect from DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed a complaint by the applicant against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the investigation the applicant , repeatedly and in the presence of his lawyer , admitted having stabbed his stepfather and described the circumstances . He later requested that his action be qualified as causing bodily harm as he had not intended to kill the victim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor indicted the applicant before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of murder . With reference to LAW , LAW and DATE , LAW CARDINAL(c ) , LAW and LAW of LAW of DATE , the first - instance court sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release on parole .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of statements by CARDINAL witnesses , the opinions of CARDINAL medical experts and a forensic institute , and the documentary evidence available , the court established that the applicant had deliberately stabbed his stepfather CARDINAL times with a knife with the intention of killing him . That action had been prompted by the applicant \u2019s aggressive behaviour while in a state of intoxication and his abnormally antisocial personality .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that at the pre - trial stage the applicant had admitted , several times and in the presence of his lawyer , the offence imputed to him and had described the relevant facts in detail . However , at the main hearing he denied having killed the victim . The court held , for the reasons which were set out in detail in its judgment , that the evidence available clearly indicated that he had committed the offence . He had done so in a particularly contemptible manner as he had attacked the victim unexpectedly and had taken advantage of the latter \u2019s incapacity to defend himself as a result of heavy intoxication .", "CARDINAL . According to the expert opinion on which the court relied , the applicant was pathologically aggressive . He lacked any self - control and there were practically no prospects of his re - socialisation at that time . The probability that he would re - offend in the future was extremely high .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been convicted of different offences CARDINAL times previously . Those convictions included a rape and a murder . He had committed the second murder DATE after his conditional release from prison , where he had been serving a sentence imposed for a similar offence . ORG concluded that the statutory conditions for imposing a life sentence without the right to be released on parole were therefore met .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG quashed the DATE prison sentence which ORG had imposed on the applicant on DATE , as well as all consecutive decisions concerning that punishment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted that he had made the initial statements admitting the offence while in a state of a shock and fatigue resulting from his intoxication , and that the police had exposed him to psychological pressure prior to the interrogation . There existed no direct evidence proving that he had committed the offence . The applicant further argued that the first - instance court had not established all the relevant facts and had committed errors of law . The evidence obtained did not suffice for his conviction . No reconstruction of the crime had been carried out , the reference in the expert opinion as to an injury to the victim \u2019s hand and the applicant \u2019s social and psychological profile were confusing . The applicant further argued that ORG had failed to hear the children who had found the blood - stained knife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment to the extent that it concerned the sentence imposed . It then imposed a term of life imprisonment on the applicant and held , with reference to LAW , that the possibility of his release on parole was to be excluded . It did so because ORG had incorrectly referred , in the operative part of its judgment , to the subparagraph of LAW which allowed for such a penalty .", "CARDINAL . In all other respects ORG endorsed the conclusions reached at first instance . It considered the applicant \u2019s arguments irrelevant . In particular , in DATE and DATE the applicant had admitted CARDINAL times , in the presence of his lawyer , to have committed the offence . In that context he had indicated manifold details which could only have been known to the perpetrator , for example that he had taken the knife from the flat where he and his mother lived , and where he had hidden it after the incident . The applicant had also described the T - shirt he had worn and such a T - shirt had been found hidden in the applicant \u2019s flat stained with the victim \u2019s blood . That blood could not have stemmed from an injury on the victim \u2019s hand , as claimed by the applicant , as the experts had excluded such an injury . The applicant had also indicated a motive for his actions .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that ORG had gathered all relevant evidence with a view to establishing the facts of the case and had correctly applied the law when convicting the applicant . The statutory prerequisites for imposing a life sentence without the possibility of release on parole were met .", "CARDINAL . The appeal court also quashed the DATE prison sentence which ORG had imposed on the applicant on DATE , as well as all relevant consecutive decisions relating to that punishment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . As in the appeal proceedings , he challenged the establishment of the facts and the conclusions reached in the first - instance and appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( cassation chamber ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The decision stated that in proceedings in an appeal on points of law courts could only examine errors of law allegedly committed at lower levels of jurisdiction . However , no such arguments had been put forward by the applicant . The interrogations at the pre - trial stage in the course of which the applicant had admitted the offence had been carried out in accordance with LAW and in the presence of his lawyer . ORG had therefore been entitled to read out those statements at the main hearing before it .", "CARDINAL . As to the sentence imposed , the applicant had not raised any specific arguments in his appeal on points of law . In any event , the lower courts had correctly concluded that , given his earlier convictions , the CARDINAL - strike rule set out in LAW was applicable to his case . Similarly , the lower courts had correctly exercised their discretionary power under LAW ) of LAW when excluding the possibility of his release on parole .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to ORG . He indicated that it was directed against the abovementioned ordinary courts at CARDINAL levels which had dealt with his case , and at the prosecuting authorities involved . In the summary of his complaint the applicant indicated that it concerned his conviction and the sentence imposed . He alleged a breach of his rights under LAW and the Convention . He complained , inter alia , that he had been detained unlawfully and that the criminal proceedings against him had been flawed . He explicitly alleged a breach of LAW ) and ( c ) and LAW , LAW , DATE and CARDINAL(d ) , and ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW , as well as LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant joined to his appeal the CARDINAL ordinary courts\u2019 decisions in his case and requested that ORG quash them . He indicated that he was indigent and asked ORG to appoint a lawyer to represent him in the constitutional proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE a ORG judge informed the applicant that in his complaint he had not specified an outcome he sought to obtain from ORG which would be enforceable given the powers of that court . As ORG could not deal with such a submission , it had to be set aside pursuant to section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered that the applicant be released from pre - trial detention and start serving a DATE prison term which had been imposed by a penal order issued by ORG on DATE in a different set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be released from pre - trial detention and start serving a DATE prison term which had been imposed in a different set of proceedings by ORG .", "CARDINAL . A decision issued by a higher judicial officer of ORG on DATE stated that the period of the applicant \u2019s detention from DATE to DATE was to be incorporated into the term of life imprisonment imposed on him . The applicant was further ordered to reimburse to the ORG the costs of his detention during the above period , pursuant to LAW ( a ) of LAW DATE . On DATE the presiding judge of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against that decision . On that basis the PERSON prison administration ordered the applicant , on DATE , to pay the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) in respect of DATE he had spent in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the criminal proceedings , newspapers published several articles about the case in which they implied that the applicant was a brutal offender . The applicant considered that those articles were based on information which the media had obtained from the prosecuting authorities dealing with his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fresh appeal on points of law in respect of the proceedings leading to his conviction .
