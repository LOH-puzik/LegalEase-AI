The Freedom and Democracy Party ( \u00d6ZDEP ) was founded on DATE . Its constitution was lodged with ORG DATE . Its programme included the following passages .", "\u201c ... Following the war of \u2018 Liberation\u2019 waged jointly by NORP , NORP and other national minorities , the Sultanate was abolished in GPE and the Republic proclaimed .", "The sole aim of the LOC has been to establish national sovereignty . Efforts to unite GPE with LOC have come to nothing . GPE has not succeeded in lifting itself out of mediocrity .", "From DATE of the Republic , certain parties have had a monopoly on power along with the collaboration of civil and military bureaucrats .", "In order to preserve that monopoly , the policy of those in power has been to refuse to recognise the existence of the NORP people and to ignore its most legitimate rights .", "The dominant \u2018 Turkish\u2019 philosophy has been maintained up to the present day , overriding the most natural rights and claims of the NORP people , by means of militaristic and chauvinistic propaganda and a policy of exile and destruction . State policy , based on a capitalist system designed to oppress minorities \u2013 particularly NORP minorities , but even NORP ones \u2013 has been pursued in the name of modernisation and westernisation .", "Owing to this policy , which colours the political , economic and social aspects of GPE \u2019s territorial integrity , there is no possibility of this monopoly of ORG power being brought to an end . That power runs counter to the interests of the vast majority of the population .", "It uses force to impose the present situation on the people in order to preserve its economic interests . Thus , it blocks the way to any democratic process aimed at protecting the interests of NORP and NORP workers .", "ORG proposes to create a system ruled by peace and fraternity in which our peoples will be entitled to self - determination .", "ORG uses political , democratic and ideological means to combat all fascist , fundamentalist , chauvinistic and racist movements or organisations hindering solidarity , unity and brotherhood between peoples .", "Both in domestic and foreign policy , the aim of ORG is to protect the interests of our peoples and those of all workers . \u00d6ZDEP is the guarantor of the cultural , occupational , economic and political values of the various national or religious minorities and of every socio - professional category . It seeks recognition of the right to form a political party .", "Our ORG will guarantee the religious and national minorities the right to worship as they please , to practise their religion freely , to freedom of thought and to respect for their customs , cultures and languages . Every individual will be entitled to use the media , especially radio and television .", "ORG has proposals on how to determine and define the prerequisites for establishing a social order encompassing the NORP and NORP peoples .", "\u00d6ZDEP regards our peoples as the sole owners of the country \u2019s wealth , natural wealth and mineral resources .", "\u00d6ZDEP supports the just and legitimate struggle of the peoples for independence and freedom . It stands by them in this struggle .", "Our ORG proposes the creation of a democratic assembly of representatives of the people elected by universal suffrage . This assembly will represent the interests of the NORP people , the NORP people and any other minority .", "This popular and democratic assembly will have the same powers as the current legislature and will be the guarantor of our peoples\u2019 national sovereignty .", "The media will be the moving force for the consolidation of fraternity and friendship between peoples . They will encourage a better approach to different cultures and languages and will guarantee the national identity of each sector of the population . They will be responsible for ensuring that the political , economic , social and cultural rights of the peoples are recognised .", "There will be no government interference in religious affairs , which will be placed in the hands of the relevant institutions .", "In order to preserve the right to self - determination of oppressed peoples , our ORG will outlaw any form of cultural , military , political or economic aggression .", "ORG is campaigning for the voluntary unification of the NORP and NORP peoples , who participated in the foundation of the country .", "ORG considers that there can be democracy only if the NORP problem is solved . This problem concerns every NORP and GPE who supports freedom and democracy .", "ORG favours a peaceful and democratic solution to the NORP problem , subject to the strict application of international instruments such as LAW , ORG .", "ORG will fully respect the NORP people \u2019s right to self - determination so that a democratic solution based on the self - determination and equality of peoples can be found .", "Currently , our legislation and the manner in which the legal system operates are inherently undemocratic , contrary to fundamental human rights and freedoms and based on class interests . They deny the NORP people an identity and forbid any form of workers\u2019 organisation or association . They are racist and retrograde .", "An order will be established permitting the NORP and NORP peoples and the minorities to develop and enjoy their particular cultures freely . Each people will be entitled to education in its mother tongue , that being an essential prerequisite for the development of a people and a nation .", "Everyone will have the right to basic education in his mother tongue . The education system from primary school to university will be based on education in one \u2019s mother tongue . A person \u2019s mother tongue shall be given precedence in court proceedings ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG at ORG ( \u201c ORG Counsel \u201d ) applied to ORG to have \u00d6ZDEP dissolved on the grounds that it had infringed the principles of LAW and the PERSON on the regulation of political parties . He considered that the content and aims set out in the party \u2019s programme sought to undermine the territorial integrity and secular nature of the ORG and the unity of the nation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG sent ORG application to the Chairman of ORG inviting him to lodge his preliminary observations in defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG \u2019s lawyers filed preliminary written observations and requested a hearing . They argued , inter alia , that the PERSON on the regulation of political parties contained provisions that were contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW . They also maintained that dissolving the party would infringe the provisions of international instruments such as LAW , LAW , LAW and GPE for LOC . They submitted that it was unacceptable to force a political party , on pain of being dissolved , to promote an ideology which conformed to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the ORG proceedings were still pending , a meeting of the founding members of \u00d6ZDEP resolved to dissolve the party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged his submissions on the merits of the case with ORG . Since \u00d6ZDEP had gone into voluntary dissolution , it did not file any submissions on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an order dissolving ORG , notably on the ground that its programme was apt to undermine the territorial integrity of the ORG and the unity of the nation and violated both the LAW and sections CARDINAL(a ) and CARDINAL(a ) and ( b ) of the LAW on the regulation of political parties . The judgment was served on ORG , the Speaker of ORG and ORG . ORG judgment was published in ORG on DATE .", "ORG held , firstly , that , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the regulation of political parties , ORG \u2019s resolution to go into voluntary dissolution did not prevent that court from ruling on the merits of the case as it had been made after the commencement of the proceedings before it .", "As to the merits , ORG began by reiterating the constitutional principles that all persons living on NORP territory , whatever their ethnic origin , formed a whole united by their common culture . The sum of the persons who made up GPE was called the \u201c NORP nation \u201d . The different ethnic groups making up the \u201c NORP nation \u201d were not divided into a majority and minorities . The court reiterated that , under LAW , no political or legal distinction based on ethnic or racial origin could be made between citizens : all NORP nationals , without distinction , could avail themselves of all civil , political and economic rights .", "With particular reference to NORP citizens of NORP origin , ORG held that in every region of GPE such persons enjoyed the same rights as other NORP citizens . That did not mean that the LAW denied the existence of a NORP identity , since citizens of NORP origin were not forbidden to express their NORP identity . The NORP language could be used on all private premises , in workplaces , in the press and in works of art and literature .", "ORG reiterated the principle that everyone was bound to observe the provisions of the LAW even if they did not agree with them . LAW did not preclude the celebration of difference but forbade propaganda based on racial difference and aimed at destroying the constitutional order . It pointed out that by virtue of LAW having a separate language or ethnic origin was not by itself enough for a group to qualify as a minority .", "With regard to the content of ORG \u2019s programme , ORG observed that it was based on the assumption that there was a separate NORP people in GPE with its own culture and language . The NORP were portrayed in the programme as an oppressed people whose democratic rights were being completely ignored . According to ORG , ORG called for a right to self - determination for the NORP and supported their right to wage a \u201c war of independence \u201d . Its stance was similar to that of terrorist organisations and constituted in itself an incitement to insurrection .", "In relation to the principle of secularism , ORG noted that ORG \u2019s programme contained a proposal for the abolition of ORG of the government on the ground that religious affairs should be under the control of the religious institutions themselves . After reiterating what was meant by the principle of secularism , the court said that advocating the abolition of the government ORG amounted to undermining the principle of secularism . It concluded that that aspect of ORG \u2019s programme was contrary to section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the regulation of political parties .", "ORG pointed to the fact that GPE for a LOC condemned racism , ethnic hatred and terrorism and that the GPE LAW guaranteed the inviolability of national frontiers and territorial integrity . It concluded that ORG \u2019s activities were subject , inter alia , to the restrictions referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW and to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c GPE is a democratic , secular and social ORG based on the rule of law , respectful of human rights in a spirit of social peace , national solidarity and justice , adhering to the nationalism of PERSON and resting on the fundamental principles set out in the Preamble . \u201d", "\u201c The State of GPE constitutes with its territory and nation , an indivisible whole .
