THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in the GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , following proceedings held in absentia , ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) convicted a person , calling himself PERSON , of a robbery committed on DATE , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment less the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "At an unspecified date the applicant started a relationship with ORG , who holds both GPE and NORP citizenship and who is the mother of ORG , who was born in DATE from a previous relationship . The father of ORG also holds both GPE and NORP citizenship .", "On DATE , a daughter named PERSON was born of the applicant 's relationship with PERSON .", "On DATE the applicant , who until that moment had resided illegally in the GPE , applied for a residence permit for the purpose of \u201c staying with his GPE partner , PERSON \u201d . When , in this connection , the applicant was asked to sign a declaration stating that he had never had any dealings with the GPE police or the GPE criminal justice authorities ( antecedentenverklaring ) , he stated that he had served a prison sentence in the past , but under a false identity .", "Subsequent verifications disclosed that the applicant had been residing illegally in the GPE since DATE and that , in his various contacts with the police , he had not given his true identity and/or had failed to cooperate in establishing his identity . The applicant was in fact known to the GPE authorities under CARDINAL different identities and , under CARDINAL of them , namely PERSON , he had been convicted of robbery and sentenced to DATE imprisonment on DATE .", "On DATE , the immigration authorities informed the applicant of their intention to reject his request on grounds of his conviction in DATE and illegal residency in the GPE .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant 's request for a residence permit . The Deputy Minister noted that , according to the relevant immigration policy rules , a request for a residence permit for the purpose of staying with a GPE partner could be granted if the alien concerned did not constitute a danger to public peace , public order or national security . Accordingly , admission could be refused on grounds of a criminal conviction for an offence entailing the imposition of an unconditional lengthy prison sentence . As the applicant had been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment in DATE , his request for a residence permit could be rejected . The Deputy Minister further held that this decision did not constitute an interference with the applicant 's family life with PERSON , as it did not deprive him of any residence title . The Deputy Minister lastly considered that no special facts or circumstances existed which could give rise to any positive obligation upon the GPE authorities under LAW grant the applicant 's request for a residence permit , or which showed that there was an obstacle to the exercise of his family life outside of the GPE . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision .", "On DATE the applicant and PERSON married and , on DATE , the applicant recognised his daughter PERSON .", "On DATE , the applicant was given the opportunity to make oral comments on his application for a residence permit before an official commission ( ambtelijke commissie ) . On this occasion , he stated inter alia that he had resided in the GPE since DATE , that in DATE he had been arrested , detained and released after DATE , and that owing to his then poor knowledge of NORP he had not understood what had then happened to him . He further stated that he had never been convicted or appeared before a court , and that until recently he had been unaware of his conviction in DATE . He further stated that ORG was expecting their second child , that she was receiving social security benefits on the grounds of an PERCENT incapacity for work , and that she did not wish to go to GPE . ORG , who attended this hearing , stated that since DATE the applicant had had no dealings with the GPE police .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected the applicant 's objection of DATE on the basis of the legal rules applicable to aliens seeking admission to the GPE to stay with a GPE non - marital partner . The Deputy Minister considered at the outset that , on grounds of the prison sentence imposed in DATE , the applicant could be declared an undesirable alien ( ongewenst vreemdeling ) under LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) . This had not been done at the material time , because the Deputy Minister had been unaware of the fact that the applicant was illegally residing in the GPE . In view of the time that had elapsed since the applicant 's conviction , the Deputy Minister decided , after balancing all the interests involved , not to declare the applicant an undesirable alien . This decision did not , however , imply that the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant no longer posed a danger to public order . The Deputy Minister further considered that , in the relevant immigration rules , the balancing of public order interests and the interests of family reunification / formation had already been made in abstracto , in that a residence permit could be refused to persons , like the applicant , who had been convicted of a serious offence for which they had been sentenced to an unconditional lengthy term of imprisonment . The Deputy Minister found that the applicant 's personal interests did not outweigh those of public order . On this point , the Deputy Minister took into account that the applicant had been illegally residing in the GPE when he developed his family life with PERSON and , later , with their daughter PERSON . The fact that the applicant had not committed any criminal offence since DATE and has responsibility towards his family did not , according to the Deputy Minister , create an obligation to grant him a residence permit .", "On DATE , a second child named PERSON was born to the applicant and PERSON .", "The applicant 's subsequent appeal to ORG of The Hague was accepted on DATE . It held that the Deputy Minister had incorrectly determined the applicant 's request on the basis of the immigration rules for foreign non - martial partners of GPE nationals and that , for this reason alone , the impugned decision should be quashed as the applicant was married to a GPE national .", "It did , however , reject the applicant 's argument that the Deputy Minister had incorrectly found that the applicant had been convicted of a serious offence for which he had been sentenced to an unconditional lengthy prison sentence , within the meaning of the relevant immigration policy rules . It further considered that , although the Deputy Minister had taken this into account in the decision not to declare the applicant an undesirable alien , the Deputy Minister had failed to take into consideration , in balancing the GPE public order interests against the applicant 's personal interests , the time that had elapsed since DATE , and the fact that the applicant had not committed any other offences since then . As the immigration policy rules stipulated that a residence permit \u201c could \u201d be rejected on grounds of a criminal conviction , these elements should be taken into account . It did , however , add that , in balancing the interests involved , the Deputy Minister could also take into consideration the fact that , owing to the applicant 's use of aliases and his hiding from the authorities , the prison sentence imposed in DATE had not been executed . It could thus be held against the applicant . The court therefore quashed the decision of DATE and ordered the Deputy Minister to take a new decision on the applicant 's objection .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister took a fresh negative decision on the basis of the immigration rules for alien spouses of GPE nationals . The Deputy Minister noted that , pursuant to LAW ) , the admission of an alien spouse of a GPE national can be refused in case of a conviction of a serious offence for which an unconditional lengthy prison sentence has been imposed and that , in its decision of DATE , ORG had found that the applicant 's conviction and sentence in DATE qualified as such . The Deputy Minister further observed that , because of this sentence , the applicant could be declared an undesirable alien under LAW . This had not been done at the material time , as the Deputy Minister had been unaware of the applicant 's illegal residence in the GPE . Given the time that had elapsed since the applicant 's conviction , the Deputy Minister decided , after balancing all the interests involved , not to declare the applicant an undesirable alien . This decision did , however , not imply that the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant no longer posed a danger to public order . In this context , the Deputy Minister pointed out that the measure of declaring a person an undesirable alien entailed more serious consequences than a decision to refuse admission on grounds of posing a danger to public order . In the former case , the undesirable alien is not allowed to reside in or enter the GPE for a period of DATE , even for short ( family ) visits . The applicant was thus not subject to that restriction .", "As to the balancing of the interests involved , as required in the context of LAW DATE LAW , the Deputy Minister considered that the offence of which the applicant had been convicted had been committed a considerable time ago , that he had not reoffended since DATE , that in the meantime he had started a relationship with PERSON in the GPE out of which a child had been born in DATE which had been recognised by the applicant in DATE , that the applicant and PERSON had married in DATE , and that the applicant had an interest in exercising his family life with his spouse and their child . The Deputy Minister did not , however , find that on the basis of these interests the applicant should be granted a residence permit . In the establishment of the rules governing the immigration of foreign spouses of GPE nationals , the public order aspects were already balanced in abstracto against the interests of family reunification / formation , whereas in the particular circumstances of the instant case , the applicant had been convicted of a serious offence for which he had been sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment , and this offence , which seriously shook the legal order , was such that it could inflict serious emotional harm to the victims thereof . Furthermore , the applicant had not served this sentence , apparently because he had used various aliases and had hidden from the authorities , which also had the result that no decision had been taken to declare him an undesirable alien . As to the applicant 's interests in exercising his family life in the GPE , the Deputy Minister considered that , not having been declared an undesirable alien , the applicant could make short visits to his family in the GPE and that therefore a negative decision on his request for a residence permit did not render the exercise of his family life entirely impossible . In addition , it had not been shown that his spouse could not be expected to follow him to GPE as she is of NORP origin and speaks good LANGUAGE . This was not altered by the fact that PERSON and PERSON are GPE nationals , as it had not been argued and it had not appeared that they would not be admitted to GPE . As to the argument that PERSON had been born and raised in the GPE , the Deputy Minister held that she was very young and that it had not been established that she was so rooted in GPE society that she could not be expected to follow the applicant to GPE .", "In so far as the applicant relied on LAW , the Deputy Minister held that a negative decision on the applicant 's request did not constitute an interference with his rights under this provision as it did not deprive him of any residence permit which had previously enabled him to exercise family life in the GPE . The Deputy Minister further did not find that the GPE authorities were under a positive obligation under LAW to grant the applicant 's request . On this point , the Deputy Minister took into account that the family life on which reliance was placed had developed while the applicant was illegally residing in the GPE , and that no objective obstacles had arisen which prevented the exercise of this family life in GPE . In this respect the Deputy Minister again relied on the arguments outlined in the preceding paragraph , regarding the possibility of the applicant 's wife and child to follow him to GPE and the public danger which the applicant posed to GPE public order . On the basis of these considerations the Deputy Minister concluded that the GPE general interest in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the interests of the applicant and his family in exercising their family life in the GPE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . In so far as the applicant relied on LAW , ORG held :", "\u201c It is not disputed that there is family life within the meaning of LAW between the applicant , his spouse and the children . It must be put first that their right to respect for their family life does not entail that [ the GPE authorities ] are thus obliged to admit [ the applicant ] . It is important in this connection that , according to the constant case - law of ORG , the point of departure is that LAW does not contain an obligation for the State to respect an alien 's choice of domicile or to render possible family formation or family reunion on its territory by allowing immigration . As [ the applicant ] has never been allowed to reside in the GPE , no issue of an interference with the right to respect for family life within the meaning of DATE arises in this case . Whether , in the present case , respect for family life nevertheless gives rise to an obligation for [ the GPE authorities ] to allow [ the applicant ] to reside [ in the GPE ] must be determined on the basis of a reasonable balance that must be struck between the interests of the individual and the interests of the community as a whole . ORG is of the opinion that [ the Deputy Minister ] could adopt the position that the interests of GPE , which lies in maintaining public order and a restrictive admission policy , prevails over the interest of [ the applicant ] in being admitted in order to exercise in the GPE family life with his spouse and child . In this finding it has been taken into account that no objective obstacle to the exercise of family life in GPE has appeared . \u201d", "The admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated at the material time by the DATE LAW and the DATE LAW ; a body of policy directives drawn up and published by ORG .", "In general , the Minister of ORG determined requests lodged by aliens for residence in the GPE under LAW . The Minister could refuse entry and residence on general interest grounds ( gronden aan het algemeen belang ontleend ) .", "In view of the situation in the GPE as regards population size and employment , Government immigration policy DATE as defined in the DATE LAW \u2013 was aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , an application for a residence permit in the GPE was granted only on the basis of treaty obligations , if the individual 's presence would serve an essential national interest or if there were compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature .", "Under LAW , an alien can be declared undesirable by the Minister of Justice when he or she has been convicted of an offence punishable by a prison sentence of DATE or more . A decision declaring a person an undesirable alien shall \u2013 upon a request thereto from the person concerned \u2013 be lifted after DATE residency abroad where the decision declaring this person an undesirable alien was been taken on grounds of a conviction for serious violent crimes or drug dealing . This period is DATE where the decision was based on a conviction for other crimes .", "The offence of robbery , as defined in LAW ) , attracts a prison sentence not exceeding DATE imprisonment or a heavy fine .", "According to LAW DATE , a child whose father is a NORP national automatically acquires NORP citizenship at birth ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
