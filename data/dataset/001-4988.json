POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a retired notary public .", "A.", "On DATE the applicant concluded the contract for a purchase of CARDINAL plots of land , nos . CARDINAL and DATE , from PERSON At that time PERSON proved her title to the plots by an administrative decision of DATE declaring that by virtue of ORG she had become their owner ( \u201e akt w\u0142asno\u015bci ziemi \u201d ) . The decision stated that PERSON had been using the farm , including plots nos . CARDINAL and DATE , previously owned by her parents , since DATE , and that she had thereby complied with the legal requirement of an uninterrupted possession of agricultural land for a period set out by law , for acquisition of its ownership by prescription .", "Subsequently the applicant was registered in the local land register as the owner of the plot .", "In DATE the ORG gave a decision by which it declared that PERSON and PERSON had acquired ownership of plot no . DATE by prescription in DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , which was later dismissed .", "On DATE ORG gave a decision by virtue of which plot no . CARDINAL was severed from the land belonging to the applicant , registered in the land register under file no . DATE , and included in the property of GPE and Mr NORP registered under file no . DATE .", "By a decision of DATE ORG declared null and void the administrative title deed of DATE , confirming that PERSON had become the owner of plot no . DATE .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision .", "On DATE the Minister of Agriculture upheld the decision of DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request to register a warning in the land register that the ownershhip of plot no . CARDINAL , which had been registered as the property of Ms and Mr NORP , had become the subject of litigation .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the administrative decision of CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , the decision of DATE became final .", "On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG a request to have appropriate steps taken ex officio by the court to put right the discrepancies between the entry in the land register and the actual ownership of the plot . She argued that she had validly acquired plot no . CARDINAL , having relied on the DATE title deed of her predecessor , PERSON The applicant further argued that the inviolability of her ownership acquired in good faith should be protected by law , and requested that plot no . DATE be included again in the register file no . DATE and that she be registered as its owner .", "On DATE the applicant , in reply to the court \u2019s enquiry as to the result she wished to obtain by lodging her reqest , submitted that it should not be regarded as a suit for rectification of the land register . The applicant reiterated that she had purchased the plot in DATE in good faith and that a copy of this contract constituted sufficient evidence that she was the legal successor of PERSON and that her request was therefore well - founded .", "On DATE the ORG refused to make the entry requested by the applicant . The applicant lodged an appeal .", "On an unspecified later date the ORG set aside the decision under appeal and ordered that the case be reconsidered . The court considered that the lower court had failed to take any position as regards a question crucial for the determination of the case , i.e. the question of conflict between the rights of the applicant originating from the purchase contract of DATE and those of Ms and Mr NORP stemming from the prescription judgment of DATE . In order for this issue to be decided it was necessary to establish whether the decision of ORG of DATE , annulling the DATE title deed of Ms. PERSON , concerned also plot no . CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG , ORG , refused to grant the applicant \u2019s request . The court established that the DATE decision confirming the title of the previous owner of the land , i.e. plot no . CARDINAL , had been declared null and void by the decision of ORG of DATE . The applicant \u2019s appeal was subsequently dismissed by ORG . The court concluded that the question of the validity of the title of the applicant \u2019s predecessor had thus been settled by a final decision . The court further observed that it was not in dispute that PERSON and Ms D had acquired ownership of the plot by prescription in DATE .", "The court considered that the applicant \u2019s claim to eliminate the discrepancies between the entries in the land register and the actual ownership of the land concerned could be brought before a court only in contentious civil proceedings . It was only in such proceedings that the applicant could rely on the argument that her ownership was protected by the principle , provided for by LAW , that entries in the land register should be presumed to be accurate . The court further considered that , in proceedings concerning registration of ownership in the land register , it lacked jurisdiction to determine the question who was the true owner of the land .", "The applicant appealed . She invoked again the principle , provided for by LAW that entries in the land register should be presumed to be accurate . She further referred to LAW and argued that she had submitted sufficient documents to prove that she had validly acquired ownership from PERSON", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court relied on LAW and pointed out that proceedings under the provisions of this Act were concerned only with obtaining a decision to make new entries in the ORG , confirming ownership of land . However , in such proceedings the court lacked jurisdiction to determine any disputes as to who was the true owner . Such questions could be examined in civil contentious proceedings under LAW . The lower court had correctly established that the documents submitted by the applicant were insufficient to show that she was the legal successor of Ms T. Thus , her appeal had to be dismissed as lacking any legal basis .", "Later the applicant submitted an identical request to ORG , which was finally rejected by ORG on DATE on the ground that the applicant \u2019s request constituted a res iudicata .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "LAW provides that the conclusion of a contract of sale , or other contracts by which the parties agree to have title to property transferred , bring about a transfer of that title .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW establishes a legal presumption that the title registered in the land register corresponds to the actual legal situation of the property .", "Under LAW , if there is a discrepancy between the title as registered in the register and the actual legal situation of the property , the person who acquired a title from a person whose title had been registered is regarded as having acquired it validly ( r\u0119kojmia wiary publicznej ksi\u0105g wieczystych ) .", "LAW reads :", "\u201c If there is a discrepancy between the title or right as registered in the register and the actual legal status of the land , a person whose title or right is not registered or is registered is entitled to request a rectification of the relevant entries .", "A claim for rectification of entries can be made public by registering a warning in the register . Such an entry shall be made on the basis of either a non - final judicial decision , or a judicial temporary order . \u201d", "A claim under LAW should be submitted to the court in ordinary contentious proceedings .", "The land registers are run by ORG of ORG . Article CARDINAL provides that a separate file shall be opened for each property . Pursuant to LAW , the files shall be divided into CARDINAL sections . The first section shall identify the real property . The second chapter shall name its owner or owners . The third section shall list rights in rem and other rights of third parties encumbering the property , and the fourth section shall contain entries concerning mortgages .", "LAW provides that the court shall examine , in non - contentious proceedings , motions to have entries made in the register . The applicable provisions of LAW shall be applied in such proceedings , with the changes provided for by LAW .", "Under LAW , the court shall order that an entry be made in the register exclusively upon the motion of a party , or ex officio if the law expressly provides for it . Such a motion can be submitted by a person who has a legal interest in having her or his rights or obligations registered .", "Pursuant to LAW , when examining a motion to have an entry made in the register , the court shall confine itself to examining the contents of the motion , the documents submitted with it and the existing entries in the register ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
