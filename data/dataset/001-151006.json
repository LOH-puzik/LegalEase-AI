Word of Life is an international religious organisation based in GPE , GPE . In DATE , CARDINAL non - profit organisations affiliated with ORG ( NORP \u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442 ) were registered by ORG under ORG , and one of these organisations opened a Bible study centre in GPE . However , on DATE ORG reversed ORG decision to register the CARDINAL organisations , on the ground that they had not submitted the necessary applications to renew their registration within DATE time - limit which had been introduced on DATE following amendment of ORG . Following ORG decision , the CARDINAL organisations affiliated with ORG were deleted from the registry of non - profit organisations . Moreover , the organisations were not registered in accordance with LAW and the Bible study centre was not registered with ORG . Word of Life therefore had no legal status in GPE at the time of the events in question .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE a complaint was submitted to the office of GPE by ORG with ORG , raising concerns about the activities of ORG in GPE . On DATE , having carried out an investigation , the prosecutor \u2019s office adopted a decision stating that the \u201c sect \u201d had an influence on its followers which increased the risk of suicide and other psychological problems . Membership might lead to the severance of family and social ties with the wider community ; followers were prohibited from watching television or reading literature other than the Bible or from undergoing any form of surgical intervention . In conclusion , the prosecutor decided to order the restriction of the right of members of the CARDINAL organisations linked to ORG from assembling to promote their beliefs and from continuing to operate the Bible study centre . Relying on LAW ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) , which allowed the prosecutor to take all measures necessary to prevent the commission of a criminal offence where there was a suspicion that an offence might be committed , the prosecutor ordered the police to take measures to restrict the organisation \u2019s access to places where it could hold meetings and preach about its beliefs and convictions . Following an appeal by members of the community , the above decision was upheld by a higher prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . At all relevant times the applicant was a member of Word of Life . Following the prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , groups of Word of Life members organised meetings in private homes , including that of the applicant . On DATE a prosecutor granted permission for a search of the applicant \u2019s flat . On DATE the applicant was summonsed and interviewed by the police in relation to her religious beliefs and to meetings of members of ORG in her home . The police then accompanied the applicant to her flat and searched it . They seized a number of items , including audio tapes with religious content , notebooks with sermons , brochures , books , magazines and video tapes .", "CARDINAL . After the search the police issued a warning order ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u0437\u0430 TIME ) under LAW instructing the applicant not to host further meetings of members of the religious community . The order relied also on the decision of the prosecutor of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against the GPE police , seeking return of her chattels and damages under the CARDINAL State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act ( \u201c the CARDINAL LAW \u201d ) in respect of the above measures , which she claimed breached her right to freedom of religion and freedom of assembly .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG partially allowed the action , finding that the applicant \u2019s questioning by the police and the warning order had been lawful , but that the search and the seizure had been unlawful as they had not been undertaken in the framework of any criminal investigation and as the items seized had not been intended to be used in criminal proceedings . Making an assessment under the general law of tort rather than LAW , the court awarded the applicant MONEY ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) at current rates of exchange ) for damages and ordered that the items seized on CARDINAL DATE be returned .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeals by the parties , on DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment insofar as it concerned the order for the police to return to the applicant the chattels seized . It remitted the remainder of the case concerning liability for damages for fresh consideration under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Following a new examination of the case , on DATE the ORG dismissed the claim for damages . It found that the impugned actions of the police could not be qualified as administrative acts because the police had acted pursuant to the orders of the prosecution authorities . As to the prosecution authorities themselves , they could not be held liable under LAW for decisions of the type in question .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the applicant , in a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG findings under LAW . ORG observed that the prosecution service had ordered the measures and that the police officers who were involved had merely assisted the prosecution authorities as they were obliged to do under LAW of the DATE Code .", "CARDINAL .
