The following sequence of events was established .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the predecessor institution of ORG concluded an agreement with the company to cooperate for the purpose of scientific research . Under the agreement various types of tissue were to be removed from deceased persons \u2012 selected by ORG in accordance with international standards \u2012 and sent to the company for processing . The company transformed the tissue received into bio - implants and sent them back to GPE for transplantation purposes .

ORG issued CARDINAL opinions on the compatibility of the agreement with domestic law and , in particular , with the PERSON on the Protection of the Bodies of Deceased Persons and ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Any qualified member of staff ( \u201c expert \u201d ) of ORG was allowed to carry out the removal of tissue on his or her own initiative .

After DATE , however , tissue removal was carried out only at FAC in GPE and the forensic division in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the agreement , experts could remove tissue from deceased persons who had been transported to FAC for forensic examination . Each expert was to verify whether the potential donor had objected to the removal of organs or tissue during his or her lifetime by checking his or her passport to make sure that there was no stamp to that effect . If relatives objected to the removal , their wishes were respected , but the experts themselves did not attempt to contact relatives or to establish their wishes . Tissue was to be removed within TIME of the biological death of a person .", "CARDINAL . Experts were obliged to comply with domestic law but , according to their own testimonies , not all of them had read the PERSON .

In the course of the inquiry the investigators questioned specialists in criminal law and the removal of organs and tissue . It was concluded that , generally speaking , CARDINAL legal systems exist for regulating the removal of organs and tissue \u2013 \u201c informed consent \u201d and \u201c presumed consent \u201d . On the one hand , the Head of ORG , the Head of ORG of FAC and the experts at ORG were of the opinion that at the relevant time ( that is to say , after the PERSON \u2019s entry into force on DATE ) there had existed a system of \u201c presumed consent \u201d in GPE . These persons were of the view that the system of presumed consent meant that \u201c everything which is not forbidden is allowed \u201d . The investigators , on the other hand , were of the opinion that section QUANTITY of the PERSON gave a clear indication that the NORP legal system relied more on the concept of \u201c informed consent \u201d and , accordingly , removal was permissible only when it was ( expressly ) allowed , that is to say when consent had been given either by the donor during his or her lifetime or by the relatives .", "CARDINAL .

The above considerations were noted down in the decision ( l\u0113mums par krimin\u0101lprocesa izbeig\u0161anu ) and differences concerning the possible interpretations of domestic law were resolved in favour of the accused . Moreover , the DATE amendments to the PERSON were to be interpreted to mean that there was a system of \u201c presumed consent \u201d in GPE . It was concluded that sections DATE and CARDINAL of the PERSON had not been violated and that no elements of a crime as set out in section CARDINAL of LAW had been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE prosecutors dismissed complaints lodged by the applicant and held that the decision to discontinue the inquiry was lawful and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a superior prosecutor of ORG examined the case file and concluded that the inquiry should not have been discontinued .

During the course of that investigation it was established that in DATE tissue had been removed from CARDINAL people ; in DATE , from CARDINAL people ; in DATE , from CARDINAL people ; and in DATE , from CARDINAL people . In exchange for the supply of tissue to the company , ORG had organised the purchase of different medical equipment , instruments , technology and computers for medical institutions in GPE and the company had paid for these purchases . Within the framework of the agreement , the total monetary value of the equipment for which the company had paid exceeded the value of the removed tissue that was sent to the company . In the decision of DATE ( see immediately below ) it was noted that the tissue was not removed for transplantation purposes in accordance with section CARDINAL of the PERSON but was actually removed for transformation into other products to be used for patients not only in GPE , but also in other countries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal inquiry was discontinued owing to the expiry of the statutory limitation period . In the decision it was noted that whenever an expert from ORG , for example , had interviewed the relatives prior to the removal of organs or tissue , he had never expressly informed them about such potential removal or indeed obtained their consent . According to the testimonies of all the relatives , they would not have consented to the removal of organs or tissue had they been informed and their wishes established . According to the experts\u2019 testimonies , they had merely checked passports for stamps and had not sought relatives\u2019 consent as they had not been in contact with them . It was also noted that with effect from DATE , information was to be sought from ORG , which the experts had failed to do . It was concluded that the experts , including GPE , had contravened section CARDINAL of the PERSON and had breached the relatives\u2019 rights . However , owing to the fiveyear statutory limitation period ( which started running on DATE ) the criminal inquiry was discontinued , and on CARDINAL May and DATE the prosecutors upheld that decision in response to complaints lodged by the applicant . The applicant lodged a further complaint .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the experts , including GPE , lodged an appeal contesting the reasons for the discontinuation of the criminal inquiry ( krimin\u0101lprocesa izbeig\u0161anas pamatojums ) . They contested their status as the persons against whom the criminal inquiry concerning unlawful tissue removal had been instigated because they had not at any stage been informed about this inquiry and argued that , accordingly , they had been unable to exercise their defence rights . On DATE in a final decision FAC upheld their appeal ( case no . DATE ) , quashed the DATE decision and sent the case file back to ORG . The court found as follows :", "\u201c Notwithstanding the fact that a certain proportion of the transplants were not returned to be used for patients in GPE , there is no evidence in the case file that they were used for processing into other products or for scientific or educational purposes . Therefore , the court considers that there is no evidence in the case file that the removed tissues were used for purposes other than transplantation ...", "There is no evidence in the case file demonstrating that the removal of tissue for transplantation purposes had been carried out disregarding the deceased person \u2019s refusal , as expressed during his lifetime and recorded in accordance with the law in force at the relevant time , or disregarding any refusal expressed by the closest relatives .", "Taking into account the fact that legislative instruments do not impose any obligation on the experts who carry out the removal of tissue and organs from deceased ORG bodies to inform persons about their rights to refuse tissue or organ removal , the court considers that the experts did not have any obligation to do so ; by not informing the deceased person \u2019s relatives about their intention to remove tissue , the experts did not breach the provisions of the [ Law ] , as effective DATE . Section CARDINAL of the [ Law ] provides for the right of the closest relatives to refuse the removal of the deceased person \u2019s organs and/or tissue , but does not impose an obligation on the expert to explain these rights to the relatives . Given that there are no legislative instruments which impose an obligation on the experts to inform relatives about their intention to remove tissue and/or organs and to explain to the relatives their right to object by refusing their consent , the court considers that a person can not be punished for a failure to comply with an obligation which is not clearly laid down in a legislative instrument in force . Therefore , the court finds that the experts , by carrying out the tissue and organ removal from the deceased , did not breach ... the [ Law ] .", "... The court finds that the experts\u2019 actions did not constitute the elements of a crime proscribed by CARDINAL of LAW ; therefore , it is possible to discontinue the criminal proceedings for exonerating reasons DATE namely on the grounds of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW \u2012 owing to the absence of the elements of a crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the superior prosecutor responded to a complaint lodged by the applicant . She admitted that the inquiry had taken a long time owing to numerous complaints against the decisions . However , she did not find any particular circumstances which would indicate that it had been unduly protracted . At the same time , she informed the applicant that the court had quashed the DATE decision upon the appeal by the experts . She further stated that a new decision to discontinue the criminal inquiry had been adopted on DATE and that the applicant would soon be duly notified .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , the applicant received the DATE decision DATE . It was reiterated in that decision that the experts did not have any legal obligation to inform anyone about their right to consent to or refuse organ or tissue removal . Section CARDINAL of the PERSON provided for the right of the closest relatives to object to the removal of the deceased person \u2019s organs and tissue , but did not impose any obligation on the expert to explain these rights to the relatives . A person could not be punished for a failure to comply with an obligation which was not clearly laid down in a legal provision ; the experts had therefore not breached the PERSON . The applicant lodged further complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor replied , inter alia , that there were no circumstances indicating the desecration of a human body . At the same time , she explained that the experts had performed actions in connection with the unlawful tissue removal in order to use the tissue for medical purposes . After the removal of tissue , other material was commonly implanted to restore the visual integrity of dead bodies . Therefore , the criminal inquiry had concerned actions under section CARDINAL of LAW and not under LAW proscribing desecration of a dead body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a superior prosecutor replied that there were no grounds for examining the actions of the persons who proceeded with the tissue removal under section CARDINAL of the Criminal Law as desecration of a dead body . The experts had proceeded in accordance with an instruction issued by ORG , implanting other material in the place of the removed tissue . According to the instruction , tissue was to be removed in such a way so as not to mutilate the body , and , if necessary , subsequent restoration was to be carried out .", "CARDINAL .
