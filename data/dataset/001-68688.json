FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Mairold Veerm\u00e4e , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr A. PERSON , Director at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted by a NORP district court of an aggravated narcotics offence and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . He had been detained since DATE . On DATE ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) ordered his expulsion to GPE . The judgment and the expulsion order both became final .", "On DATE ORG ( rikosseuraamusvirasto , brottsp\u00e5f\u00f6ljdsverket ) proposed to ORG that the applicant should serve the rest of his sentence in GPE . The applicant and ORG were invited to submit observations . The applicant objected to being transferred to GPE , whereas ORG agreed to the transfer .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to serve the rest of his sentence in GPE . It relied on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG in the Enforcement of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ( laki kansainv\u00e4lisest\u00e4 yhteistoiminnasta er\u00e4iden rikosoikeudellisten seuraamusten t\u00e4yt\u00e4nt\u00f6\u00f6npanossa , lag om internationellt samarbete vid verkst\u00e4llighet av vissa straffr\u00e4ttsliga p\u00e5f\u00f6ljder ) and on LAW to the Convention on ORG ( NORP Treaty Series no . CARDINAL ; Finnish Treaty Series no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held , inter alia , that the applicant did not have particular bonds with GPE and that he had closer social ties to GPE than to GPE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting the quashing of ORG decision . He argued that in GPE it would be possible for him to be released on parole on DATE after serving CARDINAL his sentence ; in GPE release on parole would only be possible after serving CARDINAL of the sentence . Even then his release on parole would be discretionary as PERCENT of inmates in NORP prisons were released on parole , whereas the rest served their sentences in their entirety . The de facto sentence would thus be CARDINAL and a half years longer in GPE , or even twice as long as the sentence in GPE if no release on parole were granted in GPE . He further claimed that some prisons in GPE were old and overcrowded . The applicant relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , maintaining that his transfer to GPE would place him in a discriminatory position compared to NORP prisoners and also to other NORP prisoners in GPE who were not transferred to GPE . He further relied on the non bis in idem principle ( LAW ) .", "In its opinion to ORG , ORG stated the following ( as transcribed by the court ) :", "\u201c ... Veerm\u00e4e has been sentenced to DATE imprisonment , of which he will , as a first - time offender , be serving DATE and DATE . In GPE it would be possible for PERSON to obtain conditional release on having served CARDINAL of his sentence , that is to say DATE . [ His ] possibility of being released conditionally in GPE is therefore not significantly smaller than in GPE and the NORP legislation does not in this respect differ significantly from our own . \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that , even though he was likely to serve a significantly longer prison sentence in GPE owing to the differences in the possibility of being released on parole , this in itself did not violate LAW . It also found that LAW would not be violated merely on account of the fact that prisons in GPE were apparently old and overcrowded . It ruled out any discrimination as the International Cooperation in the Enforcement of LAW , which naturally only applied to foreigners , provided an acceptable reason for the transfer .", "ORG further held that the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE would not breach LAW either , as the sentence he would actually be serving there would not exceed the sentence imposed by the NORP courts . No appeal lay against ORG decision ..", "On DATE the NORP ORG requested ORG to consent to the enforcement of the sentence in GPE . At the time of filing their observations , the Government submitted that the consent of the latter had still not been received .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred to a NORP open prison facility .", "Under LAW , LAW ( as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , of LAW ( laki rangaistusten t\u00e4yt\u00e4nt\u00f6\u00f6npanosta , lag om verkst\u00e4llighet av straff ) , a prisoner may be conditionally released after serving CARDINAL or , exceptionally , CARDINAL of the sentence , in the latter case provided that the prisoner has not served a prison sentence during DATE preceding the offence . The factors to be taken into account in the decision to release a prisoner conditionally include , inter alia , the nature of and the motives for the offence , the prisoner \u2019s earlier lifestyle and his or her behaviour in prison , as well as the situation the prisoner would face on release .", "Despite the authorities\u2019 discretionary powers , it is very rare for conditional release to be postponed in GPE . A first - time prisoner is usually released after serving CARDINAL the sentence .", "Under LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a prisoner may appeal to a district court against , inter alia , the postponement of his or her conditional release on serving CARDINAL of the sentence ( whichever is applicable under LAW , LAW ) .", "In a report ( no . CARDINAL ) , ORG noted the following ( on p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... In DATE [ conditional release ] was almost never postponed . Following the instruction issued by ORG in DATE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) postponements have been very rare and almost exclusively based on the prisoner \u2019s consent . ... \u201d", "It further observed ( on p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c [ The proposals now being made ] would not change the existing legislation as regards the possibility of obtaining conditional release on serving CARDINAL of a sentence . Nor would there be any change as regards those prisoners who had not served a term of imprisonment during DATE preceding their offence and who are [ therefore ] to be released on serving CARDINAL their sentence . ... \u201d", "The aim of the Convention on ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d LAW no . CARDINAL and Finnish Treaty Series no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , including its LAW , is to develop international cooperation in the field of criminal law and to further the ends of justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons . According to the LAW , foreigners who are deprived of their liberty as a result of their commission of a criminal offence should be given the opportunity to serve their sentences within their own society .", "LAW came into force in respect of GPE on CARDINAL DATE and LAW on DATE . They came into force in respect of GPE on DATE and DATE respectively . Thus , they were in force on DATE when the applicant was convicted by the district court .", "LAW enables the transfer of a sentenced person from \u201c the sentencing ORG \u201d to \u201c the administering State \u201d provided , inter alia , that the person in question is a national of the administering State ; that he or she ( or in some instances a legal representative ) consents to the transfer ; that the acts or omissions on account of which the sentence has been imposed constitute a criminal offence according to the law of the administering ORG or would constitute a criminal offence if committed on its territory ; and that the sentencing and administering GPE both agree to the transfer .", "Article CARDINAL ( \u201c Effect of transfer for administering ORG \u201d ) reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The competent authorities of the administering State shall :", "( a ) NORP continue the enforcement of the sentence immediately or through a court or administrative order , under the conditions set out in LAW , or", "( b ) convert the sentence , through a judicial or administrative procedure , into a decision of that ORG , thereby substituting for the sanction imposed in the sentencing ORG a sanction prescribed by the law of the administering ORG for the same offence , under the conditions set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The administering ORG , if requested , shall inform the sentencing ORG before the transfer of the sentenced person as to which of these procedures it will follow .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering ORG and that ORG alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL ( \u201c Continued enforcement \u201d ) provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the case of continued enforcement , the administering State shall be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP If , however , this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering State , or its law so requires , that ORG may , by a court or administrative order , adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence . As to its nature , the punishment or measure shall , as far as possible , correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced . It shall not aggravate , by its nature or duration , the sanction imposed in the sentencing ORG , nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering ORG . \u201d", "LAW Conversion of sentence \u201d ) reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the case of conversion of sentence , the procedures provided for by the law of the administering ORG apply . When converting the sentence , the competent authority :", "( a ) shall be bound by the findings as to the facts insofar as they appear explicitly or implicitly from the judgment imposed in the sentencing ORG ;", "( b ) may not convert a sanction involving deprivation of liberty to a pecuniary sanction ;", "( c ) shall deduct the full period of deprivation of liberty served by the sentenced person ; and", "( d ) shall not aggravate the penal position of the sentenced person , and shall not be bound by any minimum which the law of the administering ORG may provide for the offence or offences committed .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the conversion procedure takes place after the transfer of the sentenced person , the administering State shall keep that person in custody or otherwise ensure his presence in the administering State pending the outcome of that procedure . \u201d", "LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c Upon being requested by the sentencing ORG , the administering ORG may , subject to the provisions of this LAW , agree to the transfer of a sentenced person without the consent of that person , where the sentence passed on the latter , or an administrative decision consequential to that sentence , includes an expulsion or deportation order or any other measure as the result of which that person will no longer be allowed to remain in the territory of the sentencing ORG once he or she is released from prison . \u201d", "LAW ( hallinto - oikeuslaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolarna ; CARDINAL ) provides that the administrative courts examine and decide such administrative appeals , disputes and other cases as fall within their competence under LAW ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag ; ORG ) or other acts of ORG . LAW of ORG in the Enforcement of LAW provides that no appeal lies against the administrative court \u2019s decision . The government bill concerning LAW to the Convention on ORG ( HE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) states :", "\u201c When considering a request for transfer , ORG should , in particular , pay attention to prison conditions in the ORG in which enforcement is being requested . The decision would also be affected , inter alia , by the most likely date on which the sentenced person would be conditionally released in accordance with the laws of the ORG of enforcement . Should the possibilities for conditional release in the ORG of enforcement be considerably weaker than in GPE , it might be unreasonable to request the transfer of the sentenced person . \u201d", "ORG , having discussed the government bill , observed in its report ( ORG ) :", "\u201c The prison conditions in the receiving ORG should be adequate to ensure that the prisoner will not be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . As a minimum , the conditions in which the prison sentence is served and its duration should not significantly differ from those applicable in GPE . Thus , transfers should also not take place where the legislation of the receiving State concerning the serving of sentences significantly differs from the NORP legislation , for example in respect of the possibility of conditional release . \u201d", "The present case is the second one of its kind concerning GPE before the ORG , the first application ( ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . PERSON , DATE ) having been declared inadmissible by the ORG as the applicant was no longer considered the victim of a violation within the meaning of LAW following his release on parole in GPE . In that case ORG gave an account of the relevant domestic legislation and practice , a summary of which can also be found below .", "LAW , which replaced LAW on DATE , divides criminal offences into offences in the first degree and offences in the second degree . Criminal offences in the first degree are those for which LAW prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of DATE , life imprisonment or compulsory dissolution . A criminal offence in the second degree carries a term of imprisonment of DATE or a pecuniary penalty .", "In accordance with LAW , which came into force on DATE , an offence committed prior to the entry into force of LAW which is also punishable as a criminal offence under LAW is assessed in the light of the corresponding LAW in force at the time of the commission of the offence . If , after the entry into force of LAW , a penalty is imposed for a criminal offence committed prior to the entry into force of LAW , the penalty is based on the one provided for in the corresponding LAW in force at the time of the commission of the offence , where the LAW in question prescribes a lesser penalty .", "The offence of unlawful handling of large quantities of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances was punishable by CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment from DATE to DATE ( LAW ) , thus rendering the offence an offence in the second degree under LAW . Since DATE the offence has been punishable by CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , thus making the offence an offence in the first degree . LAW , valid until DATE and in force at the time the applicant committed his offence ( CARDINAL September CARDINAL - CARDINAL January CARDINAL ) , provided for a scale of penalties from CARDINAL to seven years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Conditional release ( release on parole ) is governed by LAW . If a person has been convicted of a criminal offence in the second degree , or a criminal offence in the first degree through negligence , the court may release the convicted offender conditionally if he or she has actually served CARDINAL but not DATE of the sentence imposed . If a person has been convicted of intentional commission of a criminal offence in the first degree , the court may release the person conditionally if the convicted person has actually served CARDINAL of the sentence imposed . In deciding on conditional release , the court must take into consideration the circumstances relating to the commission of the criminal offence , the personality of the convicted offender , his or her previous personal history and conduct while serving the sentence , his or her living conditions and the consequences which conditional release may entail for him or her .", "In transfer cases , GPE has used the procedure of conversion of sentences on account of the fact that the criminal law in the sentencing GPE has , so far , provided for harsher penalties than those prescribed by NORP law for the same criminal offences . Transfer cases are heard by ORG , which converts the sentence into one applicable for a similar offence under NORP law . In ORG , ORG could not speculate as to the nature of the sentence , that being solely within the competence of the court . However , taking into account the relevant provisions of law and the current practice in transfer cases , they considered it likely that the penalty imposed in GPE would be less severe than the one imposed in GPE and that the actual term of imprisonment would be no longer than it would have been in GPE . In that regard , they noted that at the time of the commission of the offence it had carried a penalty of DATE imprisonment . However , according to the wording of LAW as in force until DATE , the penalty was imprisonment from DATE and as this penalty was less severe it thus replaced the CARDINAL prescribed by LAW . At the relevant time , therefore , the offence constituted a criminal offence in the second degree and conditional release would be possible after CARDINAL the sentence had been served .", "In DATE prisoners were transferred from GPE to GPE to continue serving their sentences . In all cases LAW ( b ) of LAW was applied , as the penalty in GPE was significantly harsher ( a longer term of imprisonment ) than that prescribed for similar offences under NORP law . In ORG , ORG referred to a judgment delivered on DATE by ORG . In that case an NORP citizen had been convicted in GPE of a serious drug - related offence and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . ORG converted the sentence and imposed CARDINAL of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In most of the conversion cases , ORG has alleviated the situation of the transferred persons , as the prison sentences imposed have been reduced . In ORG submitted that they had no grounds to believe that the situation would be different regarding other comparable cases . A transferred prisoner had the possibility of bringing the case before ORG and he or she could submit any relevant information for consideration in the conversion of the sentence . An appeal lay to ORG .", "In DATE a total of CARDINAL inmates were released from NORP prisons , CARDINAL of whom were conditionally released , amounting to PERCENT of the total number released . The average percentage of persons released conditionally has remained stable at PERCENT of all prisoners released throughout DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
