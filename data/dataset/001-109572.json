FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 14+8 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Dean Spielmann;Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Jean-Paul Costa;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in Clamart .", "CARDINAL . Ms Val\u00e9rie Gas ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) has cohabited since DATE with PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) . The latter gave birth in GPE on DATE to a daughter , PERSON , conceived in GPE via anonymous donor insemination . A. does not have an established legal tie to her father , who acted as an anonymous donor in accordance with NORP law . The child has lived all her life in the applicants\u2019 shared home . On DATE her name was entered in the register of births , deaths and marriages held at Clamart town hall . She was formally recognised by her mother on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants subsequently entered into a civil partnership agreement which was registered on DATE with the registry of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied to the PERSON tribunal de grande instance for a simple - adoption order in respect of her partner \u2019s daughter , after her partner had given her express consent before a notary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor lodged an objection against the first applicant \u2019s application , on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the tribunal de grande instance observed that the statutory conditions for adoption were met and that it had been demonstrated that the applicants were actively and jointly involved in the child \u2019s upbringing , providing her with care and affection . However , the court rejected the application on the grounds that the requested adoption would have legal implications running counter to the ORG intentions and the child \u2019s interests , by transferring parental responsibility to the adoptive parent and thus depriving the birth mother of her own rights in relation to the child .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against that decision and the second applicant intervened in the proceedings on her own initiative .", "Before ORG the applicants reaffirmed their wish , by means of the adoption , to provide a stable legal framework for the child which reflected her social reality . They argued that the loss of parental responsibility on the part of the child \u2019s mother could be remedied by means of a complete or partial delegation of parental responsibility , and submitted that other NORP countries permitted adoptions which created legal ties with a same - sex partner .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the refusal of the application .", "Like the first - instance court , ORG noted that the statutory conditions for the adoption had been met and that it had been established that the first applicant was active in ensuring the child \u2019s emotional and material well - being . It nevertheless upheld the finding that the legal consequences of such adoption would not be in the child \u2019s interests , since the applicants would be unable to share parental responsibility as permitted by LAW in the event of adoption by the spouse of the child \u2019s mother or father , and the adoption would therefore deprive Ms GPE of all rights in relation to her child . The court further considered that simply delegating the exercise of parental responsibility at DATE would not suffice to eliminate the risks to the child resulting from her mother \u2019s loss of parental responsibility . Accordingly , in the court \u2019s view , the application merely accorded with the applicants\u2019 wish to have their joint parenting of the child recognised and legitimised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law , but did not pursue the proceedings before ORG to their conclusion . On DATE the President of ORG issued an order declaring the right to appeal on points of law to be forfeit .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL types of adoption in NORP law : full adoption and simple adoption .", "CARDINAL . A full - adoption order can be made only while the child is still a minor and may be requested by a married couple or by CARDINAL person . It creates a legal parent - child relationship which takes the place of the original relationship ( if such existed ) . The child takes on the adoptive parent \u2019s surname . A new birth certificate is drawn up and the adoption is irrevocable ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A simple - adoption order , by contrast , does not sever the ties between the child and his or her original family , but creates an additional legal parentchild relationship ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . The order can be made irrespective of the age of the person being adopted , including when he or she has reached the age of majority . The adoptive parent \u2019s surname is added to that of the adoptee . The latter retains some inheritance rights in his or her family of origin and acquires rights vis - \u00e0 - vis the adoptive parent . Simple adoption gives rise to reciprocal obligations between adopter and adoptee , in particular a maintenance requirement . The biological parents are required to support the adopted person financially only if the adoptive parent is unable to do so .", "Where the adoptee is a minor , simple adoption results in all the rights associated with parental responsibility being removed from the child \u2019s father or mother in favour of the adoptive parent . The legislation provides for CARDINAL exception to this rule , namely where an individual adopts the child of his or her spouse . In this case , the husband and wife share parental responsibility . Hence :", "\u201c All rights associated with parental responsibility shall be vested in the adoptive parent alone , including the right to consent to the marriage of the adoptee , unless the adoptive parent is married to the adoptee \u2019s mother or father . In this case , the adoptive parent and his or her spouse shall have joint parental responsibility , but the spouse shall continue to exercise it alone unless the couple make a joint declaration before the senior registrar of the tribunal de grande instance to the effect that parental responsibility is to be exercised jointly . ... \u201d", "Unlike a full - adoption order , a simple - adoption order may be revoked at the request of the adoptive parent , the adoptee or , where the latter is a minor , the public prosecutor .", "Simple adoption is largely aimed , where minors are concerned , at compensating for the failings of the biological parent or parents . In practice , most cases of full adoption are overseas adoptions , while the great majority of simple - adoption orders granted within families concern persons having reached the age of majority , and are often inheritance - related .", "CARDINAL . Parental responsibility is defined as the complete set of GPE rights and responsibilities towards their minor children . It is aimed at protecting children \u2019s \u201c health , safety and morals , in order to ensure their education and development \u201d ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) . In principle , once parentage has been established , the parents of a minor child automatically have parental responsibility , which can only be withdrawn on serious grounds . Parental responsibility ends when the child reaches the age of majority , normally at CARDINAL . A distinction is made between parental responsibility and the exercise of parental responsibility ; the latter may be entrusted to CARDINAL parent for reasons relating to the child \u2019s best interests . The parent not exercising parental responsibility retains the right and the obligation to oversee the maintenance and upbringing of his or her children . He or she must be informed of important decisions concerning them and may not be deprived of contact rights and the right to TIME visits without compelling reasons .", "CARDINAL . It is possible to delegate parental responsibility to a third party ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . Since the enactment of LAW on parental responsibility , LAW , which governs the \u201c standard \u201d delegation of parental responsibility , provides that , where the circumstances so require , CARDINAL or both parents may apply to the family judge to have the exercise of parental responsibility delegated to CARDINAL party ( an individual , an approved institution or the child welfare services for the d\u00e9partement concerned ) . The delegation of responsibility is not permanent and does not encompass the right to consent to adoption . In this context , parental responsibility may be transferred in whole or in part : parental responsibility continues to be vested in the parents , but its exercise is handed over to the third party .", "CARDINAL . Within the standard delegation procedure , the Law of DATE introduced a more flexible delegation option based on the sharing of parental responsibility ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) . The order delegating parental responsibility may stipulate , \u201c in the interests of the child \u2019s upbringing \u201d , that one or both parents are to share the exercise of their parental responsibility in whole or in part with the third party , thus retaining shared responsibility . This measure makes it possible to regulate the relationship between the child , the separated couple and the third parties , whether they be grandparents , step - parents or live - in partners . Each parent retains parental responsibility and continues to exercise it . The delegation of responsibility does not entail any change of surname or the establishment of a legal parent - child relationship ; it is temporary and ceases to have effect once the child reaches the age of majority .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , marriage is not available to same - sex couples ( LAW ) . This principle was reaffirmed by ORG , which , in a judgment delivered on DATE , reiterated that \u201c in NORP law , marriage is a union between a man and a woman \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A civil partnership is defined by LAW as \u201c a contract entered into by CARDINAL individuals of full age , of opposite sex or of the same sex , for the purposes of organising their life together \u201d . Civil partnerships entail a number of obligations for those who enter into them , including the obligation to live as a couple and lend each other material and other support .", "Civil partnerships also confer certain rights on the parties , which increased with the entry into force on DATE of the PERSON of DATE on the reform of the arrangements concerning inheritance and gifts . Hence , the partners constitute a single household for tax purposes ; they are also treated in the same way as married couples for the purposes of exercising certain rights , particularly in relation to health and maternity insurance and life assurance . Some effects deriving from marriage remain inapplicable to civil partnerships . Among other things , the legislation does not give rise to any kinship or inheritance ties between the partners . In particular , the dissolution of the partnership does not entail judicial divorce proceedings but simply involves a joint declaration by both partners or a unilateral decision by CARDINAL partner which is served on the other ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . Furthermore , civil partnerships have no implications as regards the provisions of LAW concerning legal adoptive relationships and parental responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Assisted reproduction , which refers to the techniques allowing in vitro fertilisation , embryo transfer and artificial insemination , is governed by Articles L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . Under LAW of the LAW , assisted reproduction techniques are authorised in GPE for therapeutic purposes only , with a view to \u201c remedying clinically diagnosed infertility \u201d or \u201c preventing transmission to the child or partner of a particularly serious disease \u201d . They are available to opposite - sex couples of reproductive age who are married or show proof of cohabiting .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , LAW provides for legal recognition of paternity for the second parent in the following terms :", "\u201c Married or cohabiting couples who , in order to conceive , have recourse to medical assistance involving a third - party donor shall give their prior consent , in a manner that ensures confidentiality , before the judge or notary , who shall inform them of the implications of this act as regards the legal parent - child relationship .", "...", "Any man who , having given his consent to assisted reproduction , does not recognise the child born as a result shall incur liability vis - \u00e0 - vis the mother and the child .", "A judicial declaration of paternity shall also be issued in his regard . The action shall be brought in conformity with the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has issued several rulings on this subject . The first CARDINAL judgments , delivered on DATE , concerned cases involving lesbian couples living in a civil partnership and raising children whose sole legal parent was their mother , as their paternity had not been legally established . In both cases the mother \u2019s partner had applied for a simple - adoption order in respect of the children , with the consent of their mother . CARDINAL of the applications was granted by ORG on the ground , in particular , that \u201c the adoption [ was ] in the child \u2019s interests \u201d , while the other was rejected by ORG . Referring to LAW , ORG of ORG quashed the first ORG judgment and declared it null and void , in the following terms :", "\u201c The adoption resulted in parental responsibility for the child being transferred , and in the biological mother , who planned to continue raising the child , being deprived of her rights . Accordingly , although Ms Y had consented to the adoption , ORG , in granting the application , acted in breach of the above - mentioned provision ; \u201d", "It upheld the second ORG judgment as follows :", "\u201c However , ORG correctly observed that Ms Y ... , the children \u2019s mother , would lose parental responsibility in relation to the children were they to be adopted by PERSON , although the couple were cohabiting . It noted that a delegation of parental responsibility could be requested only if the circumstances so required , which had been neither established nor alleged , and that in the present case the delegation or sharing of parental responsibility would , in the context of an adoption , be contradictory since the adoption of a minor was designed to attribute exclusive parental responsibility to the adoptive parent . Accordingly , ORG , which , despite the allegations to the contrary , examined the issue , gave lawful grounds for its decision . \u201d ( CARDINAL judgments of ORG , ORG , DATE , judgments ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ORG DATE I , nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "ORG subsequently reaffirmed this approach :", "\u201c Firstly , the child \u2019s ( father or ) mother would be deprived of parental responsibility in the event of the child \u2019s adoption , despite being perfectly fit to exercise that responsibility and having given no indication of wishing to reject it . Secondly , LAW provides for the sharing of parental responsibility only in the event of adoption of the spouse \u2019s child ; as the NORP legislation stands , spouses are persons joined by the bonds of marriage . Accordingly , ORG , which did not rule in breach of any of the provisions of ORG , gave lawful grounds for its decision . \u201d ( ORG , ORG , DATE , ORG DATE I , no . CARDINAL ; see also , to similar effect , the judgment of ORG , ORG , of DATE , unpublished , on appeal no . DATE and ORG , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL judgments , delivered on DATE , were published in ORG , on the Internet and in ORG DATE report .", "CARDINAL . In a first leading judgment ( Court of Cassation , ORG , DATE , published in the Bulletin ) , ORG granted an application by a same - sex couple living in a civil partnership who sought to take advantage of this option . The court ruled that LAW \u201c [ did ] not prevent a mother with sole parental responsibility from delegating the exercise of that responsibility in whole or in part to the woman with whom she live[d ] in a stable and lasting relationship , where the circumstances so GPE ] and the measure [ was ] compatible with the child \u2019s best interests \u201d . ORG subsequently tightened up the conditions to be met for the granting of an application to delegate parental responsibility ( Court of Cassation , ORG , DATE , published in the Bulletin ) . While the conditions laid down remain the same ( the circumstances have to require such a measure and it has to be compatible with the child \u2019s best interests ) , ORG now requires applicants to demonstrate that the measure would improve the lives of the children concerned and is essential . This restrictive approach is now applied by the courts hearing such cases on the merits ( GPE tribunal de grande instance , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a case concerning facts similar to those in the present case , the applicants alleged a breach of the constitutional principle of equality and requested ORG to transmit a request for a priority preliminary ruling on constitutionality to ORG . ORG granted the request .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG held that it was not its task to rule on the constitutionality of the impugned statutory provisions in the abstract , but rather in the light of ORG consistent interpretation . In the case under consideration , the constitutionality of LAW therefore had to be assessed in the light of the fact that the latter had the effect of prohibiting in principle the adoption of a child by the individual \u2019s partner or cohabitant , as ruled by ORG on DATE .", "ORG began by pointing out that the provisions of LAW did not hinder couples from cohabiting or entering into a civil partnership , any more than it prevented the biological parent from involving his or her partner or cohabitant in the child \u2019s upbringing . However , ORG ruled that the right to family life as guaranteed by LAW did not confer a right to establish a legal adoptive relationship between the child and his or her parent \u2019s partner .", "ORG went on to observe that the legislature had deliberately chosen to confine the option of simple adoption to married couples and that it was not its place to substitute its own assessment for that of the legislature .", "CARDINAL . This Convention was opened for signature on DATE and came into force on DATE . It has not been signed or ratified by GPE . Its relevant provisions read as follows .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The law shall permit a child to be adopted :", "( a ) by CARDINAL persons of different sex", "( i ) who are married to each other , or", "( ii ) where such an institution exists , have entered into a registered partnership together ;", "( b ) by CARDINAL person .", "CARDINAL . States are free to extend the scope of this Convention to same - sex couples who are married to each other or who have entered into a registered partnership together .
