It also provided that the language of instruction might be different in private schools , in ORG and municipal schools implementing national minority curricula and in other educational establishments as provided by law . As regards the ORG and municipal schools implementing national minority curricula , it was for ORG to set out specific subjects to be taught in the ORG language ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) and the Minister for ORG was to ensure that the relevant regulations were submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers by DATE ( transitional provisions , paragraph CARDINAL ) . It was also established that everyone should learn the ORG language and take the ORG language proficiency test in order to obtain primary and secondary education ( section GPE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was actively involved in protests against the education reform . He was one of the main leaders of a movement named \u201c ORG for ORG \u201d ( \u201c PERSON skolu aizst\u0101v\u012bbas \u0161t\u0101bs \u201d in NORP ) , which was involved in promoting and advocating protests against the education reform . He participated in meetings and demonstrations against the education reform and made public statements advocating ideas concerning the LANGUAGE - speaking community \u2019s rights to education in NORP and the preservation of the ORG - financed schools with NORP as the sole language of instruction . The Government provided the ORG with evidence of media coverage of these protests in the period from DATE to DATE , including news reports by the NORP news agency ORG and articles in the DATE newspapers PERSON and PERSON and in the regional newspaper ORG ( in NORP ) . There were CARDINAL news reports and articles in total .", "CARDINAL . After several sizable meetings and demonstrations , ORG adopted amendments to LAW on DATE .

On DATE ORG informed the applicant of the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted administrative proceedings against ORG . He asked ORG ( ORG rajona tiesa ) to \u201c obligate ORG to take a decision on admitting him to NORP citizenship \u201d . The applicant stated that the decision regarding admission to NORP citizenship was an administrative act and could not be regarded as a political decision . He considered inter alia that a person fulfilled the obligation of loyalty if he met all the requirements of LAW and unless any restrictions stated in the PERSON could be applied to such person . He considered that the refusal to grant him citizenship was unlawful ; in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , his views could not constitute grounds for a refusal . He stated that his name had been struck out of the list owing to his participation in the political party \u201c For Human Rights in GPE \u201d ( \u201c ORG cilv\u0113ka ties\u012bb\u0101m vienot\u0101 FAC , abbreviated to ORG ) and to his public statements .

On DATE the applicant gave an interview to a journalist from the DATE newspaper ORG . His answer to the question whether he hoped to win the case before the domestic and international courts was reportedly as follows :", "\u201c If I wanted to gain political power , I would have been naturalised DATE and would have been elected to [ ORG ] . The chances of winning a case in a court in GPE might be CARDINAL . But I do not need that . Frankly speaking , we need a broad international scandal . With my case of citizenship we \u2019ve achieved that , and , additionally , [ we \u2019ve got ] a broad public relations campaign for the ORG for free . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its submissions of DATE to ORG , the Cabinet of Ministers emphasised that the Minister of ORG had drawn attention to the provisions of LAW to the effect that in seeking NORP citizenship a candidate must demonstrate allegiance to GPE , not only with a promise but also by his actions , and that the applicant \u2019s actions were not compatible with the oath of allegiance to GPE . Having examined the information at its disposal , the Cabinet of Ministers decided that the applicant \u2019s actions at the material time had not demonstrated loyalty to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its additional submissions of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , ORG argued , inter alia , that its political decision had been based on the applicant \u2019s actions ; it was clear that he could not truthfully give a pledge of allegiance . It was evidenced by his own public statements , which indicated that he did not have a genuine link with GPE , that he did not wish to establish such a link and that he had applied for citizenship as part of a political campaign to harm GPE . The ORG quoted statements he had made during the interview on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Relying on the principle of \u201c democracy capable of protecting itself \u201d , it argued that national security , protection of others and also the ORG language were the democratic values which the ORG purported to protect . The applicant \u2019s public statements revealed that his actions were aimed at destabilising the situation in the country and that his wish to become a citizen had this purpose in mind . His statements and actions showed that he posed a real threat to national security : ( i ) the applicant was a leader of an organisation whose activities were directed towards disturbing public order and safety ; ( ii ) the organisation \u2019s activities attested to the possibility of using violence ; ( iii ) the applicant \u2019s statements indicated that he was ready to use violence ; ( iv ) the applicant \u2019s actions demonstrated his unwillingness to allow the ORG authorities to exercise legitimate control over the lawfulness of the organisation \u2019s activities ; and ( v ) the applicant \u2019s genuine aim was not to acquire NORP citizenship but to conduct an organised campaign directed at triggering a political scandal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to terminate the proceedings without examining the case on the merits . The court concluded that the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers regarding admission to NORP citizenship ( l\u0113mums par personas uz\u0146em\u0161anu Latvijas pilson\u012bb\u0101 ) was \u201c a political decision \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and as such not subject to examination by a court . The applicant appealed , stating , inter alia , that LAW could not be used as a political weapon and that a court should have full jurisdiction over such decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NORP apgabaltiesa ) upheld the decision of ORG and also considered that the decision of ORG was a political decision . The applicant appealed , stating , inter alia , that the granting of citizenship could not be used as a political weapon and that a court should have full jurisdiction over such decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG lietu departaments ) upheld the decision of ORG . The court established that , under LAW , ORG should prepare a draft decision as regards the establishment of legal facts . The final decision was taken by ORG . The ORG took its decision , based on the draft decision prepared by ORG , by a vote . Members of the ORG were not required to give reasons for their vote and the PERSON did not stipulate the details of the decision - making process in this respect . The court stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL.CARDINAL ] ... the Cabinet of Ministers [ has ] unrestricted competence as regards granting or refusing citizenship to persons who , as affirmed by ORG , have met the naturalisation criteria . Such unrestricted freedom of action , which is also in stark contrast ( krasi kontrast\u0113 ) with the detailed regulation regarding a decision of ORG , attests that ORG in such a case performs not an administrative but rather a constitutional function . Thus , ORG can not be regarded as a public authority for the purposes of administrative procedure . Therefore , the argument stated in the ancillary complaint that the said decision meets all criteria of an administrative act is unfounded .", "Having regard to the above , the conclusion of [ ORG ] that the decision appealed against can not be regarded as an administrative act , but as a political decision , is correct . ...", "[ CARDINAL ] In ORG view , if a person meets all the requirements for naturalisation and if no restrictions for naturalisation are applicable , [ there is ] a subjective right only to have a draft decision concerning acquisition of citizenship examined by ORG .", "[ CARDINAL ] The fact that the legislation does not set out a procedure for appeal against a decision of ORG does not mean that such decision is subject to appeal like an administrative act , in accordance with LAW . There is no established practice in GPE of indicating expressis verbis in a legal act that the relevant decision is not subject to appeal ...", "[ CARDINAL ] ... In ORG view , the laws of GPE provide for the possibility of monitoring ( kontrol\u0113t ) decisions taken on naturalisation issues . That is to say , decisions taken by ORG ( administrative acts ) are subject to appeal before a court , in accordance with LAW , whereas if a decision of ORG or a part of it is incompatible with the law , a public prosecutor can submit an application for supervisory review ( protests ) under section CARDINAL of the PERSON on ORG . Therefore , the [ applicant \u2019s ] reference to [ LAW is unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
