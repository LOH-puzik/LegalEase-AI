It held DATE on the basis of testimonial , documentary and surveillance evidence of phone conversations between CARDINAL of the co - accused , his wife and a third party DATE that there was reasonable suspicion that on DATE the applicant and his colleagues had asked CARDINAL NORP nationals to pay them money in order to allow them to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE prosecutor PERSON , who was attached to the N.A.D. , authorised several police officers to enforce a warrant to appear ( mandat de aducere ) issued in the applicant \u2019s name and the names of the CARDINAL coaccused . According to the order to appear produced by the ORG , the applicant \u2019s presence was required in order for him to be heard as an accused ( \u020bnvinuit ) in the criminal investigation instituted against him in DATE . No other reasons or considerations were stated on the order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL police officers went to the applicant \u2019s workplace to enforce the warrant to appear . According to the report produced by the police officers and signed by the applicant , he was shown the warrant to appear and was informed that he would be taken to the N.A.D. \u2019s LOC . He was also informed that he could contact and retain the services of a legal representative of his own choosing . He refused to do so because he considered that he did not need one . The applicant and the escorting police officers left the applicant \u2019s workplace at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , PERSON informed the applicant in the presence of a publicly appointed legal representative that a criminal investigation had been opened against him for bribe - taking . According to the documents submitted before the ORG , and signed by the applicant and his legal representative , he had refused to retain a legal representative of his own choosing and had accepted assistance from a publicly appointed lawyer . According to the statement made before the prosecutor , he notified the authorities that he suffered from diabetes and that he needed his insulin treatment , which would have to be brought from his workplace . In addition , he requested the authorities to notify his wife in the event of his placement in police custody . He also stated that he reaffirmed the statement he had made previously concerning the events in connection with which he was being investigated . According to the record of the applicant \u2019s statement , he was heard as an accused by the prosecutor at ORG offices from TIME to TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was informed that at TIME he had been charged with bribe - taking . According to the report produced by the authorities and signed by the applicant and his legal representative he refused to make any statement as a defendant ( inculpat ) and reaffirmed the statement he had made as an accused .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE the N.A.D. placed the applicant in police custody for TIME commencing at TIME for bribetaking . The arrest order was signed by both the applicant and his legal representative . It stated that on the basis of the available evidence there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant had accepted money from NORP nationals for the purpose of allowing them to return to GPE . It also stated that the offence in question was punishable by over DATE imprisonment and his release would constitute a danger to public order , bearing in mind that he was a border guard officer and had committed the offence at his workplace .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on testimonial , documentary and audio surveillance evidence , the ORG asked the domestic courts to detain the applicant pending trial .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the ORG \u2019s request and ordered the applicant \u2019s release on condition that he remain in the country . It held that the available evidence was plagued by inconsistencies which should have been resolved by the investigating authorities . In addition , except for the seriousness of the offence , none of the other legal requirements for detaining the applicant pending trial had been met . In particular , there was no evidence in the file that he had attempted to abscond or to obstruct justice . Also , it had not been proven that his release would be a danger to public order , given that the events in question had occurred in DATE and that the applicant was not responsible for the length of the criminal investigation . Consequently , it considered that the implementation of an alternative measure was more appropriate in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a second instance court , dismissed as ill - founded an appeal by the N.A.D. against the interlocutory judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of bribe - taking and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL .

He argued that the prosecutor had obtained testimonial evidence against him in breach of domestic and international criminal procedure rules and had detained him for TIME instead of the CARDINAL allowed by law . In addition , there had been no reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence , nor had the other legally - required criteria for his detention been met . Also , he had been subjected to intense physical and psychological suffering because the order to appear issued by the prosecutor had been unjustified and devoid of grounds , in breach of LAW ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . Lastly , he had been refused a medical examination , medical treatment and food for the entire time he was under the authorities\u2019 control , even though he had notified them of his medical condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings seeking to have prosecutor PERSON removed from the case on the grounds that he had instituted criminal proceedings against him in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a final order delivered on DATE , the hierarchically superior prosecutor attached to ORG , namely ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s action of CARDINAL DATE on the ground that there was no evidence in the file that PERSON had had a personal interest in the outcome of the case or that he had had a feud with CARDINAL of the parties in the case . The fact that the applicant had instituted criminal proceedings against him was not an incompatibility ground provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of DATE the public prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint of DATE against the prosecutor PERSON on the grounds that the offences cited by the applicant were inexistent and that his claims amounted to a complaint against the acts and measures carried out by the prosecutor during the investigation stage of the criminal proceedings instituted against him . The purpose of a criminal complaint was not , however , to censor the acts and measures carried out by a prosecutor . The lawfulness of such measures could only be examined within the framework of a complaint lodged with the hierarchically superior prosecutor against the acts and measures carried out by the investigating prosecutor . The applicant appealed against the order before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By interlocutory judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ORG ordered that the investigation file be attached to the court \u2019s file and that PERSON be summoned before the court . According to the applicant , neither the investigation file nor PERSON was ever presented to the court .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the order of DATE . It held that the applicant \u2019s complaints concerned investigative acts carried out by PERSON During ongoing criminal proceedings , other legal remedies are available to the accused or the defendant(s ) by virtue of the criminal procedure rules , and these could have been used here to express dissatisfaction in respect of the alleged breaches of the procedural rules and of their lawful rights . In this connection , the court identified several complaints the applicant could have lodged within the framework of the criminal proceedings instituted against him , namely a complaint against the prosecutor \u2019s orders for preventive measures and based on Article CARDINAL et seq . , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL et seq . , and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG . In addition to the aforementioned legal remedies , the defendants had other lawful means of lodging complaints against the person investigating or supervising the investigation of their case . However , a criminal complaint lodged against the prosecutor who had carried out the investigation in criminal proceedings that were still pending was not one of the legal means the applicant could have used , as it opened up the possibility of having aspects of legality regarding the pending criminal trial examined outside the framework expressly provided by LAW and of examining aspects of the criminal proceedings instituted against him . Moreover , the procedure allowing the prosecutor \u2019s orders to be challenged before domestic courts did not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of the judicial organs charged with the examination of the pending criminal proceedings instituted against him . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against ORG seeking an injunction to force that court to examine both the appeal on points of law lodged by him against the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the unconstitutionality objections raised by him after the previously mentioned judgment was delivered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by a final judgment delivered in private , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE as inadmissible . It held that , following recent law reforms , judgments delivered by the domestic courts in proceedings challenging the legality of a prosecutor \u2019s decision not to institute criminal proceedings were no longer appealable before CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action of DATE . It held that ordering ORG to examine his appeal on points of law would breach the principle of legal certainty . In addition , an unconstitutionality objection had been raised by the applicant after the proceedings had ended on DATE and there was no legal framework that would allow ORG to force another court to examine them . The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and according to him , the appeal was dismissed as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought criminal proceedings with no civil claims against the prosecutor L.P. for abuse of office against the public interest , incitement to the unlawful exercise of a profession and to perjury , incitement to unlawful perversion of justice , and incitement to the retention and destruction of documents . He claimed that , as ORG \u2019s hierarchically superior prosecutor , ORG had approved the criminal - investigation measures undertaken by ORG , including the evidence dismissed and gathered by him , and had allowed PERSON to detain him and institute the criminal proceedings against him , even though he had been aware that he was innocent .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint against ORG on the grounds that the offences cited by the applicant were non - existent . It held that the complaints lodged by the applicant against ORG were related to those lodged by him against PERSON In the latter \u2019s case the public prosecutor \u2019s office had already discontinued the criminal investigation for similar reasons . The applicant appealed against the order before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the order of DATE . It held that ORG had neither investigated the applicant \u2019s case nor undertaken any acts or measures in this respect . He had merely approved the proposal submitted by PERSON before the domestic courts to detain the applicant pending trial . The fact that he had examined and dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints in respect of the legality of the criminal proceedings instituted against him did not engage his criminal liability . In the absence of evidence to suggest that the prosecutor had acted unlawfully or that he had breached his duties , the applicant \u2019s arguments in support of his complaint could not be assessed within the framework of a criminal investigation . Most of the applicant \u2019s complaints were in fact arguments in his defence based on challenges to the way the evidence had been produced , the measures undertaken and the procedural flaws . According to the relevant criminal procedure rules , such complaints could be raised by the applicant before the domestic courts examining his case but could not be interpreted as constituting the elements of an offence . The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by a final judgment delivered in private , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE as inadmissible . It held that , following recent law reforms , judgments delivered by the domestic courts in proceedings challenging the legality of a prosecutor \u2019s decision not to institute criminal proceedings were no longer appealable before QUANTITY of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought criminal proceedings with no civil claims against prosecutors ORG for breach of the secrecy of his correspondence , amongst other things . He argued that the CARDINAL prosecutors had unlawfully monitored his electronic mail correspondence during DATE and in DATE had publicly presented the content of CARDINAL of his electronic mails in court .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the criminal proceedings with no civil claims that had been brought by the applicant against prosecutor PERSON for forgery and use of forged documents during the course of the criminal proceedings conducted by the said prosecutor against him . It held that the offences alleged by him were in fact allegations of breaches of procedural rules by the prosecutor investigating his case , which could have been examined by the appellate courts over the course of the criminal proceedings instituted against him , particularly since the proceedings in question were still pending before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of CARDINAL DATE ORG attached to ORG dismissed criminal proceedings that had been instituted by the applicant against prosecutors ORG on DATE on the grounds that no unlawful act had been committed . The applicant did not appeal against the order before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of CARDINAL DATE , the public prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG dismissed criminal proceedings that had been instituted by the applicant against , inter alia , prosecutors ORG for slanderous denunciation , unlawful arrest and abusive investigation , and forgery on the grounds that , amongst other things , the available evidence did not suggest the existence of any offence committed by the aforementioned prosecutors . The applicant did not challenge the decision before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL .

In his initial submission to the ORG on DATE the applicant stated that on DATE at TIME the QUANTITY police officers holding the warrant to appear had taken him to the ORG \u2019s office . At the ORG \u2019s office he had been left waiting in a room until TIME , when the police officers informed him that he needed to retain the services of a legal representative .
