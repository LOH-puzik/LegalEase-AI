The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the time of the events , he was a bank armoured vehicle driver .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant went around an illegally parked bus while driving an armoured vehicle . While he was completing the manoeuvre , the bus started moving and to prevent having an accident with the armoured vehicle it stopped abruptly . As a result of the sudden stop a bus passenger , C. , fell from her seat and suffered moderately severe injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation was initiated . The prosecutor heard the applicant , the victim C. , the bus driver NORP , a witness who had been sitting in the applicant \u2019s vehicle and another CARDINAL witnesses who had been passengers on the bus ( S. and PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP was charged with violating traffic rules , resulting in C. \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and NORP were interviewed face - to - face . According to the applicant , he had completed the manoeuvre around the stationary bus and taken the lane in front of it after making sure the bus was still stationary .

According to NORP , the applicant \u2019s car had turned right without any warning and he had been forced to stop abruptly to prevent an accident .", "CARDINAL .

The court also examined a site investigation report and a sketch map of the scene of the incident , both drawn up on DATE at TIME in only NORP \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL . The court considered the testimony of C. and the CARDINAL bus passengers unreliable . They claimed that the applicant had performed a sudden manoeuvre which had obliged NORP to suddenly stop the bus . The court considered that none of them had seen any of the events themselves and that their impression that the applicant was guilty was because the bus driver blamed him . The court also considered D. \u2019s testimony unreliable because the same charges had been previously brought against him . The court noted that charges had been brought against the applicant based on statements by NORP made shortly after the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued , without re - interviewing the other witnesses . The court also noted that the site investigation report and the sketch map had not been drawn up immediately after the incident , that the police had gone to the scene TIME and had been joined only by NORP , that the applicant \u2019s objections had not been reflected in the documents , and that the sketch map did not correspond to the statements given by all the witnesses shortly after the incident .", "CARDINAL .

The court upheld the prosecutor \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed the appellate judgment and ordered a rehearing of the case in accordance with the provisions of LAW , namely that any examination had to be in accordance with the rules applicable in proceedings before the first - instance court . The court found that the appellate court had not thoroughly stated its position on the assessment of the statements made by ORG , NORP and the CARDINAL passengers , but had merely relied on evidence in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "CARDINAL . After rehearing the case , on DATE ORG dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment .
