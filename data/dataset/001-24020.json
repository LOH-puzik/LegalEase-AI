He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered GPE illegally on or DATE and on DATE claimed asylum on the basis that he feared persecution as a homosexual . He stated that security forces had come to his house because of a satellite television and had become suspicious of the double beds , which he used with his homosexual partner , along with his cousin and his partner . According to his account , CARDINAL were arrested for having a satellite dish and detained for DATE and beaten . His partner confessed to being homosexual and they were remanded in custody . After being held in prison for DATE , he was released on the payment of bribes by his family who feared that he would face the death sentence as a homosexual . He left GPE on DATE .", "By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected the asylum application . He found it lacking in credibility that the authorities had kept him so long in custody if they intended to execute him and noted that the applicant had not claimed asylum on arrival in GPE . However , the ground of rejection was that he was not satisfied that the applicant was in fact NORP . The applicant appealed to the Adjudicator raising complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE , the Adjudicator rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . He examined the extent of risk to homosexuals in GPE . It appeared that in theory homosexuality in GPE was punished harshly but that in practice the strict regulations , requiring CARDINAL eye witnesses to the act of homosexual penetration or CARDINAL confessions from each active partner , rendered convictions hard to achieve . CARDINAL source was quoted as not having come across any case that went to trial and another that it was so hard to prosecute a case of homosexuality that it almost never happened . Another sociologist and researcher stated that homosexuality was a common phenomenon in GPE and was tolerated as long as it did not disturb public order and remained in private . The Adjudicator concluded that it was extremely unlikely that homosexual activity conducted in private would result in ill - treatment or harassment . Insofar therefore as the applicant alleged that he had been detained on ground of his homosexuality and brought before a court , he observed that there was no question of there being QUANTITY eyewitnesses to any sexual act . He considered it most unlikely that the security forces acted as the applicant alleged , that the account of his escape was implausible and that the applicant had not been telling the truth about what happened . As the applicant had not expressed any prospect of continuing a relationship with his partner and was not at risk of punishment for acts conducted in private , he found no issue arising under LAW , notwithstanding the criminal prohibition in GPE was in likely breach of this provision .", "The applicant applied for leave to appeal in ORG . His grounds relied on LAW and the existence of a law in GPE prohibiting adult consensual activity which would breach that provision .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal , finding no error of law and that the Adjudicator had quite properly found that there would be no breach of the applicant \u2019s human rights if removed to GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s application for legal aid to bring judicial proceedings was refused by ORG on DATE . His request for review of the refusal was refused on DATE .", "The applicant may be expelled at any time but directions for his removal have not yet been issued .", "This report dated DATE stated in respect of homosexuals :", "\u201c CARDINAL Although homosexuality is never spoken about and thus a hidden issue , in practice it is not difficult to encounter homosexuals in GPE . There are special parks in GPE , known as homosexual meeting places ... A different sexual orientation may , however create problems . Still , homosexuality is practised DATE and as long as this happens behind closed doors within your own CARDINAL walls , and as long as people do not intend to proselytise \u2018 ORG or homosexuality , they will most likely remain unharmed .", "CARDINAL Technically , homosexual behaviour is sharply condemned by ORG and the NORP code of law ( LAW law ) ... Sodomy is punishable by death if both parties are considered to be adults of sound mind and free will . It must be proven by either CARDINAL confessions from the accused , the testimony of CARDINAL righteous men who witnessed the act or through the knowledge of a Sharia judge \u2018 derived through customary ORG . If the accused repents before the witnesses testify , the penalty \u2018 will be ORG . ...", "CARDINAL NORP So far , no cases of execution only on grounds of homosexual relations have been identified . In fact , the burden of proof is quite high and it would be difficult to prove homosexual liaisons or intercourse . According to some local newspapers there have been instances of execution of homosexuals . It is not confirmed whether the homosexual act alone led to the execution or whether the person was accused on other charges too .", "CARDINAL . DATE there were reports that a man accused of sodomising and then murdering his nephew was to be thrown over a cliff in a sack . This was given widespread publicity by the NORP opposition in the GPE and was taken up by the other wires , but we have heard no reports that the sentence was ever carried out .", "CARDINAL . However , jurisprudence , burden of proof notwithstanding , certainly has used accusations of homosexuality . Furthermore , it does happen that homosexuality is mentioned as CARDINAL of the accusations amongst other offences held against the defendant . For instance , accusations of homosexuality have been used in unfair trials , such as the case of a NORP leader in PERSON in DATE who was clearly prosecuted for political reasons . There have also been other political cases , although not in the recent past .", "CARDINAL . According to the NORP of DATE valid to DATE sentences of imprisonment for DATE and up to CARDINAL lashes are possible . The death penalty may also be incurred if the act is deemed \u2018 LAW against God and corruption on earth\u2019 . Since DATE the revised NORP omits direct threat of lashes or the death penalty . The penalties of lashing and of death are , however , still judicial options , even though they are not mentioned in the revised NORP . Reports suggest that since DATE they have been rarely used . The most recent report of execution [ which ] is of the death by stoning of a man dates from DATE , on charges of repeated acts of \u2018 adultery and ORG Reports of use of the death penalty in cases where the only offence is sodomy are extremely difficult to substantiate , and are held to be an unlikely sentence . More usually lashing is the punishment .", "CARDINAL . However , strict though the legal position is , expert opinion consulted by the NORP IRB [ ORG ] states \u2018 ... in practice ( homosexuality ) is presently , and has been in the past , for the most part tolerantly treated and frequently occurring ... In practice it is only public transgression of NORP morals that is condemned and therefore NORP law stresses the role of eye - witnesses to an offence\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . The same source stated that the police are not empowered nor do they actively pursue homosexual activity of any kind that is performed behind the \u2018 veil of decency\u2019 of closed doors .", "CARDINAL . Sources indicate that there are held to be many differing levels of homosexual activity within NORP society . In rural areas , even \u2018 lavat\u2019\u2013 sexual behaviour between men - can be considered socially to be compensatory sexual behaviour for heterosexual sexual intercourse , and the practitioners held not to be homosexuals . The key offensive practice is sodomy , or more particularly to be sodomised , as an unnatural inversion of God \u2019s creation , and some experts hold that \u2018 homosexuals\u2019 are understood in GPE to be willing passive partners . \u201d", "This report , cited in the CIPU above and in the Adjudicator \u2019s decision in this case stated inter alia :", "\u201c Theoretically , homosexual behaviour is sharply condemned by ORG , but in practice it is present , and has been in the past , for the most part tolerantly treated and frequently occurring in countries where NORP predominates ... In practice it is only public transgression of NORP morals that is condemned , and therefore NORP law stresses the role of eye - witnesses to an offense . The police are not allowed to go in search of possible sinners , who can only be caught red - handed , and not behind the \u201c veil of decency \u201d of their closed doors ... The generally tolerant attitude toward homosexual practice can partly be explained by the fact that it will usually take place discreetly . Moreover it does not have serious personal consequences such as for example , heterosexual adultery would have . ...", "According to the representative of ORG for NORP and NORP Concerns ... who is also an activist working with ORG ... none of the few known executions of homosexuals and lesbians in GPE were carried out on the sole basis of homosexuality . ...", "In its DATE report ORG states that :", "The strict regulations for submission of evidence , CARDINAL male witnesses to the homosexual penetration , alternatively CARDINAL confessions from each of the active partners , renders a sentence for homosexuality almost impossible in practice . The police and justice administration do not take active measures to investigate the existence of homosexuality , nor do they actively hunt homosexuals . All in all , the situation in practice in GPE is drastically different from the impression conveyed by the Shari\u2019a inspired penal code . According to the information from usually very reliable sources , no homosexuals have been executed in GPE for DATE . In order to risk policiary sanctions \u2013 maltreatment or a short time in custody / jail , regardless of the fact that the penalty according to the law is death or whipping - a homosexual couple must behave with great indiscretion , almost provocatively , in a public place .", "According to a sociologist specializing on GPE and charg\u00e9e de conferences at FAC ( GPE ) , the law stipulates that people engaging in sexual relations with a person of the same sex ... would only be put on trial if the prosecution can produce CARDINAL righteous men who witnessed the sexual act , or CARDINAL of the partners admits to having sexual relations with another man ... If there are CARDINAL men to testify to the homosexuality of a person , the accusation of homosexual activities can not be proven . The sociologist stated that it would be suicidal to \u2018 admit one \u2019s homosexuality\u2019 and added that such an admission is implausible . In practice , the burden of proof lies so heavily on the prosecution that ... a homosexual will very rarely be tried or sentenced . The sociologist has never come across any case that went to trial and stated there are many more stonings for heterosexual relations prior to marriage and for adultery than for homosexuality .", "Another sociologist ... at ORG stated ... that legislative repression is not directed against \u2018 homosexuals\u2019 but against heterosexual relations outside marriage . Repressing \u2018 homosexual GPE is rare for the security forces because of the difficulty of identifying who is \u2018 ORG and who is not since NORP men have very close physical contact ( holding hands and kissing ) which is socially acceptable behaviour in GPE . It is very rare that a person would be arrested for \u2018 homosexuality\u2019 but if a person were arrested and convicted as a homosexual the punishment would be harsh .", "According to another sociologist and a researcher on GPE with the ORG , although NORP and NORP laws punish \u2018 homosexuality\u2019 by death , in practice , it rarely happens , except in the cases of pedophilia ... \u2018 Homosexuality\u2019 is a common phenomenon and is tolerated as long as it does not disturb public order and remains a private activity . It would be repressed only when made public and asserted , an implausible occurrence in GPE .", "A DATE letter from the Director of ORG at ORG in GPE states that :", "Furthermore it is not known that NORP authorities are actively taking legal actions against homosexuals . It is most unlikely that the authorities would take proceedings against a homosexual as long as he does not manifest his disposition in an open and public manner . As far as ORG knows not anyone has been prosecuted on homosexuality charges alone in GPE for DATE .", "There are many indications that there is a significant difference between the legal texts and the practice of the security forces .", "As far as the behaviour of homosexual persons can be taken as a relevant indication about the degree of oppression of homosexuals , the impression is rather that the situation in GPE is relatively tolerant , since homosexuality is by no means unusual in GPE . Certain \u2018 health ORG in GPE are for example known to be frequented by homosexuals . Furthermore , it is by no means unusual to meet openly homosexual persons \u2013under otherwise heterosexual private circumstances like social events .", "... There is a park in central GPE called GPE ( student ) that is famous and well - known as a place where men who are looking for sexual relationships with other men meet . The sociologist added that the public and the security forces are aware of the park \u2019s reputation ... \u201d", "", "A NORP fact - finding mission to GPE in DATE reported :", "\u201c CARDINAL Homosexuals", "During their visit to GPE , the delegation had an opportunity to discuss the situation for homosexuals in GPE with several of their contacts .", "... A NORP embassy said that it had never heard of cases relating solely to homosexuality . According to the same source , however , a man who had been charged with CARDINAL counts of indecent behaviour had been executed DATE ... He had also been found guilty of raping a DATE boy in his shop .", "According to a NORP source familiar with the homosexual scene in GPE , it had never heard of cases being brought against homosexuals . The source thought that the homosexual community would be aware of any cases being brought against persons solely on the grounds of their homosexuality .", "A source connected with a NORP news agency thought that any cases brought against homosexuals would not be brought to public attention . In view of that fact , the source could not rule out the possibility that there might be cases where the charge relates to homosexuality . In that connection the source referred to a case in a military prison where a prisoner let slip to a warder about a homosexual relationship he had had . The prisoner was subsequently sentenced to CARDINAL lashes .", "According to a government source , homosexuals do not experience any problems in NORP society ; in other words , few cases relating to homosexuality have been brought before the courts .", "However , according to a source with good knowledge of the NORP judicial system , many cases concerning homosexuality have been brought before the NORP courts . The source was unable to provide further details of the cases in question . With regard to sentences passed in such cases , the source could say only that the death penalty had been pronounced in several . The source added that if a case was not fully substantiated , it was for the judge to decide on the punishment .", "When the delegation asked why such cases were brought , the source replied that this was because CARDINAL of the parties involved in the homosexual relationship had contacted the courts .", "According to a government source , a person can not accuse himself . With regard to homosexuality , this means that DATE in his opinion \u2013 if an NORP citizen reveals himself as a homosexual in a NORP newspaper , nothing will happen to that person when he returns to GPE .", "Several Western sources , including CARDINAL embassy , said independently that homosexuals do not face problems in GPE DATE . There are places where homosexuals meet ... \u201d", "In this case , the ORG rejected the complaints of the complainant who complained that the GPE were proposing to expel him to GPE where as a homosexual he claimed that he had previously been detained and tortured for his homosexuality and would face further risk of torture . It noted the contradictions and inconsistencies in his account and also \u201c from different and reliable sources that there is currently no active policy of prosecution of charges of homosexuality in GPE \u201d .
