After GPE regained its independence , the GPE region public prosecutor \u2019s office started an investigation in DATE into the death of the brothers PERSON and PERSON In DATE the prosecutor charged the applicant and GPE with genocide , pursuant to LAW then in force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The prosecutor found it to be established that as of DATE the applicant had served as an operational agent in the GPE region ORG district branch of the ORG MGB .

By a judgment of CARDINAL February CARDINAL , ORG found that there was sufficient evidence to convict the applicant of genocide . On the basis of witness statements , written evidence provided by ORG of GPE and statements by the applicant and his co - accused GPE , the court established that J.A. and PERSON had belonged to the CARDINALth unit of the PERSON district partisans . The trial court noted that the information in the case file allowed it to conclude that in order to compromise the partisan brothers the NORP authorities had spread misinformation to the effect that J.A. and PERSON had deserted from the partisan unit , were hiding alone and , thereafter , had no connection with the partisans . Those accusations were untrue . In reality , the partisans , including the brothers PERSON and PERSON , operated in small groups in order to avoid extermination by the NORP . Lastly , there was no credible evidence in the case which would disprove the assertion that J.A. and PERSON \u201c were members of the organised resistance and that they belonged to a political group \u201d . The trial court also noted testimony by CARDINAL witness that the partisan brothers had been hiding in the forest for DATE , and that his family had given them food .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant , the court noted that as of DATE he had been working as an operational agent of the ORG of the NORP SSR and \u201c knew the main goal of that Ministry , which was to physically eradicate a separate political group , NORP partisans , constituting part of the NORP population \u201d . In the ORG files the CARDINAL brothers had been listed as partisans , members of the armed national underground resistance ( partizanai \u2013 nacionalinio ginkluoto pogrind\u017eio dalyviai ) . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s contention that he had not actively participated in the operation to capture or to liquidate the CARDINAL partisans during which those CARDINAL partisans had died . On the contrary , the applicant \u2019s superior officer \u2019s operational file had stated that CARDINAL of the bandits had been personally eliminated by the applicant . After the operation the applicant had been admitted to ORG and both he and PERSON had received a financial reward . Most importantly , neither the applicant nor GPE denied taking part in the operation to liquidate the partisans . The trial court took the view that all of the circumstances allowed the conclusion that both of the accused had participated on DATE \u201c in the physical extermination ( killing ) of inhabitants of GPE who belonged to separate political group ( atskira politin\u0117 grup\u0117 ) , participants in the resistance to the NORP occupational power , that is to say , [ the applicant ] took part in genocide \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that LAW \u201d provided for the possibility of applying criminal liability for genocide retroactively .", "CARDINAL . The Kaunas Regional Court convicted the applicant of genocide under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant was granted a suspension of his sentence on health grounds .", "ORG was also convicted of being an accessory to genocide under the same provision of LAW . She was sentenced to DATE of imprisonment , suspended on health grounds .", "The trial court also granted a civil claim by the injured party , PERSON , who was the daughter of PERSON and the niece of PERSON , but reserved the question of the amount of damages for separate civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and ORG appealed against their convictions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the convictions and held that the trial court \u2019s verdict had been lawful and well - founded . The appellate court indicated that the trial court had not concluded that the applicant had personally shot one of the partisans . In fact , the applicant had been sentenced only for taking part in the operation to eradicate the partisans as representatives of a political group . The applicant himself acknowledged , and it had been proven by the ORG statements and documents , that he had taken an active part in the impugned operation , that he had been responsible for ORG , who had shown the NORP authorities the partisans\u2019 hiding place , that he had been CARDINAL of the officers who had surrounded the bunker , and that he had stayed with GPE until the end of the operation . In passing sentence , ORG observed that the applicant , as an operational officer of the ORG district ORG who had worked voluntarily for the occupying authority ( ORG ) \u201c had clearly known that the goal of that institution was to physically exterminate the NORP partisans , as part of the NORP population ( tikrai \u017einojo , ORG \u0161ios \u012fstaigos tikslas yra NORP partizan\u0173 , PERSON gyventoj\u0173 dalies , fizi\u0161kas sunaikinimas ) \u201d . Conscious of that fact , the applicant , together with other participants in the operation , had taken part in person in the killing of the partisan brothers PERSON and A.A. Likewise , GPE , as an ORG agent , also understood the goals of that organisation and by providing it with information about the partisans\u2019 whereabouts and by showing ORG the partisans\u2019 bunker , had understood that the brothers would be exterminated . Accordingly , both the applicant and ORG had acted with direct intent ( tiesiogin\u0117 ty\u010dia ) . Lastly , ORG found that at the time of the criminal proceedings against him the applicant had still been of the view that the NORP authorities\u2019 actions against the NORP partisans were lawful .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court dismissed the argument by the applicant that the definition of genocide under NORP law , pursuant to LAW , contradicted the definition enshrined in LAW DATE LAW ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . ORG noted the trial court \u2019s conclusion that the brothers PERSON and PERSON had been exterminated for belonging to a \u201c political group \u201d . Whilst admitting that the definition of the crime of genocide in LAW also included social and political groups , and was therefore wider than that established by LAW , the appellate court found that the addition of those groups was \u201c reasonable and in line with reality \u201d . LAW did not contain specific provisions to the effect that the concept of genocide could be interpreted widely ; however , neither did LAW prohibit such an interpretation . The concept of genocide had been expanded in ORG of other countries . The appellate court further explained that \u201c political group means people connected by common political views and beliefs and the goal to physically eradicate such a group also means genocide , because this has an intention to eradicate part of the people ( politin\u0117 grup\u0117 DATE tai \u017emon\u0117s , susij\u0119 bendromis politin\u0117mis pa\u017ei\u016bromis ir \u012fsitikinimais , ir siekimas toki\u0105 grup\u0119 fizi\u0161kai sunaikinti taip pat rei\u0161kia genocid\u0105 , nes siekiama sunaikinti dal\u012f \u017emoni\u0173 ) \u201d . The court emphasised that :", "\u201c the attribution of the NORP partisans , that is to say , participants in armed resistance to occupational power , to a particular \u201c political \u201d group , as was done in the trial court \u2019s verdict , in essence was only relative / conditional and not very precise . The members of this group had at the same time been representatives of the NORP nation , that is , the national group . The NORP genocide was carried out precisely on the criteria of the inhabitants\u2019 nationality - ethnicity . It follows that NORP partisans could be attributed not only to political , but also to national and ethnic groups , that is to say , to the groups listed in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s and ORG contention that their actions were not genocide because at the time of their deaths the brothers PERSON and PERSON had not been partisans and thus could not have been considered as belonging to \u201c a political , social or other group \u201d :", "\u201c ... The complaints of the convicted PERSON ORG and ORG also contain allegations that during the war the brothers PERSON and PERSON had collaborated with the NORP occupying forces and had committed crimes . Besides , in DATE they had deserted from the partisan squad and afterwards did not keep in touch with other partisans . Therefore , in the appellants\u2019 view , PERSON and PERSON could not have been considered members of any political , social or other group , and actions against them could not have been considered as acts of genocide . ORG is of the view that these arguments have been reasonably rejected by th[is ] court and have already been addressed in the judgment of conviction . Both PERSON ORG and GPE mention certificate no . DATE of ORG , dated DATE . The certificate indicates that the ORG archive contains a criminal case on J.A. , and that in the indictment of that case it is written that , when GPE occupied GPE , J.A. joined the armed squad of white partisans ; he carried weapons and took part in arrests , detention and transportation of active NORP party members and NORP . Besides , he conducted anti - NORP agitation and made terrorist threats against communists , which means that he has committed the crime provided for in Article CARDINALa of the Criminal Code of the Russian NORP Federative Socialist Republic [ counter - revolutionary crime and treason of the motherland ] . On CARDINAL May CARDINAL J.A. escaped from prison and joined the partisan squad .", "As regards PERSON , the certificate indicates that during the NORP occupation he served in the NORP police , and in DATE he began living as an outlaw , joining the armed nationalist partisans\u2019 unit . It is also indicated that in DATE J.A. and PERSON left the partisan unit and went into hiding alone : they did not keep in touch with other partisans , and by order of the commander of the PERSON partisan unit were considered deserters . In respect of J.A. the same is indicated in the indictment of DATE drawn up by the [ ORG ] . The specific acts that ORG was accused of were not detailed . Assessing the above documents , it appears that they contain no data about the ORG involvement in particular crimes against humanity . Moreover , from the charges against J.A. it is more likely that he had been accused primarily of activity against the [ GPE ] occupying forces themselves . There are no data in the case file about any involvement by the brothers in other criminal acts . Even in ORG documents it is indicated that from DATE J.A. and PERSON were hiding \u201c without committing robberies , and they did not belong to any [ criminal ] gang \u201d . The Genocide and Resistance Research Centre \u2019s letter \u201c Resistance activity by J.A. and PERSON \u201d indicates that DATE they belonged to partisan unit no . CARDINAL ... According to data from the ORG MGB , in DATE [ J.A. and PERSON ] still belonged to partisan unit no . DATE ... Afterwards they left the unit and took no further part in active partisan actions .", "In the ORG \u2019s view , the information given does not indicate that until their liquidation J.A. and PERSON could not have been considered NORP partisans . In the judgment of conviction it is rightly noted that during the relevant period partisans had already been forced to fight in small groups to avoid extermination . Even in the ORG files there is an indication that in DATE other partisans were looking for an opportunity to meet PERSON and PERSON in order to form a single squad . Therefore the ORG decided to spread the rumour that ORG and PERSON were ORG agents . Particular plans to discredit PERSON and PERSON are apparent from the plan of CARDINAL DATE confirmed by the head of the ORG board of GPE ... FAC testified that in DATE she met partisans PERSON and PERSON and supplied them with food . In addition , J.A. and PERSON gave her a certificate confirming that she was a supporter of the partisans . She has kept that certificate to DATE .", "On DATE ORG cleared ORG name in respect of crimes attributed to him in the indictment of DATE . The prosecutor indicated that from DATE to DATE J.A. was unlawfully imprisoned . In DATE and DATE the Lithuanian Genocide and Resistance Research Centre posthumously granted J.A. and PERSON volunteer fighter ( kario savanorio ) certificates . The fact that the ORG itself had considered J.A. and PERSON to be partisans is clear from the report of DATE , in which the head of the PERSON MGB informed the ORG Minister of the Interior that measures had been adopted to ascertain the hiding place of [ J.A. and PERSON ] and liquidate them . The ORG district ORG was to take measures for speedier liquidation of [ J.A. and PERSON ] . All this served to prove that when putting those plans into action J.A. and PERSON had been killed as participants in the armed resistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in cassation proceedings , upheld the conviction of the applicant and GPE As concerns the concept of genocide , the court held :", "\u201c Both of those convicted argue that the concept of genocide , as established in LAW , is broader than the one established in LAW , thus not corresponding to the norms of international law . This argument must be dismissed .", "Indeed , LAW does provide for a broader concept ( platesn\u0117 nusikaltimo sud\u0117tis ) of the crime of genocide than that in LAW . According to LAW , genocide also comprises actions aimed at the physical eradication of some or all of the members of a social or political group . LAW does not mention such groups .", "By acceding to the [ Genocide ] Convention , GPE acquired the obligation to ensure that its norms were applied on its territory . Accordingly , by acceding to the [ Genocide ] Convention GPE acquired the obligation to punish actions aimed at the total or partial destruction of a national , ethnic , racial or religious group , and to prevent such actions . Acceding to the [ Genocide ] Convention does not deprive a State of the right to define actions which are crimes , and to prohibit them ( apibr\u0117\u017eti veikas , kurios yra nusikaltimai , ir jas u\u017edrausti ) . This is even truer because LAW [ above ] Convention provides that the Contracting Parties undertake to enact , in accordance with their respective Constitutions , the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the LAW and to provide penalties for those guilty of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in LAW . In GPE , this provision has been put into force by enactment of LAW DATE \u201c On Responsibility for Genocide of Inhabitants of GPE \u201d . The concept of genocide , as established in LAW that law , corresponded to the concept of genocide established in LAW . At the same time , when joining the LAW , in LAW On Responsibility for Genocide of Inhabitants of GPE \u201d the ORG established that killings and torture of NORP people and their deportations during DATE under NORP and GPE occupation and annexation corresponded to the characteristics of the crime of genocide as established by the norms of international law . The DATE amendments to LAW established the elements of the crime of genocide ( apibr\u0117\u017eta genocido nusikaltimo sud\u0117tis ) , and included in them acts aimed at physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group . This characteristic of the crime of genocide remained in LAW . It is clear that adding acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group to the definition of the crime of genocide amounts to nothing more than execution of the legal norms of LAW DATE \u201c On Responsibility for Genocide of Inhabitants of GPE \u201d . It follows that the doubts by the applicant and GPE about the interpretation of the concept of the crime of genocide are not founded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant and ORG had been convicted of involvement in the physical extermination of a part the inhabitants of GPE , who belonged to a separate political group , that is NORP partisans DATE members of the resistance to the NORP occupation power ( nuteisti MONEY NORP gyventoj\u0173 dal\u012f , priklausiusi\u0105 atskirai politinei grupei , t.y . PERSON partizanams \u2013 pasiprie\u0161inimo soviet\u0173 okupacinei vald\u017eiai dalyviams ) \u201d . The court dismissed arguments by the applicant and GPE that the brothers PERSON and PERSON had deserted from the partisans and at the time of their death they therefore no longer belonged to the partisans\u2019 political group . That argument had been raised both before the trial and appellate courts and had been dismissed by them for sound and clear reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that in DATE the \u201c nation \u2019s armed resistance \u2013 the partisan war DATE against GPE occupying army and structures of occupying regime was underway in GPE \u201d . It further pointed out that under the PERSON on the Status of Participants in Resistance against the Occupations of DATE , enacted on DATE , the partisans who fought against the occupation had been declared to be volunteer - fighters . In DATE and DATE the Lithuanian Genocide and Resistance Research Centre granted volunteer - fighter status to LAW and PERSON , which meant that they had met the condition contained in that PERSON that such status was not to be granted to individuals who had committed crimes against humanity or had killed civilians .", "CARDINAL . ORG also dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he had not committed any act causing the death of the CARDINAL partisans :", "\u201c The trial court has concluded that PERSON ORG took part in the killing of NORP partisans J.A. and PERSON : he surrounded the bunker with other ORG officers and attacked the bunker ; during the attack J.A. and PERSON were shot and killed . The trial court \u2019s verdict does not state that PERSON himself killed any of the partisans , although data to that effect exists in the case file [ DATE report by the head of the ORG district ORG ) .", "Participation in killing people who belong to a political group is CARDINAL of the objective elements ( vienas i\u0161 nusikaltimo sud\u0117ties objektyviosios pus\u0117s po\u017eymi\u0173 ) of the crime of genocide listed in LAW . Involvement in the killing of members of the groups enumerated in LAW means not only committing acts causing loss of life ; it also means setting up conditions ( sudarymas s\u0105lyg\u0173 ) so that the killings happen . It has been established that PERSON , as an ORG officer , together with an ORG subsection chief , took part in preparations for the operation to exterminate J.A. and PERSON ; PERSON was armed , and during the operation he was responsible for the ORG agent [ GPE ] , who had located the partisans\u2019 bunker ; V. ORG stayed with GPE until the end of the operation . PERSON NORP himself acknowledges those actions . Having taken the above into account , ORG arrived at the reasonable conclusion that PERSON ORG had played an active role in the operation of extermination of the partisans J.A. and PERSON Even though it has not been established that V. NORP killed either of the partisans himself , the actions he took when preparing the operation and at the time of the operation correspond to the objective element of the crime of genocide , as established in LAW involvement in killing people who belong to a political group .", "The actions of V. ORG also correspond to the subjective element of genocide \u2013 direct intent ( tiesiogin\u0117 ty\u010dia ) : PERSON ORG , when taking those actions , had known the goal of GPE \u2013 to eradicate all NORP partisans . He knew that the brothers PERSON and PERSON were partisans , and understood that during the operation they would be killed or arrested and then tortured , tried as \u201c traitors to the homeland \u201d and [ possibly ] sentenced to death , and [ V.

On DATE M.B. brought civil proceedings , claiming CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) from the applicant and GPE , to be paid by them jointly .

Her father \u2019s death had left her an orphan . Because of the applicant \u2019s actions she and her remaining family members had sustained enormous mental suffering , depression , humiliation , and loss of reputation ; her opportunities to communicate with others had been reduced and she had had to hide and constantly change her place of residence . PERSON argued that she continued to feel the repercussions of the crime up to the present time , because the applicant and PERSON still refused to tell her where her father was buried .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It noted that GPE had already paid PERSON the sum of LTL CARDINAL as CARDINAL - off compensation payable to those whose families had suffered under the DATE - CARDINAL occupation ( see paragraph DATE below ) .
