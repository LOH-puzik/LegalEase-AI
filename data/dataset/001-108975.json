It would appear from the case file that the salient fact in the domestic proceedings was the applicant \u2019s association with the mujahedin in GPE ( \u201c BH \u201d ) . The term mujahedin has been widely used to refer to foreigners \u2013 mainly from the NORP world \u2013 who came to BH during the war in support of NORP . However , the same term has been used to describe local NORP who joined the foreign mujahedin , endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing . The phenomenon has been explained by ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in PERSON and PERSON , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE , and Deli\u0107 , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first foreign mujahedin arrived in BH in DATE via GPE and with the assistance of the NORP authorities . It would appear that their arrival was welcomed by the ORG authorities . While the presence of at least some foreign mujahedin seems to have been motivated by a desire to provide humanitarian assistance to the NORP population , most of them actively supported the military struggle against the NORP ORG adversaries , ready to conduct a jihad or \u201c holy war \u201d . As stated by PERSON , an ORG witness of NORP origin who came to ORG in DATE , some of the mujahedin were members of ORG who had the aim of \u201c creating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations \u201d . Some of them also came to perform missionary work .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrival , foreign mujahedin settled in various locations and did not form a homogeneous entity . Towards DATE , NORP started to join the foreign mujahedin . The locals were provided with military training and participated in combat action . They were also given religious instruction . A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active . Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other , it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities . There were religious and ideological differences between them , which resulted in occasional violent clashes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the foreign mujahedin were organised into a unit within the local ORG ( ORG of GPE ) forces . The unit , named \u201c GPE \u201d , was based in GPE . Following its establishment , the unit significantly grew in size . By DATE , it consisted of CARDINAL fighters . Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only , locals soon outnumbered its foreign members . The factors that motivated locals to join it included : its stricter regimental discipline ; a better degree of organisation ; superior equipment and combat morale ; its religious dedication ; and material benefits . The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the NORP world , including ORG and ORG . ORG in GPE provided logistical support .", "CARDINAL . El Mujahedin had a number of features setting it apart from regular ORG units . It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ORG . At the top of the hierarchy was an emir , who has been described as the highest - ranking person within the unit . PERSON , a NORP , was its first emir . In DATE , he was succeeded by an NORP , PERSON , who remained in that position until the end of the war . A different person from the emir , the military commander , headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations . In DATE , this post was held by an NORP named PERSON . After his death in DATE , another NORP , PERSON , succeeded him . PERSON was killed in DATE . The unit had a religious council , the shura , which was its supreme decision - making body . It consisted of CARDINAL prominent members of the unit , mostly of NORP origin . The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura . At DATE , Sheikh PERSON joined the leadership of the unit . He was the head of ORG in GPE and known to be an extremist who was well - connected with NORP fundamentalists all over the world ( the ORG relied in that regard on a judgment of ORG of DATE ) . He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from NORP countries for the struggle in BH . Although Sheikh PERSON did not hold an official function within the unit , its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit . He could issue binding rulings ( fatwa ) and his authority was never challenged by the shura . Sheikh PERSON was killed , together with PERSON , at an HVO ( Croatian Defence Council ) military checkpoint on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The General Framework Agreement for Peace , which ended the war in ORG , was initialled at a military base near GPE , GPE , on DATE and signed in GPE , GPE , on DATE . LAW CARDINALA to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces , including individual advisors , freedom fighters , trainers , volunteers , and personnel from neighbouring and other GPE , irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces . In view of that , on DATE the ORG disbanded ORG and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by DATE . Despite initial resistance , the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded . It would appear that awards , such as the \u201c GPE \u201d , were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave . Members of the unit were also provided with ORG certificates of service , which assisted its foreign members to acquire ORG citizenship . Whereas most of the unit \u2019s foreign members left ORG , some of them ( such as the present applicant ) applied for ORG citizenship and continue to live in ORG to date .", "CARDINAL . After the attacks of DATE , the official attitude towards foreign mujahedin changed dramatically . Many lost their ORG citizenship or were deported from ORG after being declared a threat to national security .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he went to the then GPE to pursue his studies . He first studied at ORG , in GPE , and then at ORG , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the last time the applicant was in GPE was in DATE . He stayed DATE and obtained a new NORP passport .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , having returned from GPE , the applicant met a refugee from BH in GPE . They were married in a NORP wedding ceremony in DATE and then in a civil ceremony in DATE ( the applicant had previously been married ) . They have CARDINAL children together , born in DATE . The applicant \u2019s wife also has CARDINAL children from her first marriage ( her first husband was killed at the beginning of the war ) . The applicant has no children from his previous marriage .", "CARDINAL . While it is certain that the applicant was a member of ORG , the ORG unit described above , it is not clear for how long . According to a certificate issued to the applicant , his service in the ORG lasted from DATE until DATE , but this is not consistent with the applicant \u2019s version of events . Neither is it clear when he obtained BH citizenship . He was first issued a national identification number on DATE on the basis of a naturalisation decision of CARDINAL DATE and again on DATE on the basis of a naturalisation decision of DATE . However , the applicant claims that the naturalisation decision of DATE did not exist . Indeed , it has never been delivered to him , despite his numerous requests .", "CARDINAL . In the immediate aftermath of the war , the applicant acted as leader of a group of foreign mujahedin and their local supporters based in ORG . The group advocated the NORP - inspired NORP / NORP version of NORP . In his role as the group \u2019s leader , he interrogated CARDINAL local NORP for TIME in DATE . This led to his conviction for false imprisonment in DATE and a suspended prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the relevant administrative authority quashed the naturalisation decision of DATE . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and remitted the case for reconsideration . On DATE the relevant administrative authority quashed the naturalisation decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . They held that the applicant had acquired ORG citizenship by means of fraudulent conduct , false information and concealment of relevant facts . As a result of this decision , the applicant became an unlawful resident in ORG . On DATE ORG and on DATE ORG upheld the decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit . On DATE ORG rejected his application . It held , on the basis of confidential intelligence reports , that the applicant was a threat to national security . He was granted a period for voluntary departure of DATE . On DATE ORG , after having assessed the national security evidence , upheld that decision . On DATE ORG dismissed an application for judicial review . On DATE another bench of the same court upheld that decision . On DATE ORG set aside ORG decision of DATE and remitted the case for a retrial ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed asylum . He maintained that he would be perceived by the NORP authorities as a member of the outlawed ORG ( in view of his involvement in rallies organised by that organisation in DATE ) or as an NORP ( given his association with the mujahedin movement advocating the NORP - inspired NORP / NORP version of NORP ) . The applicant claimed that the NORP authorities were aware of his activities in ORG , as he had always been outspoken about them ( for example , he had given a number of interviews to the ORG television channel and the PERSON newspaper DATE ) . Those authorities had allegedly interviewed his father and brothers on several occasions in this connection and , furthermore , had held one of his brothers in detention for DATE because of his refusal to spy on the applicant . He referred to the situation of PERSON , a mujahedin of NORP origin , who had reportedly been tortured in GPE and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for membership of ORG ( although no proof of his membership in that organisation had been presented at trial ) , belonging to an organisation formed with the purpose of changing the economic or social structure of the state , carrying out activities that threatened the state or might damage its relationship with a foreign country and weakening national feeling and inciting sectarian strife . The applicant claimed that he might also be targeted because of his draft evasion . Given all the above and the general political and human rights situation in GPE , the applicant argued that his deportation to GPE would expose him to a risk of being subjected to ill - treatment . Lastly , he submitted that his deportation would be contrary to LAW in view of his family situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the asylum claim and granted the applicant a DATE period for voluntary departure . It held that the applicant did not face a real risk of being subjected to ill - treatment given that he had never been a member of ORG ( unlike PERSON mentioned above ) . It further held that it had not been shown that he would be ill - treated solely because of his fighting with the foreign mujahedin in ORG ( in view of the fact that none of the parties to the war in BH were either an ally or an enemy of GPE ) or because of his draft evasion . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations about his father and brothers , ORG rejected them as unsubstantiated . Lastly , ORG considered the Article CARDINAL complaint to be irrelevant in an asylum case . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . On DATE ORG set aside the part of ORG decision concerning LAW and remitted it for a retrial . It upheld the remainder of that decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to indicate to the Government that the applicant should not be expelled pending the final decision of ORG in the applicant \u2019s case ( ORG CARDINAL ) and for a period of DATE following notification of that decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG edited its DATE ORG in ORG , in which the applicant ( known as PERSON ) had been wrongly identified as convicted terrorist PERSON alMasri ( who had also fought with the foreign mujahedin in BH ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rendered its decision in the applicant \u2019s case ( ORG CARDINAL ) . It set aside ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ORG decision of DATE in part ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It upheld the remainder of ORG decision of DATE and ORG decision of DATE in its entirety ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG placed the applicant in an immigration centre on security grounds , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE . On DATE ORG , after having assessed the national security evidence , upheld that decision . In his constitutional appeal , the applicant maintained that even if he indeed constituted a security threat , that factor would not be sufficient in itself to justify his detention ( he relied on GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG held that the applicant \u2019s custody was lawful and consistent with the LAW . The initial detention period was extended DATE on security grounds until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . All extension orders were upheld by ORG and some of them also by ORG ( constitutional appeals concerning the remaining orders are pending ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ORG in ORG called upon the ORG authorities not to deport the applicant to GPE because of a serious risk of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . Further to ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG quashed part of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above and instructed that service to examine whether the indication of a period for voluntary departure was contrary to LAW . On DATE ORG held that the impugned measure was consistent with LAW . On DATE ORG quashed that decision . On DATE ORG again held that the impugned measure was consistent with LAW On DATE ORG quashed that decision . On DATE ORG again held that the impugned measure was consistent with LAW . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . It emphasised that the indication of a period for voluntary departure should not be confused with a deportation order and that the issue of whether the applicant \u2019s departure would be contrary to LAW appropriately be examined within the context of deportation proceedings . It would appear that a constitutional appeal against that decision is pending .", "CARDINAL . Further to ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG assessed the national security evidence and upheld ORG decision of DATE mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above . It relied on the applicant \u2019s conviction of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , his public threats against ORG authorities , his standing in the mujahedin community which allowed him to issue a binding ruling ( fatwa ) , his lectures at a mosque in GPE kolonija , a GPE suburb , advocating the NORP - inspired NORP / NORP version of NORP and his attempts to obtain ammunition illegally . It also took into account some secret evidence . Following a constitutional appeal , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered as an interim measure that the applicant should not be expelled pending the proceedings before ORG . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case for a retrial . It further ordered that its interim measure remain in force until ORG had examined the application under LAW . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the first- and second - instance administrative decisions and remitted the case to ORG for reconsideration . On DATE ORG rejected the application for a residence permit and granted the applicant a period for voluntary departure of DATE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . On DATE , after having assessed the national security evidence , ORG upheld that decision . It relied , among other things , on the fact that the applicant \u2019s name appeared on a list of international criminals maintained by ORG ( ORG ) . On DATE another bench of the same court upheld that decision . It would appear that the applicant has lodged a constitutional appeal in that regard which is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a deportation order : it decided to expel the applicant and to prohibit his re - entry for DATE . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG , respectively , upheld that decision . The applicant has ever since been detained with the intention of deportation pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u2013 \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) entered into force . LAW was applied to the present applicant \u2019s claim for asylum and application for a residence permit because the proceedings had started before the entry into force of LAW . On the other hand , LAW was applied to the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provided that asylum had to be granted to an alien who , owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership of a particular social group , was outside his or her country of nationality and was unable or , owing to such fear , was unwilling to benefit from the protection of that country . The principle of non - refoulement was incorporated in section CARDINAL of that Act , which read as follows :", "\u201c An alien shall not be returned or expelled in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , regardless of whether or not the person concerned has been granted asylum . The prohibition of return or expulsion shall also apply to persons in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . An alien may not be returned or expelled to a country where he or she is not protected from being sent to such a territory . \u201d", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , aliens whose claims for asylum had been refused had to be granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds if their removal would breach the principle of non - refoulement .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(i ) of LAW , the authorities were entitled to issue deportation orders against aliens constituting a threat to public order or national security . LAW contains a similar provision ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(h ) of that Act ) . While it is not clear whether an appeal against a deportation order had suspensive effect under LAW ( see section QUANTITY ) , such an appeal suspends deportation under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . Under both acts , a claim for asylum and an application for judicial review against a refusal of such a claim suspend deportation ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act and sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW CARDINAL of LAW , once an alien has become subject to expulsion , removal directions shall be issued within DATE . An appeal does not suspend deportation .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW , an alien must be detained if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security , irrespective of whether a deportation order has been issued . Once a deportation order has been issued , the alien concerned may also be detained under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of that Act . An initial detention order is valid for DATE ( section CARDINAL ) of that Act ) . It may be extended any number of times for DATE at a time .

It is also concerned at the very low rate of successful asylum applications . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner for Human Rights , an independent institution within ORG , has been mandated to promote the awareness of and respect for human rights in the CARDINAL ORG member states . His recent report on ORG ( document CommDH(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) reads , in the relevant part , as follows :", "\u201c According to ORG , of the CARDINAL recognised refugees in GPE , CARDINAL are from GPE . Most of them were recognised prior to the handover of refugee status determination by ORG to the authorities of ORG in DATE . Since DATE , refugee status has been granted CARDINAL persons , none of whom is from GPE ( CARDINAL NORP , CARDINAL NORP , one NORP and CARDINAL GPE ) . In addition , ORG granted subsidiary protection to CARDINAL GPE minors from GPE in DATE , and CARDINAL PERSON from GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to many reliable and objective sources , torture and other forms of ill - treatment have been used extensively and with impunity in police stations and security agencies\u2019 detention centres . The relevant part of ORG DATE Country Report on ORG in GPE reads as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW of the constitution , \u2018 no one may be tortured physically or mentally or treated in a humiliating manner\u2019 . Nevertheless , security forces reportedly continued to use torture frequently . Local human rights organizations continued to cite numerous credible cases of security forces allegedly abusing and torturing prisoners and detainees and claimed that many instances of abuse went unreported . Individuals who suffered torture or beatings while detained refused to allow their names or details of their cases to be reported for fear of government reprisal .", "Former prisoners , detainees , and reputable local human rights groups reported that methods of torture and abuse included electrical shocks ; pulling out fingernails ; burning genitalia ; forcing objects into the rectum ; beatings while the victim is suspended from the ceiling and on the soles of the feet ; alternately dousing victims with freezing water and beating them in extremely cold rooms ; hyperextending the spine ; bending the body into the frame of a wheel and whipping exposed body parts ; using a backward - bending chair to asphyxiate the victim or fracture the spine ; and stripping prisoners naked for public view . In DATE ORG documented CARDINAL types of torture and mistreatment used against detainees in the country . ORG reported that torture was most likely to occur while detainees were held at CARDINAL of the many detention centers operated by the various security services in the country , particularly while authorities attempted to extract a confession or information .

The centres controlled by these services are not accessible by independent monitoring and inspection bodies , and are not subject to review by the authorities . ORG is further concerned that detainees are deprived of fundamental legal safeguards , including an oversight mechanism in regard to their treatment and review procedures in respect to their detention . ORG is also concerned at allegations that those detained in such facilities could be held for prolonged periods without any judicial review , in practice in incommunicado detention and subject to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Reportedly , actual or suspected NORP and members of the banned ORG have been subject to particularly harsh abuse . According to ORG DATE Report DATE , they have faced arbitrary arrest , prolonged detention , torture and other forms of ill - treatment , and unfair trials ( see also ORG report Far From Justice : GPE \u2019s ORG of DATE , pp .
