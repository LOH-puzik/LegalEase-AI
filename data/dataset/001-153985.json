Introduction", "On DATE DNB sent the outcome of ORG ) to ORG ( ORG ) in the form of an intended ORG decision . In this intended decision ... DNB notes a capital shortage of MONEY ( ORG ) and states its intent to impose on ORG the measure of having to supplement its core capital by CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL no later than DATE at TIME , or at least to present , no later than DATE at TIME , a final solution which , in the considered view of DNB , has sufficient prospects of success and which will , in the short term , lead to the actual supplementing of the said capital shortage . If ORG should prove unable sufficiently to strengthen its capital position in time , DNB , according to its statement of intent , will consider it irresponsible for ORG to continue banking and DNB will make use of its powers under LAW ( Wet op het financi\u00ebel toezicht ) . ORG has until TIME on DATE to state its views ; DNB will come to a final decision as soon as possible thereafter , taking these views into account . If these views should provide any new insight , then DNB will inform your ministry accordingly as soon as possible .", "In the event that DNB in its final ORG decision imposes on ORG the measure referred to in its intended decision and ORG does not comply with the measure thus imposed within the time - limit set , DNB considers it irresponsible for ORG to continue banking . In addition , in the absence of a convincing and final solution it would appear impossible to publish by CARDINAL DATE provisional annual accounts drawn up on the basis of continuity . In view of the expectations raised as regards an overall solution , postponing the publication of DATE accounts without announcing an overall solution for ORG will mean further undermining confidence in SNS LANGUAGE . DNB considers this irresponsible from the point of view of financial stability , also in the light of the increasing flow of publications in the media on the vulnerable position of SNS LOC and the resulting outflow of funds .", "Since ORG is a system - relevant institution ( systeemrelevante instelling ) , the threat of insolvency of ORG ( and therefore that of the entire concern ) will mean that the stability of the financial system is in serious and immediate danger . DNB therefore advises you to make preparations to enable the use of your powers under part CARDINAL of LAW immediately after the lapse of the time - limit in a final ORG - decision if and in so far as one is taken , or even sooner if the situation should so require .", "In view of the seriousness of the situation and the speed of the developments , DNB considers it important to send you this informative letter \u2013 based on section CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 already now . Paragraph CARDINAL of this letter provides background information relating to the situation of the institution and the supervisory approach adopted by DNB . Paragraph CARDINAL explores financial stability as the guiding point of departure in seeking a solution . Paragraph CARDINAL provides an overview of the solutions examined and the reasons why , as it appears at present , these are not achievable . Paragraph CARDINAL makes a few closing remarks .", "CARDINAL . Background", "...", "After a broad survey of possible avenues for a solution by a joint working group , there have been intensive discussions with ORG and market parties about a plurality of ( variants of ) solutions . In its role as supervisor and co - responsible party for the stability of the financial system , DNB has played an initiating and active role in this process of negotiation . With the help of external advisors , a solution has been sought which comes as close as possible to meeting the following basic criteria :", "The private sector should be involved as much as possible to limit the financial consequences for the ORG as much as possible ;", "Wherever possible , losses should be borne by SNS ORG \u2019s current risk - bearing financiers ( burden sharing ) . This point of departure not merely limits the financial consequences for the ORG , but also serves the stability of the financial system in the long term ;", "The intention to forestall an emergency situation ;", "It is self - evident that any solution \u2013 involving ORG support DATE should in addition be assured of the approval of ORG ( ORG ) , be structural in character , and be proportionate .", "CARDINAL . Financial stability", "In DNB \u2019s considered view it is not only ORG continuity which is of importance for the financial system , but also that of the holding SNS Reaal .", "ORG insolvency will have serious consequences for the stability of the financial system because of ( i ) the costs involved in the implementation of the deposit guarantee scheme , ( ii ) loss of confidence in other GPE financial institutions and ( iii ) the consequences for account holders and the attending unrest . DNB has described these factors in its letter of DATE , in which it is explained that DNB considers the estimated eventual cost flowing from the implementation of the deposit guarantee scheme irresponsibly high , seen also in the light of the general scarcity of capital and the desire of the markets for the anticipated application of PERSON [ a voluntary regulatory standard on bank capital requirements , now due to enter into force in DATE ] ( argument i ) . In order to supplement these arguments , communicated to your Ministry earlier , DNB points to the following factors :", "The uncertainty as to the possibility for banks to recover against the estate of ORG bank if the deposit guarantee system is implemented . Since ORG CARDINAL of the deposits guaranteed by that scheme are held by ORG , claims would be in the order of greatness of ORG MONEY per major GPE bank . A situation in which other GPE banks have major claims against the estate of ORG and in which it is uncertain to what extent these will be met in itself undermines the health of , and therefore confidence in , these banks .", "Further splitting up ORG into separate parts is not a realistic option . This is caused , in particular , by the interrelation of subsidiaries ORG and ORG with their parent ORG as regards operations and IT ; these subsidiaries use the same infrastructure with their own labels . There is also considerable financial interrelation between ORG and ORG : savings from ORG are used to finance credit ( mortgages ) provided by ORG . Because of these interrelations any insolvency of the parent bank will in practice include that of the subsidiaries and vice versa . Any insolvency of ORG will in addition probably lead to loss of confidence in its subsidiaries as well .", "ORG and ORG hold CARDINAL current accounts and CARDINAL savings accounts , with a total credit balance of approximately ORG MONEY . At least EUR DATE is paid into CARDINAL of the current accounts , which is an indication that these accounts play an important role in the financial transactions of individuals . Consequently all sorts of practical problems [ sic ] resulting from any insolvency of ORG , such as cashpoints breaking down or standing orders being stopped , will have enormous social effects [ sic ] .", "...", "CARDINAL . Conclusion", "... [ It would appear ] , at this moment , that nationalisation of the conglomerate as a whole is the only remaining solution for SNS LOC . For a decision to expropriate to be taken , there has to be a situation of \u2018 serious and immediate danger to the stability of the financial system\u2019 . As has been observed in the introduction to this letter , DNB considers it irresponsible for ORG to continue banking in the event that DNB in its final ORG - decision imposes on ORG the measure referred to in its intended decision and ORG does not comply with the measure thus imposed within the time - limit set . In the considered view of DNB the above - mentioned legal criterion for nationalisation will then have been met . Should you decide not to proceed with nationalisation , DNB , as the responsible supervisor , would be compelled to seek an emergency arrangement , which would mean implementing the deposit guarantee system .", "An emergency situation is therefore imminent . In the introduction to this letter attention has been drawn to the danger of loss of confidence as a result of any postponement of publication of the DATE accounts without announcing an overall solution for SNS Reaal . There is already a loss of confidence , which has manifested itself in an outflow of funds in an amount of QUANTITY since the reports of CARDINAL DATE about the position taken by the ORG in this case ; actually , if it had not been for public confidence in the safety net provided by the ORG the outflow would probably have been considerably greater .", "In addition to publication of the DATE accounts without announcing an overall solution DNB notes other events that could be the beginning of an emergency situation . In the first place , DNB can not allow NORP and/or ORG to increase lending to the holding SNS LOC with which to repay external financing that will end in DATE . Absent any other funding possibilities this is expected to cause the holding to be unable to make further payments . In addition , if no solution is found , then ORG , owing to its very weak capitalisation and the negative developments in this respect , would run the risk of no longer having access to ORG facilities . This , combined with the outflow of funds that has already occurred , could cause SNS immediate liquidity problems .", "On the above grounds , DNB advises you to make preparations to enable the use of your powers under part CARDINAL of LAW immediately after the expiry of the time - limit in a final ORG decision if and in so far as one is taken , or even sooner if the situation should so require . \u201d", "This letter was at the time classified confidential . It has since been made available to the public .", "CARDINAL . The ORG decision", "CARDINAL .

Final remarks", "Only if the decision set out in paragraph CARDINAL has been fulfilled will it be possible for DNB to conclude that ORG established capital ( toetsingsvermogen ) guarantees controlled and durable cover of its risks . If ORG should prove unable to strengthen its capital position sufficiently and in time , DNB considers that it is irresponsible for ORG to continue banking and ORG will make use of its powers under LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
