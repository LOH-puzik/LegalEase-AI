The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is proprietor and editor - in - chief of the local DATE newspaper \u201c Komu i NORP \u201d , published in the PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In issue no . CARDINAL of DATE the applicant published an article entitled \u201c Elegantly wrapped dung \u201d ( \u201c DATE elegancko opakowane \u201d ) . It read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c A poser is someone who does everything to produce external effects by his conduct , speech and , in particular , with the populism he preaches . He is a numbskull posing as the people \u2019s tribune . The only panacea , or universal cure , for such a person is to recognise his intentions and take up a bloodless fight using arguments . An argument against any kind of tricks by a poser or populist will be always a counterargument based on reality , logic and the opportunity to put one \u2019s intentions into practice .", "I remember when , not so long ago , the author of the proposal to develop a quail farm as a panacea against rural unemployment had a go at me in an accommodating local newspaper , accusing me of malice , a willingness to discredit every good idea , and mindlessness leading to nasty mental disease and many other irreversible disorders of the mind . At the same time he declared that he would continue doing his job , that is , condemning farmers to breeding nice little birds in order to collect their eggs . His boss considered the quail business very important , because it would eliminate the need for viagra . There has not been a sideshow like it in LOC for a long time . So the time is approaching when pilgrimages of men from all over GPE , and maybe even ORG , will come to PERSON to taste quail eggs and later begin procreating .", "I wonder who has gone mad in the district , and why mad ideas , supported by even madder arguments , can be accepted by our officials . But no matter . Every dull boss can be convinced by any rubbish . Once more I want to authoritatively and responsibly declare that neither quail breeding , nor mushroom growing , nor PERSON [ a registered trademark for fibre cement ] , which suddenly seems to have dropped out of the picture , will solve the unemployment problem in the villages of our region . And I will continue calling the actions of dim - witted officials and their dull bosses pretentious and populist , and no numbskull will convince me that I am wrong . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant went on to describe in general terms a local economic development programme , which had been presented to him by a businessman . He finished his article with the following paragraph :", "\u201c This is not a venture of the quail variety by some smart poser or populist who is able to sell his dull bosses dung nicely wrapped in words . And he actually sells it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE M.D. , the mayor of the Radomsko District ( starosta ) , ORG , the head and spokesperson of the district \u2019s marketing department , and GPE , an employee of that department , lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant with ORG . In respect of the impugned article , they accused him of defamation committed through the mass media under LAW . In particular , they alleged that the copious use of words such as \u201c numbskull \u201d , \u201c dull boss \u201d , \u201c dim - witted official \u201d , \u201c poser \u201d and \u201c populist \u201d ( \u201c palant \u201d , \u201c nierozgarni\u0119ty szef \u201d , \u201c przyg\u0142upawy urz\u0119dnik \u201d , \u201c pozer \u201d , \u201c populista \u201d ) had defamed them as local government officials . The statements had lowered them in public opinion and undermined the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties .", "CARDINAL . The private prosecutors sought an order requiring the applicant to publish an apology in the DATE newspaper . They further sought reimbursement of their legal costs and payment by the applicant of MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity .", "CARDINAL . The Radomsko District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction in the case , and transmitted the private bill of indictment to ORG . The trial court held CARDINAL hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski ORG gave its judgment . It held that the use of the words \u201c numbskull \u201d , \u201c poser \u201d and \u201c dimwitted official \u201d in respect of GPE , and the use of the words \u201c dull bosses \u201d in respect of PERSON and PERSON , had amounted to insult ( zniewaga ) committed through the mass media , within the meaning of LAW . The court convicted the applicant under that provision and ordered him to pay a fine of LAW ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . It also ordered him to reimburse the private ORG costs ( ORG , approximately LAW ) and the costs of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL , approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the facts , the court observed that , since DATE , the applicant \u2019s newspaper had been publishing articles which were critical of GPE , the mayor of GPE , and his officials . The newspaper was particularly critical of GPE \u2019s initiative to develop quail farming in order to tackle the impoverishment of the local population . GPE was an official in the district \u2019s marketing department . PERSON , the head of the marketing department , was also involved in the implementation of this project . In DATE the applicant had published an article in which he had made ironic remarks about GPE \u2019s initiative . In DATE a journalist at the same newspaper had published a detailed article on the same subject . The conflict between the applicant and the private prosecutors had intensified with each successively published article .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that , in his article entitled \u201c Elegantly wrapped dung \u201d , the applicant had again written about the quail farming . Being aware of the publicity which the initiative promoted by GPE and ORG had received , the applicant had decided once again to mock the CARDINAL officials , as well as their superior , PERSON had referred to GPE , the author of the initiative , as a \u201c poser \u201d , \u201c numbskull \u201d and \u201c dim - witted official \u201d , while the idea of quail farming had been referred to as \u201c nicely wrapped dung \u201d . According to the applicant , this kind of \u201c product \u201d had been sold to \u201c dull bosses \u201d , that is , first G.D. and then PERSON , the mayor of the district .", "CARDINAL . The trial court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the impugned article had been a simple DATE column in which any similarity to actual persons had been purely coincidental . It found that the article in issue had been part of a campaign carried out by the newspaper against the private prosecutors . They had not been mentioned by name , but they had been easily identifiable on account of the publicity generated by the quail farming project and the earlier articles published by the applicant \u2019s newspaper . The court established that there was no doubt that the words \u201c numbskull \u201d , \u201c dimwitted official \u201d and \u201c poser \u201d had referred to GPE , and the term \u201c dull bosses \u201d to PERSON and G.D.", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s criminal responsibility , the trial court noted that a journalist had the right to criticise the actions of public officials , but was not entitled to use media in a manipulative way to wage private wars . The latter behaviour was not only unethical and unprofessional , but also incompatible with the role of the media , which was to serve the ORG and society . The trial court further held :", "\u201c The fair criticism and objective coverage , free from personal emotions , which is desired in journalism , gave way to the private interest of the defendant , pursued through expressions which , in common understanding , remain offensive and disrespectful . It is difficult not to agree with the position that the word \u201c numbskull \u201d ( \u201c palant \u201d ) in the analysed context , although its literal meaning is legally irrelevant , fulfils all the criteria of insult within the meaning of LAW . Of an equally offensive character are the terms \u201c poser \u201d , \u201c dim - witted official \u201d and \u201c dull boss \u201d . It would be hard to find a person who would not feel offended by similar epithets , especially if formulated in the press .", "Incidentally , it should also be noted that the word \u201c dung \u201d used in the title of the article has a cruder equivalent , and undoubtedly that equivalent was meant to describe GPE \u2019s contribution to the development of local entrepreneurship , which was accepted without reservation by his \u201c dull bosses \u201d . \u201c Dull \u201d meaning not sharp , unintelligent , intellectually retarded .", "However , the court found no grounds to hold that the impugned words had the effect of lowering the private prosecutors in public esteem , or undermining the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties as local government officials . Accordingly , it would not be justified to classify the applicant \u2019s acts as coming under LAW . The quoted statements were rather harmful to the private prosecutors\u2019 perception of their dignity , and such , in the court \u2019s view , was the defendant \u2019s intention . By using insulting words in respect of the district officials , PERSON intended to derive satisfaction from doing them moral harm . By doing so in a newspaper , he fell within the scope of LAW , acting unlawfully , reprehensibly , and , in the absence of circumstances capable of precluding or mitigating his guilt , also culpably . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial court noted that the present case involved a conflict between constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and the right of each citizen to have his reputation protected . However , it found that the applicant \u2019s acts had constituted a blatant abuse of freedom of speech and professional ethics . The court observed that his acts and motivation had been reprehensible , since he had been settling a private conflict with the officials and transgressing basic professional standards .", "CARDINAL . As regards sentence , the court found that , , it would be disproportionate to impose a prison sentence , and that a fine would be the most appropriate penalty . It imposed a fine of PLN MONEY , which it considered proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He contested the factual findings of the firstinstance court , in particular that his article had concerned the private prosecutors personally . He argued that the impugned article had presented in a sarcastic light people who achieved personal gain by pretending to work , and their dull bosses who accepted such practices . The applicant emphasised that criticism of the quail farm project as a solution to a decline in agriculture in the region had been entirely legitimate . Lastly , he submitted that public figures such as GPE , the district mayor , and other officials had to accept harsh criticism of their activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski Regional Court ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) upheld the first - instance judgment . It ordered the applicant to pay ORG MONEY ( approx . ORG ) in respect of the costs of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the lower court had correctly established the facts of the case . It endorsed the trial court \u2019s findings that the words used in the article had been insulting and harmful to the private ORG dignity . It further held that , although fair criticism of public authorities and officials was socially desirable and legally accepted , the protection afforded by law did not extend to the use of insulting words which offended human dignity .", "CARDINAL .
