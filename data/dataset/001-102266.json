ORG Scheme", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG introduced the first version of ORG ( \u201c the first version \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL of ORG etc . ) Act CARDINAL provided a statutory basis for the scheme and further details were set out in ORG Regulations DATE ( SI CARDINAL ) ( \u201c the DATE Regulations \u201d ) and ORG Instructions ( \u201c IDIs \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The first version of the scheme required that in order to marry , persons subject to immigration control had to have either entry clearance expressly granted for the purpose of enabling them to marry in GPE or a Certificate of Approval . The definition of \u201c persons subject to immigration control \u201d excluded ORG nationals and persons who had been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to obtain a Certificate of Approval , a person subject to immigration control had to submit an application to the Secretary of ORG for ORG together with an application fee of ORG . If both parties to the proposed marriage were subject to immigration control , each party had to submit an application form and pay the required fee . The IDIs provided that in order to qualify for ORG , an applicant had to have been granted leave to enter or remain in GPE for a period of DATE and he or she had to have DATE of that leave remaining at the time of making the application .", "CARDINAL . The first version of the scheme did not apply to persons seeking to marry in accordance with the rites of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON delivered judgment in the case of R ( on the applications of PERSON and Others ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL GPE ( Admin ) , in which he considered whether the first version of the scheme interfered with the Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL rights of those who were subject to immigration control and who were in GPE lawfully .", "CARDINAL . He found that it was permissible , according to the ORG 's jurisprudence , to introduce legislation to prevent marriages entered into for the purpose of avoiding immigration control even though this legislation might interfere with the right to marry . Furthermore , the legislative objective relied on by the Government of preventing sham marriages was sufficiently important to justify limiting an LAW right .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in the case of the first version of the scheme , the measures designed to meet the legislative objective were disproportionate as they were not rationally connected to it . First , all religious marriages other than those in ORG required a Certificate despite the fact that the evidence showed that sham marriages predominantly took place in registry offices . The treatment of religious marriages outside ORG was therefore a matter of concern as they were treated like registry office marriages even though evidence indicated that the same precautions which prevented sham marriages taking place in ORG were also present in other religious ceremonies . Secondly , there was no basis for the assumption that all religious marriages outside ORG were automatically to be treated as sham marriages , thus requiring a Certificate , while in contrast all marriages conducted according to the rites of ORG were to be regarded automatically as not being sham marriages and therefore did not require a ORG . Thirdly , the first version of the scheme arbitrarily failed to take into account many factors which might be relevant in considering whether or not a proposed marriage was a sham , such as clear and corroborated evidence that the parties had enjoyed a loving relationship over DATE , during which time they might have had children or bought a house together . It was difficult to understand how the scheme , which ignored factors such as these , could be \u201c rationally connected \u201d to the purported legislative aim of avoiding sham marriages . Fourthly , the first version of the scheme was not rationally connected to the legislative objective as it regarded the only relevant factors in determining whether a non - EU national could marry in GPE as his or her immigration status .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON therefore held that the first version of the scheme was not proportionate and constituted a substantial interference with LAW .", "CARDINAL . He also held that this version of the scheme was incompatible with LAW as it was discriminatory on the grounds of religion and nationality . It constituted direct discrimination as it targeted individuals who were , because of their religious convictions or lack of them , unable or unwilling to marry pursuant to the rites of ORG . Meanwhile those who wished to marry in ORG were exempted from the scheme .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the fact that a fee was levied was also discriminatory as this was not required of those with the same characteristics wishing to marry in ORG religious ceremonies .", "CARDINAL . In a separate judgment ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) , Mr Justice ORG found that in the case of Mr PERSON , at the time an illegal immigrant , the refusal of permission to marry did not constitute an interference with his rights under LAW , as permitting him to marry an ORG national would effectively have permitted him to \u201c queue jump \u201d and would have undermined the effectiveness of immigration control .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG accepted Mr Justice PERSON 's findings that the first version of the scheme under section DATE Act was discriminatory and did not seek to challenge this conclusion on appeal . However , he was granted permission to appeal against Mr Justice PERSON 's findings in respect of LAW . Mr PERSON was also granted permission to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered judgment in the case of LOC v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL . It agreed with Mr Justice PERSON 's finding that the first version of the scheme under section DATE Act was disproportionate and violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . However , it disagreed with the conclusion reached in respect of Mr PERSON . ORG held that the immigration status of Mr PERSON was irrelevant to the genuineness of his proposed marriage , which alone could properly determine whether he should be free to exercise his right to marry . It therefore dismissed the Secretary of ORG 's appeal and allowed that of Mr PERSON . The Secretary of ORG was granted permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its opinion in the case of NORP ( on the application of PERSON and others ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG DATE . It dismissed the appeal and ordered that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the CARDINAL Act should be read as meaning \u201c has the written permission of the Secretary of ORG to marry in GPE , such permission not to be withheld in the case of a qualified applicant seeking to enter into a marriage which is not one of convenience and the application for , and grant of , such permission not to be subject to conditions which unreasonably inhibit exercise of the applicant 's right under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON observed that from DATE the ORG had described the right to marry as \u201c fundamental \u201d and noted that LAW , in contrast with LAW , conferred a right and not a right to respect for specified areas of personal life .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON further observed that the scope afforded to national law was not unlimited and it had been emphasised that national laws governing the exercise of the right to marry should never injure or impair the substance of the right . In practice the ORG had been firm in upholding the right to marry , finding in favour of applicants denied the exercise of that right because they were serving prisoners ( ORG v. GPE , no . DATE , Commission decision of DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , because of a mandatory delay imposed before entering into a fourth marriage ( PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , or because CARDINAL applicant was the father - in - law of the other and they could only exercise their right to marry if they obtained a private ORG ( B. and PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE considered , inter alia , the ORG 's decisions in PERSON v. GPE , no . ORG decision of DATE , GPE CARDINAL p. CARDINAL and PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE ( DATE ) DR CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL . He concluded that :", "\u201c A national authority may properly impose reasonable conditions on the right of a third - country national to marry in order to ascertain whether a proposed marriage is one of convenience and , if it is , to prevent it . This is because LAW exists to protect the right to enter into a genuine marriage , not to grant a right to secure an adventitious advantage by going through a form of marriage for ulterior reasons .", "... ... ...", "[ The authorities ] establish ... that where a third - country national proposes to marry within the jurisdiction the member state may properly check whether the proposed marriage is one of convenience or not and seek information necessary for that purpose . The authorities give no support to the proposition that a significant restriction may be placed on all such marriages , or on a sub - class of such marriages , irrespective of whether they are marriages of convenience or genuine marriages and with no procedure to ascertain whether they are the CARDINAL or the other . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the first version of the scheme , Lord PERSON held :", "\u201c Apart from its discriminatory features , which the Secretary of ORG has said she will remove , I do not think section DATE , read alone , is legally objectionable . It is open to a member state , consistently with article CARDINAL , to seek to prevent marriages of convenience . There is nothing in the text of section CARDINAL which authorises or requires the withholding of permission to marry in the case of any marriage which is not a marriage of convenience . Indeed , the section makes no reference to marriages of convenience or sham marriages and gives no hint of the grounds on which permission may be granted or withheld . Section CARDINAL could be operated , consistently with its terms and with article CARDINAL , in a manner which required persons subject to immigration control to give notice of a proposed marriage , enabled an appropriate authority to investigate whether the proposed marriage would be CARDINAL of convenience and provided for the withholding of permission only in cases where it appeared that the proposed marriage would be CARDINAL of convenience .", "Subject to CARDINAL qualification , LAW are similarly , in my opinion , unobjectionable . They provide in some detail in Schedule CARDINAL for the information to be given by an applicant for permission to marry , and considerable detail ( more than is required in the Schedule ) is clearly necessary if enquiry is to be made whether a proposed marriage will be CARDINAL of convenience . My qualification relates to the prescribed fee . It is plain that a fee fixed at a level which a needy applicant can not afford may impair the essence of the right to marry which is in issue . A fee of \u00a3 MONEY ( \u00a3 MONEY for a couple both subject to immigration control ) could be expected to have that effect .", "ORG , promulgated ( it is understood ) without express parliamentary sanction , provide for the denial of permission to marry ( save on compassionate grounds , relatively rarely allowed in practice ) to all those who are in the country without leave , or whose grant of leave to enter or remain in the GPE on the occasion in question did not total DATE , or who did not have DATE remaining at the time of making the application for permission . The vice of the scheme is that none of these conditions , although of course relevant to immigration status , has any relevance to the genuineness of a proposed marriage , which is the only relevant criterion for deciding whether permission should be given to an applicant who is qualified under national law to enter into a valid marriage . It may be that persons falling within the categories specified in the ORG are more likely to enter into a marriage of convenience than others , and that may be a very material consideration when the genuineness of a proposed marriage is investigated . But the section CARDINAL scheme does not provide for or envisage any investigation at all , because ( as has been explained in the evidence ) such investigation is too expensive and administratively burdensome . Thus , subject to the discretionary compassionate exception , the scheme imposes a blanket prohibition on exercise of the right to marry by all in the specified categories , irrespective of whether their proposed marriages are marriages of convenience or whether they are not . This is a disproportionate interference with exercise of the right to marry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON of GPE considered that :", "\u201c It is not disputed that the Government would be free to deny any immigration advantage to a party to a marriage which had been entered into solely for the purpose of obtaining that advantage . ( Indeed , the respondents argue that that is already the case , as the claimed advantages apply only to real relationships . ) But the scheme in issue here does something very different . The legislation enables the ORG to prohibit in advance a great many marriages irrespective of whether or not they are genuine , irrespective of whether or not there is any immigration advantage to be obtained thereby , and without any right of appeal other than judicial review . This strikes at the very heart of the right to marry which is guaranteed to everyone of full age by LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She found that there were many objections to the scheme , other than its being discriminatory . In particular , she noted that :", "\u201c It covers anyone who is subject to immigration control , that is , anyone who is not an ORG national and requires leave to enter or remain in GPE ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . This covers all non - nationals unless they have already acquired the ' right of abode ' . All of these people are required to give notice to the registrar in specified registration districts , irrespective of where they live or intend to get married ; and both parties to the intended marriage must attend in person to deliver their notice ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . This is all irrespective of how long they have been living here , how close their relationship and how small or non - existent the immigration advantage there might be .", "When they get to the registrar , there are CARDINAL categories of people who need go no further . The first is a person who has been given entry clearance expressly for the purpose of enabling him to marry in GPE ( s CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) . The second is a person who falls within a class specified in regulations ( s CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ) . Regulation CARDINAL of ORG Regulations DATE ( SI CARDINAL ) specifies a person ' who is settled in GPE within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of ORG . This basically means someone who is ordinarily resident here , not in breach of the immigration laws , and without any restriction on the period for which he may remain . A very large number of people who have been here lawfully for a long time will still not be ' settled ' here in this sense .", "Everyone subject to immigration control who does not fall within those CARDINAL exceptions can not marry without the written permission of the Secretary of ORG to marry in GPE ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) ) . Application must be made in writing accompanied by the fee prescribed in LAW , which is now \u00a3 CARDINAL . If both parties require permission , therefore , they must pay \u00a3 MONEY to apply for it . There is no power in the regulations to waive or reduce the fee no matter how meritorious the case . This is on top of the much more modest fees for the actual marriage , of \u00a3 MONEY for each notice to marry , \u00a3 CARDINAL for the ceremony , and \u00a3 MONEY for the marriage certificate , making a total of \u00a3 MONEY . It must be a positive disincentive to couples whose desire to marry is deep and sincere and has nothing to do with their immigration status or where they intend to live once married .", "None of these applicants will be able to find out from the LAW or the LAW how good their chances are of getting permission . On the face of it , the ORG can adopt whatever policy it chooses without even laying it before ORG for scrutiny . The current policy is contained in the published \u201c ORG \" , chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL . This does not depend upon any reasonable assessment , either of the immigration advantage which the marriage might bring , or of the genuineness of the relationship . It depends upon a rule of thumb : permission will be granted if each person needing it has been granted leave to enter or remain in the GPE for DATE ( calculated from when his present stay in the GPE first began ) and has DATE of this remaining when he makes the application . Even within this category , permission will be refused if there is good reason to believe that either of the parties lacks capacity to marry in LANGUAGE law . Outside this category , permission will be refused unless \u201c there are exceptionally compassionate features \u201d making it unreasonable to expect them to travel , either to marry abroad or to apply for entry clearance from abroad . The examples given are pregnancy or some other condition making the person unfit to travel abroad . They do not include features suggesting that the marriage is genuine , because that is not the point .", "This policy automatically excludes all asylum seekers because they do not have leave to enter . The policy states that they should not normally be permitted to marry until after their claims have been determined . But if an initial decision on an application or an appeal has been outstanding for DATE ( and we understand that time starts running afresh once an appeal has been lodged ) , or if they can not be expected to travel abroad for compelling compassionate reasons , the permission may be granted . It is , of course , extremely unlikely that any genuine asylum seeker will be in a position to travel back to the country from which he has fled to escape a wellfounded fear of persecution , nor would it be consistent with this country 's obligations under LAW to compel him to do so .", "It is an indication of how over - inclusive the statutory scheme is that the great majority of applications for permission are granted . From DATE , when section CARDINAL came into force , until DATE , when PERSON handed down his first judgment , CARDINAL applications for permission to marry or enter a civil partnership were dealt with . CARDINAL were granted , CARDINAL of these on exceptional or compassionate grounds , the rest because they met the leave criteria . CARDINAL were refused . CARDINAL were withdrawn or discontinued . We are told that this was quite deliberate . The Government simply decided to subject a large number of proposed marriages to the deterrent effect of scrutiny and to prohibit all those in the class which they thought most likely to contain the suspect unions . Making a serious attempt to distinguish between the \u201c sham \u201d and the genuine was considered too difficult and too expensive . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the judgments of Mr Justice PERSON on DATE , the first version of the scheme was amended . Under the new procedure ( \u201c the second version \u201d ) , applicants who had insufficient leave to enter or remain at the time of applying for a Certificate of Approval could be asked to submit further information in support of their applications to enable ORG to satisfy itself that the proposed marriage or civil partnership was genuine .", "CARDINAL . Further amendments followed ORG judgment on DATE ( \u201c the third version \u201d ) . Under the third version of the scheme , applications from individuals who did not have valid leave to enter or remain , who had until this point been refused a Certificate of Approval unless there were exceptional compassionate circumstances , were to be treated in line with the guidance for those who had limited but insufficient leave to qualify for a Certificate .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE the ORG suspended the requirement to pay any fee . On DATE a scheme for repaying fees to applicants who met a financial hardship test at the time of the application met with Ministerial approval .", "CARDINAL .
