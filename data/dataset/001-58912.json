In this respect , ORG noted that , pursuant to LAW had the immunities provided for in GPE I of the said Convention , and that it had not waived immunity under LAW ( a ) of that annex .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question of waiver , ORG found that LAW concerning ORG did not apply in the applicants\u2019 situation as they had not been employed by ORG , but had worked for ORG on the basis of a contract of employment with a third person .

Furthermore , the alleged violation of the applicants\u2019 constitutional rights was not of special importance , nor were the applicants significantly affected .

However , they had failed to show any disadvantages other than those associated with any loss of work .
