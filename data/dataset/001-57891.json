ORG In the ORG counsel for the applicant and Mr PERSON called for their acquittal . He argued that the conduct of the applicant and PERSON could in no way be compared to that of the other CARDINAL defendants , with whose views they did not sympathise . They sought merely to provide a realistic picture of a social problem ; in fact the programme only provoked resentment and aroused pity in respect of the CARDINAL other defendants , who had exposed themselves to ridicule on their own terms . Accordingly , it was by no means the intention of ORG to persuade others to subscribe to the same views as the ORG , rather the contrary . Under the relevant law a distinction had to be drawn between the persons who made the statements and the programme editors , the latter enjoying a special freedom of expression . Having at that time a broadcasting monopoly , ORG was under a duty to impart all opinions of public interest in a manner that reflected the speaker \u2019s way of expressing himself . The public also had an interest in being informed of notoriously bad social attitudes , even those which were unpleasant . The programme was broadcast in the context of a public debate which had resulted in press comments , for instance in ORG , and was simply an honest report on the realities of the youths in question . Counsel , referring inter alia to the above - mentioned article in ORG , also pointed to the fact that no consistent prosecution policy had been followed in cases of this nature .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG convicted the CARDINAL youths , CARDINAL of them for having stated that \" niggers \" and \" foreign workers \" were \" animals \" , and CARDINAL of them for their assertions in relation to drugs and \" Perkere \" . The applicant was convicted of aiding and abetting them , as was PERSON , in his capacity as programme controller ; they were sentenced to pay day - fines ( dagsb\u00f8der ) totalling CARDINAL and MONEY , respectively , or alternatively to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment ( h\u00e6fte ) .", "As regards the applicant , ORG found that , following the article in Information of DATE , he had visited the ORG and after a conversation with PERSON , amongst others , agreed that the CARDINAL youths should participate in a television programme . The object of the programme had been to demonstrate the attitude of the ORG to the racism at ORG , previously mentioned in the article in Information , and to show their social background . Accordingly , so ORG held , the applicant had himself taken the initiative of making the television programme and , further , he had been well aware in advance that discriminatory statements of a racist nature were likely to be made during the interview . The interview had lasted TIME , during which beer , partly paid for by ORG , was consumed . In this connection the applicant had encouraged the ORG to express their racist views , which , in so far as they were broadcast on television , in itself constituted a breach of LAW ( b ) of LAW . The statements were broadcast without any counterbalancing comments , after the recordings had been edited by the applicant . He was accordingly guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of LAW ( b ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant and PERSON , but not the CARDINAL ORG , appealed against ORG judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) . They essentially reiterated the submissions made before ORG and , in addition , the applicant explained that , although he had suspected that the ORG statements were punishable , he had refrained from omitting these from the programme , considering it crucial to show their actual attitude . He assumed that they were aware that they might incur criminal liability by making the statements and had therefore not warned them of this fact .", "CARDINAL . ORG By judgment of DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , dismissed the appeal .", "The dissenting member was of the view that , although the statements by the ORG constituted offences under LAW ( b ) of LAW , the applicant and PERSON had not transgressed the bounds of the freedom of speech to be enjoyed by television and other media , since the object of the programme was to inform about and animate public discussion on the particular racist attitudes and social background of the youth group in question .", "CARDINAL . ORG With leave the applicant and PERSON appealed from the High Court judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , which by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL dismissed the appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The majority held :", "\" The defendants have caused the publication of the racist statements made by a narrow circle of persons and thereby made those persons liable to punishment and have thus , as held by ORG and ORG , violated LAW b ) in conjunction with LAW . [ We ] do not find that an acquittal of the defendants could be justified on the ground of freedom of expression in matters of public interest as opposed to the interest in the protection against racial discrimination . [ We ] therefore vote in favour of confirming the judgment [ appealed from ] . \"", "Justice PERSON stated in his dissent :", "\" The object of the programme was to contribute to information on an issue - the attitude towards foreigners - which was the subject of extensive and sometimes emotional public debate . The programme must be presumed to have given a clear picture of the ORG views , of which the public was thus given an opportunity to be informed and form its own opinion . In view of the nature of these views , any counterbalancing during or immediately before or after would not have served a useful purpose . Although it concerned a relatively small group of people holding extreme views , the programme had a fair degree of news and information value . The fact that the defendants took the initiative to disseminate such views is not of paramount importance for the assessment of their conduct . In these circumstances and irrespective of the fact that the statements rightly have been found to be in violation of LAW ( b ) , I question the advisability of finding the defendants guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of this provision . I therefore vote in favour of the defendants\u2019 acquittal . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG When ORG has rendered judgment in a case raising important issues of principle it is customary that a member of the majority publishes a detailed and authoritative statement of the reasons for the judgment . In keeping with this custom , Justice PERSON on DATE published such a statement in ORG ( ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the conviction of the applicant and PERSON , the majority had attached importance to the fact that they had caused the racist statements to be made public . The applicant \u2019s item had not been a direct report on a meeting . He had himself contacted the CARDINAL youths and caused them to make assertions such as those previously made in ORG , which he knew of and probably expected them to repeat . He had himself cut the recording of the interview , lasting TIME , down to TIME containing the crude comments . The statements , which would hardly have been punishable under LAW ( b ) of LAW had they not been made to a wide circle ( \" videre kreds \" ) of people , became clearly punishable as they were broadcast on television on the applicant \u2019s initiative and with PERSON approval . It was therefore beyond doubt that they had aided and abetted the dissemination of the statements .", "Acquitting the applicant and PERSON could only be justified by reasons clearly outweighing the wrongfulness of their actions . In this connection , the interest in protecting those grossly insulted by the statements had to be weighed up against that of informing the public of the statements . Whilst it is desirable to allow the press the best possible conditions for reporting on society , press freedom can not be unlimited since freedom of expression is coupled with responsibilities .", "In striking a balance between the various interests involved , the majority had regard to the fact that the statements , which were brought to a wide circle of people , consisted of series of inarticulate , defamatory remarks and insults spoken by members of an insignificant group whose opinions could hardly be of interest to many people . Their news or information value was not such as to justify their dissemination and therefore did not warrant acquitting the defendants . This did not mean that extremist views could not be reported in the press , but such reports must be carried out in a more balanced and comprehensive manner than was the case in the television programme in question . Direct reports from meetings which were a matter of public interest should also be permitted .", "The minority , on the other hand , considered that the right to information overrode the interests protected by LAW b ) of LAW .", "Finally , Justice PERSON noted that the compatibility of the impugned measures with LAW ) of the Convention was not raised during the trial .", "CARDINAL .
