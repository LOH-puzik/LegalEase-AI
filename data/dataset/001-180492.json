On DATE ORG once again ordered the police to ensure the presence of PERSON and the CARDINAL attesting witnesses at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it decided to continue the examination of the case in the absence of PERSON as it appeared impossible to establish her whereabouts . In reaching that conclusion , the court referred to the fact that she was no longer registered as being resident in the ORG region and that the police had information that she had emigrated to GPE . By the same ruling , ORG ordered the prosecution authorities to ensure the mandatory presence of T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of fraud and incitement to bribery and sentenced her to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( then equivalent to LAW ) . Although the applicant pleaded innocent , the court considered her guilt to be proved by the totality of the evidence . It relied on the statements of PERSON , the aggrieved party , made during the pretrial investigation , and those of the attesting witnesses , made by PERSON before the court and by T. during the pre - trial investigation . The court stated that it had \u201c no grounds for questioning the credibility of the aggrieved party and the witnesses whose statements [ were ] corroborated by other objective [ ... ] evidence \u201d . The trial court also relied on the inspection and seizure report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the forensic expert examination report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The verdict noted that the applicant had initially confessed to the offences , but had later retracted her confession for no apparent reason other than an attempt to escape liability . Her initial statement was considered , however , more plausible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed and on DATE she submitted further \u201c written explanations to [ her ] appeal \u201d .

The applicant did not refer in her appeal or in its supplement to her inability to examine ORG or to have him examined . At the same time , on DATE , she lodged a written application to the appellate court to summon T. given that he \u201c was an attesting witness \u201d and that he \u201c had made statements against [ the applicant ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . It considered that the applicant had initially made a confession of her own free will and that she had failed to give any convincing explanation about her subsequent change in position . Furthermore , the appellate court noted that the whereabouts of PERSON and T. could not be established . There were no reasons to question the veracity of the statements they had made during the pre - trial investigation . Nor were there any reasons to suspect any intention by them to falsely accuse the applicant . In sum , the appellate court did not discern any procedural flaws which warranted quashing the verdict .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . She argued that the covert operation of DATE had been unlawful because it had not been duly authorised and had taken place in the absence of any criminal proceedings against her , even prior to the formal registration of PERSON \u2019s statement . The applicant also complained that her rights under LAW ( d ) of the LAW had been breached on account of her inability to cross - examine M. and T.", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued again . However , DATE the investigation was resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant for lack of the constituent elements of a crime in her actions .

On DATE a new Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) entered into force . Instead of opening a criminal case , it provided for the initiation of an investigation by way of making an entry in ORG .", "DATE .

The applicant also mentioned , in general terms , that she had been unlawfully placed under an undertaking not to leave her town , without further details .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor submitted objections . He stated that on DATE the investigator dealing with the applicant \u2019s case had revoked the impugned preventive measure , given that no charges had been brought against her within DATE of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . The prosecutor also noted that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been reopened on DATE ( see paragraph DATE above ) and remained pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim as unsubstantiated . As regards her undertaking not to leave the town , the court concluded that it had only been applicable from MONEY DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She submitted , in particular , that \u201c the [ firstinstance ] court had not given any legal assessment to the fact that the criminal proceedings against [ her ] had been instituted on DATE and discontinued on CARDINAL DATE , and that all that time [ she ] had been under an undertaking not to abscond , which had been lifted by the ruling on the termination of the criminal proceedings of CARDINAL DATE , that being confirmed by [ the investigator \u2019s ] letter of CARDINAL DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant indicated in brackets the page number of the letter concerned in the case file . She further argued , in general terms , that the court had incorrectly interpreted Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that it had not calculated , as prescribed under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , an amount of compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage to which she was entitled . The applicant did not enclose any documents with her appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It noted that the sole fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued did not imply that she had suffered non - pecuniary damage and she had failed to prove otherwise . The appellate court further observed that the applicant \u201c [ had ] not proved when exactly she had been placed under the undertaking not to leave the town as a preventive measure . Therefore , her submission that she had been restrained in her liberty of movement for DATE [ could ] not be taken into consideration \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , in which she indicated , in particular , that the applicability of the undertaking not to leave the town from DATE to CARDINAL DATE had been established by documents . She reiterated her earlier argument that no assessment had been given to the investigator \u2019s refusals of her requests for leave to travel outside the ORG region in DATE . This time the applicant enclosed a copy of the letter referred to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers involved in the undercover operation of DATE . Her main argument was that PERSON \u2019s complaint had been registered only at TIME that day , which had been after the completion of the police operation and thus had undermined its lawfulness .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution authorities refused to open a criminal case against the police on several occasions . It was established that PERSON \u2019s complaint had indeed been registered , by mistake , at TIME instead of TIME on DATE , for which the respective officer had been reprimanded .
