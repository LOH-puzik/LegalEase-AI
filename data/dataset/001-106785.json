On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s mother made a request for her son to be granted NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed the applicant \u2019s mother that since she was not a NORP citizen and the father of the applicant had not yet been declared to be a NORP citizen on the applicant \u2019s birth certificate , the applicant was not entitled to NORP citizenship .

By a decree of an unspecified date the NORP courts declared PERSON , a NORP citizen , to be the applicant \u2019s biological father . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s birth certificate was amended to reflect the established paternity .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in the meantime the applicant \u2019s mother was informed that even if PERSON was judicially declared to be the applicant \u2019s father the applicant would still not be eligible for citizenship in view of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW , which stated that children born out of wedlock were only eligible for NORP citizenship if their mother was LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL .

Since the applicant was not born to a married couple , as a result of the application of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) any reference to the \u201c father \u201d in section CARDINAL ) had to be deemed to be a reference to the mother .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , on appeal , ORG reversed the first - instance judgment . Noting the amendments in DATE ( see Relevant Domestic Law ) , it considered that its judgment had to be limited to the parameters of the application before it . It held that the right to citizenship was not a substantive Convention right . The grant or denial of citizenship would not facilitate or create obstacles to the applicant \u2019s family life since his father categorically refused to have any contact with him . Moreover , since the Convention did not oblige a ORG to allow a non - national spouse to reside in its territory , it could not be said that the ORG was obliged to grant citizenship to a non - national .", "CARDINAL .
