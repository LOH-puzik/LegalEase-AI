It later turned out that they were police officers from the PERSON and ORG and from a special anti - terrorist group .", "CARDINAL . Some of the officers wore plain clothes and others combat uniforms with bulletproof vests and helmets . Not all the police officers were wearing fluorescent vests and they bore no other visible signs that would indicate that they were from the police . In particular one police officer , later named witness no . CARDINAL , as was visible on the film recorded by the camera of the private television station ORG , was not wearing such a vest . The ORG television had been preparing a documentary on the work of the police and had placed cameras in the police cars . A short documentary \u201c Criminal Games \u201d was prepared following the operation .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE and the other CARDINAL occupants of the car thought they were about to be robbed and tried to escape in the direction of the swimming pool which led to a dead end . PERSON took the driver 's seat and Mr PERSON climbed into the back - seat behind him . The third man , ORG , did not manage to get inside the car and tried to run away .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE and PERSON drove DATE third police vehicles while the police opened fire , shooting repeatedly at the driver and the passenger . The orders of the commanding officer had not been complied with as he had ordered that the police officers from the last vehicle should arrest the suspects .

The whole operation lasted TIME during which CARDINAL bullets were fired at the car as it was driving off , according to an expert , at CARDINAL k.p.h . In spite of the claims by the police officers that they had been aiming at the tyres , none of the tyres had been damaged .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL police officers had arrived in CARDINAL unmarked cars , wearing balaclavas and bulletproof vests .

The other group , from a special anti - terrorist force , were wearing uniforms and dark - coloured vests marked \u201c Police \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The police operation had started when the commanding officer received information that a suspicious group of people had gathered on the grounds of ORG . After he had given the order to move , the column of cars had approached the ORG Passat that was parked at right angles to the street . The commanding officer had ordered the arrest of CARDINAL men who were standing next to the ORG and who turned out to be Mr ORG and ORG The arrest was to be carried out by police officers from the last CARDINAL cars in the column . The police vehicles had moved CARDINAL after the other , blocking the street and the suspects ' car . The suspects had tried to escape and CARDINAL of them had jumped into the car and driven off fast , taking advantage of a gap that had been left between the second and third police vehicles . By this time almost all the police cars had stopped and the police officers had got out . They were armed with guns and semi - automatic rifles . A police officer , who in the proceedings was named anonymous witness no . CARDINAL , got out of the second vehicle and found himself in the way of the ORG so he jumped aside to avoid being hit by the rapidly moving car . He shouted \u201c police \u201d and started shooting , aiming at the tyres of the suspects ' car . He fired TIME shots from his sub - machine gun ( pistolet maszynowy Glauberyt ) . Another police officer , witness no . CARDINAL , got out of the first vehicle and found himself facing the escaping ORG . He was wearing a fluorescent vest marked with the word \u201c Police \u201d , and shouted \u201c stop , police \u201d but the driver failed to obey . At the last moment , the witness had had to jump aside but had nevertheless been hit by the car and sustained an injury to his leg .

The police officer then fired a short burst from his machine gun ( karabin PERSON ) aiming at the lower side of the car and tyres . Finally , another officer from the antiterrorist forces , witness no . DATE , had got out of the third vehicle . Noticing that the suspects ' car had passed one of the police vehicles and hit officer no . CARDINAL , he had run after the escaping vehicle , shouted to the driver to stop and opened fire with his machine gun ( a PERSON ) , aiming at the car 's left rear tyres . The other police officers had run after ORG , the remaining suspect who had not managed to get into the car , and overpowered him .", "CARDINAL . The suspects ' car stopped on reaching the metal fence . Witness no . CARDINAL had gone to the car and ordered the driver to surrender . He had helped him out of the car and attended to him as he was bleeding . Anonymous witness no .

The police officer had tried to staunch the bleeding from his back and called the commanding officer , who brought over a medical ventilator and started to resuscitate him until the arrival of the ambulance .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also established that Mr PERSON 's death had been caused by a bullet wound to the torso . The bullet breached the abdominal aorta causing a massive haemorrhage . It did not leave his body and the experts were able to establish that it had been fired by witness no . CARDINAL . In addition to the fatal wound , PERSON had sustained a further CARDINAL surface bullet wounds to his head , right arm , lower torso , left torso and left thigh .", "CARDINAL .

As a result , he had become severely disabled , suffering from paralysis on one side of his face and deafness .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor established that the driver of the ORG had failed to obey the order to stop , accelerated towards witness no . CARDINAL , and had therefore acted with the intention of killing him . The prosecutor concluded that in those circumstances the police officers had had the right to use their firearms in pursuing persons against whom there was a reasonable suspicion that they had attempted to commit homicide and were armed . According to the prosecutor , the investigation materials showed that when using their weapons the police officers had followed all the relevant rules and their sole intention had been to stop escaping suspects . The prosecutor thus decided to discontinue the investigation as no crime had been committed .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants appealed against that decision . They submitted that PERSON and Mr PERSON had not been armed as the guns found in the car had not been used and did not have their fingerprints on them . The gun linked by the expert to PERSON by scent identification had been hidden in the pocket of the car seat and thus could not have been used by him . The applicants alleged that the prosecutor had failed to deal with many inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers . Moreover , it had not been explained why no blood stains had been found in the car even though PERSON had died of a haemorrhage and suffered many bullet wounds . The applicants also blamed the police for not preparing the operation properly . They pointed to the fact that in total CARDINAL armed police officers had participated in the operation during which forty shots had been fired at the car ( including CARDINAL which had passed through a point above the driver 's door handle , CARDINAL through the boot , CARDINAL through the rear bumper , and CARDINAL through the driver 's seat and back seat ) . The car 's tyres remained undamaged despite the testimonies of the police officers that they had all aimed at the tyres . The applicants therefore submitted that the force used by the police officers against CARDINAL unarmed men had been disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki District Court ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) dismissed the applicants ' appeals and upheld the prosecutor 's decision . It found that no offence had been committed and the law , in particular section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , had been complied with . The court stated :", "\u201c When seeing the police , [ PERSON and Mr PERSON ] tried to escape . This attempt was met with a firm but proper response from the police officers participating in the operation , in particular anonymous witness no . CARDINAL , who stood in the path of the oncoming car and attempted to stop it by shouting : ' Stop , police ' . One should recall at this point the very important circumstance that this witness was wearing a fluorescent vest with the word ' Police ' marked on it , leaving no room for doubt about his function . The car was heading straight for the intervening police officer who only managed to avoid being hit by PERSON [ who was driving the car ] through his training and expertise ...", "The court has established , after analysing the evidence , that when firing the shots the police officers followed all the procedures necessary in the situation and their intention was only to stop the speeding car and to arrest the fugitives . They used their guns in the direct pursuit of the suspects , who had made an attempt on the life and health of the police officers ...", "The court does not agree with the submission made in the appeal lodged by the [ first applicant 's ] lawyer that PERSON and [ PERSON ] had not used any firearms and that no shot had been fired by them . The actions of the police officers were not in response to shots being fired by the suspects . They attempted to arrest persons in respect of whom there was a reasonable suspicion that they were armed , without a relevant licence , and who had made a direct and illegal attempt on the life and health of the police officers .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . That decision was final as no appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . After the events , PERSON and some other persons arrested in the Spa\u0142a FAC were indicted on various charges .", "CARDINAL . It appears that in the course of these proceedings the police officers who had participated in the operation again gave evidence in court . The applicants submitted excerpts from the transcript of CARDINAL of the hearings held on an unspecified date when the court heard witness no . CARDINAL . The witness repeated the version of events he had given in the investigation against the police . Afterwards he was shown the episodes from the film recorded by a TVN camera . He then testified as follows :", "\u201c I saw on the film that a person , probably me , jumped out of a car and did not have a yellow vest on , but from what I can remember I must have put on this vest when drawing alongside the second vehicle . It was caused by the fact , mentioned by me before , that according to the first plan of the operation , the team in the vehicle I was in was supposed to make arrests at the swimming pool [ located deeper inside the grounds of the FAC , where some other suspects were arrested ] . That 's why I was taken by surprise when the order of the commanding officer came and so did not have my vest on when I got out of the car . I was not wearing a helmet either , as I did not put it on and it remained in the car . At this moment I do not remember if I got out of the car with the vest in my hand but I believe so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that in DATE ORG convicted PERSON of assaulting a police officer and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . It appears that subsequently in this set of proceedings , on DATE , an expert opinion was submitted to the court by a road accident expert . The expert was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt the exact location of witness no . CARDINAL and the ORG Passat during the events . He was also unable to give a conclusive opinion on whether the driver of the ORG had had time to change direction in order to avoid hitting witness no . CARDINAL , who had emerged suddenly from his police car .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( ORG ) reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
