The Federal Chancellery , for its part , made comments along the same lines and noted that PERSON would be agreeable ( ware einverstanden ) to this form of reparation and would waive ( w\u00fcrde verzichten ) all claims to monetary compensation .", "( c ) It was on the basis of this proposal that , on DATE , the Federal President of GPE granted PERSON remission of the part of his sentence remaining unserved , i.e. , DATE , DATE and DATE .

He further claimed that he had spent in vain QUANTITY in lawyers\u2019 fees in order to obtain his release . Finally , he considered that he was entitled to CARDINAL schillings damages for the injustice he had suffered . He pointed out , however , that the total amount he claimed , MONEY , should be reduced somewhat as his business losses resulting from his arrest had been calculated on estimated gross profits . Noting that the damages due to him by GPE considerably exceeded the total sum originally claimed , he reserved his right to make a corresponding increase in his claim and in addition he asked for payment of interest at an official rate of MONEY per annum .", "CARDINAL .
