NORP In DATE the municipal authorities in GPE decided to allocate land for the construction of a hotel in PERSON . The exact borders of the plot were specified in a decision delivered in DATE : it was one of the plots formerly owned by the applicants\u2019 ancestors . In DATE a proposal to formally expropriate the land from the agricultural co - operative in which it had been included earlier was rejected by a commission created by the Government .", "CARDINAL . The hotel was constructed DATE . It consisted of a main building \u2012 comprising a restaurant and QUANTITY bedrooms , QUANTITY bungalows and maintenance buildings . In DATE the complex also included an unfinished building , designed to be used as CARDINAL bedrooms and a lounge , and a swimming pool .

In DATE the local authorities in GPE created a ORG - owned enterprise named \u201c ORG delo na SO \u201d , which was charged with the task , in particular , of using and managing the hotel in PERSON . On DATE the Minister of Agriculture ordered the creation of a ORG - owned limited liability company named \u201c ORG delo na ORG \u201d ORG , which took over the assets of the enterprise ; under the applicable domestic provisions , this entailed the company becoming the owner of these assets . \u201c ORG delo na ORG \u201d ORG was entered in the companies register in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The applicants instigated proceedings for judicial review of the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In a final judgment of DATE the ORG quashed the decision .

ORG final judgment was given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The domestic courts found that \u201c ORG delo na ORG \u201d ORG had become the owner of the plot following its transformation into a ORG company in DATE , since the ORG enterprise of which it was the successor had previously used and managed that property . As to the ORG claims , the courts noted that they were based on the land commission \u2019s decision of DATE . However , this decision , as well as the Teteven ORG judgment of DATE , were not binding on \u201c ORG delo na ORG \u201d ORG , as it had not been party to the restitution proceedings .

This was so in particular in the light of the provision contained in section CARDINAL of the ORG , which barred such restitution where a \u201c complex of construction works \u201d had been carried out on the land at issue . Section CARDINALb did not require the construction works to have been lawful , since what mattered was the situation at the moment of the ORG \u2019s entry into force .", "CARDINAL .
