THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and resident on GPE ( GPE ) .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The applicant hails originally from GPE ( GPE ) . It appears that at some time before the events complained of he was convicted of drugs dealing there and spent DATE in prison . He subsequently moved to the GPE .", "In DATE the applicant went to visit his native GPE . He returned to the GPE on DATE , arriving at GPE ( GPE ) Airport on DATE .", "Passing through customs the applicant stated that he had nothing to declare . Nonetheless his luggage was inspected by customs officials . A clock was found which had a wooden casing decorated with a picture of a typical LOC house . It appears from an official record subsequently drawn up by the customs officials concerned that they had felt the clock body to be \u201c rather thick \u201d and that , when they tapped it , it had sounded hollow . They had drilled a hole into it and some white powder had come out on the drill . When opened the clock was found to contain QUANTITY grams of a substance identified as cocaine .", "The cocaine and the clock were seized . The applicant was arrested and questioned by a police officer and a customs officer . He stated that he had not known that the clock contained cocaine . The police officer placed him in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) .", "The applicant was questioned by the police officer and the customs officer on DATE . According to his statement on this occasion , he had met a young woman , CARDINAL NORP , on GPE , with whom he had entered into an intimate relationship . The applicant and NORP had planned to travel to the GPE together . For this reason he had postponed his departure for DATE . His airline ticket , which had cost MONEY , had been bought for him by a friend . He had given this friend MONEY and the friend had paid the balance himself . He declined to give the name of the friend . On DATE of the applicant \u2019s and NORP \u2019s planned departure , DATE , NORP had told the applicant that she would not accompany him . She had given him a souvenir clock . The applicant had travelled to the GPE alone . The applicant stated that he was not prepared to relinquish title ( afstand doen ) to the clock and the cocaine because they were not his .", "An unsigned document which was apparently appended to a receipt dated DATE and delivered to the applicant by the police officer and the customs officer states that the applicant had in fact relinquished title to the clock and the cocaine . This document further states that the clock and the cocaine would be kept by the police at FAC pending a decision of the public prosecutor .", "The applicant was questioned by an investigating judge on DATE . He made a brief statement confirming the statement made DATE to the police officer and the customs officer . The investigating judge placed him in detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) .", "On DATE the applicant was released pending trial by order of ORG after a brief hearing in camera . According to the applicant \u2019s counsel the clock was present at that hearing . ORG order , however , does not refer to it .", "Proceedings in ORG", "On DATE the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) sent the applicant a notification that he would be prosecuted for importing or , in the alternative , possessing a quantity of cocaine .", "The applicant was summoned to appear before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on DATE . The summons was served at the applicant \u2019s registered address in NORP on DATE . As the applicant was not at home at the time , the summons was handed to his sister , who agreed to take charge of it and ensure that it reached the applicant without delay .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer sent CARDINAL fax messages , CARDINAL to ORG registrar and one to the public prosecutor , both asking for the clock to be produced at the hearing . DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer received a message by telephone from the secretary of the public prosecutor to the effect that the clock had not been deposited at the registry of ORG and could not be traced .", "The applicant did not appear at the hearing on DATE . His counsel , who was present , stated that the applicant was apparently living in GPE and that he had the impression that the summons had reached the applicant . He did not seek an adjournment for lack of any arguments on which to base such a request . ORG proceeded with the trial in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "Invoking the report of ORG in the case of PERSON v. the GPE ( DATE , no . CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , the applicant \u2019s counsel asked to be allowed to address the court in the applicant \u2019s defence . The prosecution objected on the ground that no compelling reasons were apparent which prevented the applicant from attending the hearing . This objection was accepted by ORG , which accordingly proceeded to a judgment without hearing any defence argument .", "On DATE ORG gave its judgment . It found the applicant guilty of having intentionally imported QUANTITY of cocaine into the GPE and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It withdrew the clock and the cocaine from circulation .", "ORG in ORG", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "A summons to appear before ORG on DATE was addressed to the applicant at his address in LOC . However , it appeared that the applicant had in the meanwhile returned to GPE , and so ORG declared the summons null and void . The applicant was summoned anew , this time to appear before ORG on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s counsel \u2013 not the same lawyer who had tried to defend the applicant before ORG \u2013 submitted grounds of appeal in writing .", "Relying on ORG PERSON v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) he argued that the first - instance proceedings had not been fair because the defence had not been heard . He asked for the case to be referred back to ORG for rehearing in the applicant \u2019s presence .", "Relying on , inter alia , the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , he argued that criminal intent on the part of the applicant could not be proved . The clock which NORP had given the applicant had appeared perfectly normal and there had been nothing to suggest that it might contain any illicit substance . He asked for the clock to be produced at the hearing .", "The Procurator General ( procureur - generaal ) of ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE informing him that the clock could not be produced because it had been destroyed .", "The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearing on DATE . Counsel asked ORG first to rule on the preliminary objections contained in his statement of grounds of appeal .", "ORG withdrew to consider these objections . After deliberating in private it rejected the objection that the summons to the first - instance hearing had been served at the wrong address , noting that the address to which it had been served had been the address at which the applicant was registered and that it did not appear that the applicant had not been resident there . It further found that LAW did not oblige it to refer the case back to ORG on the ground that the applicant \u2019s counsel had not had the opportunity to address that court in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "The hearing was resumed . The applicant availed himself of his right to remain silent .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer again asked for the clock to be produced . The Procurator General again stated that it had been destroyed .", "The lawyer then argued that the prosecution ought to be declared inadmissible because what it considered to be the most essential item of prosecution evidence , the clock , had been destroyed ; in the alternative , since the clock could not be produced , it should be assumed that the applicant had not had any real reason to examine it when it was given to him , and so the clock could not be relied upon to ground a conviction .", "ORG gave its judgment on DATE . It found the applicant guilty of having intentionally imported cocaine into the GPE and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "ORG noted that although the applicant had not formally relinquished title to the clock , it could be inferred from his \u201c procedural attitude \u201d ( proceshouding ) at the relevant time that he had not been interested in having the clock re - examined at a later stage . There was therefore no need to declare the prosecution inadmissible merely because the clock had been destroyed by mistake . Moreover , the clock was not so important an item of prosecution evidence as the defence claimed . In any event , sufficient information about it was available in the form of descriptions and photographs , and to that extent the rights of the defence were not impaired to any material extent .", "In so far as the defence claimed that it had not been apparent that there had been anything unusual about the clock , ORG referred to the official report by the customs officers who had arrested the applicant , from which it appeared that the applicant had been found in possession of a clock comprising a wooden body which had appeared \u201c rather thick \u201d and which , when tapped on , had sounded hollow .", "Proceedings in ORG", "The applicant , through his lawyer , lodged an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) on CARDINAL DATE .", "He complained , as his first ground of appeal , that since the prosecution had been responsible for the destruction of the clock , the prosecution ought to have been declared inadmissible or , in the alternative , all evidence based on the clock ought to have been rejected . It was of essential importance whether or not the appearance of the clock had been such as to justify any reasonable suspicion that it might contain cocaine \u2013 which in his contention was not the case . Moreover , even if the applicant should be considered to have relinquished title to the clock DATE which in his contention was not so either \u2013 he had not waived the right to base a defence on it . Finally , the photographs contained in the file were not adequate substitutes for the clock itself .", "He claimed , as his second ground of appeal , that since he had consistently denied all knowledge of the fact that the clock contained cocaine , it could not be proved that he had intentionally imported that substance into the GPE . In his contention the finding of intent had been based solely on the presence of the cocaine in his luggage .", "As his third ground of appeal , relying on ORG above - mentioned PERSON judgment , he complained about the refusal by ORG to refer the case back to ORG for a rehearing at first instance , given that ORG had refused to allow his counsel to address it in his defence .", "Finally , should the above grounds of appeal in themselves not constitute sufficient reason to overturn the judgment of ORG , he argued that , taken together , they reflected a general lack of fairness of the proceedings .", "ORG gave its judgment on DATE . It rejected the appeal in its entirety .", "With regard to the third ground of appeal , ORG referred to its own case - law according to which the failure by the first - instance court to allow counsel to plead in the absence of the accused , although unlawful per se , did not entail any obligation on the part of ORG to refer the case back to ORG for a rehearing at first instance .", "The fourth ground of appeal was rejected in view of what had been held with regard to the other CARDINAL points ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
