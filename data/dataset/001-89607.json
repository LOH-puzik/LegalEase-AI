At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant and an accomplice were surprised by police while in the process of trying to enter a computer equipment shop through a hole in the wall of the basement of a neighbouring building . They had previously drilled the hole over the course of DATE , and in this way had attracted the attention of the building \u2019s inhabitants .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicant and his accomplice were heavily armed . The applicant opened fire and shot a police officer dead . Later he detonated a hand grenade . In the ensuing exchange of gunfire his accomplice was injured and died . The special antiterrorism squad intervened TIME . The applicant gave himself up and was arrested at TIME , after negotiations with the police , a psychologist and a public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was charged with attempted robbery committed in conspiracy with others and accompanied by murder , and placed in pretrial detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The charges against him were later amended to include the unlawful possession of firearms , ammunition and explosives in large quantities , the murder of a police officer , and attempted murder of CARDINAL police officers committed in a manner and by means which endangered several lives and by a person who had already committed murder . The maximum penalty on conviction for those offences was life imprisonment , with or without parole .", "CARDINAL . After GPE Prosecutor \u2019s Office referred the case back to the investigator on CARDINAL occasions for additional investigation , on CARDINAL DATE the investigator finished his work on the case , recommending that the applicant be committed for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed an indictment against the applicant with GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgerapporteur to whom the case was assigned set it down for hearing on CARDINAL and DATE . As required by LAW , as in force at that time , he examined of his own motion whether the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention should be replaced with a more lenient measure , and confirmed it without giving reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial against the applicant began in DATE , but had to restart in DATE , as in DATE the judge - rapporteur was appointed as the Minister of ORG and the formation examining the case did not include a reserve judge .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over the course of DATE numerous hearings were adjourned for various reasons . On some occasions the adjournments were made necessary by the fact that the applicant had dismissed his counsel and instructed new ones , who needed time to acquaint themselves with the case file .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of murdering a police officer , attempting to murder another police officer and unlawfully possessing firearms and explosives . Although under the relevant provisions of the DATE LAW it could have imposed a sentence of life imprisonment , it opted for a lesser penalty and sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , citing his clean criminal record , and the facts that he had a family and had not been fully discredited morally and socially .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed . The prosecution requested that the applicant \u2019s sentence be increased to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . When considering the appropriateness of the applicant \u2019s sentence , it found that the mitigating circumstances relied on by the lower court were not sufficient to warrant a sentence less than the maximum penalty . It also found that GPE had failed to take into account certain aggravating circumstances , such as the victim \u2019s good moral character . In its judgment , the murder committed by the applicant was considerably graver than other offences of that type and the aggravating circumstances were , overall , of such weight and intensity as to rule out a penalty showing any degree of lenience . However , it went on to say , by express reference to LAW , that the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined within a reasonable time , with all the negative repercussions which this had had on him . It found that the excessive length of the proceedings was not attributable to the applicant \u2019s conduct , although he had at times failed to organise his defence efficiently . In the court \u2019s view , the undue delay amounted in itself to a mitigating circumstance , which obviated the need to imprison the applicant for life , in line with the former ORG \u2019s and the ORG \u2019s caselaw that the excessive length of criminal proceedings could be remedied by a reduction in sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the prosecution appealed on points of law . The prosecution again argued that the penalty was far too lenient and should be increased to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment , endorsing its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on CARDINAL DATE and detained by an investigator \u2019s order of DATE . The reasons given by the investigator were that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence and that there existed a genuine risk that he might abscond . On DATE the investigator \u2019s order was approved by a prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made his first request for release on DATE , when the proceedings against him were at the preliminary investigation stage . The request was dismissed by ORG at a public hearing held on DATE . The court observed that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence carrying a very severe penalty , and that no special circumstances warranting his release existed . This decision was not subject to appeal . Nevertheless , on DATE , when the proceedings against him had already progressed to the trial stage , the applicant appealed against it to ORG . In a decision made in private on DATE ORG , finding that the applicant \u2019s legal challenge was actually not an appeal but a fresh request for release , sent it to GPE for a ruling . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to ORG . On DATE ORG returned the appeal , informing the applicant that its decision was not subject to appeal on points of law . It seems that GPE did not examine the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of the judgerapporteur to confirm his detention of his own motion following receipt of the indictment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , declared the appeal inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made further requests for release at several trial hearings , held on DATE and DATE , and DATE and CARDINAL DATE . They were all turned down by ORG at the respective hearings . The applicant \u2019s ensuing appeals were dismissed by ORG by decisions made in private on DATE , DATE , DATE and an unknown DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their reasoning ORG and ORG stressed , with various degrees of detail , the following points : ( i ) the applicant stood accused of several very serious offences , which in itself justified the conclusion that he was a dangerous individual who could abscond or reoffend , ( ii ) there were no fresh circumstances warranting his release , and ( iii ) no unwarranted delays had taken place in the criminal proceedings , as the case was factually and legally complex .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the presumption under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , in DATE version , about the existence of a risk that the detainee might abscond or reoffend ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) applied to the applicant \u2019s case . In CARDINAL other decisions \u2013 those of DATE and DATE that court expressed the view that the applicant \u2019s lack of a criminal record , known identity and permanent place of abode were not enough to rebut this presumption .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL occasions , in DATE and DATE , the applicant \u2019s appeals against the decisions of ORG were sent to the competent public prosecutors , who commented on them in writing . These comments were not communicated to the applicant and later the Sofia Court of Appeal ruled on the appeals in private , without holding a hearing , with the result that the applicant did not have the opportunity of replying to these comments .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the applicant made CARDINAL further requests for release in writing . They were turned down by ORG in decisions made in private on DATE and DATE and DATE . On appeal , these decisions were upheld by ORG in decisions also made in private on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later lodged CARDINAL more requests for release . They were all rejected by ORG at public hearings held on DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE and DATE . The applicant \u2019s ensuing appeals were dismissed by ORG by decisions made in private on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . ORG declined to examine a further request for release made by the applicant during the trial hearing on DATE , on the grounds that his counsel was absent and it could not proceed with the case .", "CARDINAL . In turning down the requests for release made DATE and DATE the courts relied on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant , the lack of change in the circumstances save for the passage of time , the complexity of the case and the diligent conduct of the proceedings . In their decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE the ORG and ORG expressed the view that the length of the proceedings was due to the numerous adjournments caused by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In its decisions of CARDINAL May , DATE and DATE the ORG stated that under the newly added LAW DATE Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , when ruling on requests for release made during the trial , it was barred from examining the existence or otherwise of a reasonable suspicion against the applicant . In its view , to do so would mean to prejudge the merits of the criminal case against the applicant . It was true that under LAW ( c ) of the LAW the court had to examine whether a reasonable suspicion existed , but that applied only to rulings made at the pretrial stage . This view was endorsed by ORG in its decision of DATE . For this reason , the courts declined to delve into the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning this point .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In a separate decision it confirmed his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to annul certain provisions of Regulation no . CARDINAL governing the legal regime of pretrial detainees ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which , in his view , violated , inter alia , his freedom of correspondence . In a final judgment of DATE ORG rejected his application .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW and the NORP courts\u2019 practice before DATE are summarised in the ORG \u2019s judgments in several similar cases ( see , among others , PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no .

On DATE the DATE Code was superseded by DATE Code of Criminal Procedure , which reproduced all the provisions brought in with the DATE reform .", "CARDINAL . By Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code , during the trial the GPE requests for release were examined by the trial court ( the same is currently provided for by LAW ) . It followed from LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Code that these requests could be examined in private or at an oral hearing ( under LAW , these requests must be examined at an oral hearing ) . The law did not \u2013 and still does not \u2013 require the court to decide within a particular timelimit .", "CARDINAL . The trial court \u2019s decision was subject to appeal to the higher court ( LAW of LAW ; superseded by LAW ) . The higher court could examine the appeal in private or , if it considered it necessary , at an oral hearing ( LAW , reproduced in LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A new Article CARDINALa was added to LAW in DATE . By paragraph CARDINAL of that Article ( presently reproduced in LAW ) , a fresh request for release at the same level of court could be made only if there had been a change in circumstances .
