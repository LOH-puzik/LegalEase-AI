NORP B.L.H. , a holding company , ORG ( together with CARDINAL further companies ) had their business address at FAC , GPE ( GPE ) , at LOC owned by GPE . The companies used a common server and e - mail server ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the server \u201d ) for their respective information technology systems . The server was owned by ORG . It contained the applicant ORG electronic archives and private information ( including private e - mail correspondence ) of employees and other persons working for the companies , which did not have their own administration . They received administrative support from a small number of persons working in ORG operating at the same address .", "CARDINAL . B.L.H. \u2019s data were stored on the server in the user areas dedicated to QUANTITY persons : Mr S. , who was B.L.H. \u2019s Managing Director , and QUANTITY other persons . They were employed by ORG AS \u2013 a subsidiary company of B.L.H. \u2013 which carried out management services for several companies , including B.L.H. The data in question were accessed by entering those ORG user areas , through their respective user names and passwords .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE tax office ( ligningskontor ) warned B.L.H. that the company \u2019s accounts for DATE would be audited . On DATE a meeting was held between representatives of B.L.H. , on the one hand , and the GPE tax office and GPE tax office ( fylkesskattekontor ) , on the other . The meeting took place at B.L.H. \u2019s offices in GPE . During the meeting the tax authorities presented B.L.H. with a list of questions and demanded that B.L.H. allow the auditors to make a copy of all the data on the server , which contained , inter alia , information on B.L.H. \u2019s accounts .", "CARDINAL . NORP The representatives of B.L.H. complied with the request to grant access to the server , including offering the tax authorities the necessary passwords . They refused , however , to comply with the tax authorities\u2019 further demand to supply a mirror copy of the ( entire ) server .", "CARDINAL . The Managing Director , PERSON , argued , inter alia , that B.L.H. did not own the server but only rented server capacity and that also other companies made use of the server . The Managing Director of Kver , the company owning the server , was called but he too refused to allow the tax authorities to take a mirror copy of the server .", "CARDINAL . Information and documents stored on the server were in part linked to other companies ( with the necessary access control ) , in part to employees working for the different companies . Access to the home directorates and e - mails ( including the map \" private files and pictures \" ) belonging to the different employees were protected by passwords .", "CARDINAL . Thus the server contained information belonging to the applicant companies and also information belonging to other companies and persons .", "CARDINAL . Following the refusal by B.L.H. and Kver to supply a mirror copy of the server , alternatives to a complete copy of the server were discussed . The discussion related first and foremost to whether the tax authorities would have to limit themselves to demanding copies of the part of the server administered by B.L.H. or persons working for B.L.H. The Managing Director of B.L.H. , PERSON , explained to the tax authorities how they could obtain ( all and only ) the documents belonging to B.L.H.", "CARDINAL . When Kver , as a co - user and the owner of the server , opposed the tax authorities\u2019 demand to seize the entire server , the tax authorities responded by issuing a notice that Kver would also be subject to a tax audit . They further ordered Kver to \u201c hand over all electronically stored information \u201d .", "CARDINAL . After further discussions , the parties compromised and agreed that the previous months\u2019 backup tape would be handed over to the tax authorities and sealed pending a decision on their complaint . The backup tape contained CARDINAL files in CARDINAL folders , totalling QUANTITY . In the applicant ORG submission , which the Government did not dispute , only a minor part of that information was relevant for the tax audit of B.L.H.", "CARDINAL . Both Kver and B.L.H. immediately lodged a complaint with ORG , a central tax authority under ORG , and requested the speedy return of the backup tape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Kver informed the GPE tax office that CARDINAL other companies , including ORG ( the third applicant company ) , also used the server and had therefore been affected by the seizure of DATE . On DATE the tax office notified those companies that they would also be audited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged a complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG gave a decision on each of the applicant ORG complaints on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards Kver and I.O.R. , the ORG withdrew the tax office \u2019s notice that an audit would be carried out and its demand that those companies hand over data . The ORG observed that the tax audit concerned B.L.H. and that section CARDINAL of LAW ( ligningsloven ) did not authorise the measures at issue where the purpose of the audit was to collect information about third parties .", "CARDINAL . The ORG confirmed the tax office \u2019s demand that B.L.H. hand over or give access to the server . Its decision further stated that a representative of this company would have the opportunity to be present during the review of the server by the tax office . The tax office \u2019s access to each area of the server was to be limited to those areas that were ( also ) used by B.L.H.", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaching the above conclusion , the ORG noted that ORG had observed , in its letter to ORG , that the term \u201c document \u201d in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW was not limited to information appearing on paper , plastic cards and so on , but also covered texts and figures stored electronically on a computer . Furthermore , the duty to hand over documents also applied to electronically stored documents . The tax authorities could choose whether to ask for paper printouts , electronically readable media , or for the documents to be forwarded to their own computers .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the question at issue concerned the delimitation of the tax authorities\u2019 access to the \u201c company \u2019s archives \u201d under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . In instances where the documents were stored on a server , the server was to be considered as an archive for the purposes of that provision . In the present instance , the tax office had \u201c seized \u201d ( \u201c tatt beslag i \u201d ) the server and the question was to what extent the tax office could inspect it . Whether an obligation could be imposed under section CARDINAL to hand over each document in the archive required consideration in the specific circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The ORG moreover noted that a tax subject was not under a duty to produce documents which exclusively concerned the rights and business relationships of other tax subjects . A further limitation was that the documents in question should be relevant to the tax subject \u2019s tax assessment . Accordingly , documents of exclusively private character fell outside that definition . That distinction was important in ascertaining the extent to which the tax authorities could themselves go through the server ( the archive ) or whether it was for the tax subject to decide which areas of the server should be handed over .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) had been added to give the tax authorities an opportunity to act with assertiveness ( \u201c g\u00e5 offensivt til verks \u201d ) when inspecting archives in order to find documents of importance to the activity concerned . It was thus clear that the authority to audit did not just amount to the passive reception of information handed out by the person subjected to the audit .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the ORG noted , section CARDINAL of the Act applied to the tax audit of a specific tax subject . The handing over of documents relating to other tax subjects ought to be based on LAW . In instances where the archives were physically separated ( into different parts of the server ) , section CARDINAL did not authorise the imposition of access to the archives of other companies . In the present instance , LAW did not apply .", "CARDINAL . To the extent that a joint archive was not physically divided but was mixed , the tax subject could not refuse the tax authorities access to the archive . In discussions on the draft legislation , it had been emphasised that the purpose of an audit should not be undermined by the tax subject withholding documents . In the ORG \u2019s view , this ought also to apply in relation to access to the tax subject \u2019s archives . The tax subject could thus not refuse the tax authorities access to its archives on the ground that they contained documents concerning other tax subjects . The duty to hand over all documents contained in the archives should , however , be limited to documents of importance to the tax subject \u2019s tax assessment , see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In practice , in order to solve the problem of the tax subject avoiding the inspection of documents in the archives ( the server ) that were insignificant for its tax assessment , the tax subject would be allowed to be present during the review of the archive ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . Accordingly , the ORG stated , a representative of B.L.H. was to be present during the tax authorities\u2019 review .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the applicant companies instituted proceedings before ORG , asking it to quash ORG decision of DATE in respect of B.L.H. and to order the return of the backup tape to GPE . On DATE ORG found in favour of the ORG and rejected the applicant ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG found that the measure imposed by the tax authorities could comprise the copying of data for subsequent inspection at the tax office to the same extent as on - site access to data on the server could be imposed . It also found that the server in the present instance should be considered in the same way as mixed paper archives .", "CARDINAL . The applicant companies appealed to ORG , which by a judgment of DATE upheld ORG decision on essentially the same grounds . ORG noted inter alia that the case concerned an inspection by the tax authorities of a taxpayer in connection with a notified tax audit , an area in which the principle of legality ( legalitetsprinsippet ) applied , as did other legal safeguards , including the prohibition of self - incrimination derived from LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant companies appealed to ORG , disputing in the main the High Court \u2019s application of the law . It had failed to appreciate that the relevant provisions of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) laid down clear limits for the manner of conduct of a tax inspection , which could be carried out only of the archives of the tax - subject in question , and a demand to hand over documents should be limited to pertinent material contained therein . These limits had been transgressed in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The threshold for accepting access beyond the relevant company \u2019s own archives ought to be high , not least because , by reviewing the server , the right to inspect B.L.H. had been extended to other tax subjects that were not being audited , and to any private and confidential information stored on the server . They referred to LAW , according to which interference with \u201c home \u201d and \u201c correspondence \u201d was not permitted unless it was \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d and \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d . They submitted that , according to ORG judgment in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , DATE also protected companies .", "CARDINAL . By empowering the authorities to demand copies of the server this would also give them full access to personal data belonging to employees working for different companies as well as any private correspondence that they might have stored on the server or received on their respective e - mail addresses . This aspect of the case also appeared to breach LAW , as well as laws and regulations on the processing of personal data .", "CARDINAL . ORG Since the imposition of an inspection of the archives of entities others than B.L.H. lacked a basis in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW and LAW , the tax authorities had acted contrary to the national legal provisions relied on .", "CARDINAL . The application of the mixed - archive doctrine to their case had no legal basis , nor did it follow from clear and established practice . The tax authorities had not documented that there was a mixed archive in the instant case or made any attempt to carry out a prior on - site review in order to determine whether it would be possible to separate B.L.H. \u2019s archives from those of the other companies . It ought to be a condition for a company accepting the seizure of its archives that adequate attempts be made to restrict the seizure to those areas that concerned the activity at issue . Where a partial inspection on the spot revealed that CARDINAL or more documents had no corroborative significance , the tax authorities could not , according to ORG case - law , seize the archives for further investigation . The same would also follow from LAW .", "CARDINAL . There had been no legal basis for the authorities to take a full backup copy of the server . LAW had come into force at a time when archives had been paper based . In the absence of the tax subject \u2019s consent and any prior review , the tax authorities were not entitled to take away an entire paper archive in order to go through all the material at the tax office . The same ought to apply in relation to electronically stored documents , the only difference being that they had to be printed out rather than being photocopied . In this manner the intents and purposes of the LAW would be fully taken into account . The copying of the server in order to subsequently review the entire archives constituted an interference that could not be justified as proportionate and necessary for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In additional written pleadings to ORG dated DATE , the applicant companies stated , inter alia :", "\u201c In this context , it is noted that the references to LAW in the notice of appeal do not constitute a new submission . As the Attorney General also indicates , reference to the LAW was made during the oral proceedings in the lower courts . In ORG the respondent made reference to a decision of ORG which considered the relationship between LAW and the country \u2019s competition law . The decision is enclosed in the joint case documents before ORG , on page CARDINAL et seq . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON DATE p. DATE ) ORG upheld the High Court \u2019s judgment by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL and held that no award should be made for costs .", "CARDINAL . Mrs Justice Stabel , whose opinion was endorsed in the main by the other members of the majority , observed that the case raised CARDINAL questions , all related to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW concerning the inspection of records located on a computer server : First , whether the tax authorities could demand access to all the records , regardless of content ; secondly , whether this also applied in cases where the records included material belonging to other taxpayers ; and , thirdly , whether the tax authorities could demand access in order to copy material for subsequent inspection at the tax office .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW empowered the tax authorities to order a tax subject to hand over specific documents of significance for a tax assessment . ORG - paragraph ( b ) provided , in addition to the on - site visit and review of the taxpayer \u2019s assets , a legal basis for the imposition of a review of the company \u2019s archives . With the exception of the rule on review of archives ( \u201c arkivgjennomsyn \u201d ) in sub - paragraph ( b ) , those provisions were essentially a continuation of the earlier ones of LAW on the duty to provide information and allow special inspections . Since the rule on review of archives had been added during the consideration of the LAW by ORG , the preparatory work had been rather sparse . On the other hand , ORG had pointed out that an order to produce a document pursuant to subparagraph ( a ) presupposed knowledge about the existence of the document , and that the refusal to allow access to review archives constituted a hindrance to effective inspection .", "CARDINAL . From the context , it transpired that the purpose of the provision in CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) was to provide a basis for the tax authorities to assess whether a tax subject possessed documents which he or she could be ordered to produce under sub - paragraph ( a ) . The duty to produce documents was not limited to accountancy documents . What was decisive was whether the documents were significant for the taxpayer \u2019s tax assessment and the authorities\u2019 review of the latter . It was clear that also electronic documents were covered by sub - paragraph ( a ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG - paragraph ( b ) should naturally be interpreted in the light of its purpose . The aim of an inspection was to find out whether an archive contained documents that could be significant for tax assessment purposes . Access should therefore comprise all archives which the tax authorities had reason to assume contained information of significance for the tax assessment , not just those archives or parts of archives that included accountancy material . In the interests of efficiency of the tax audit , access at that stage should be relatively wide . Therefore , the ORG argument that it should be up to each tax subject to give binding indications as to which parts of the archive contained documents of significance for the tax assessment or the audit had to be rejected .", "CARDINAL . Access to archives could not be compared to search and seizure , as argued by the applicant companies . Measures taken under LAW formed part of ordinary administrative procedures with a view to ensuring that a correct tax assessment was made . An accountancy audit could be initiated independently of any suspicion of the commission of a criminal offence . An order imposed pursuant to section CARDINAL also involved compulsion of a different character than enforcement measures ( \u201c tvangsmidler \u201d ) in the context of criminal proceedings , where the prosecution executed the measure by way of enforcement ( \u201c tvangsgjennomf\u00f8ring \u201d ) . The principle of the duty to submit tax returns , supplemented by the tax subject \u2019s duty to provide information under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL , presupposed that it should be possible to verify and depart from the information provided by the tax subject . The consequences of a tax subject \u2019s refusal to cooperate were exclusively administrative ( discretionary tax assessment ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicants\u2019 argument that the server contained archives belonging to several companies , PERSON observed that where several companies shared an archive and the areas belonging to the different users were clearly separated , the authorisation to access the archives was limited to the tax subject concerned . The problem arose where it was not possible , at least in advance , to ascertain whether the respective parts were clearly separated , typically where the data were stored electronically on a common server . On this point she agreed with and cited ORG distinction between separate and common ( mixed ) archives in its decision of DATE :", "\" When several tax subjects share an archive , one must , in the opinion of the ORG , distinguish between cases in which the archives are clearly physically separated and cases in which there is a common ( mixed ) archive . Whether or not an area will be considered as clearly separate must be assessed in the specific case . The ORG emphasises that , at present , there is insufficient information in this case to make that assessment . \"", "CARDINAL . Mrs Justice Stabel further agreed with ORG that , as a starting point , where full access was not given to the tax authorities , it should be possible to impose full access if the archive was organised in a manner making the tax authorities dependent on indications by the tax subject in order to identify relevant information . It would be up to the companies whether they wished to organise clearly separate archives or to maintain mixed archives which , in practice , would lead to an extension of the tax authorities\u2019 powers .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the companies had disputed that there had been a mixed archive of the type described . They had argued that ORG \u2019s representative should be able to identify which users had been working on matters pertaining to them and which files had been relevant to their activities . However , it followed from the facts established by ORG that B.L.H. did not have its own administration but was serviced by a small number of persons in ORG AS located at the same address , as was the situation of the other companies using the server in question which was owned and run by GPE . B.L.H. did not have its own user area , but the persons who provided services to the company stored the company \u2019s documents under their own user names and passwords .", "CARDINAL . It would have been impossible for the tax authorities to identify immediately the areas of the server where the relevant information was stored . The archive was not organised with clear separations between the different companies , and the distinction between each service person \u2019s user area was not such as to enable the tax authorities to identify information of significance for the tax assessment . In this situation , ORG had correctly considered that the tax authorities could not depend on B.L.H. indicating the files that might be relevant for the tax assessment of the company . Therefore , the authorities ought to be vested with powers to review all the data on the server . Like ORG , she also attached some weight to the fact that it had been fully possible to organise the cooperation regarding the use of the server differently , for example by applying consistently own user names .", "CARDINAL . As to the third question , the manner in which the review of the relevant data should take place , PERSON took note of the fact that the backup tape containing all the information on the server had been prepared , sealed and taken to the tax office , pending a final judgment in the case . A backup tape contained all the files stored in the archive but , unlike a mirror copy , not the computer programmes and deleted material , as the tax authorities had initially wanted .", "CARDINAL . The question was whether the imposition of a duty to allow access with a view to take copies for subsequent inspection at the tax office could be deduced from the right to demand access to the company \u2019s archives . The answer did not follow directly from section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW . Unlike sub - paragraph ( a ) , which expressly stated different alternatives for access to documents , sub - paragraph ( b ) made no mention of how the review should take place . That provision was supplemented by section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , which authorised the tax authorities to demand the presence of a representative of the tax subject in order to provide the necessary guidance , assistance and access to the company \u2019s LOC .", "CARDINAL . The question of copying was twofold : did the tax authorities have a right to require a copy and , if so , could the tape then be inspected at the tax office ?", "CARDINAL . Very little preparatory work had been carried out on that provision and that particular point had not been dealt with . Since archives had been almost exclusively paper based at the time when the provision had been enacted , the question of copying a whole archive had been unlikely to arise . In view of its purpose , there was no reason to interpret the provision to the effect that it hindered the imposition of a requirement to take a copy where the review of a copy was desirable . The central question was whether the measure imposed by the tax authorities could also include the taking of material to the tax office .", "CARDINAL . The rationale behind sub - paragraph ( b ) DATE namely to remove obstacles to an effective audit occasioned by the requirement on the tax authorities to show that the archives contained documents that were significant for tax assessment purposes \u2013 militated strongly in favour of an interpretation adapted to the current situation . According to ORG , an on - site inspection would be particularly time - consuming , and if the authorities were unable to take copies for inspection at the tax office , they would face difficulties in implementing the audit .", "CARDINAL . It could be questioned whether access would entail such an additional burden for the tax subject that the above interpretation would be incompatible with the principle of legality ( legalitetsprinsippet ) . In the view of PERSON , it was difficult to see that this could be the case . Indeed , the inspection as such would be less burdensome in that the tax subject would at no time be deprived of access to the archive . The requisite safeguards were preserved as the tax subject had a right , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , to be notified about and to be present during the authorities\u2019 review of the tape . If the measure was the subject of a complaint , the material had to be sealed pending examination of the complaint ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . In most instances , there was reason to believe that it would also be in the tax subject \u2019s interest that the review took place at the tax office . In any event , there was little reason to oppose that .", "CARDINAL . Mrs ORG Stabel agreed , however , that the protection of privacy ( \u201c personvernhensyn \u201d ) had to be taken into consideration , because the review of the archive was not limited to accountancy documents but included other documents in the archives which the tax authorities had reason to believe might be of relevance for the tax assessment . However , the tax authorities could also access such sensitive information even if the review were carried out on the tax subject \u2019s premises . Even though , theoretically , there would always be a danger of abuse , which might be somewhat greater if the copied material were taken to the tax office , that risk was hardly so great as to be decisive .", "CARDINAL . It had not been alleged that the backup copy contained more data than what would have been accessible had the review been carried out on - site . The legal safeguards described above would be observed during the review . It was further understood that once the review had been completed , the copy would be destroyed and all traces of the contents would be deleted from the tax authorities\u2019 computers and storage devices . In addition , the review was to provide a basis for orders pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) . The tax authorities would not be authorised to withhold documents from among the material that had been taken away unless the tax subject accepted the measure .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting member of ORG , Mr Justice PERSON , agreed with the view held by the majority that the tax authorities could require B.L.H. to give access in order to enable them to carry out an inspection of the server used jointly by the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . As to the further issue of whether the tax authorities could demand a copy of the server on which the archive was stored with a view to subsequent review at the tax office , Mr Justice PERSON observed as follows . In his view , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) could not reasonably be understood to mean that it authorised the tax authorities to demand a copy of the archive . The provision was limited to \u201c review \u201d . To demand a copy was something else and much more far - reaching .", "CARDINAL . The reason why the majority in ORG in DATE had been in favour of conferring on the tax authorities a power to search and seize material was that they had believed that the authorities should be able to ensure that important documents had not been \u201c hidden or destroyed ( notably burned ) \u201d . If the tax authorities were allowed to demand a copy of the archive , they would in reality be empowered to seize , a power which the majority in ORG in DATE had not wished to give them when removing a provision to that effect before the entry into force of the relevant part of LAW .", "CARDINAL . He agreed with the majority that the right to review archives under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) comprised not only archives containing accountancy material but all archives that potentially contained documents of significance for the tax assessment . This meant that the archived material which the tax authorities could demand to review included a great quantity of sensitive personal data . If the tax authorities were to be empowered to demand the copying of archives , the risk of dissemination and abuse of sensitive personal data would increase considerably beyond what followed from a review on the taxpayer \u2019s LOC . This applied especially to the copying of electronic archives . The search facilities for an electronic archive were different from those used for a traditional paper - based archive . Even if electronically stored data were deleted , they could be reconstructed . Also , electronically stored data might be disseminated far more easily and effectively than information on paper . The right of the tax subject to be present when the tax authorities opened and reviewed the archive did not constitute a guarantee against abuse . There was no way of ensuring that that right had been respected . Therefore , weighty considerations of legal security and protection of privacy militated against conferring on the tax authorities a right to demand a copy of the archive . As the majority in ORG had pointed out in the context of the legislative amendment in DATE , the requirements of legal security and protection of privacy were an overriding political aim in a democratic society . In particular , since the parliamentary majority had voted strongly against search and seizure , and since copying for subsequent review at the tax office was in reality a form of seizure , Mr Justice PERSON found that the tax authorities clearly should not be empowered to require a copy without the question being first considered by the legislator and a clear statutory power given for copying .", "CARDINAL . On that ground , Mr Justice PERSON voted for quashing ORG decision of DATE in respect of B.L.H. authorising the copying of the server .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( skatteetaten , PERSON ) notified the applicant companies of their intention to open the tape with a view to ordering the production of documents . It notified them of the dates , time and place of the review , its object , certain preparatory processing not involving searching or opening of documents , and the identity of the companies concerned . It also invited them to appoint a common representative to attend the said preparations , and the opening and review of the tape .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the applicant companies dated DATE , ORG responded , inter alia , to certain complaints made by the applicant companies in their letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In response to the applicant ORG complaint that the backup tape had been secretly copied , ORG reiterated that they had already informed the applicant companies in a letter of DATE that after their meeting on DATE , the contents of the tape had been copied to hard disk . This had been necessary in order to be able to open and read the files , and the data would be carefully secured pending further proceedings . Except for in the limited context of the criminal investigation described in paragraph CARDINAL below , the files had not been opened and read .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant companies\u2019 demand that either the CARDINAL hard disks in question be handed over to B.L.H. , or the copied material be deleted , ORG replied that they could not see that ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE would prevent them from copying the contents of the backup tape to hard disk , or that the actual review could be carried out on this instead of the backup tape . They referred to ORG reasoning summarised in paragraph CARDINAL above . The copying of the data onto an independent , free and unused hard disk was necessary in order to be able to carry out an appropriate review of the contents of the backup tape . In that connection , the tax office took note of ORG understanding that , once it had been reviewed , the copy would either be returned or destroyed , and all traces of the contents would be deleted from the tax authorities\u2019 computers and storage devices . ORG reasoning thus appeared to be based on the presumption that the contents of the server could be copied temporarily as described . The tax office would not hand over the hard disks or delete information from the backup tape stored on them until completion of the review .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a request by the applicant companies for the names of personnel who had dealt with the case , including those who had viewed documents on the backup tape , the tax office stated that the correspondence , faxes and e - mails that the tax authorities had produced in connection with the case indicated sender \u2019s identity . Moreover , representatives of the tax office had presented themselves by name during meetings and telephone conversations that had taken place . Furthermore , in the context of a separate tax investigation of the applicant companies and other companies within the same ownership sphere that were linked to a certain PERSON and criminal proceedings against the latter , the regional tax office had filed a complaint against him to the police alleging that he had committed aggravated tax fraud . During the criminal investigations the police had obtained a judicial order authorising the seizure of the backup tape . The tax office accepted to assist the police , in accordance with relevant agreements and instructions . The assistance had consisted of the reviewing of the backup tape , during the period DATE , by certain named expert accountants and a tax lawyer . After completion of the work , the police had demanded that the ORG delete all documents stored electronically and shred all paper copies taken . That had been done immediately . In the proceedings before ORG in the present case , the parties agreed to distinguish these from the afore - mentioned criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed with the applicant companies that it would be problematic with respect to the duty of confidentiality if the representative(s ) of all taxpayers present were to be given the opportunity to view the computer screen during the review of documents . For that reason DATE and because it would have made working conditions difficult if the officer had the said representative(s ) just behind his back while working on the backup tape DATE it had been decided that the representative(s ) would not have access to the screen or to read printed documents continuously during the inspection ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , first sentence , and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW ) . The representative(s ) would therefore be directed to another part of the LOC where they could observe the processing but not the documents being reviewed .", "As the officers identified documents that the taxpayer would be ordered to produce , the documents would be printed out and listed .
