In the course of their exchanges , the applicant had demanded a bribe of MONEY ( \u201c USD \u201d ) in return for a favourable resolution of GPE \u2019s civil dispute . Following the authorisation of the model on DATE , GPE had been given money by the anti - corruption police . In TIME that day he had handed over USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant and , in the afternoon , he had given her a further USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL , to be used by the applicant for a new car . At a meeting in TIME of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant had drafted GPE \u2019s civil claim and had instructed him on the future course of the proceedings . On DATE the applicant had further instructed GPE on his case , whilst assuring him of its favourable outcome .", "b ) On DATE the applicant had asked GPE to obtain new DATE tyres for her car . On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant had informed GPE that further payments might be required to buy off certain judges of the higher court . On DATE the applicant had taken from GPE a further bribe of USD CARDINAL for the DATE tyres . On DATE she had obtained from him CARDINAL for bribing higher judges . The applicant had thus taken a total of CARDINAL in personal bribes , as well as USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL to buy - off certain higher court judges .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also submitted that the case materials disproved any element of undue instigation as the applicant had :", "- recommended a particular lawyer to GPE for his civil case ;", "- drafted his claim , assuring him of its favourable outcome ;", "- registered PERSON \u2019s case in court and had personally undertaken to examine it ;", "- bought a new car after having received the bribe ; and", "- met GPE on a number of occasions on her own initiative , whilst assuring him of the favourable outcome of his claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was apprehended in her office whilst receiving a further CARDINAL from GPE .

On DATE the Prosecutor General applied to the Seimas ( ORG ) , requesting that the applicant \u2019s judicial immunity be lifted and that she be suspended from her functions pending the outcome of the criminal case .

On CARDINAL DATE the case was transmitted to ORG , a judge of which , on DATE , committed the applicant for trial on the above counts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to apply to ORG to examine the compatibility of LAW with LAW . In particular , she claimed that the LAW had not duly protected persons from possible incitement by the investigating authorities to commit offences . In addition , it was alleged that the power conferred upon the prosecution under LAW to authorise the model - which effectively allowed private persons like GPE to imitate criminal acts but avoid criminal liability - had gone beyond the constitutional competence of the prosecutors . Consequently , the authorisation of such models should only have been issued by courts . She further claimed that a judicial authorisation should have been required for certain intrusive measures under LAW such as the secret recording of conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request and applied to ORG with a view to establishing the compatibility of LAW with LAW . On DATE ORG found this legislation to be generally compatible with LAW ( see PERSON , [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial , ORG reclassified the charge of cheating as an attempt to buy off ORG officials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of accepting a bribe in large amounts ( Articles CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW as then in force ) , attempting to buy off ORG officials ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and official malpractice ( LAW . She was acquitted of cheating ( LAW ) . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , banned from ORG service for DATE , and had her property confiscated . The court based the conviction mostly on the recordings made by GPE when implementing the model , finding that she had promptly accepted a bribe from him of USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL on DATE and then a further ORG CARDINAL on DATE . On DATE she had obtained from GPE another USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL with which to bribe certain higher court judges in order to ensure the favourable outcome of his case on appeal . It was established that , in return for the bribe , the applicant had drafted ORG civil claim ( as of TIME of CARDINAL DATE ) , had made the necessary arrangements to be appointed as the judge in his case , and had started examining it . The court did not find that the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL obtained by the applicant from GPE on DATE had been used for any criminal purpose . She was therefore acquitted of any offence in respect of this money .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations of incitement , the court held as follows :", "\u201c The acts of [ S\u0160 ] as a whole are not considered to be a provocation because he acted under [ the model ] authorised in accordance with the law[. ] From his application [ of DATE ] it appears that he applied to the law enforcement authorities alleging , in his opinion , unlawful actions on the part of [ the applicant ] . ... The case contains no objective evidence of close or intimate relations between [ GPE and the applicant ] , or that she had been intimidated [ by GPE ] ...", "[ T]he model was authorised on DATE , while [ S\u0160 ] applied to the officers on DATE [ ; ] and on DATE he taped his meeting with [ the applicant ] by a voice recorder given by the officers ... This recording constitutes proper evidence , in that it was made in order to collect and verify the preliminary information about the crime ... On DATE , [ only after ] the ORG officers had properly verified the preliminary information about [ the applicant \u2019s ] criminal intentions and [ following ] the authorisation of the model in accordance with the law , [ S\u0160 ] \u201c joined \u201d the continuing , but not completed , offences of the applicant ... . The chamber considers that [ S\u0160 ] did not overstep the limits established by [ the ] model . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court excluded from the incriminating evidence against the applicant the transcript of a secretly taped telephone conversation between her and S\u0160 at TIME on DATE , as it had been obtained without the appropriate judicial authorisation . However , the court found no domestic unlawfulness in the admission as evidence of the remainder of GPE \u2019s recorded conversations with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , on DATE ORG amended the lower judgment , quashing the applicant \u2019s conviction for official malpractice , but upholding her conviction for accepting a bribe and the attempted buy - off . The sentence of imprisonment remained unchanged . ORG confirmed the exclusion from the evidence of the recording of the early morning telephone conversation of DATE . However , the court ruled that the secret recording by S\u0160 of his other conversations with the applicant , and the rest of the evidence subsequently collected in implementing the model , had been lawful , there being no signs of incitement to commit the offences .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a cassation appeal in which she alleged the unlawfulness of the recordings of her conversations with S\u0160 obtained DATE and DATE , and the improper use of those recordings as evidence to support her conviction . The applicant also complained that GPE and the authorities had entrapped her into committing offences upon which she had not been ready to embark . In this respect , the applicant complained that the authorities had had no good reason to suspect her of contemplating taking a bribe , as her meeting with GPE on DATE had only attested to their discussion about her intention to sell her car . She stated that , in his application to the ORG of DATE , GPE had seriously distorted the facts . The applicant alleged that , in executing the model , the authorities had exceeded its scope by paying a much more significant amount of money than had been required to obtain her conviction for bribery . She claimed that all the investigative actions by GPE and the authorities should have been discontinued upon her receiving the first instalment of USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL in the morning of CARDINAL DATE . The subsequent payments had served only to inflate the impugned criminal act ( accepting a bribe ) out of all proportion , and to obtain the commission by her of a further crime ( the attempted buy - off of higher court judges ) which had not been foreseen when authorising the model .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the appeal judgment , but upheld the conviction for accepting a bribe and the attempted buy - off of higher court judges . The applicant \u2019s sentence remained unchanged . In reply to the applicant \u2019s allegations of incitement , ORG stated inter alia :", "\u201c The recording of the conversation of DATE ... attests that [ S\u0160 ] asks [ the applicant ] to accept his suit and declare the auction null and void ... The applicant , albeit not eagerly , agrees to take the case , asking [ S\u0160 ] to sell her car . [ S\u0160 ] presented this recording to [ the ORG ] together with his application , stating that [ the applicant ] demands a bribe ... This was the initial information about the preparation of the offence ( LAW , hereinafter the ORG ) . Since that [ information ] was insufficient to undertake operational steps , the ORG officers decided to verify it ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) . For this purpose , on DATE [ S\u0160 ] was given a recorder to tape secretly his [ next ] conversation with [ the applicant ] . It was established during the verification that the applicant has for some time intended to get a newer car ... She ... asked [ S\u0160 ] to sell the car in her possession , and buy a newer car with the money received . [ S\u0160 ] explained to the applicant [ the ] difference between the value of her present car and the desired car ... [ whilst ] offering to cover the price difference with his own money , in return for [ the applicant ] admitting his civil action ... and deciding it in his favour ... The applicant agreed with this proposal , i.e. the preliminary information on [ the applicant \u2019s ] readiness to accept a bribe was confirmed . The cassation arguments that [ the applicant ] was provoked into commit the crime are unsubstantiated . The above circumstances confirm that [ the applicant ] had wanted to take a bribe , in that she immediately accepted the offer without any outside pressure . The recordings also confirm that on DATE [ GPE and the applicant ] agreed upon the specific object of the bribe , a car ... costing MONEY . The specific agreement about the bribe corresponds to the preparatory stage of a crime provided for in Article CARDINAL of LAW . The criminal conduct simulation model was only approved DATE , on DATE . Therefore [ the authorities ] \u201c joined \u201d the crime already being committed , in conformity with the decision of ORG DATE . ... [ While the interests of GPE ] in applying to file the action ... to a familiar judge was unlawful , ... this fact does not invalidate the criminal conduct simulation model , which served to protect the more important general interest of preventing someone who has accepted a bribe to work as a judge ... . An offer to accept a bribe can not be considered to be active pressure to commit an offence , which is not allowed by LAW ) of the ORG , and which would contradict ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ... The criminal conduct simulation model [ as authorised in this case ] confirms that its limits were defined not by a number of actions , but by specifying the Articles of the Criminal Code establishing criminal responsibility for the simulated offences ... On DATE the ORG officers could not discontinue the execution of the model because it was necessary to establish if the applicant would keep her word - if she were to admit [ ORG ] action [ on her case docket ] and decide it in favour of the plaintiff . The qualification of [ the applicant \u2019s ] actions depended on her future conduct : had [ she ] refused to examine the case , her act would have been classified not under LAW , but under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( obtaining property in large amounts by deception ) . Nor were the confines of the model exceeded in terms of time , in that [ it ] had been authorised for DATE ... The evidence collected in the course of executing the model ... confirm that [ the applicant ] was indeed trying to keep the promise given to [ S\u0160 ] : she accepted ( without the knowledge of the court president ) and rectified [ his ] draft civil claim , gathered favourable evidence , consulted her mother [ a lawyer ] on this question , and discussed the questions raised by [ GPE \u2019s ] civil case even during DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the recordings made by S\u0160 had been properly admitted as evidence , and that the unlawfully - obtained evidence ( the secretly taped telephone conversation of DATE ; paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been rightly excluded from the case . That decision was final .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was released from prison after having completed her sentence .", "CARDINAL .
