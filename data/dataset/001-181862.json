Prior to the attempted military coup of DATE , he presented a political discussion programme on Can Erzincan TV , a television channel that was closed down following the adoption of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL , issued on DATE in connection with the state of emergency ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE leading up to the attempted coup , the applicant had been known for his critical views on the serving government \u2019s policies .", "CARDINAL . During TIME a group of members of the NORP armed forces calling themselves the \u201c Peace at ORG \u201d attempted to carry out a military coup aimed at overthrowing the democratically elected parliament , government and President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the attempted coup , soldiers under the GPE control bombarded several strategic State buildings , including the parliament building and the presidential compound , attacked the hotel where the President was staying , held the Chief of ORG hostage , attacked television channels and fired shots at demonstrators . During TIME of violence , CARDINAL people were killed and CARDINAL were injured .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the attempted military coup , the national authorities blamed the network linked to PERSON , a NORP citizen living in GPE ) and considered to be the leader of a terrorist organisation known as GPE / PDY ( \u201c ORG / Parallel State Structure \u201d ) . Several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government declared a state of emergency for a period of DATE as from DATE ; the state of emergency was subsequently extended for further periods of DATE by ORG , chaired by the President , most recently with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities gave notice to the Secretary General of ORG of a derogation from LAW CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the GPE public prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation in respect of suspected members of GPE / PDY . In addition , on the basis of LAW no . CARDINAL , he ordered restrictions on the right of the PERSON lawyers to inspect the contents of the investigation file or to obtain copies of documents in the file . In the course of the criminal investigation , the applicant was arrested at his home on DATE and taken into police custody on suspicion of having links to the media wing of the organisation in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s home was searched by police officers without his lawyers being present , as they had been prevented from attending the search on account of the state of emergency .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant lodged an objection challenging his detention in police custody and seeking his release . On DATE the GPE magistrate \u2019s court dismissed the objection .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in police custody for DATE at the GPE police anti - terrorist branch . During DATE in custody , he was not permitted to speak to his lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while at the police station , the applicant stated that he was asserting his right to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was questioned by the GPE public prosecutor on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the government or to prevent it from discharging its duties ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and of being a member of the FET\u00d6 / PDY terrorist organisation ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The records of the questioning indicate that the applicant was accused of : ( i ) attempting to discredit an investigation into an alleged coup ( the \u201c PERSON \u201d case ) ; ( ii ) making certain statements serving the interests of GPE / ORG , in particular during a television programme broadcast on Can Erzincan TV on DATE , in the course of which , according to the public prosecutor , the terrorist organisation had sought to prepare the public for a military coup ; ( iii ) holding an account with ORG , a bank with alleged links to ORG / PDY ; ( iv ) avoiding a criminal investigation through the assistance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to ORG / PDY ; ( v ) visiting PERSON at his home in GPE and kissing his hand ; and ( vi ) having in his possession a GPE MONEY bill with an \u201c F \u201d serial number ( denoting the initial of the forename ORG ) . In reply , the applicant stated that he did not know any NORP army officers and had no links to the attempted coup . The comments he had made during the television programme in question had been intended as warnings to prevent future military coups . Regarding the bank account , DATE previously he had taught for DATE at a private university , which had asked him to open an account at the bank in question for payment of his wages . He added that he had not been aware of having avoided a criminal investigation through the assistance of certain suspected members of an illegal organisation , and that this was a matter to be taken up with the police officers allegedly responsible . Furthermore , he had visited PERSON as a member of a group of journalists , for purely professional reasons linked to his role as a journalist , and had never kissed anyone \u2019s hand . Lastly , the MONEY bill was of no special significance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before the GPE CARDINALth ORG and was questioned about his alleged acts and the accusations against him . At DATE the hearing , the magistrate ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , having taken the following factors into consideration : the strong suspicions against him ; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among the offences listed in LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) \u2013 the so - called \u201c catalogue offences \u201d , for which a suspect \u2019s pre - trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion ; the risk of absconding ; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant \u2019s participation in the criminal proceedings . In the reasons for his decision , the magistrate noted the following : during the attempted military coup , members of GPE / ORG had used heavy weapons ; since DATE the organisation in question had been explicitly waging a campaign against the political authorities ; the members of GPE / ORG had attempted to force the government \u2019s resignation by discrediting it in public opinion , especially through judicial operations carried out DATE ; and the organisation had taken control of several media outlets with a view to achieving its aim . The magistrate further noted that during the television broadcast on DATE , the applicant had said : \u201c Within ORG , there is probably another structure , whose components outside GPE are closely observing and documenting all these events . It is not clear exactly when [ it ] will pull its hand out of the bag or how [ it ] will do so \u201d ( \u201c PERSON i\u00e7inde de muhtemelen QUANTITY bu geli\u015fmeleri d\u0131\u015f d\u00fcnyada daha fazla belgeleyen , izleyen bir ba\u015fka da yap\u0131 var .

The magistrate concluded that there were suspicions that the contents of the applicant \u2019s statements about the political authorities had been intended to prepare the ground for a military coup and were not covered by freedom of the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against the order for his pre - trial detention . In a decision of DATE the GPE CARDINALnd ORG dismissed the objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a fresh application for his release . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE CARDINALrd ORG rejected the application .", "CARDINAL . On various dates the applicant lodged further applications seeking his release pending trial . According to the documents produced by the parties , the applications were all rejected by the competent GPE courts , for example on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with ORG in respect of several individuals , including the applicant , in particular accusing them , under LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW of the CC , of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order , ORG and the government by force and violence , and of committing offences on behalf of a terrorist organisation without being members of it . The public prosecutor presented the following items of evidence against the applicant : CARDINAL articles written by him ; his comments during the television broadcast on DATE ; the fact that he had an account with ORG ; and the seizure at his home of GPE MONEY bill with an \u201c F \u201d serial number . He sought the imposition of CARDINAL aggravated life sentences and a sentence of up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the public prosecutor filed his submissions on the merits ( esas hakk\u0131nda m\u00fctalaa ) . He sought the applicant \u2019s conviction for the offences with which he was charged . Besides the evidence he had already submitted when the bill of indictment had been filed , the public prosecutor also produced messages sent by other suspected members of ORG / ORG via ORG , an encrypted messaging service allegedly used by members of that organisation .", "CARDINAL . During the criminal proceedings , the applicant denied having committed any criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . In a summary judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to aggravated life imprisonment , in accordance with LAW , for attempting to overthrow the constitutional order . The criminal proceedings are still ongoing in the national courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an individual application with ORG . He complained that he had been placed in pre - trial detention on account of his articles and statements and alleged that this infringed his right to liberty and security and his right to freedom of expression and of the press . He also submitted that he had been arrested and detained for reasons other than those provided for by LAW . In addition , he complained that his detention in police custody had been unlawful and excessively lengthy , that he had had no access to the investigation file in order to challenge his pre - trial detention , that the magistrates ordering his detention had not been independent or impartial , that no hearings had been held following his applications challenging his continued pre - trial detention , and that the conditions of his detention were incompatible with the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court gave a judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which it held , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security and the right to freedom of expression and of the press .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that his pre - trial detention was unlawful , ORG noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included : ( i ) an article entitled \u201c The meaning of ORG ( \u201c Balyoz\u2019un FAC ) , published in the ORG newspaper in DATE ; ( ii ) his statements during the television programme broadcast on Can Erzincan TV on DATE ; and ( iii ) an article entitled \u201c Turbulence \u201d ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) , published on his own website on DATE . After examining the substance of these items of evidence , ORG held that the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of GPE / ORG or with the purpose of preparing the ground for a possible military coup . ORG observed that , as well as having published the above - mentioned articles and made the statements in question , the applicant was accused of holding an account with ORG , having avoided a criminal investigation through the connivance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to ORG / ORG , and having in his possession a GPE MONEY bill with an \u201c F \u201d serial number . Addressing those allegations , ORG held , having regard to the applicant \u2019s testimony and line of defence , that no specific facts had been established that could refute his explanations , which were \u201c consistent with the normal course of life \u201d . Similarly , regarding the contents of the messages exchanged by other individuals via ORG , ORG held that the messages could not in themselves be regarded as significant indications that the applicant had committed an offence . Accordingly , it concluded that \u201c strong evidence that an offence had been committed \u201d had not been sufficiently established in the applicant \u2019s case . Next , ORG examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of LAW ( providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war , general mobilisation , a state of siege or a state of emergency ) . On this point , it noted firstly that in a state of emergency , LAW provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in LAW , to the extent required by the situation . It observed , however , that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre - trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence , the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless . Accordingly , it held that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security , as safeguarded by LAW , had been breached .", "CARDINAL . However , having regard to the length of the applicant \u2019s detention and the documents available to it , ORG held that his complaint that he had been detained for political purposes , on grounds other than those provided for by LAW , lacked a sufficient basis .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaint concerning freedom of expression and of the press , ORG observed that the applicant \u2019s initial and continued pre - trial detention on account of his articles and statements amounted to interference with the exercise of that right . Taking into account his arguments regarding the lawfulness of his pre - trial detention , ORG held that such a measure , which had serious consequences since it resulted in deprivation of liberty , could not be regarded as a necessary and proportionate interference in a democratic society . It further noted that it could not be clearly established from the reasons given for ordering and extending the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention whether the measure met a pressing social need or why it was necessary . Lastly , it found that it was clear that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press , in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles and statements ( see paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . Regarding the application of LAW , it referred to its findings concerning the lawfulness of his pre - trial detention ( as set out in paragraphs CARDINAL of its judgment \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and held that there had also been a violation of freedom of expression and freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaints concerning the lawfulness and duration of the applicant \u2019s detention in police custody , ORG held that he should have brought an action under LAW ( a ) of the ORG but had refrained from doing so . Furthermore , it noted that there was no information in the application or the appended material as to whether the applicant had lodged an objection under LAW of the ORG against his detention in police custody . Accordingly , it declared these complaints inadmissible for failure to exhaust the appropriate remedies .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint of a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the magistrates who had ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , ORG dismissed it as being manifestly ill - founded , on the grounds that the magistrates were appointed by ORG and Prosecutors and were entitled to the same constitutional safeguards as other judges .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had had no access to the investigation file , ORG held that he had had sufficient means available to prepare his defence to the charges against him and challenge his pre - trial detention , in view of the contents of the detailed questions put to him during questioning by the public prosecutor and the magistrate , and the overall duration of the restriction on access to the case file . Accordingly , it declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the complaint that no hearing had been held during the examination of the applicant \u2019s applications challenging his pre - trial detention , ORG found that there was no obligation to hold a hearing on each and every objection to pre - trial detention orders and their extension , and that where a person had been able to appear before the first - instance court considering the issue of detention , the fact that there was no hearing on a subsequent appeal did not in itself contravene the LAW since it did not breach the principle of equality of arms . ORG noted that the applicant and his lawyer had been present at the hearing on DATE , following which the applicant had been placed in pre - trial detention . It observed that he had lodged an objection against his detention on CARDINAL DATE , that the objection had been dismissed on DATE and that DATE had thus elapsed between his previous appearance in court and the dismissal of his objection . Taking this period into account , ORG considered that there had been no obligation to hold a hearing during the examination of his objection , and accordingly declared this complaint likewise inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , with regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the conditions of his detention were incompatible with the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment , ORG observed that he had not raised this issue with the enforcement judge . Accordingly , it declared the complaint inadmissible for failure to exhaust the appropriate remedies .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to its findings of violations , ORG held that the applicant was to be awarded CARDINAL NORP liras ( TRY \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage and TRY MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was still in pre - trial detention on the date of delivery of its judgment , ORG decided to transmit the judgment to ORG so that it could take \u201c the necessary action \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied to ORG for his client \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the application by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , on the grounds that it had not yet received official notification of ORG judgment . It held in addition that the summary judgment submitted by the applicant \u2019s lawyer did not contain any indication by ORG of a measure relating to the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion the dissenting judge stated that , in accordance with LAW CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG judgments were binding on the legislative , executive and judicial organs , the administrative authorities and natural and legal persons . Accordingly , where a violation had been found on account of a judicial decision , the relevant court was required to take the necessary action to redress the effects of the violation , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . DATE on the establishment and rules of procedure of ORG ( \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ) . In his view , the only way of satisfying this requirement in the applicant \u2019s case was to order his release .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection with a view to securing his release , submitting a copy of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE as published on the court \u2019s website .", "CARDINAL . In a decision delivered on DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection and ordered the continuation of his pre - trial detention . In reaching that finding , it observed that ORG judgment had not been published in ORG as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In his dissenting opinion , the judge in the minority expressed the view that , since ORG judgments were binding and not subject to appeal , the applicant should be released pending trial without waiting for the judgment in question to be published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judgment on the individual application lodged by the applicant was published in ORG no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE ORG examined of its own motion the question of the applicant \u2019s continued detention . Noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to ORG against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation , and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by ORG in the context of an individual application , it found that ORG did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file . On that account , ORG judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not in compliance with the law . ORG added that ordering the applicant \u2019s release as an automatic consequence of the judgment in question would run counter to the general principles of law , the independence of the courts , the principle that no authority could give orders or instructions to the courts , and the \u201c natural judge \u201d principle . Lastly , by CARDINAL votes to one , it ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . In so holding , it took the following into account : the evidence before it ; the large scale of the attempted military coup ; the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding ; the current state of the case file ; and the severity of the potential sentence in the event of a conviction .", "CARDINAL . The judge who had voted in favour of the applicant \u2019s release stated in a dissenting opinion that ORG judgments were binding and that ORG was thus required to comply with judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . He pointed out that the only possible way for it to do so was to order the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further individual application with ORG . Relying on DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention , he complained mainly that he had been kept in pre - trial detention despite ORG judgment of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
