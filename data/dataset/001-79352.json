The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested by the police on DATE . On DATE ORG charged him with CARDINAL offences ( mostly burglaries ) . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed a number of burglaries .

The detention order was subsequently extended by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with armed robbery , robbery and burglary ( CARDINAL counts ) . There were CARDINAL defendants in the case , including the applicant .

The prosecution obtained voluminous evidence , including various expert reports .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention until DATE .

ORG found that prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings for the time needed for the examination of the case . It held that no other measures could prevent the applicant from attempting to interfere with the proceedings or even from going into hiding .", "CARDINAL . ORG listed a hearing for DATE . However , it had to be cancelled since the applicant and CARDINAL of the co - defendants had been disorderly and were removed from the courtroom .

On DATE ORG made an application under LAW of LAW to ORG for prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , since the statutory DATE time - limit of detention pending trial was soon to be exceeded ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) .

In addition to the reasons specified in the decision of DATE , ORG also mentioned the illness of CARDINAL of the defence counsel and the police \u2019s failure to bring the detained co - defendants from prison ( on CARDINAL occasions ) .

On DATE ORG granted ORG application . In addition to the reasons previously given , it held that the case was particularly complex .

The applicant appealed against that decision , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the trial court to lift his detention on the ground that it entailed a difficult financial situation for his wife and child . On DATE ORG refused that request , having regard , inter alia , to the report prepared by a court officer . The applicant \u2019s repeated request to that effect was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
