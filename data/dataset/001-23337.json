After the Second World War , differing regulations had emerged in the occupation zones and subsequently in the L\u00e4nder . In a number of courts of appeal , by way of deviation from the principle of exclusive rights of audience , there had already been an optional combined right of audience in the regional court and the court of appeal , this being the case in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . This practice was later introduced in GPE , GPE and ORG . Subsequently , the question as to whether exclusive rights of audience should be preserved or give way entirely or at least in certain fields to combined rights of audience exercised the minds of the NORP GPE and its committees as well as those of ORG over CARDINAL legislatures ... Finally LAW , which entered into force on DATE , provided for an ongoing combined right of audience to the courts of appeal only for barristers admitted to the bars of the GPE , GPE and ORG , subject , however , in each case to a waiting period of DATE . Furthermore , this right was extended to barristers who already enjoyed combined rights of audience . In GPE consideration was given to a combined right of audience for a transitional period .", "DATE , GPE ( cf . LAW of the LAW and the Law on Patent Lawyers of DATE ... ) , followed a further DATE by PERSON and GPE ( cf . LAW on LAW and ORG and Fees for Barristers and other prescriptions of DATE ... ) , was included in the circle of ORG in which lawyers enjoyed combined rights of audience . In GPE no sufficiently strong body of barristers had managed to develop within ORG . When the occasion arose , barristers attached to the regional courts would have themselves sponsored by a colleague admitted to the local court of appeal bar in order to be able to appear before that court themselves ( cf . Record of the CARDINALth Session of ORG of ORG PERSON , p. CARDINAL with further reference ; cf . Summary Record of the CARDINALth Session of ORG of the CARDINALth NORP GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL and ORG of said ORG , ... ) . In GPE and GPE , the co - existence of exclusive and combined rights of audience had led to distortions in competition . The experience of barristers with combined rights of audience was considered positive ( ... cf .. also ORG of the CARDINALth GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "Barristers in the new ORG who were entitled to appear before the ORG courts continued to enjoy rights of audience in all courts , even after LAW of DATE ... ; LAW , PERSON , LAW , Subject Matter A , Paragraph III , No .

The Federal legislature had no wish to give pride of place to CARDINAL or the other ... ORG and GPE opted in favour of the system of unrestricted rights of audience , whereas GPE and GPE - West Pomerania preferred exclusive rights of audience . Before the relevant ORG law had taken effect in practice , the law of DATE on the reorganisation of the exercise of the profession of barrister and patent lawyer , contrary to a planned nation - wide freedom of choice for ORG to decide themselves as to the form of admission ... , left LAW of LAW untouched and only the new L\u00e4nder which had opted for unrestricted rights of audience were included under LAW , subset . CARDINAL of LAW .", "II .", "The applicant applied in DATE to the President of ORG for an unrestricted right of audience to that court after having practised as a barrister for DATE . His appeal to ORG against the decision to reject his application proved unsuccessful . Like ORG , ORG , in its decision of DATE upholding the latter \u2019s view , found that the legislature had not written into LAW of LAW impugned by the applicant any disproportionately restrictive interference in his freedom to exercise his profession . The LAW on the Exercise of the Profession ( GPE ) were in conformity with the LAW ... . The system of exclusive rights of audience served the common good in so far as , after the decision of first instance , the subject matter of the proceedings when laid before a fresh barrister should be examined and judged by him uninfluenced by what had gone on before ( principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes ) . Despite the exceptions in LAW subsection CARDINAL of LAW , the law did not breach LAW of LAW either . To the extent that exceptions apply also to a part of the new L\u00e4nder , this is constitutionally acceptable having regard to their weight as grounds conducive to the accession of the new L\u00e4nder .", "III .", "In his constitutional complaint the applicant contests the breach of LAW and LAW as a result of the adverse decisions of the President of ORG , ORG and ORG , together with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Hitherto deemed to be in conformity with the LAW , the rules , so it is argued , have been superseded by amendments to the law on the exercise of the profession of barrister and by the evolution that has taken place in the practical relations between practitioners . They are said to lead to distortions in competition that are not only a bar to equality but also incompatible with the freedom of choice and the freedom of exercise of the profession .", "It was claimed that there was a restriction on the freedom to exercise one \u2019s profession affecting the very choice of a profession . The applicant contended that he could be admitted to ORG by abandoning his solicitor \u2019s practice in GPE . The principle of the CARDINAL pairs of eyes was not so much in the general interest as to justify the interference . Its observance was exclusively a matter of the internal organisation of a law practice . Even in ORG with the system of exclusive rights of audience it has broadly lost its validity . This was said to be the consequence of the introduction authorised in the meantime of mixed practices encompassing CARDINAL or more localities in which barristers specialised and could also appear in respect of appeals before the courts of appeal . Given the great number of barristers admitted to the regional courts , those with exclusive rights of audience would always be able to find a partner . Should the legislature allow barristers with exclusive rights of audience to gain access to all the regional courts situated in the district of the court of appeal through partnerships with colleagues practising in cases of the first instance before the regional courts , it would then have to enable barristers admitted to the regional court bars to gain access to the courts of appeal . For the specialisation of barristers , what was decisive was the size of the practice and not whether they enjoyed exclusive rights of audience . Given the considerable disadvantages for barristers not admitted to the court of appeal bar , the interference was however disproportionate . A barrister not able to appear before the court of appeal seemed to be less qualified than his colleague ; this in itself was a competitive disadvantage . The effect of this was particularly felt along the frontiers between ORG with different systems . For example , barristers from GPE or GPE with unrestricted rights of audience were fully successful in the surrounding area where the system of exclusive rights of audience was in force .", "Unequal treatment within GPE was also said to run counter to LAW . To that extent a more stringent measure should be included in the law of the LAW , since the diversity of legal situations affected LAW . The legislature had no overriding reasons for this unequal treatment ; in DATE , he had rather merely accepted it because no majority had emerged in favour of any alternative rule . The legislature was unable to take purchase on the principle of CARDINAL - pairs - of - eyes because , had it carried weight , it could not have been confined to individual regions . Regional peculiarities could no longer be invoked as a justification . Such peculiarities might have existed in the historical development of ORG and the southern L\u00e4nder ; however , they were totally absent in the new L\u00e4nder . Moreover , DATE , when the unrestricted rights of audience in courts was reintroduced in the LOC and GPE , the legislature had considered the system of unrestricted rights of audience as objectively better attuned to legal policy and the requirements of competition .", "IV .", "ORG on behalf of ORG , ORG , the President of ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG with exclusive rights of audience in ORG took a stand on the matter and added further detailed comment at the hearing .", "They conclude and largely concur that the impugned decisions and the norm on which they are based are compatible with LAW .", "In a Land the legislature is entitled to take account of regional particularities resulting from the historical development of the LOC and from the special situation of rebuilding an effective legal system in the LOC .", "The principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes was necessary for the administration of justice , as could be confirmed by statistics . In civil actions , the principle of the production of evidence applied . A change of barrister protected parties against possible failure to discover opportunities for an effective defence . The compulsory change in barrister provided a possibility of a further examination of the case and an improvement in its factual basis . Not having been involved in the trial proceedings , the new barrister was not under pressure to win the case or to justify himself . The system of exclusive rights of audience , so it is argued , facilitates specialisation by barristers in procedural law and substantive law , thus being conducive to a more thorough examination of the case . This specialisation , it is claimed , matches that of ORG . Section CARDINALa of LAW can not be read as being in favour of abandoning the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes . Mixed practices of barristers with differing rights of audience had always been available . Despite the increase in the number of these so - called mixed practices , the principle of exclusive rights of audience had not been abandoned in practice . In court districts with the system of exclusive rights of audience , changeover of barristers handling cases continues to take place . Such a practice can not be achieved in areas with unrestricted rights of audience ; there is especially no way of ensuring that the appeal lawyer is equally familiar with the case - law of the appeal court . The bench also values the improved quality resulting from the \u2018 principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes\u2019 .", "Should the system of exclusive rights of audience be abandoned , constitutional reasons would require a transitional solution . Barristers , it is claimed , would have been encouraged by the decision of ORG DATE ... to expect the right to continue to remain valid . This discontinuation of the system of exclusive rights of audience would not allow the survival of the specialisations of barristers vested with such rights . This would have resulted in a devaluation of their legal practice , for the colleagues dealing with cases in the first instance would as a rule no longer pass on to them the representation of clients in proceedings before the court of appeal . A transitional solution would first and foremost have to take account of the fact that the great majority of barristers enjoying exclusive rights of audience did not possess a source of clients of their own among persons seeking justice . Their continued existence would depend on the development of a practice dealing with cases of first instance and general legal advice . Therefore , only a transitional arrangement laying down a deadline on the prohibition of exclusive unrestricted rights of audience", "ORG unilaterally in favour of barristers hitherto enjoying exclusive rights of audience in the court of appeal and allowing only them to appear before regional courts and courts of appeal would seem suitable . A CARDINAL-year period would be appropriate .", "B.", "The constitutional complaint is in essence well - founded .", "The system of exclusive rights of audience as laid down in LAW of LAW is not compatible with LAW . There is thus no need for an examination on the basis of LAW of LAW . The constitutional complaint is to be rejected , in so far as it is directed against the impugned decisions , as the hitherto applicable right continues to be available to the applicant .", "I.", "The impugned decisions and their underlying regulations limit the applicant \u2019s exercise of his profession . A sector of professional activity is closed to him , whereas it is generally open to barristers in other ORG , while in GPE , for example , it is reserved for barristers admitted to ORG . ... At the same time , other barristers who - like the applicant - are not admitted to ORG are excluded from forensic activity in ORG in proceedings where the presence of a barrister is mandatory .", "Such legislative regulations over the exercise of a profession have been held by ORG constant case - law to be admissible when they are justified on cogent grounds as being in the general interest , when the chosen means is in accord with the aim sought and when an overall weighing of the degree of the interference and the grounds serving to justify it do not exceed the limit of what is reasonable ... . The more the practitioner suffers hindrance in the exercise of a profession , all the greater has to be the weight of the general interest that the arrangement is designed to serve ... . The impugned decision does not suffice to meet these constitutional requirements .", "CARDINAL . The institution of exclusive rights of audience was originally based on a variety of concerns for the general interest . These included the legal tradition and the existence of a counterpart to the institution in civil - law procedures ... , and the advantages for the administration of justice resulting from an easier access to qualified barristers and from the furtherance of a climate of mutual trust between the ORG and the barristers established in its area of jurisdiction ... . The legislature also relied on the last of these grounds to justify LAW , previous version , during the period when it was in force . The right of practice restricted to cases of the first instance was designed to expedite proceedings before ORG , to further trust - based co - operation between GPE and Bar and to enhance the quality of advice given by barristers thanks to a knowledge of the local habits and traditions . However , in the process of reforming the regulation of the profession of barrister , the legislature itself did not hold this aim to be defensible as a justifiable means of imposing restrictions on the right of audience to the regional court bars ... .", "( a ) Technological progress has prompted the legislature to cease to attach great weight to the disadvantages that might arise for the ORG as a result of the acceptance by barristers of cases from outside areas . Increased mobility brought about by improved means of transport and the emergence of modern means of communication ( such as portable telephones , facsimile , laptops ) , together with the ability to transmit large quantities of documents to law practices and increasingly to the ORG , offers a reliable mode for contacting a barrister provided he continues to be required to have his practice in the district where he is registered . In all other jurisdictions , the fixing of dates of hearings has long been successfully achieved without recourse to locally based barristers and this is now also the case in civil matters with district and regional courts . The courts of appeal show no special features that could stand in the way of the general interest . The frequency of travel to outside hearings will depend on how much importance the client or the barrister attaches to attendance in person , the responsibility assumed by the barrister in the specific case and his ability to adjust various hearing dates to one another ... . Dates for hearings before the courts of appeal can also be fixed effectively and swiftly with barristers with unrestricted rights of audience .", "( b ) In civil matters before district and regional courts , the legislature has also abandoned the aim of a trust - based personal contact between barrister and judge as a requirement for the administration of justice ... . It is not clear that the viewpoint was a decisive reason in upholding exclusive rights of audience in the courts of appeal .", "( c ) Neither can the specialisation of barristers pleading before them be relied on to justify the system of exclusive rights of audience in the courts of appeal as being a matter of public interest . This applies to both specialisation in individual fields ( bb ) and a thorough acquaintance with the case - law of a particular court ( aa ) . The weight attaching to matters referred to as being in the general interest has diminished so much in this area that they can no longer serve to justify the exclusive rights of audience in the courts of appeal . These general - interest arguments were based on circumstances and conditions that no longer exist . Moreover , the legislature has made it clear through the revised rules of procedure and organisation of the profession of barrister that these approaches no longer carry any weight .", "( aa ) True , a knowledge of the case - law of a given court and features peculiar to a locality may be of advantage to the client . However , such knowledge does not come into play at the appeal stage first of all , but is made much use of at the court of first instance , since it may provide a means of avoiding recourse to appeal . In any case , such circumstances were more relevant in matters dealt with by the administrative courts of the second instance which would usually reach a final decision based on the law of the Land than they were in matters falling under the jurisdiction of the civil courts . However , rights of audience in administrative appeal procedures was never restricted to a small circle of barristers possessing such a right .", "( bb ) In the meantime , the specialisation of barristers outside the area where they enjoy exclusive unrestricted rights of audience has become much more widespread with the support of the legislature ( cf . Sets . CARDINAL a , CARDINAL b subset . CARDINAL Nr . CARDINAL and Section CARDINALc of LAW ) .", "In so far as a specialised corpus of barristers had already developed at an early stage , this was not the result of exclusive rights of audience . First of all , specialisation in matters dealt with by the courts of appeal requires a corresponding distribution of labour in the court of appeal concerned , which was only the case of the larger courts of appeal . The views uttered by the President of ORG do not apply uniformly to places such as GPE , GPE , GPE or GPE . Specialisation as a rule requires above all that barristers be able to work in large practices where the work is divided among them , thus enabling them to specialise . As a result of changes in the laws governing the ORG profession such large practices have grown up on a broad scale , as was to be foreseen when LAW came into force in DATE . Barristers joined forces in various structures and worked across the borders of the local area of jurisdiction and those between ORG in practices comprising barristers enjoying either of the CARDINAL types of rights of audience and members of other professional groups . This development clearly shows that the services of barristers specialised in various areas of the law were already in great demand at the stage of preliminary advice and first instance and not only as the result of their enjoying exclusive rights of audience in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The only common - interest arguments that the legislature continued to view as relevant were the improved quality of legal advice and the ability to reach an independent assessment of the prospects of the success of an appeal thanks to the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes . However , this principle and the expectations to which it gives rise do not suffice to justify the interference in barristers\u2019 professional freedom .", "( a ) It is already unclear whether the legislature continues to look upon the system of exclusive rights of audience as an appropriate and necessary means of improving the administration of justice .", "( aa ) Granted , there are many pointers to the effect that , against the background of the sources of information then available , the legislature of DATE saw in exclusive rights of audience a particularly suitable means of securing an administration of justice of high quality on the basis of the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes .", "The principle of exclusive rights of audience was the practice in the great majority of appeal - court districts and was such as to give the legislature the impression that , in conjunction with the strong local concentration of the capacity to conduct first - instance proceedings as per section CARDINAL of LAW , it represented a principle of proven practical value . Decisions of appeal courts were published less frequently , so that the case - law of these courts may have increasingly tended to develop in different directions . In addition , practices were small and were not allowed to operate in CARDINAL locality . Barristers were more dispersed and far less specialised . There were practically no specialist lawyers and no reported emergence of pools of special skills . Experience of Labour- , Financial - , ORG jurisdictions where restrictions on rights of audience had been waived from the outset was seldom to be found .", "( bb ) However , it is to be doubted whether the DATE legislature continued to abide by his assessment having regard to changes in real - life situations .", "Already in DATE the rapid and readily accepted spreading of the system of unrestricted rights of audience in GPE and GPE showed that the legislature did not consider that the experience so far acquired endangered the administration of justice if an amendment to the law offered a means of ending competitive pressures among barristers . However , it would appear from the legislative history prior to the authorisation of mixed practices in DATE that there were doubts as to the suitability of exclusive rights of audience as a means of achieving the desired aims .", "When preparing LAW in DATE the legislature still considered a ban on such practices as an additional measure indispensable for the preservation of the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes ( cf . In extenso Report of the CARDINALth Session of the Legal Affairs Committee of the CARDINALrd NORP GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . Such a ban could not be executed at this stage ( cf . In extenso Report of the CARDINALrd Session of ORG of the CARDINALrd NORP GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . ; Report of the Plenary Session of the NORP GPE of DATE , ORG , CARDINALnd Session , p. CARDINAL ; Report of the Plenary Session of the NORP GPE of DATE , CARDINALrd ORG , CARDINALth Session , p. CARDINAL ) ; however , practices operating in CARDINAL locality were not viewed as admissible ... . A relevant connection between the forms of law firms , the restricted capacity to conduct proceedings before the courts of first instance and the exclusive right of audience to the appeals courts also featured prominently in the Report of ORG of DATE ( cf . p. CARDINAL of the Report ) .", "It was only in DATE that the legislature reacted with section CARDINAL of LAW to the changes that had in fact taken place and to the case - law of ORG that had moved in a similar direction . At the same time , it abandoned linkage of the capacity to conduct proceedings and the nation - wide professional localisation for civil proceedings before ORG ( Section CARDINAL of LAW in the wording of LAW , Nr . CARDINAL ORG ) . Last but not least , doubt was occasionally expressed in the debates about the amendment as to whether the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes required the existence of a system based on exclusive rights of audience ( cf . ... the Report of the CARDINALth Session of ORG of the CARDINALth NORP GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL about talks at ORG ) .", "( cc ) Further , In LAW on the amendment of the LAW of DATE on greater flexibility of the practical exercise of their services by barristers of CARDINAL DATE ( ... hereinafter referred to as the ... ) , the legislature found another means of compulsorily adhering to the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes without the need for exclusive rights of audience ... . According to the third sentence of LAW of the LAW on the Exercise of ORG , barristers from member ORG are entitled to appear before the civil chambers of appeal courts even without exclusive rights of audience according to section CARDINAL of LAW , provided however that it has been ascertained that such barristers have not acted as full legal representatives in the initial proceedings .", "Already in DATE , the legislature had thus demonstrated that there was an alternative and less demanding way of ensuring the free exercise of the profession and of implementing the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes , merely by prescribing a changeover in staff from CARDINAL instance to the other . This solution , which was favourable to barristers from ORG member GPE , failed to obtain majority support from barristers authorised to practise in GPE during the debates on the amendment of sections . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( cf . Verbatim Record of the CARDINALth Session of ORG of the CARDINALth NORP GPE of DATE , p. CARDINAL ; the matter was not taken up again later ) , although the system of exclusive rights of audience is less conducive to the observance of the principle of CARDINAL pairs of eyes . Thereafter , the legislature , contrary to what was laid down in LAW on the Exercise of ORG ( henceforth section CARDINAL of the PERSON on ORG in GPE ) , has ceased to consider the changeover of staff as indispensable .", "( dd ) It Is consequently to be noted that , overall since DATE , the legislature has increasingly and clearly distanced himself from \u2018 its initial assessment that the system of exclusive rights of audience was on the whole more necessary for the administration of justice than unrestricted rights of audience .", "The basis for this clearly lay in the recognition that grew up in a number of ORG and in other branches of the judiciary of the capacity of the administration of justice to function on the basis of a system of unrestricted rights of audience , as well as in advantages that accrued to the administration of justice , especially from the clients\u2019 standpoint . Foremost among these advantages was the special relationship of trust between barrister and client underpinned not only by the knowledge of the case - file in a specific case , but also by long - standing advice and successful co - operation concerning all the legal business involving the client . For a client who has won his case in the first instance , a mandatory change of barrister can be disturbing . Although the consequences of such a change may be offset to some extent by bringing into the appeal proceedings the barrister already fully conversant with the case when tried in the first instance , additional costs would be entailed .", "Hence the marked reticence shown by the legislature in the DATE ORG and its failure to decide itself whether the administration of justice would be better served by a system of exclusive rights of audience or a system of unrestricted rights of audience ... . The idea was first of all to offer the new L\u00e4nder an opportunity of deciding according to their own preferences . A corresponding freedom of choice was then thrown open to all the L\u00e4nder in the initial draft reform of DATE ... . This was to make clear the fact that , under Federal legislation , neither unrestricted nor exclusive rights of audience were to enjoy precedence before ORG . ORG of the NORP GPE rallied to this view of the law at its hearing of DATE ... .", "( b ) These doubts in the legislature \u2019s mind as to the suitability and the necessity of the system of exclusive rights of audience as a means of improving the quality of the administration of justice were strengthened by the body of experience acquired in GPE . According to LAW of LAW , exclusive rights of audience are no longer required for the achievement of the desired aims and are in breach of LAW .", "Neither have any drawbacks emerged in the administration of justice when , further to the introduction of unrestricted rights of audience , the client has himself decided whether he wishes a change of barrister for the appeal proceedings and himself determines what he deems to be the relevant criteria , such as geographical proximity , specialisation and size of the law firm , familiarity with the case - law of the competent chamber of the court or perhaps merely dissatisfaction with his previous legal representative .", "The principle is clearly not a requirement for the formation of a body of specialised barristers which the association of barristers enjoying exclusive rights of audience , together with the President of ORG , consider to be in the common interest . There are barristers specialising in GPE Financial - , ORG law and who appear before all levels of jurisdiction in those sectors . Specialist barristers also work on an appreciable scale in practices which associates with rights of audience in appeal courts are allowed to join . It is thus irrelevant whether the rights of audience in the particular sector are exclusive or unrestricted . In certain appeal courts barristers enjoying exclusive rights of audience belong without exception to mixed practices with some members specialising in specific areas in which they are particularly qualified . In addition , in the new ORG with the system of exclusive rights of audience , no law firms dealing exclusively in ORG appeal court proceedings have so far been formed . No need for barristers specialising in appeal matters has been felt , as was already clearly the case at an early stage in LOC and other places with unrestricted rights of audience .", "Significant advantages that might flow from the system of exclusive rights of audience are not to be seen . True , the figures that have been presented do reveal deviations in the frequency and the success of appeals as well as fluctuations over DATE and in results as between individual ORG . However , since the performance of barristers is expressed in terms of numbers and results of judgments , no clear view of the pros and cons of either system can be obtained . Judgments handed down by independent courts can hardly be attributed to the preparatory work by barristers appearing before appeal courts or to the applicable right of audience .", "True , judges have always favoured the system of exclusive rights of audience since it facilitates their task . On the other hand , clients gain a greater freedom of choice when barristers enjoy unrestricted rights of audience . Evidence that they often have no wish to change barristers is to be seen in a long - standing avoidance of the rule restricting admission to a single bar . Restrictions on the exercise of the profession must take account of the fact that above all else barristers have a duty to their clients as an independent adviser and representative ... . Restrictions on the free exercise of their activity by barristers can not be required solely on the ground that they are looked upon as objectively useful by the appeal courts and judges in the districts where the system of exclusive rights of audience holds sway .", "If , over the course of DATE , the legislature restricts the freedom to exercise the profession only in a part of GPE without this entailing either greater drawbacks where greater freedom prevails or significant advantages where that freedom is more restricted , then it is clear that the restrictions were not needed .", "II .", "Although section CARDINAL of LAW is not in tune with LAW of LAW , the prescription is to continue to abide by the measures clearly arising out of the operative part until DATE . The barristers concerned in the ORG that are not identified in LAW need a certain period of adjustment .", "The time - scale first of all serves to help barristers appearing before appeal courts on the basis of the system of exclusive rights of audience to prepare to obtain admission to the relevant district and regional courts and to establish contacts with fellow - professionals . Many of them will also need to consider the matter of the siting of their practices for all or some of their partners . Planning and implementation will require appreciable time . For barristers who have been involved in first - instance proceedings for DATE ( Section CARDINAL , Nr . CARDINAL of LAW ) the question arises of their concurrent admission to the appeal - court bar . Clients with their roots in a local community situated in the larger L\u00e4nder will be able to use the period of transition in order to decide whether they wish to consider one or other of the barristers who have served them before the courts of first and second instance as possible permanent legal representatives for the future .", "Since it was argued in the proceedings that barristers enjoying exclusive rights of audience in appeals courts have so far been kept at full stretch by their forensic activity , it would then seem questionable to allow them throughout the transitional phase to take on the additional work resulting from their rights of audience to the courts of first instance with the shift of the centre of gravity of their activity this would entail , notwithstanding that the unconstitutional nature of the norms bar any new granting of exclusive rights of audience . The better barristers so far appearing exclusively before courts of second instance succeed in their reorientation , the more energy they will have to devote to first - instance cases and to advising new clients , so that cases still to be pleaded by them before the appeal courts could no longer continue to receive the same degree of care as hitherto . Since , however , it should not be overlooked that the reorientation will entail greater difficulties for second - instance barristers than for those who have so far acted exclusively at first - instance level , it is proper to stagger the opening of the system of unrestricted rights of audience . Barristers who have so far enjoyed exclusive rights of audience in the appeal courts can have additional rights of audience in courts of first instance as from DATE , whereas barristers who have so far appeared exclusively at first instance will be able to be accredited to the appeal courts at the earliest on DATE .", "III .", "As a consequence of the transitional regulations , the applicant will also have to wait until DATE in order to achieve his aim .
