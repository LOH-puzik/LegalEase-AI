These proceedings appear not to have been pursued to a conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL PERSON sued LAW , the trustee in bankruptcy and PERSON in ORG , objecting to the seizure and seeking an order to LAW to release the concrete - mixer from seizure and another order to the trustee and PERSON not to hinder the exercise of PERSON \u2019s rights .", "PERSON \u2019s position may be summarised as follows . Their objection to the seizure ( verzet ) was based on the argument that the concrete - mixer had not been operational on DATE , so that it could not have been part of the \" furnishings of a house or farmstead \" within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the alternative , the seizure was , on various grounds , wrongful in civil law ( onrechtmatig ) . Finally , the fact that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) prevented third parties from challenging a seizure affecting their own goods amounted to a denial of \" access to court \" as guaranteed by LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG filed lengthy pleadings in reply . The trustee and PERSON did not themselves make any submissions on the merits but requested that ORG statements in defence ( conclusie van antwoord ) and subsequent rejoinder ( conclusie van dupliek ) be treated as their own .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE . Taking the same view as LAW , it held that the fact that the concrete - mixer had not been operational at the time of the seizure did not invalidate the seizure itself . Since the proceedings concerned an objection to seizure under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court could not entertain PERSON \u2019s complaint that the seizure was unlawful ; the only permissible purpose of such proceedings was to examine whether the requirements of LAW ( CARDINAL ) were met . Furthermore , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention did not apply - and had therefore not been violated - because section CARDINAL related to the imposition and collection of taxes , empowering ORG authorities to make decisions in the normal discharge of their duties under public law , and thus did not concern \" civil rights and obligations \" .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG , summoning PERSON \u2019s trustee in bankruptcy on DATE and LAW and PERSON on DATE .", "PERSON \u2019s first ground of appeal ( grief ) was that ORG had erred in holding that the seizure was valid even though the concrete - mixer had not been operational at the time . The second and third grounds of appeal were founded on ORG refusal to deal with PERSON \u2019s allegations of unlawfulness and to accept their arguments based on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "ORG replied that PERSON \u2019s complaints concerning LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW amounted to an allegation of deprivation of their possessions in violation of LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . He denied , however , that there had in fact been such violation .", "CARDINAL . Following the exchange of pleadings by the parties to the proceedings , a hearing was held on DATE .", "At this hearing counsel for PERSON continued to rely on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . In his view , what was decisive for that provision ( article DATE ) to be applicable was whether the plaintiff sought protection of a right that was to be classed as \" civil \" within the meaning of the provision ( article DATE ) . Since PERSON sought to be protected against infringement by LAW of their ownership of the concrete - mixer , undoubtedly a \" civil \" right within the meaning of the provision ( article DATE ) , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) applied ; it had , moreover , been violated since section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW amounted to a limitation of access to court with respect to assets of the kind mentioned in it .", "While agreeing that PERSON had been deprived of CARDINAL of their possessions and had suffered damage as a result , PERSON \u2019s counsel expressly declined to rely on LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Contrary to what LAW had suggested both at first instance and on appeal , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) had nothing to do with deprivation of property but barred access to court for those who sought to be protected from the seizure and sale of their property . That was clear from its wording . That also followed , incidentally , from LAW , which prohibited expropriation without compensation : if section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) were a provision concerning deprivation of property , it would contravene LAW . On the principle that a provision of GPE legislation could not be construed so as to be incompatible with the LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) therefore had to be construed as merely barring access to court . The questions raised by LAW ( CARDINAL ) were thus of a \" procedural \" , not a \" substantive \" nature , and therefore the more appropriate LAW provision was Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) and not LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "Since section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) obviously violated Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , it should - pursuant to LAW be applied . This meant that section CARDINAL and the following sections of LAW applied without restriction , and this in turn meant that PERSON could rely on their right of ownership of the concrete - mixer , which was therefore not subject to seizure .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE .", "Like ORG , it held that the seizure was not vitiated by the fact that the concrete - mixer had not been fully operational at the time ; the concrete - mixer \u2019s intended use had already been established and all efforts had been directed towards making it operational and ensuring that it would serve PERSON on a lasting basis . The concrete - mixer thus qualified as \" furnishings \" of PERSON \u2019s factory building . The first ground of appeal therefore failed .", "The second and third grounds of appeal were also dismissed .", "After establishing that the right claimed by PERSON was a \" civil right \" for the purposes of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , ORG went on to hold :", "\" The question is therefore whether in the present case access to a tribunal and due process were sufficiently secured to PERSON . To answer this , it is necessary to ascertain what provisions , in so far as relevant to the present case , govern ownership and the procedure connected with it .", "In the ORG of ... section I [ of the LAW ] apart from the aforementioned LAW ) , a number of fundamental rights are laid down and - where necessary - defined . The right of ownership is not one of them . This is provided for in LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL ) to the Convention ...", "[ LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ] does therefore authorise national legislatures to pass laws restricting the enjoyment of possessions or even entirely depriving the individual of that enjoyment for specific purposes relating to the general interest ; however , when it comes to the question of whether such a law has been properly applied in a specific case , the owner concerned remains entitled , as provided in LAW , to access to a tribunal and to due process in order to have the application of the law assessed .", "CARDINAL such provision of domestic law which is authorised by LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) is LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . The rule laid down therein implies that seizure levied by the tax authorities in order to collect a tax debt in fact deprives a third party of his ownership of an item of movable property provided that when the seizure was effected the item of property was on the tax debtor \u2019s premises and served as \u2018 FAC of them . Whether , when judged by this condition , the seizure of his property was rightly effected is a matter which any affected third party can have reviewed by the ordinary civil courts in proper legal proceedings . In assessing the lawfulness of the seizure , the court may not take into account whether or not the relevant property is owned by the tax debtor , because precisely this point is not relevant - save for certain exceptions which are of no consequence here - in view of the scope of the subsection . This also reveals the meaning of the provision that third parties may \u2018 never bring an action to challenge seizures for tax purposes\u2019 . It means not that they may not bring an action before the courts but rather that , having brought an action in the courts , they may not successfully submit , as a basis for their action , that the seizure is unlawful because the goods seized belong to them and not to the tax debtor . Consequently , the provisions of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW are of no avail to them in this respect because LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW derogates from them as a lex specialis .", "It follows from the above that there has been no violation of LAW ) of the LAW and that ORG was correct in not dealing with the allegation that the LAW acted unlawfully by seizing the concrete - mixer belonging to PERSON ... \"", "CARDINAL . PERSON entered an appeal on points of law ( beroep in cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . They filed grounds ( middelen van cassatie ) that were each subdivided into a large number of parts . ORG ( advocaat - generaal ) noted that several grounds and many of their component parts were merely variations on a single theme .", "ORG had erred in considering the matter under LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW was a \" procedural \" provision , not a \" substantive \" one , and should therefore have been examined only in the light of LAW ) ; the fact that lack of access to a tribunal could lead to loss of property indicated only that the interests protected by LAW ) were very real .", "PERSON went on to submit that LAW ( CARDINAL ) violated LAW ) as it only allowed third parties to challenge seizure of their goods on the LOC of another by the tax authorities on the ground that those goods were not \" fruit \" , or \" furnishings \" , or intended for the \" cultivation or use of land \" . If the goods concerned fell into CARDINAL of those categories , there was no other ground on which to base an action . LAW ( CARDINAL ) had been inspired by the need to prevent tax evasion , but had been rendered obsolete by developments in business practice and commercial law , retention of title now being a generally accepted and quite legal form of security . ORG had acted unlawfully in seizing the concrete - mixer since PERSON had not actually been conniving at tax evasion .", "In any event , even if LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) applied ( which PERSON submitted it did not ) , it only allowed GPE to interfere with the tax debtor \u2019s peaceful enjoyment of his possessions to secure payment of the taxes he owed . It did not allow them to deprive third parties of their possessions .", "It was not to be assumed that LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) legitimised greater interferences with ORG rights than did LAW , which forbade expropriation without compensation . If LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were seen as a \" substantive \" provision , it clearly amounted to a provision making deprivation of property by the ORG possible in the public interest .", "Finally , ORG had not at any time informed PERSON of the seizure as he should have done .", "CARDINAL . Following the advisory opinion ( conclusie ) of its Procurator - General ( procureur - generaal ) , ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . Its reasoning was as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . The purport of grounds of appeal PERSON is to argue that the provisions of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of CARDINAL DATE ... are incompatible with LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In the assessment of this argument , the following is of importance :", "( a ) LAW of LAW , in particular the third paragraph thereof , implies that LAW has a right of recovery against third parties\u2019 goods listed in that paragraph and ` situated on the premises of the tax debtor at the time of the seizure\u2019 .", "( b ) The objection which third parties may make before the civil courts to the seizure of their goods is in principle limited to the question whether the conditions for its applicability described in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) have been satisfied ; in other respects , third parties may file an administrative objection to the Commissioner of Direct Taxes by means of the complaint procedure referred to in subsection CARDINAL of that section ...", "( c ) It follows from the provisions of chapter V of ORG ( Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen ) and LAW , opening words and subsection ( m ) , of ORG ( GPE administratieve rechtspraak overheidsbeschikkingen ) that no appeal lies to an administrative tribunal against the Commissioner \u2019s decision on the administrative objection . Consequently , the third party may bring an action against such a decision in the civil courts , possibly in summary proceedings ( kort geding ) , on the basis that there has been an unlawful act . In so doing , the third party may also base his claim of unlawfulness on the allegation that the Commissioner has acted in breach of a general principle of good governance ( algemeen beginsel van behoorlijk bestuur ) .", "( d ) The provisions of the DATE LAW ( PERSON invordering - Resolution of DATE , no . B CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in particular paragraph CARDINAL , are also of importance in this connection . Although the DATE Guidelines do not contain rules of law , principles of good governance imply that the Commissioner may not deviate to the disadvantage of a third party from the rules laid down in the LAW , as the court considers they should be interpreted . If he does depart from them , he is in principle acting unlawfully vis - \u00e0 - vis the third party .", "( e ) As regards the content of paragraph CARDINAL of the Guidelines , the following features of the provisions contained in sub - paragraph CARDINAL should be mentioned briefly . It is in keeping with the Commissioner \u2019s policy that the third party \u2019s title will in principle be respected in cases of ` real ownership\u2019 . But recovery against the goods of a third party is generally justified if ` the circumstance that the goods legally belong to another person has mainly been brought about to exclude the possibility of recovery against such goods for debts of the taxpayer or to ensure that the third party has a priority right to recover against such ORG . CARDINAL of the examples quoted here is where a supplier of goods reserves the ownership of them . It has been established that PERSON did this as supplier of the goods which are the subject of the litigation .", "( f ) It is also provided in paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of the DATE Guidelines that an administrative objection made by a third party shall be dealt with even if it is not filed in time , i.e. within the said period of DATE from the date of seizure as referred to in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . It follows that a third party who files an administrative objection out of time is entitled to have it dealt with . As the third party need not be aware that the seizure has occurred and thus that time has started to run - neither the law nor the LAW require service on , or any other form of warning to , a third party - it must be assumed - partly in the light of DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW - that the third party may have recourse to the civil courts in this case in the manner described above under ( c ) and ( d ) .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , the arguments advanced in grounds of appeal I - III can not be accepted as correct .", "A third party whose goods have been seized has opportunities for redress against the acts of LAW or the Commissioner as the case may be , before an independent and impartial tribunal established by law such that the requirements of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention are met .", "Nor can it be said that the recovery , on the basis of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , of goods belonging to a third party such as PERSON - who as supplier of the goods has reserved title to them - is not compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . That is because LAW ( CARDINAL ) is to be regarded as a statutory provision which the ORG regards as necessary in order to secure the payment of taxes in such a manner as to ensure that this payment is not frustrated by reservation of title by a third - party supplier .", "Grounds of appeal I - III fail in view of the above , irrespective of the validity of the arguments set out by ORG , which these grounds attack .", "CARDINAL . As , according to the explanation given of it , ground of appeal PERSON builds on the previous grounds , it must fail likewise . In so far as it is suggested that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) should not be applied as it has been ` rendered obsolete by developments in business practice and commercial law\u2019 , the ground is unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Ground of appeal V takes issue with ORG opinion that LAW does not have a duty to give notice , in the sense that he should have given notice to PERSON after the seizure of the goods that they had been seized . The ground fails .", "As already indicated at CARDINAL . ( f ) above , neither the DATE Act nor LAW contain any such obligation to provide a warning . Although such an obligation may in special circumstances be inferred from unwritten law , no such special circumstances have been alleged by PERSON in this connection .", "CARDINAL . Since none of the grounds of appeal justifies overturning the judgment appealed against , the appeal must be dismissed . \"", "The above judgment of ORG was published in LOC , ( Weekly Law Reports - RvdW ) DATE , CARDINAL ; in the PERSON ( Professional Studies News ) DATE , p.

These priority rights were based on the nature of the debt ( section CARDINAL ) and their order of precedence was laid down by law .

It is in accordance with such a policy that the property rights of a third party are spared where a personal tax or social - security contribution debt is to be collected and also where genuine property ( re\u00eble eigendom ) of a third party is involved , provided , however , that the following is taken into account .", "...", "The above does not alter the fact that there can be no grounds for any reticent policy in clear cases of connivance between the tax debtor and the third party to create a sham property situation in an attempt to prevent recovery on goods .", "From the point of view of fairness and good policy recovery on goods of a third party is generally justified in cases of recovery of commercial tax and social - security contribution debts and when the economic relationship between the tax debtor and the goods provides reason to consider these goods as his and the circumstance that legally the goods belong to someone else has been created mainly to exclude recovery at the expense of the tax debtor or to enable the third party to obtain a preferential right of recovery on these goods .", "Examples of this are cases of goods delivered under a hire - purchase agreement or under various forms of leasing or other forms in which the supplier of the goods retains the ownership thereof .", "In addition , one might consider in this connection those cases in which ownership of the goods has been transferred to a third party as a security .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) , ORG rejected the proposition that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) applied only to goods on the tax debtor \u2019s premises the ownership of which had been transferred to a third party in order to prevent the tax authorities from recovering tax debts by the forced sale of those goods . Although it did appear from the drafting history of that provision that it had been prompted at the time ( DATE ) by the desire to counter certain abuses , this did not mean that the occurrence of an abuse had been made a requirement for the provision \u2019s applicability , section CARDINAL being derived from the landlord \u2019s priority right as defined in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Section CARDINAL had afterwards several times been the subject of debate between the ORG and ORG and this debate supported the idea that the purport of LAW was , in the words of ORG , \" to afford the tax authorities the possibility of recovery against the goods seized , notwithstanding any third - party rights , as if they belonged to the tax debtor \" .", "CARDINAL . It was not possible for suppliers of goods to obtain information from the tax authorities as to whether their clients had any outstanding tax debts and whether there was accordingly any risk of seizure . According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen ) tax officials were , and are , under an obligation to keep such information secret .", "CARDINAL . A right similar to that of LAW under LAW of LAW was enjoyed by the customs authorities . They were empowered by section CARDINAL of ORG ( Algemene wet inzake de douane en de accijnzen ) to recover import duties and excise against the goods for which these were due , along with any administrative fines or interest , irrespective of who could claim rights to the goods concerned .", "CARDINAL . When a natural or legal person was declared bankrupt , all seizures affecting his property lapsed ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON ) ) . This included the seizure of his property by the tax authorities , but not the seizure pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of the goods of third parties .", "CARDINAL . In cases in which movable goods had been sold and delivered but not paid for in full , LAW allowed the vendor to reclaim the goods if the purchaser went bankrupt , provided that the goods could still be identified ( section CARDINAL ) and that the vendor exercised his right within DATE of delivery to the purchaser ( section CARDINAL ) . The vendor had then to refund any payment he might already have received as well as certain expenses that might in the meantime have been incurred ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The purchase agreement was then considered rescinded and ownership of the goods was deemed always to have remained with the vendor ( judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "The vendor \u2019s rights under sections CARDINAL and following of LAW had to be respected by the tax authorities ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As followed from section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , third parties claiming a title to goods seized on the premises of the tax debtor could submit an administrative objection to LAW , who forwarded it to the Commissioner of Direct Taxes . Although section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) contained a DATE time - limit , administrative objections submitted after its expiry nevertheless were dealt with and LAW was required to suspend the forced sale of the seized goods if that was still possible ( paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of the DATE Guidelines ) .", "There were no restrictions as to the grounds on which an administrative objection to the tax authorities might be based .", "CARDINAL . After obtaining a decision from the Commissioner or - if preferred - without first obtaining such a decision , a third party could bring an action before ORG under section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "However , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW limited the grounds for such an action to the question whether the seized goods were in fact \" fruit , whether harvested or not , or movable goods serving either as furnishings of a house or farmstead or for the cultivation or use of land \" ( judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL , and the judgment of ORG in the present case - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The possibilities of redress by the civil courts were clarified by ORG judgment in the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . That judgment made it clear that in bringing a case before the civil courts a third party did not have to confine himself to the questions outlined in paragraph CARDINAL above but could also base his action on a wrongful act in civil law ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) committed by LAW , thus enabling the courts to review compliance with LAW by LAW in authorising the seizure and by the Commissioner of Direct Taxes in rejecting the third party \u2019s objections .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the German Civil Code ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) reads as follows :", "\" If the vendor of a movable good has retained ownership until the price has been paid , it should be assumed in case of doubt that the transfer of ownership takes place subject to a suspensive clause of full payment of the price and that the vendor is entitled to rescind the contract if the purchaser comes to be in default of payment . \"", "According to section CARDINAL of the German Civil Code , in the event of rescission each party had to return to the other everything already received under the contract .", "At the time of the events complained of , there was no statutory provision in GPE law similar to section CARDINAL of the German Civil Code but retention of title was frequently resorted to and upheld by the courts in disputes between private parties .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a report was published by a government committee ( ORG \" ) set up to review the law on priority rights ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . With regard to the right granted the tax authorities by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW the report expressed the opinion that this right should be limited to cases in which other creditors besides the tax authorities had stipulated rights wholly or essentially amounting to security for debts ; this would broadly correspond to the policy followed by the tax authorities themselves as laid down in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also suggested extending the right of seizure to all movable goods intended for permanent professional use by the enterprise concerned .", "CARDINAL . The right of the tax authorities pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) came under increasing criticism . For this reason , the ORG , when introducing legislation aimed at modernising the law on the collection of tax debts , did not - for the time being - propose any significant changes to the priority right of the tax authorities or the right of seizure . They stated , when introducing the relevant PERSON , that that required further study , for which an ORG was to be set up . This position was criticised in ORG , particularly by those parties which considered the wide powers of seizure enjoyed by the tax authorities unjustified , but the ORG maintained their position . Nevertheless , the submission to ORG of the new PERSON led once more to critical debate both within ORG and outside it .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON referred to in the previous paragraph became the new LAW , which entered into force on DATE ( ORG DATE - \" the DATE LAW ) .", "For all practical purposes , it retains intact the arrangement of LAW as regards the priority of tax debts , even extending the time - limit involved . It also contains a provision ( section CARDINAL ) which is in practice almost identical to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the only real difference being that in the third paragraph an exhaustive list is given of the taxes concerned .", "According to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW would cease to operate on DATE , unless by that date a PERSON had been introduced for its replacement or for prolonging its validity for DATE ; in fact , a PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) meeting these requirements was submitted to ORG of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) published its report in DATE . PERSON . CARDINAL - which is based on , and closely follows , the report of the above - mentioned ORG - proposes to amend LAW and LAW in such a way as to grant the tax authorities a right of recovery against all goods not belonging to the tax debtor but intended for his permanent use in the exercise of his profession . Third parties would not be able to oppose to LAW any negotiated right which served essentially as a security . LAW would , however , be required to enquire of the tax debtor whether any of the seized goods belonged to third parties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
