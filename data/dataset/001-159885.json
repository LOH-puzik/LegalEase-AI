LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Public hearing);Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A.

The applicant was employed as the head of a municipal kindergarten in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was informed by the local office of ORG that , as a person of equivalent status to a civil servant , she was under investigation on suspicion of fraudulent management of accounts , abuse of office and forgery of documents . In DATE she was informed of additional suspicions against her concerning further acts of abuse of office , forgery of documents and misappropriation of property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant submitted a request to the pre - trial judge to terminate the criminal investigation on the grounds that it had been excessively long . The judge refused the request , noting that the investigation had been completed DATE and the case was ready for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was referred for judicial examination . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) found the applicant guilty on several of the charges against her . She was sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) and a prohibition on working for the civil service for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was amended on appeal : on DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the appellate court \u201d ) upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction on some of the charges and acquitted her on several others . Her sentence was reduced to a fine of LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) and a prohibition on working for the civil service for DATE and DATE . Soon afterwards the applicant was dismissed from her job by GPE in line with the decision of the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the reasoning of the appellate court but changed the applicant \u2019s sentence . ORG found that when determining the length of the applicant \u2019s prohibition on working for the civil service , it was necessary to take into account the fact that she had been suspended from her post during the criminal investigation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . As a result , the period of prohibition was reduced to DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the launch of the criminal investigation against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the first - instance court granted the prosecutor \u2019s request to have the applicant suspended from her job as the head of DATE for DATE . The court held that there were grounds to believe that the applicant , as a person of equivalent status to a civil servant , might use her official position to hinder the investigation by , for example , destroying or fabricating evidence , or attempting to influence the witnesses in the case , who were her subordinates .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision , arguing that she could not be equated to a civil servant because she worked under an employment contract with GPE . She further argued that all the important documents had already been collected from DATE and all the relevant witnesses had been questioned , so there was no possibility for her to interfere with the investigation . The applicant also submitted that she had no prior convictions and had never been subject to any disciplinary action at work and that her employer \u2019s evaluation of her had always been positive ; thus there were no grounds to believe that she would use her official position to hinder the investigation . Lastly , the applicant submitted that her job in the kindergarten was her only source of income and therefore the suspension would cause significant difficulties for her and her young daughter , whom the applicant was raising alone . However , the appellate court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the reasoning of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the first - instance court granted the prosecutor \u2019s requests to extend the applicant \u2019s suspension from her post by further periods of DATE on essentially the same grounds . The applicant appealed against all the decisions , raising the same arguments as before , but her appeals were dismissed by the appellate court ( on CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE ) . On DATE the appellate court noted , inter alia , that the applicant was only suspended from holding a specific post in a particular kindergarten , so the suspension did not affect her ability to take a different job and thus obtain a source of income .", "CARDINAL . On each of the above - mentioned occasions the decision of the first - instance court was taken following a written procedure , while the appellate court held oral hearings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Neither the applicant nor her representative was present at any of these hearings . The prosecutor was present at the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the criminal case was referred for judicial examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in DATE the first - instance court held an oral hearing in which it extended the applicant \u2019s suspension from her post by DATE on the same grounds as before . The applicant and her representative were present at the hearing . The applicant \u2019s appeal was subsequently dismissed by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court in an oral hearing at which the applicant and her representative were present , terminated the applicant \u2019s suspension from her post . The court found that almost all the witnesses had been questioned , so there were no grounds to believe that the applicant might attempt to influence them or otherwise hinder the investigation . The applicant returned to her job as the head of DATE .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE the appellate court overturned the decision of the first - instance court , finding that the investigation had not been completed yet , so there was still a risk that the applicant may hinder it . Since the appellate court was not authorised by law to adopt a new decision extending the suspension , the prosecutor submitted a new request for an extension to the first - instance court . During this period the applicant continued working as the head of the kindergarten .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court , in an oral hearing at which the applicant and her representative were present , renewed the applicant \u2019s suspension from her post for DATE . However , on CARDINAL DATE the appellate court allowed an appeal by the applicant against this decision and quashed the above extension ordered by the first - instance court . The applicant returned to her job and remained the head of the kindergarten until her dismissal in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to the Inspector of ORG concerning several articles in the LOC rytas newspaper . The publications commented on the criminal case against the applicant and presented statements from her subordinates criticising her competence and personality . The applicant complained that these articles had been defamatory and insulting . She also complained about a comment posted by a user on the website of the NORP rytas newspaper which insulted the applicant and her young daughter on the grounds that the applicant was a single mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Inspector of ORG partly satisfied the applicant \u2019s complaint . The ORG found that the comment on the website of NORP rytas was insulting to the applicant and her daughter and ordered the newspaper to remove it from the website . With respect to the articles in LOC rytas , the Inspector held that the applicant was a public figure and therefore had to accept a greater level of media attention and criticism . The Inspector also found that the statements about the applicant in the articles in question reflected the opinions of the interviewed individuals , so the newspaper could not be held accountable for their factual accuracy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s decision indicated that it could be appealed to the court within DATE . The applicant did not appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
