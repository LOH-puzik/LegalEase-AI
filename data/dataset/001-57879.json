GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON lives in GPE and is a journalist by profession . At the material time he was working as editor - in - chief of a news agency run by a commercial company , ORG , of which he was a founder member and manager . This company filed a petition in bankruptcy ( ORG ) on DATE . A new company , ORG ( \" the ddp \" ) , was created subsequently , and PERSON became its sole director ( PERSON ) and editor - in - chief on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Shortly afterwards , he instituted CARDINAL different sets of proceedings . In the first ( A ) he sought to challenge his dismissal and in the second ( B ) he claimed the right to reply to a press release issued by his employer . At almost the same time , he became involved in a third set of proceedings ( C ) brought against him under LAW of DATE ( PERSON gegen den unlauteren PERSON - \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG For reasons connected with the applicant \u2019s financial management , the ddp \u2019s supervisory board ( PERSON ) dismissed him without notice from all his duties on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE it sent him another letter of dismissal on the ground that he had allegedly communicated inside information to third persons . PERSON challenged the validity of the latter dismissal , which was renewed on DATE . A further dismissal letter was sent to him on DATE , after he had distributed a circular letter and newspaper cuttings among fellow professionals on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . A final dismissal notice , based on new grounds , was sent to him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the end of legal proceedings instituted by the applicant , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) held on DATE that he had been validly dismissed on DATE .", "According to the court , the distribution of the circular and cuttings was to be regarded as such a serious breach of PERSON duty of loyalty that it was not possible for the employer to continue his contract , nor could it reasonably be expected . By sending press articles to a large number of influential professionals and endorsing in the circular their objectively unfavourable statements about the ddp \u2019s competence and business situation , PERSON had knowingly run the risk of causing the company considerable prejudice ; such behaviour on the part of a leading employee was unacceptable and therefore not covered by the constitutional right to freedom of expression .", "Furthermore , it could not be inferred from the circular that its main aim was to defend the applicant \u2019s reputation and honour ; it contained neither any reference to the ddp \u2019s allegations nor any arguments in PERSON defence . The circular \u2019s last paragraph clearly showed that the sole purpose of the mailing had been to disseminate adverse comments on the applicant \u2019s former employer and to establish contact with the addressees .", "CARDINAL . Mr Jacubowski challenged this judgment in ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , but on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively those courts declined to accept for adjudication his applications on the ground that they had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , on DATE , the agency had published a press release concerning its own reorganisation . In this it also criticised the applicant \u2019s management in the following terms :", "\" ... after the private limited company ... had filed a petition in bankruptcy on DATE , the public limited company NORP - again under the management of PERSON - started up on DATE with a capital of CARDINAL DM . ORG unchanged business methods and his inappropriate behaviour to clients , together with the lack of any efficient , reliable editorial management meant that no advantage was taken of the opportunity to make a fresh start , and indeed they led to a loss of clients . Until DATE PERSON misled the supervisory board about vital aspects of the developments . In particular , liabilities incurred in the private company \u2019s period of existence were transferred to the public company , and this put the NORP agency into financial difficulties again . Only the timely intervention of the former finance and accounting director , PERSON , the current director , prevented more serious harm being done , so that DATE NORP is once again on a sound financial footing . On CARDINAL July - the date of the general meeting - Jacubowski was dismissed without notice on account of his business incompetence ... PERSON was appointed sole director . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested the ddp to publish his reply ( PERSON ) to the press release , but without success . He then sought an interim injunction ( einstweilige GPE ) from ORG ( Landgericht ) , but this was refused on DATE , on the ground that the proposed reply was not limited to answering the allegations of fact in the press release ( gegenteilige Tatsachenbehauptung ) but gave a completely new version of the sequence of events ( PERSON ) , which had not been an issue in the ddp \u2019s press release .", "On DATE ORG reversed ORG judgment and ordered the agency to accede to PERSON request , which it did DATE . In the reply then published the applicant answered in detail all the main accusations contained in the ddp \u2019s press release .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , on DATE , PERSON had sent CARDINAL articles from newspapers with large circulations to CARDINAL newspaper publishers and newspaper , radio and television journalists who , as clients of the ddp , had received the press release of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . These articles gave critical accounts of his dismissal , the circumstances surrounding it and the ddp \u2019s activities in general . They reported in particular that the ddp \u2019s financial position had worsened again since the bankruptcy in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that some of its clients were preparing to dispense with its services , mainly because of their poor standard and the lack of certain technical facilities .", "He had appended a circular letter that read as follows :", "\" The enclosed selection - which is inevitably incomplete - of articles on the PERSON v. NORP case will undoubtedly throw light on certain matters that are still obscure , even though you may already be familiar with CARDINAL or other of the accounts of the facts . Some of the facts are admittedly reported inaccurately , but they scarcely alter the picture as a whole . The pending court proceedings that members of NORP \u2019s staff affected by current developments at the agency and I have brought will ensure that all the details finally become clear .", "I should be glad to be able to meet you in person before too long , in order to discuss not only the past but also future developments in the NORP \u2018 news ORG . I will ask for an appointment in due course . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Shortly afterwards , on DATE , the applicant set up a \" public - relations \" agency .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime the PERSON company , which had acquired PERCENT of the ddp \u2019s capital , had applied for a restraining injunction ( Unterlassung ) against PERSON . On DATE ORG refused the application on the ground that PERSON had no legal interest ( rechtliches ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , on an appeal by PERSON , joined ( Eintritt in den LOC ) by the agency , ORG refused to grant an injunction prohibiting the applicant from systematically criticising the ddp but ordered that he should desist from any further such mailings , on pain of a fine ; it went on to hold that he would have to \" compensate the [ E. company ] for all the damage that the acts [ in question ] ha[d ] caused and [ would ] cause the [ ddp ] \" . The judgment was based on section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , which provides : \" Any person who , in the course of business commits , for purposes of competition , acts contrary to accepted moral standards may be enjoined from further engaging in those acts and held liable for damages . \"", "The court held that in his circular the respondent had repeated in his own name the allegations made in the attached articles . Admittedly , he had sought to correct assertions made about him in the press release that were possibly false but he had acted above all for purposes of competition in the course of business .", "The court said , inter alia :", "\" ... the respondent sent his circular of DATE for purposes of competition in the course of business .", "An action is said to be for purposes of competition where it is on the face of it apt to promote CARDINAL person \u2019s sales to the detriment of another \u2019s and where it is carried out with a corresponding intention , although that intention need not be the only or the essential motive for the action ( settled case - law , see ORG in GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL - Constanze I ; ORG , GPE , CARDINALth edition , intro . to LAW , marginal notes CARDINAL et seq . , with further references ) .", "Remarks which , according to the witness ORG , the respondent made several times show that even before sending out the circular the latter had planned to set up his own news agency after he left the employ of the [ ddp ] . The distribution of the circular referring to the enclosed adverse newspaper reports on , inter alia , the [ ddp ] \u2019s activities as a news agency to current clients of the [ ddp ] and/or potential clients of both the [ ddp ] and the news agency that the respondent proposed to set up was apt to enhance the competitive position of the respondent \u2019s company and impair that of the [ ddp ] . Admittedly , the respondent \u2019s company did not then exist . However , for it to be held that there is a competitive relationship , it is sufficient that traders have , or at least will in the future have , the same potential clientele . This was the case as regards the respondent \u2019s company and the [ ddp ] ...", "Behind the respondent \u2019s conduct there was furthermore a ... competitive intention .", "Experience shows that the fact that activities are objectively apt to enhance one \u2019s own competitive position at the expense of another \u2019s is not the only basis for presuming a competitive intention ...", "In the present case such an intention is also apparent from the other facts that emerged during the proceedings . According to what he told the witness ORG , the respondent had already been planning for a long time to set up his own agency in the event of his leaving the [ ddp ] \u2019s service . In DATE the [ ddp ] had removed him from the post of director and in DATE [ it ] had terminated his contract of employment . The circular and newspaper cuttings were sent out DATE to selected addressees , including - and this is not disputed - important clients of the [ ddp ] . DATE the respondent \u2019s new agency was set up . This chronological sequence of events is a further indication of the respondent \u2019s intention to lower the [ ddp ] in the esteem of potential clients of both parties and thereby make it easier for his own agency to gain a foothold in the market in preparation for competition with the [ ddp ] .", "The last paragraph of the circular likewise makes the competitive intention clear . It shows that the respondent intended to provoke discussion not only with a view to correcting assertions concerning himself that were possibly false , but also , at the very least , in order to promote his future activities as a competitor of the [ ddp ] . It is not apparent what else the respondent could have meant when he wrote that he wished to discuss \u2018 not only the past but also future developments in the NORP \" news market \" \u2018 . By taking up these unfavourable comments on the [ ddp ] and distributing them anew as his own statements and assessments , he unnecessarily handicapped the [ ddp ] as a competitor . In this connection it does not matter whether the unfavourable factual statements concerning the [ ddp ] \u2019s activities were accurate and whether they justified the unfavourable assessments accompanying them . This is because even true statements may only be used to disparage a competitor where the person making them has sufficient reason to link his own competitive position with disparagement of the competitor and provided that the criticism does not in nature or degree exceed what is necessary ( ORG in GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL - F\u00e4lschung ) . It does not appear that there was any such reason to disparage the [ ddp ] by taking up the unfavourable comments on its activities in the ORG article . \"", "In short , PERSON had needlessly handicapped ( behinderte unn\u00f6tig ) a competitor and accordingly infringed section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG declined to accept for adjudication an appeal on points of law ( Revision ) by the applicant on the ground that it had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG Thereupon PERSON applied to ORG , complaining in particular of an infringement of freedom of expression ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , first sentence , of LAW ) . On DATE ORG declined to accept the complaint for adjudication on the ground that it was unfounded .", "It noted , firstly , that the prohibition in issue related solely to the applicant \u2019s chosen method of circulating his information . The information was , moreover , of a business nature , but this did not mean that it ceased to be an opinion whose expression was protected by LAW CARDINAL , first sentence , of LAW . This provision therefore had to be weighed against section CARDINAL of LAW , on which the prohibition had been founded .", "The court went on :", "\" In order for it to be determined how [ freedom of expression and fair competition ] are to be related to each other in the case of damaging comment by a competitor , the following points are decisive , having regard to earlier decisions of ORG in cases involving a call for a boycott ( see ORG [ vol . ] CARDINAL , CARDINAL at CARDINAL et seq . , with further references ) .", "In the first place , the motives of the person concerned and , linked to them , the aim and purpose of the comment are crucial . If the comment is motivated not by personal interests of an economic nature , but by concern for the political , economic , social or cultural interests of the community , if it serves to influence public opinion , the appeal will probably qualify for the protection of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , even if private and , more particularly , economic interests are adversely affected as a result . Conversely , the importance of protecting the latter interests is the greater , the less the comment is a contribution to public debate on a major issue of public concern and the more it is immediately directed against those interests in the course of business and in pursuit of a self - serving goal ( see ORG [ vol . ] CARDINAL , CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) such as improving one \u2019s own competitive position ...", "...", "In the light of these facts , the distribution of the applicant \u2019s circular can hardly be regarded as an attempt to influence public opinion . Rather it was designed almost exclusively to promote his private business interests and to secure or improve his competitive position in the news market .", "It follows ... that the prejudice caused to the complainants by the distribution of the circular was disproportionate to the applicant \u2019s aim , stated in it , of clarifying his relationship with the ddp and \u2018 current developments at the agency\u2019 . In principle , freedom of expression takes precedence over rights ( Rechtsg\u00fcter ) protected by ordinary laws in so far as the statement is part of the ongoing discussion of questions of public importance which is absolutely fundamental to a free democratic system . This condition is not satisfied where the statement is made to ensure that certain business interests prevail over others in the context of business competition . The fact that an interest is made to prevail by means which are in principle protected under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW can not therefore justify subordinating to it the other interest , which is in turn entitled to the protection of an ordinary law that places restrictions on freedom of expression , in this case LAW ( see ORG [ vol . ] CARDINAL , CARDINAL at CARDINAL et seq . ) . It follows that the finding by ORG that the applicant \u2019s distribution of the circular was contrary to accepted moral standards is not incompatible with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . \"", "ORG added that the fact that the impugned circular followed a press release directed against him which had been issued by the ddp ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) did not invalidate this conclusion , since in order to claim the protection of the LAW , his response would have had to be intended to influence public opinion , which it was not .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed a claim for damages brought by the ddp in reliance on ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that the ddp had insufficiently substantiated its claim and had failed to prove any causal link between the alleged damage and the distribution of PERSON circular ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
