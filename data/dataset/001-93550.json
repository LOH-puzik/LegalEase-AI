In addition , the applicants\u2019 grandchild had a stroke . Consequently , they decided to sell part of their property in order to pay for the medical treatment of the second applicant and their grandchild . They also wanted to finance their son \u2019s higher education . However , a number of potential buyers , having learnt about the lack of possibilities to develop the land , lost interest in the property .", "On DATE the applicants requested the Mayor of PERSON to clarify whether the ring road would be constructed and informed him about their difficult financial situation and unsuccessful attempts to sell part of their property to pay off their debts .", "On DATE the Mayor informed them that the construction of the ring road was not foreseen in the municipality investment plan . He further pointed out that due to the scale of the construction and the character of the ring road , its construction would most likely be financed from the budget of the regional governor or the Government . In those circumstances , the GPE \u2019s budget could not bear the expenses related to the acquisition of the ORG land .", "Subsequently , the applicants made an enquiry with ORG .", "On DATE they were informed that the construction of the ring road as part of the regional road no .

The owner could either ( CARDINAL ) claim compensation for the damage actually incurred , or ( CARDINAL ) claim that the property be acquired by the municipality , or ( CARDINAL ) that he / she be provided with an alternative property . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was the first provision in the post - war period which provided for some compensatory measures in favour of the owners of properties who were negatively affected by the local development plans . However , section DATE of the CARDINAL Act stipulated that those provisions would be applicable only in respect of those local development plans that were adopted after the Act entered into force ( i.e. DATE ) .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL LAW , the development plans adopted before the date of its entry into force were to expire on DATE at the latest .
