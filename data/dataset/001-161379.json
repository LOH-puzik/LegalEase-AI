ORG also examined GPE \u2019s personal circumstances and found that he was single , that his next of kin lived in GPE , that he did not have a family relationship with any NORP nationals , that he lived in a student hostel rather than in a rented flat , and that he had no resources to pay for HIV treatment .", "CARDINAL .

The claimant and his representative merely confirmed that they have a sexual relationship , which does not equate to social links .", "A threat to public health ... could result from the fact that the claimant has a registered place of residence and actually lives in a hostel , which is a public place ; this fact alone put the health of the other residents of the dormitory at risk because the claimant may use the same public facilities ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The request contained full personal details of V.V. The Prosecutor General sent the request to the local prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE . As it happened , Mr X was a former employee in that prosecutor \u2019s office . A prosecutor summonsed PERSON for an interview and put questions about the nature of his relationship with GPE , whether PERSON was still present in GPE , and where they lived . Law - enforcement officers also visited their neighbours and asked them how long GPE and PERSON had lived together and whether they had girlfriends .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a copy of a statement from a prosecutor in charge of human rights and federal law compliance , dated DATE , from which it appears that on DATE PERSON had been asked to attend the GPE regional prosecutor \u2019s office in his capacity as GPE \u2019s representative . He was interviewed about \u201c the exercise by PERSON of his labour , family and migration rights \u201d .

He refused to name ORG \u2019s partner or to say whether he was ORG \u2019s partner : in his capacity as ORG \u2019s representative he was not required to disclose any information about his own private life .
