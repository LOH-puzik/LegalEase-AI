This work led to her developing dysfunctions of the nervous system . In DATE she was declared to have a \u201c third degree disability \u201d and started receiving a disability pension .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant underwent CARDINAL medical reexaminations by the local ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the body competent to assess the level of disability . The medical examinations serve as a basis for the allocation of disability pensions .

On DATE the applicant underwent a new regular reexamination by the ORG . This time she was diagnosed with vegetative polyneuropathy of the upper extremities and myotendinosis . No mention was made of the other diseases diagnosed earlier , namely coxarthrosis , cervical spondylosis and radiculopathy . On that basis the ORG assessed the applicant \u2019s loss of ability to work at PERCENT , which was not sufficient to entitle her to a disability pension .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged this decision before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . After re - examining her , the ORG declared the applicant fully fit to work in a decision of DATE .

It found , on the basis of the expert \u2019s conclusions corroborated by the remaining documents in the case file , that the applicant \u2019s ability to work was reduced . The court concluded that the ORG had erroneously assessed the applicant \u2019s state of health by failing to consider all relevant elements to her actual state of health .

On that basis , on DATE the ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to it for further examination in accordance with the conclusions of the medical expertise accepted by the court in the case proceedings . The court found that the administrative body had erred when assessing the applicant \u2019s state of disability as it had not taken into account all the relevant circumstances . It considered the ORG \u2019s opinion that the applicant did not suffer from vegetative polyneuropathy unfounded and concluded that the ORG \u2019s decision was not based on the applicant \u2019s actual state of health . The court held , like in its judgment of DATE , that the ORG was exclusively competent to assess the percentage of disability .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the ORG , ORG upheld ORG judgment in a final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following that , in a decision of DATE the ORG assessed the applicant \u2019s reduced ability to work at PERCENT which did not entitle her to a disability pension . In the decision \u2019s entry \u201c occupational deceases \u201d , only vegetative polyneuropathy featured this time .
