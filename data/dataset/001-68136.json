At the time of enactment of LAW , no final court decisions had been given on the water district boundaries in the municipalities of ORG , ORG and ORG . Therefore , the existing specific rights to a fishing site , attached to real estates , were also unclear . For these reasons , the provisions of the DATE LAW remained in force for the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities .", "Thereafter , the decisions on the water district boundaries have become final and any specific fishing rights attached to real estates have been established . There are no longer any unsolved questions of ownership of water areas in respect of individual real estates , and therefore it is no longer necessary to apply the DATE LAW in the area in question .", "The state - owned fishing sites are of great importance for the local population in the municipalities of ORG , ORG and ORG . In the absence of decisions on the establishment of water district boundaries , there were unsolved questions in respect of the ownership of the water areas . Therefore , the inhabitants of the said municipalities had a possibility to fishing free of charge in the waters located in their municipalities of residence . In the proceedings for the establishment of water district boundaries , most of the waters were established as belonging to the state . Thus , the state also held the fishing rights attached to the waters , except for certain specific fishing rights . In order to provide for the possibilities of the local inhabitants to fish , it was provided in the decree implementing the DATE LAW , which entered into force in DATE , that the local inhabitants of the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities , who were carrying out professional fishing , fishing for personal purposes or other natural means of livelihood , had the right to obtain a fishing licence free of charge for fishing in the state - owned waters located in their municipalities of residence . The local inhabitants were also provided with a possibility to participate in decision - making concerning fishing and management of fish stock in respect of those waters , by means of setting up advisory boards for each of the CARDINAL municipalities . These advisory boards had , inter alia , the responsibility of reviewing fishing arrangements and principles concerning the issue of fishing licences . ORG , ORG , the fishing districts , the municipality and the local associations of professional fishermen appointed members to ORG . ...", "It is proposed that the possibility for the local inhabitants of ORG , ORG and ORG municipalities to fish in the state - owned waters be maintained . Therefore , the present proposal contains provisions which are currently included in a decree , concerning the right of the local inhabitants carrying out professional fishing , fishing for personal purposes or other traditional means of livelihood to fish free of charge in the state - owned waters ( LAW ) . ...", "The application of LAW in the municipalities of ORG , ORG and ORG does not remove or change the fishing rights that their inhabitants have in the state - owned waters which have an established legal basis , such as the basis of custom \" from time immemorial \" . Most of the local inhabitants carrying out traditional means of livelihood in the said municipalities represent the S\u00e1mi population . In order to secure the fishing rights of the local inhabitants carrying out professional fishing , fishing for personal purposes or other traditional means of livelihood , it is proposed that the LAW contain those provisions on the right to fish free of charge in the state - owned waters which are now included in a decree . Thus , the existing provisions would be included in an LAW of ORG instead of a decree , but the proposal does not intend to change the substance of the provisions .", "\u201c On different occasions ( opinions CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL ) ORG has found that local inhabitants of the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities , who have no titles to land , have such fishing rights as enjoy the protection of possessions guaranteed by the LAW .", "In the opinion given in DATE , ORG observed that \" the bill subject to debate , concerning fishing in the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities , entailed weakening of the traditional fishing rights of their residents who had no titles to land but who earned a significant part of their living from traditional means of livelihood , of whom most represented the PERSON population , as a licence would thereby be necessary for fishing and it would be subject to a charge . \" In the ORG 's view , the bill had to be considered in accordance with the procedure for the enactment of the LAW .", "The opinion given by LAW in DATE concerned the Government PERSON for the enactment of the CARDINAL LAW . The ORG drew attention to the fact that it was necessary to separately solve the unresolved questions concerning fishing in the northernmost municipalities without delay . Thereafter , the Law and ORG proposed that the fishing legislation - the DATE LAW - in force at the material time should remain in force for the said municipalities ( Report of ORG DATE ) . Thus , a provision based on that proposal , subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , was included in the new LAW .", "In DATE , the opinion of ORG concerned a Government Bill in which it was proposed , inter alia , that section subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW be repealed . On that occasion , the ORG was of the view that the bill entailing repealing of the said provision had to be discussed in accordance with the procedure provided for in section CARDINAL of LAW . The ORG further noted , referring to the ILO Convention No CARDINAL concerning ORG , adopted in DATE , that such an amendment should not be made even if it was made in accordance with the procedure applied to the enactment of the LAW . ...", "Extending the scope of application of LAW to concern the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities entails harmonisation of legislation which can be said to be in conformity with the principles enshrined in section CARDINAL of LAW and with the requirements of foreseeability . A general constitutional issue relating to the extension of the scope of application is the question of public fishing rights as a restriction on the enjoyment of possessions . Referring to earlier opinions , the ORG finds that in this regard the bill may be discussed in accordance with the procedure applied to the enactment of ordinary acts of ORG ( Opinions of the Constitutional Law Committee CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . ...", "Subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL means that the local inhabitants in the CARDINAL northernmost municipalities maintain their possibility to fish free of charge in the state - owned waters , based on custom . In the ORG 's view , this kind of a legislative measure conforms to the requirements attached to the protection of possessions based on custom \" from time immemorial \" and on an extensive right of enjoyment , which have been observed in earlier opinions of the ORG , concerning the traditional rights of inhabitants who do not have titles to land . For this reason , the ORG is of the view that the bill is also acceptable in the light of the provisions in section CARDINAL of LAW . As regards the status of the S\u00e1mi people , particularly in view of the provisions in subsection CARDINAL of section QUANTITY , the ORG has paid attention to the fact that fishing has been part of the traditional way of life of the PERSON without any restrictions as to their place of residence . Therefore , the ORG finds it important to clarify the last part of the provision in subsection CARDINAL of CARDINAL so that the fishing right is not only dependent on the place of residence but is valid in the areas of all CARDINAL northernmost municipalities where the person is resident in CARDINAL of them . ...", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides for the rights of minorities . For example in the light of the practice of ORG monitoring the implementation of the LAW , it may be observed that the exercise of fishing rights of the PERSON is part of their minority culture . The proposed amendment may not be considered to entail prevention of fishing as part of the PERSON culture in the sense of constituting a violation of LAW . In this respect , reference may be made to LAW , which is based on the premise that the permanent residents of the said municipalities have the right to obtain a fishing licence free of charge . ...", "The Government PERSON does not interfere with questions of ownership . The purpose of the proposed provisions is , inter alia , to establish the right of permanent residents of the municipalities of ORG , ORG and ORG to obtain a fishing licence free of charge for fishing in the state - owned waters , on certain conditions . The PERSON is not restricted to the PERSON as a population group but concerns all residents of the said municipalities . Apart from permanent residence , it is further required for the existence of such a right that the residents in question carry out professional fishing , fishing for personal purposes or other traditional means of livelihood . In the ORG 's view , these conditions are , however , of such a nature that they have relevance in particular for the PERSON . Therefore , it may be observed that the PERSON partly contributes to the protection of the right of the PERSON to use the water areas in question . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
