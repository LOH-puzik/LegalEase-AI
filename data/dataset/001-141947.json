GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently serving a life sentence in PERSON prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested after he had shot his wife , PERSON , who had recently left him , and injured CARDINAL bystanders . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant of murder and negligent bodily injury and sentenced him to life imprisonment . He has been imprisoned ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG determined that the applicant \u2019s guilt was not of \u201c particular gravity \u201d pursuant to LAW ( a ) of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , implying that the degree of the applicant \u2019s guilt did not require an execution of DATE of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant served his sentence in a semi - custodial regime ( offener Vollzug ) . On DATE this privilege was withdrawn after preliminary investigations were initiated against the applicant who was suspected of having , in DATE , while on prison leave , caused bodily harm to a female acquaintance , PERSON , by using an electric truncheon . On DATE ORG acquitted him of these charges on factual grounds without giving any further written reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as an execution of sentence chamber ( PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the remainder of his sentence and to release him on probation . The chamber considered that the criminal proceedings before ORG had failed sufficiently to clarify the facts of the incident of DATE . Having heard evidence by witnesses , the chamber noted that the applicant had started a sexual relationship with PERSON , who was married , in DATE . When PERSON decided to terminate the relationship in DATE , the applicant had threatened to tell her husband and children about her extramarital relationship . Based on testimony given by several witnesses , the chamber was further convinced that the applicant had attacked PERSON in the evening of DATE . The chamber considered that the applicant \u2019s submissions that he had not been in GPE at the time of the alleged incident lacked credibility .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the prognostic decision , the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG is convinced that a serious danger still emanates from [ the applicant ] for other ORG lives and limbs . The established facts disclose remarkable similarities to the crime against PERSON The convict knew both women from his youth ... Irrespective of the qualification of the incident under criminal law \u2013 which is irrelevant for the prognostic decision at hand DATE both incidents were preceded by a long period of time during which the perpetrator and the victim were deeply involved on an emotional level . The convict made elaborate plans for the future with both women , which ended in disappointment , and both women decided to leave him for another man ... The convict was unable to take a clear stance in respect of the separation from both women . He oscillated between aggressive acts and menacing behaviour on the CARDINAL side and pleadings on the other . In both cases , his behaviour followed the same pattern : it started with rather low - key aggression , which escalated during the course of the crisis which was marked by serious feelings of mortification .... Now and then he threatened the women with violence and displayed suicidal tendencies ... PERSON might not yet have been in serious danger , as the convict had still been able to set himself limits . However , the ORG has very serious doubts whether he will remain able to respect these limits in the future . \u201d", "The ORG further observed that the psychological expert Prof PERSON , in an expert report prepared on DATE , had given the applicant a favourable legal prognosis . However , these findings had become obsolete in view of the freshly established events . The ORG finally considered that the fact that the applicant had been acquitted in the criminal proceedings before ORG did not prevent the execution of sentence chamber from making its own assessment of the relevant facts , as ORG had failed sufficiently to examine those facts in a convincing way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . That court considered that the principle of presumption of innocence did not prevent the execution of sentence chamber from examining on its own motion those facts that were relevant for its prognostic decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . On DATE , the applicant lodged an application with ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which he complained about his continued detention . On DATE , a ORG of CARDINAL judges declared this application inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant lodged CARDINAL further requests for the stay of execution of the remainder of the sentence , which were likewise rejected by the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant has again enjoyed relaxed conditions of detention ( Vollzugslockerungen ) , like accompanied outings and therapy . Further relaxed conditions of detention were not granted because on CARDINAL DATE ORG objected to the prison authority \u2019s proposal in this regard .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , sitting as an execution of sentence chamber , and after having heard the applicant , rejected his request for a suspension of his sentence on probation . The court found that there was no real chance that the applicant would not reoffend if released . This finding was based on the psychiatric expert report submitted by Prof PERSON on DATE , which had found that the applicant continued to be dangerous . ORG further found as follows :", "\u201c On the other hand , it has to be taken into account that the expert detected risk factors in the convict \u2019s personality which make it difficult to come to an unconditionally positive social and legal prognosis ... [ The expert found ] that these risk factors derived on the one hand from the fact that the convict had failed to deal with his offence , had not admitted any guilt and had not shown sympathy for his victims . In the expert \u2019s view , he displayed a massive infantile egocentricity which was reflected in distinctive cantankerousness . While it was true that this would not necessarily lead to the commission of further criminal offences , the criminal offence that the applicant had committed to the detriment of PERSON showed that the applicant was willing to enter into relationships with women once more and that a separation would lead to violent acts for reasons of wounded pride . His problem was that he was incapable of dealing either with his own weaknesses or with his catastrophic actions and that he could not take a mature , adult stance towards them \u201d .", "( \u201c Anderenfalls war hierbei jedoch zu ber\u00fccksichtigen , dass auch nach den NORP des Gutachters in der Person des Verurteilten Risikofaktoren festgestellt ORG , die eine uneingeschr\u00e4nkt positive Sozial- und Legalprognose ... erschweren . PERSON ergeben sich zum einen daraus , dass PERSON nach der QUANTITY LOC auseinandergesetzt hat und weder seine eigene NORP einger\u00e4umt noch Mitleid mit den Opfern gezeigt hat . Bei ihm besteht nach Auffassung des Sachverst\u00e4ndigen eine massive infantile Egozentrik , die sich in einer ausgepr\u00e4gten PERSON widerspiegelt . PERSON f\u00fchre dies nicht notwendig zur Begehung weiterer Straftaten . LOC zeige die PERSON zum PERSON der PERSON , dass PERSON geneigt und imstande sei , wieder PERSON einzugehen und dass es bei Trennungen zu Gewalttaten aus gekr\u00e4nkter PERSON komme . Seine Problematik bestehe darin , dass er au\u03b2erstande sei , sich PERSON , aber auch PERSON katastrophalen ORG auseinanderzusetzen und diesen gegen\u00fcber einen reifen , erwachsenen PERSON . \u201c )", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that there was no need to obtain further expert reports . It observed , in this context , that it was part of the expert \u2019s task to assess a factual situation from a medical point of view in order to deliver the requested prognostic assessment . The court observed that the risk associated with a suspension of the sentence on probation could only be taken once it was clear that the applicant would adhere to the norms and once his conduct had been tested for some time in the framework of relaxed conditions of detention , in particular in a semi - custodial regime . In this context , the court also welcomed that the applicant was now cooperating and it was thus envisioned to start individual therapy in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed against ORG decision . He submitted , inter alia , that he had not received ORG observations ORG had referred to in its decision and that his rights under LAW were violated because ORG had based its decision on the alleged incident with PERSON , even though he had been acquitted of all charges in this respect . He further maintained that the decision could not be based on the lack of relaxed conditions of detention ; otherwise , the court had an obligation to ensure that appropriate measures were taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . ORG based its decision on the expert report , recalling the expert \u2019s findings , inter alia , that the murder of his wife and the incident with PERSON , as referred to in previous decisions of ORG and of ORG , showed that with regard to women the applicant thought he could execute his own \u201c law \u201d at his discretion . He still did not accept his own weaknesses and did not have a plan on how to avoid or deal with critical situations in the future . Referring to its previous decisions of DATE , ORG concluded that the circumstances had not changed to a decisive degree . The murder of his wife was not triggered by the environment , but by the applicant \u2019s personality . Since the criminogenic structure of his personality remained unchanged , the fact that the applicant \u2019s conduct was non - objectionable was only of minor prognostic relevance .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that it had been legitimate for the execution of sentence chamber to investigate on its own motion the incident with PERSON , since this was relevant for the prognosis . Therefore , the expert was allowed to base his prognostic assessment on the execution of sentence chamber \u2019s findings in this respect . According to ORG , which referred to its prior decisions , this did not constitute a violation of the presumption of innocence . Having regard to the persistent danger that the applicant committed further violent acts in situations which could be compared to the original offence , ORG considered that it was not justifiable to take the risk of suspending the further execution of the life sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted a constitutional complaint . He raised in particular the issue of presumption of innocence and further alleged that his right to be heard had been violated since he had not received the prosecution \u2019s observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG declared the complaint inadmissible for non - exhaustion of prior remedies on the grounds that the applicant had failed to lodge a motion to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to be heard on the grounds that the applicant and his counsel had been informed about the content of the public prosecutor \u2019s statement and of the prison authority \u2019s submissions during a hearing . Furthermore , the prison authority \u2019s submissions had been served on the applicant \u2019s counsel for comments on DATE . On DATE , ORG , relying on the same grounds , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s fresh complaint lodged on DATE against the decisions given by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE for adjudication without giving any further reasons . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to order the applicant \u2019s probationary release and , at the same time , instigated fresh proceedings on the review of the applicant \u2019s continued detention . On DATE ORG confirmed .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the applicant underwent therapy . He was granted prison leave to attend therapy lessons . As from DATE the applicant was additionally granted CARDINAL or CARDINAL prison leaves DATE .
