The applicant gave evidence before the delegates that he had been beaten on DATE after the visit from his parents on DATE . During that visit , he had said to his parents that he had been beaten and called a beast . The applicant \u2019s parents stated before the delegates that they had been told by their son on DATE that he had been beaten and humiliated .

The Commission considered that the applicant \u2019s account contained a number of details and elements which it would not have expected to find in a fabricated story . It noted , however , that there was no record of any occurrence connected to the ill - treatment described by the applicant . The ORG accepted that the applicant may have been afraid to complain or to write to anyone , as he said . However , it accepted this argument with difficulty , having regard to the fact that he had not been scared when he had told his parents on DATE that he had been beaten . Moreover , the prison psychiatrist saw him on DATE and had not recorded any problems regarding his state of health or any injuries . The ORG added that the medical report of DATE , which the applicant had signed , concluded that he did not show any signs of having been beaten and that his state of health was satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . The Commission further noted that the applicant had signed a written statement on DATE to the effect that he had been treated properly by the prison authorities , that no physical violence had been used against him , that all disciplinary measures imposed on him had been justified and that his GPE complaints had not been substantiated . It took into account the fact that , before the delegates , the applicant had denied the contents of his statement , and pointed out that the practice of the prison authorities to require an inmate to confirm in writing that he had been treated properly by prison officers gave rise to suspicion .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s GPE submission before the delegates that , after the alleged beatings and torture on DATE , he had been transferred to ORG TIME of CARDINAL DATE and had been placed in the intensive care unit where he had been given a blood transfusion , the ORG observed that , although the applicant had maintained that he had been beaten after his GPE visit on DATE , he had denied that he had been transferred to hospital .

The Commission found that there was no medical or other material evidence establishing that the applicant had sustained injury as a result of ill - treatment by prison officers in GPE FAC , as he had alleged . It had regard to the fact that the applicant had denied that he had been beaten before CARDINAL September CARDINAL and had been transferred to hospital after that date , and that the absence of any use of force by prison officers on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE had been supported by the oral statements of the witnesses heard by its delegates . The Commission therefore found it impossible to establish , beyond reasonable doubt , that the applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment in prison as he had alleged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s parents sent a complaint to the regional prosecutor on DATE , claiming , inter alia , that they had become aware that the applicant had been beaten and humiliated by prison officers .

During the delegates\u2019 visit on CARDINAL and DATE , the cell had been overheated , particularly in comparison with other rooms in the prison . The light was on TIME a day and the central radio was switched off at TIME . The inmates were frequently observed by prison warders through a spy hole in the door of the cell , which deprived them of any kind of privacy . The cell was freshly painted , from which the inference might be drawn that conditions had been worse prior to the delegates\u2019 visit . The ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s evidence that DATE there had been no tap or washbasin in his cell , but only a small pipe on the wall near the toilet , that the water supply could only be turned on from the corridor , that the walls were covered with faeces and that the bucket for flushing the toilet had been taken away .

In its report ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , the ORG expressed at the outset its serious concern about the conditions under which these prisoners were being held and about the regime applied to them . It was noted that prisoners sentenced to death were usually accommodated CARDINAL to a cell , the cell measuring CARDINAL to QUANTITY m. The cells had no access to natural light , the windows being obscured by metal plates . The artificial lighting , which was permanently on , was not always sufficiently strong with the result that some cells were dim . To ventilate the cells , prisoners could pull a cord that opened a flap . Despite this , the cells were very damp and quite cold ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The equipment in the cells was described in the report as being rudimentary , consisting of a metal bed and/or sleeping platform ( fitted with a thin mattress , sheets of dubious cleanliness and a blanket which was manifestly insufficient to keep out the cold ) , a shelf and CARDINAL narrow stools . Prisoners were supposed to be able to listen to radio programmes via a speaker built into the wall of the cell , but the delegation had been told that the radio only functioned sporadically ( ibid . ) .", "All the cells had non - partitioned toilets which faced the living area ; as a result , a prisoner using the toilet had to do so in full view of his cellmate . As regards toiletries , prisoners sentenced to death were in a situation as difficult as that of many of the other inmates ; items such as soap and toothpaste were scarce ( ibid . ) .", "It was further recorded that prisoners sentenced to death had no form of activity outside their cells , not even an hour of outdoor exercise . At best they could leave their cells once DATE to use the shower in the cell - block , and for TIME once a month if they were authorised to receive family visits . In - cell activities consisted of reading and listening to the radio when it worked . Apart from the monthly visits which some inmates received , human contact was limited essentially to the occasional visit by an NORP priest or a member of the health - care staff , who spoke to the prisoners through a grille in the cell door ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG summarised its findings as follows ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c In short , prisoners sentenced to death were locked up for TIME a day in cells which offered only a very restricted amount of living space and had no access to natural light and sometimes very meagre artificial lighting , with virtually no activities to occupy their time and very little opportunity for human contact . Most of them had been kept in such deleterious conditions for considerable periods of time ( ranging from DATE to over DATE ) . Such a situation may be fully consistent with the legal provisions in force in GPE concerning the treatment of prisoners sentenced to death . However , this does not alter the fact that , in the ORG \u2019s opinion , it amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d", "It was further recorded that the delegation had received numerous complaints from prisoners sentenced to death about the fact that they lacked information with regard to their legal situation ( the progress of their cases , follow - up to applications for cases to be reviewed , examination of their complaints , etc . ) ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
