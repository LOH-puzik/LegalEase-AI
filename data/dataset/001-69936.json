They are also elected representatives of their respective local fishing co - operative ( kalastuskunta , fiskelag ) or association for joint ownership ( jakokunta , osakaskunta ; samf\u00e4llighet , del\u00e4garlag ) .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE and in application of ORG ( kalastuss\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6 , fiskestadgan ) for LOC ( ORG / ORG \u00e4lv ) Area , the NORP - Swedish ORG ( suomalais - ruotsalainen rajajokikomissio , finsk - svenska gr\u00e4ns\u00e4lvskommissionen ) prohibited inter alia all fishing of salmon and sea trout in the relevant waters in the open sea during DATE and DATE . Fishing other species in the relevant sea area with fixed equipment was prohibited during the periods CARDINAL May-CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL May-CARDINAL DATE . ORG further prohibited all fishing of salmon and sea trout in the river area , except for fishing with hand - held equipment which was authorised on DATE during the period CARDINAL May-CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL May-CARDINAL DATE . With some minor exceptions , all fishing in the river area was prohibited during the periods CARDINAL September-CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE 's decision was announced publicly on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Fishing Regulation was issued following the enactment of Act no . CARDINAL incorporating the NORP - Swedish Frontier Rivers Agreement ( as far as GPE was concerned ) . A subsequent agreement to amend Annex B of the Agreement was incorporated into NORP law by Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , entitling ORG to decide on the protection of a particular fish species or on the prohibition or restriction of fishing with equipment which had proved harmful for the species either in the entire fishing area or in a specific part thereof , provided such a measure was deemed necessary for the preservation of the species in question for a maximum period of DATE at a time ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Regulation ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants indicated at paragraph CARDINAL(x . ) above received FIM CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in compensation paid out of the supplementary ORG budget for DATE with a view to covering economic losses which they suffered during the DATE due to the restrictions imposed by ORG . The relevant Government decision ( no . CARDINAL ) was applicable to professional fishermen fishing in the sea area adjacent to the ORG river .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG ( h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) dismissed charges concerning fishing in violation of the prohibition which ORG had imposed on fishing with certain equipment . ORG held that the ORG 's order issued by virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of ORG could not be applied , since LAW had not been brought into force and implemented as required by LAW , namely by LAW ( decision No . DB CARDINAL ; ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At DATE GPE and GPE declared that certain provisions of ORG , including section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Regulation , should not be applied .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter GPE enacted GPE in LOC ( CARDINAL ) which entered into force on DATE . The LAW entitles ORG to issue rules concerning fishing on the NORP side of the ORG river . A decision to that effect ( CARDINAL ) entered into force at the same time as the LAW . The decision was essentially identical to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . In DATE the ORG issued a new decision ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG ( GPE ) found that the sections of LAW concerning prohibited fishing equipment and applicable sanctions fell within the scope of the legislation . As Annex B ( containing LAW ) had been brought into force by a Decree , ORG decided not to apply certain sections of the LAW by virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( NORP hallitusmuoto , PERSON f\u00f6r GPE , CARDINAL ) which was in force at the material time ( decisions CARDINAL . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) dismissed a request lodged by , among others , the associations represented by applicants listed at paragraph CARDINAL . ) above , and whereby they sought to have ORG decision of DATE annulled . The associations had argued that the decision was contrary to the LAW and ordinary law ( including LAW as incorporated ) . Furthermore , the Commission had allegedly failed to hear the associations in a matter affecting the civil rights both of individual owners of fishing waters and of fishermen entitled to the continued enjoyment of the compensation in natura which had been awarded by ORG in DATE . The applicants did not request an oral hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions to ORG had stated , inter alia , that it was hardly for an organ established by a bilateral agreement to examine whether LAW contravened LAW . The fishing restriction addressed in the annulment request had been imposed of ORG own motion after it had afforded the known parties an opportunity to comment in writing on the fishing restrictions proposed by the NORP and the NORP expert whom ORG was regularly consulting . According to the dispatching list , all those who had sought an annulment \u2013 except for the ORG association for joint ownership ( the applicants at paragraph CARDINAL(ix . ) above ) DATE had been so consulted and had also commented on the proposal . The nature of the matter had not been such that an oral hearing could have been expected to further the examination thereof .", "ORG further opined that the prohibition in question had only concerned salmon and trout and had been consistent with the restriction imposed simultaneously in respect of the NORP coastal waters . Moreover , as the ORG 's decision of DATE was to be considered administrative in nature , LAW did not provide for any ordinary appeal against it , nor for any extraordinary remedy .", "CARDINAL . ORG had also obtained opinions on the annulment request from ORG and ORG . The applicants had commented on the aforementioned CARDINAL opinions .", "CARDINAL . In its decision ORG held :", "\" The Frontier Rivers Agreement between GPE and GPE , annex B of it being LAW for the LOC fishing area , has been incorporated by law no CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "Article CARDINAL of chapter CARDINAL of ORG ordains that , unless there are other special provisions in the LAW , the applicable law in each ORG is the law in force in that ORG . With regard to the above , the national LAW is applicable where LOC does not contain special provisions on fishing .", "According to paragraph CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , the LAW and the LAW issued on the basis of the LAW are applied also to waters located at the frontier of a ORG , unless there are provisions stating otherwise that are based on a contract with another ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ordains , that when an international agreement binding on GPE or the preservation of fish stocks so requires , a decree can be used to bring into force provisions regarding the fishing or catching of seafood by NORP nationals outside NORP waters . On the basis of subsection CARDINAL of the same paragraph the decree may also , if an agreement referred to in subsection CARDINAL so requires or for another reason , contain provisions regarding restrictions on catching within or outside NORP waters .", "A subsection CARDINAL has been added to paragraph CARDINAL of ORG for the LOC area on the basis of an agreement with GPE , incorporated with decree no PERSON , amending annex B of ORG . According to subsection CARDINAL , ORG may protect by law a species of fish or limit the use of a trap that has proven harmful , either for the entire fishing area or a part of it , if this is necessary for preserving the species in question , for DATE at a time . With regard to the above - mentioned paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , the said addition of subsection CARDINAL to paragraph CARDINAL of ORG could be brought into force with a decree .", "It appears from the documents that a reply to the proposal by ORG concerning fishing restrictions for DATE and DATE was submitted in writing on DATE by inter alia the FAC fishing association , the NORP fishing association , the ORG fishing association , which on the basis of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW acts as legal representative in matters concerning the LOC area and the common special prerogative , as well as by the NORP fishing association and certain other associations . Considering the fact that the decision of ORG was issued on DATE , all the applicants for annulment have been aware of the pending project and have had the opportunity to make known their opinions on the matter before it was decided .", "LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ordains , that if building in the waterways causes the fish or fishing apparent harm , the permit - holder should be charged with the duty to take action to prevent or reduce damage to the fish and fishing as well as , if needed , to monitor the results of his action in the water area where damage has also been done ( fish preservation duty ) . Such action may consist , according to the nature of the building and its effects , inter alia of planting fish stocks . According to chapter CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINALa subsection CARDINAL the same duty may be imposed on the holder of a permit .", "The purpose of the above - mentioned fish preservation duty is not primarily to ensure certain amounts of catch , but to ensure the preservation of stocks of fish , which has also been the aim of the decision by ORG concerning the prohibition on the fishing of salmon and trout . The decision of ORG does not invalidate the aim of restocking obligations in the way presented in the annulment application . The purpose of the decision is to strengthen fish stocks and thus ensure fishing opportunities in the future . The decision of ORG can not on the grounds specified in the annulment application be held to be contrary to LAW .", "On the basis of the above , the decision sought to be annulled is not based on manifestly incorrect application of the law or a ( procedural ) error that might have fundamentally affected the decision . Neither does the application contain any other annulment ground mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . \"", "CARDINAL . Informal negotiations between GPE and GPE on further amendments to the Agreement began in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered the ORG to compensate fishermen for economic losses suffered as a result of the fishing restrictions imposed in the LOC river area on the basis of ORG at the time when it had been implemented by a Government Decree delegating to ORG , without a basis in an ORG , the power to restrict fishing ( case no . T CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , as in force up to DATE , everyone was to be equal before the law and his or her property was to be protected ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . A judge or other official was under an obligation not to apply a provision in a Decree which conflicted with constitutional or other laws of ORG ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . The LAW has been incorporated into NORP law by an ORG with the status of ordinary law ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW anyone who had suffered an infringement of his rights , or damage , through an illegal act or negligence on the part of a civil servant was entitled to demand that the civil servant be convicted and held liable for damages , or to report him for the purpose of having charges brought ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . A similar provision appears in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . LAW ( \u201c Basic rights and liberties \u201d ) of LAW was amended by Act no . CARDINAL which entered into force on DATE . The new LAW includes , inter alia , the right to property ( section CARDINAL ; as from DATE section CARDINAL ) and has been incorporated as such into LAW . Under LAW a court of law shall give primacy to a provision therein , if the application of a provision of ordinary law would be in evident conflict with LAW . If a provision in a Decree or any other statute of lower rank than an Act of Parliament is in conflict with the LAW or ordinary law , that provision shall not be applied by a court of law or any other public authority ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( vahingonkorvauslaki , skadest\u00e5ndslag CARDINAL ) proceedings for damages may be initiated against the ORG on the basis of its vicarious liability for mistakes or omissions in the exercise of public authority . The ORG 's vicarious liability comes into play only if the responsible official fails in his or her duty to take a measure or perform a task that could reasonably be required in the light of the nature and purpose of the activity in question ( Chapters CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The claim for damages must be made within DATE from the date when the damage occurred , unless a shorter limitation period applies ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL of ORG , a decision may be annulled if a procedural error which may have had a relevant effect on the decision has been committed , if the decision is based on a manifestly erroneous application of law or on an error which may have had a fundamental effect on the decision , or if new evidence which could have had a relevant effect on the decision appears and it is not the fault of the applicant that the evidence was not presented in time .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , the holder of a construction permit relating to a water area may , if the construction would clearly damage the fish stocks , be ordered to restock the area and take other necessary measures in order to safeguard the fish stocks in the affected waters ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A claim concerning a measure alleged to be in violation of LAW and whereby it is sought to have such a measure prohibited , the previous conditions re - established or damage compensated , may be lodged with the competent water court ( chapter DATE , section DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The general right to fish in public water areas and within the NORP fishing zone does not include the right to fish salmon and sea trout ( see , for example , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Restrictions on fishing within or outside the territorial waters of GPE may be imposed by decree for the purpose of fulfilling obligations set in an international agreement binding on GPE , for safeguarding fish stocks or for any other comparable special reason . Domestic law applies to watercourses located in frontier areas , unless otherwise agreed on in an agreement between GPE and another ORG ( section QUANTITY ) . Non - compliance with a fishing restriction may be subject to prosecution ( sections CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A ORG concerning fishing legislation ( no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) suggested , in DATE , that limited rights in rem be abolished . However , in the Government PERSON for a new LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) , it was suggested that these rights of the ORG be maintained as being relevant for the protection of the salmon stocks . The provisions concerning the ORG 's fishing waters and fishing rights can now be found in chapter CARDINAL of the Fishing Decree ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ( vesiylioikeus , vatten\u00f6verdomstolen ) found that since time immemorial the owners of fishing waters in the Kemi river ( ORG ) and its estuary had been engaged in the fishing of salmon and sea trout without any state interference and with its de facto consent . Compensation for the loss of fishing benefits resulting from permitted construction should therefore be awarded to all individuals who had been engaged in such fishing in the area , provided they had been using legal fishing gear . ORG further found that the ORG too was entitled to compensation for the permanent loss of the use of its limited right in rem in respect of the fishing waters . In addition , compensation was awarded to the ORG for its loss of income from leasing out those waters .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) found in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( no . DATE ) that the damage which a company had caused by setting up timber floating routes in the PERSON river ( GPE , GPE \u00e4lv ) had engendered effects on private owners of water areas , causing them losses which were to be compensated by virtue of LAW . The ORG , which traditionally had the right to fish salmon in the river , had not used that right for DATE , either by leasing out its waters or in any other way .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) ORG upheld a decision of ORG of DATE which had dismissed various fishery associations ' claims for compensation for the allegedly failed restocking of the estuary of the Kemi river as ordered on DATE . ORG had found that the defendants had complied with the obligations imposed on them in DATE for the purpose of safeguarding the relevant fish stocks . In such circumstances the defendants could not be held responsible for the diminution in catches for which compensation had been sought .", "CARDINAL . In its precedent no . CARDINAL ORG examined an action for damages which a hydro - electric power company had brought against the ORG on the ground that a contract between the CARDINAL with a view to establishing CARDINAL power plants along the GPE river ( GPE , PERSON \u00e4lv ) could not be implemented in full , as ORG had enacted legislation for the protection of the river ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The company had sought compensation for wasted planning costs in so far as those had exceeded the amount paid out following the assessment procedure provided for in the LAW on ORG and Special Rights ( PERSON ) . ORG declined to examine this part of the claim as the costs to be compensated had already been finally determined in the procedure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the company had claimed compensation for projected profit and related losses , ORG dismissed the action after having examined its merits . ORG reasoned , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... The contract did not bind the legislative arm . Possible legislative changes and the possibility that no construction permit would be granted were specifically taken into account in the contract . The Government is therefore under no obligation to compensate for the economic losses suffered by the company due to the fact that the contract for the construction of the power plant was never implemented . The company is therefore not entitled to any compensation ... other than that stipulated in the [ specific LAW on the protection of the river ] . ... \u201d", "An account of domestic law can also be found in the ORG 's judgment in GPE and PERSON v.
