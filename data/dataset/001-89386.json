On DATE the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of committing an offence . On DATE he was charged with CARDINAL counts of theft , CARDINAL count of attempted theft and CARDINAL count of robbery . Most of the charges concerned offences committed jointly with others . He remained in custody until DATE , when he was released on bail .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG indicted the applicant , Mr NORP and Mr D.D. in relation to CARDINAL thefts and CARDINAL robbery . On an unspecified date CARDINAL of the victims of the offences joined the proceedings as a civil claimant .", "CARDINAL . After a trial , in a judgment of DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged , sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , and ordered him to pay damages to the civil claimant . The court did not make an order for the applicant \u2019s detention pending appeal . It did not immediately give the reasons for its judgment ; they were made available in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel appealed to ORG . Since at that point she did not yet have the reasons for GPE ORG judgment , she submitted in general that the applicant \u2019s conviction was unlawful and unfounded and asked it to be quashed . She also argued that his sentence was excessive and requested that it be revoked or suspended . She said that she would provide further particulars and indicate the evidence to be gathered as soon as the reasons for the GPE ORG judgment became available . As required under LAW of LAW , the appeal was lodged through GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG briefly noted that the appeal did not meet the requirements of LAW and , without indicating the specific deficiencies , directed the applicant to submit a rectified appeal within DATE . The applicant was notified of the court \u2019s ruling on DATE , but did not react . Accordingly , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . Neither the applicant , nor his counsel was notified of this and did not seek to appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In line with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , upon the expiry of the DATE time - limit for appealing against the decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence were considered final and therefore enforceable . On DATE he was detained in FAC for the purpose of serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel appealed to ORG against GPE decision of DATE . She argued that the appeal against the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence had been in line with all legal requirements . She stressed that the applicant had not been required to give detailed grounds of appeal , as ORG had not made available the reasons for its judgment within the timelimit for lodging an appeal . Finally , she asked the court to rule rapidly , as the applicant was in custody serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent this appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL hearings listed by ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively were adjourned : the first because the applicant had not been properly summoned and , although legally represented , did not appear in person , and the second because his co - accused and the civil claimant , despite being duly summoned , failed to attend .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing which took place on DATE the ORG found that there was no need to involve the applicant \u2019s coaccused and the civil claimant in the proceedings relating to the propriety of the GPE ORG decision to dismiss his appeal against conviction and sentence . It further held that this appeal had been in line with legal requirements and that ORG had erred by dismissing it . Moreover , its decision to do so did not indicate in what respects the appeal had been deficient . The court therefore quashed this decision and referred the case back to GPE for further consideration of the appeal against the conviction and sentence . With that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were restored and his conviction and sentence were no longer considered final .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at the same hearing his counsel asked ORG to consider whether he should remain in custody or be released . The court declined to do so , saying that it was for GPE to decide on this matter .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel filed with ORG and GPE ORG several requests for release , none of which was examined .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel also met CARDINAL times with the president of ORG , who explained that the judge to whom the case had been assigned was absent . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel filed a complaint with ORG , but received no reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent the case file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG set the applicant \u2019s appeal down for examination . Apparently , at this point the president of the panel to which the case had been assigned noticed that the applicant was still in custody . For this reason , on DATE , DATE , she alerted ORG that , following the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence were no longer considered final , and that he could not be kept in custody pursuant to them . On DATE the Sofia ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release , citing the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this order was received by FAC and the applicant was set free . It appears that until DATE of the criminal proceedings against him the applicant was not further remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG acquitted the applicant of the charges concerning CARDINAL of the thefts and upheld the remainder of the GPE ORG judgment . It imposed a global sentence of CARDINAL and a half years\u2019 imprisonment . In determining the length of the applicant \u2019s period of imprisonment in pursuance of this sentence it deducted , by reference to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the time he had already spent in custody DATE and DATE , saying that during this period the applicant had been serving a sentence which had not yet been made final .", "CARDINAL .
