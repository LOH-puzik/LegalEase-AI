This declaration establishes that the scheme is in the public interest . The expropriation liability order subsequently made by the ORG identifies the property to be expropriated and ends the administrative stage of the expropriation .", "The next step in the procedure is for the expropriating authority to forward the expropriation liability order , within DATE of its publication , to the judicial authority for expropriation matters , a judge of the ordinary court , failing which it will lapse .", "CARDINAL . ORG The second stage takes place before the expropriations judge . He alone has the power to order expropriation and assess compensation . He does not , however , have competence to assess the lawfulness of the steps taken by the administrative authority . On receipt of the expropriation liability order that has been forwarded to him , he will issue an expropriation order transferring ownership to the expropriating authority and depriving the former owner of the right to dispose of his property . The former owner , however , retains the use of it as a provisional occupier until compensation for the loss of possession is paid or , in the event of a dispute , deposited .", "The proceedings for issuing the expropriation order are separate from those leading to the judicial assessment of the expropriation compensation ; they are generally conducted entirely by the expropriating administrative authority .

ORG Anyone affected by an expropriation that enables a scheme in the public interest to be carried out may challenge the validity of the public - interest declaration in the administrative court within DATE of its publication . Appeals against expropriation liability orders must be brought within the same time . As a prefectoral decision to open a public - interest inquiry is seen as a purely preliminary measure , its lawfulness may only be challenged in conjunction with CARDINAL of those CARDINAL remedies .

These appeals do not have a suspensive effect and do not prevent possession being taken of the expropriated property .", "Lastly , if the compensation has not been either paid or deposited by the expropriating authority within DATE of the decision whereby it was assessed , the person expropriated may seek review of it by the expropriations judge .", "CARDINAL .
