He had a history of mental disorders and of alcohol and drug addiction , and since DATE had spent several periods in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in ORG : from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE ; from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ; from CARDINAL to DATE ; from DATE ; from CARDINAL DATE ; from DATE to DATE ; and from DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON \u2019s clinical records , in DATE doctors told the applicant that she should seek an order for her son \u2019s compulsory confinement . During his hospitalisation in DATE the doctor treating PERSON instructed that he must not be permitted to leave the unit in which he was hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . During CARDINAL of the periods he spent in hospital , PERSON was authorised to spend DATE at home with his family DATE during the period from DATE to DATE , and CARDINAL weekends during the period from DATE . During those CARDINAL periods , PERSON also escaped from the ORG premises several times and sometimes went to the applicant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was voluntarily admitted to the ORG , upon medical advice , because he had attempted to commit suicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON went home for DATE to spend GPE with the applicant and other members of his family , despite the reluctance of the doctor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant took PERSON to the emergency ward of ORG because he had drunk a large amount of alcohol . According to the observation record completed by the emergency services , PERSON had behaved recklessly during DATE because he had got drunk . They added that although PERSON had a history of mental weakness , depressive episodes and recurrent suicide attempts , those characteristics had not been observed DATE . PERSON was subsequently sent back to the same HSC ward in which he was hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was kept under medical observation for the whole day . He was given medication and his state of health improved . He got up to dine and to welcome visiting family members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital staff noted that TIME PERSON \u2019s behaviour had been calm and he had been walking around the unit in which he had been hospitalised . He had had lunch and an afternoon snack .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant called the hospital . She was told to call back later , during the afternoon snack , as her son was not inside the building at that time . She was assured that TIME he had been standing at the door and he looked fine .", "CARDINAL . At TIME it was noticed that PERSON had not appeared for dinner , and a nurse informed the head nurse of his absence . The hospital staff then initiated searches in the areas of the ORG premises where patients were allowed to walk around freely , such as the cafeteria and the park .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the coordinating nurse ( enfermeiro coordenador ) telephoned the applicant and told her that PERSON had not shown up for dinner .", "CARDINAL .

It is not known at what time PERSON left the hospital LOC and followed a footpath towards the applicant \u2019s house . At QUANTITY he committed suicide by jumping in front of a train near the ORG LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil action with ORG do ORG ) against the ORG under LAW ( a\u00e7\u00e3o de responsabilidade civil extracontratual por ato de gest\u00e3o p\u00fablica ) , seeking pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that her son had been treated at the ORG for mental disorders on several occasions ; the first actual hospitalisation had been in DATE . He had been admitted to the hospital on DATE because he had attempted to commit suicide . The fact that her son had been able to leave the hospital LOC on DATE during his hospitalisation had led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties . Because of his suicide attempts and mental condition , her son should have been under medical supervision and the hospital staff should have prevented him from leaving the hospital premises . She further claimed that the ORG should have erected fencing around the boundaries of its LOC in order to prevent patients from leaving . The fact that those duties had not been complied with reflected the poor organisation of the ORG services . Lastly , she argued that the ORG lacked a mechanism for checking the presence of patients and an emergency procedure capable of detecting a patient \u2019s absence , which would allow the hospital to take the measures required to ensure that patients returned safely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court gave a preliminary decision ( despacho saneador ) , specifying which facts were considered to be established and which remained to be established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered that an expert report be drawn up on PERSON \u2019s clinical condition and the supervision measures required by that condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychiatrist appointed by ORG ) submitted his report , the relevant parts of which read :", "\u201c ...", "Although alcohol dependence was the predominant diagnosis , several other diagnoses were considered . In particular , dependent personality ( personalidade dependente ) ; delirious outbreaks ( surto delirante ) ; schizophrenia ; manic - depressive psychosis ( psicose man\u00edaco - depressiva ) ...", "PERSON \u2019s clinical history enables us to consider him an ill person with recurring relapses in excessive alcohol consumption ... but also another kind of symptomatology ...", "...", "There is no detailed reference in his clinical records to his psychopathological condition on DATE ...", "...", "The [ plaintiff \u2019s ] son suffered from disorders which caused depressive behaviour with a significant inclination to suicide .", "Taking into account the clinical documents , his clinical condition may have led to another attempt to commit suicide , which turned out to be fatal .", "In addition , the polymorphism of the patient \u2019s psychiatric condition should be emphasised . A psychopathological condition such as the patient \u2019s has a bad prognosis and suicide is frequently preceded by an attempt ( or attempts ) to commit suicide . ... Indeed , it must be clarified that ... it should also be considered that the hypothesis of [ his ] diagnosis could be of a borderline personality disorder [ perturba\u00e7\u00e3o de personalidade borderline ] ...", "...", "There is reference to a multiplicity of diagnoses , all of them capable of enhancing the risk of the patient \u2019s suicide ( and also of suicidal behaviour ) .", "...", "The clinical history and psychopathological framework [ quadro psicopatol\u00f3gico ] , for the reasons already mentioned , would predict future suicidal behaviour ; thus the occurrence of suicide is not surprising .", "With regard to prevention , containment and surveillance measures must without a doubt be adopted . But with a patient like this one , these measures are difficult to adopt ( see for example his requests to be discharged despite the doctor \u2019s opinion , which is substantiated ) and never enough because of the high potential for suicide .", "...", "The fact that the patient had been on antidepressant treatment for DATE , had wandered around the hospital without ever endangering his life ... does not mean that the probability of that event ( suicide ) was negligible . However , it was hardly avoidable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . The applicant and the psychiatrist who had issued the medical opinion gave evidence at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL hearings the court heard evidence from different witnesses , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2013 PERSON \u2019s sister ; nurses , doctors and medical auxiliaries who had worked for or were still working for the ORG , some of whom had started their shift at TIME on DATE ; a social worker employed by the ORG since DATE , who had had contact with PERSON ; and the train driver . The court also analysed several documents attached to PERSON \u2019s clinical file from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court conducted an on - site inspection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing at which it adopted a decision concerning the facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment in which it ruled against the applicant . If found that although her son had been suffering from a mental disorder , there was no causal link between his wholly unexpected suicide and an alleged violation of the hospital staff \u2019s duty of care . It noted , in particular , that the applicant \u2019s son had been suffering from a psychiatric disorder which had never been properly diagnosed , either because the symptoms were complex or because he had been addicted to alcohol and drugs . In this regard , it pointed out that over DATE the applicant \u2019s son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression . However , only after his death and as a consequence of an expert opinion requested from ORG during the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was there an agreement that he had been suffering from a severe personality disorder . The court established that he had last been admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt . However , it considered that despite the possibility that people diagnosed with mental diseases such as that of the applicant \u2019s son might commit suicide , during DATE before his death he had not shown any behaviour or mood which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that DATE would be different from DATE . The court thus concluded that the hospital staff could not have foreseen the suicide of the applicant \u2019s son and that his behaviour had been absolutely unexpected and unpredictable . With regard to the applicant \u2019s argument that the hospital should have supervised her son more effectively and erected fences or other barriers around the hospital LOC , the court pointed out that the current paradigm in the treatment of mentally ill patients was to encourage social interaction . The existence of fencing would lead to the stigmatisation and isolation of mentally disabled patients . In the same way , any supervision of patients had to be carried out discreetly . The ORG had a surveillance procedure in place which consisted of verifying the ORG presence at meal and medication times ; this was in compliance with the most recent psychiatric science and respected the ORG right to privacy . With regard to the applicant \u2019s argument that the emergency procedure was non - existent , the court noted that it consisted in alerting the police and the patient \u2019s family . Therefore , the court found that there had been no omission in the duty of care on the part of the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , claiming that the first - instance court had wrongly assessed the evidence , that its findings of fact had been incorrect , and that it had wrongly interpreted the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney ORG attached to ORG , called upon to issue an opinion on the appeal , held that the first - instance judgment should be reversed . In their opinion , given that PERSON \u2019s medical record stated that he had attempted to commit suicide on different occasions and considering that he had last been admitted to hospital because of a suicide attempt , a new attempt to commit suicide was likely and should have been foreseen . They noted that the hospital had failed to implement a supervision regime capable of preventing the applicant \u2019s son from leaving the hospital LOC . They also argued that the increased monitoring of the patient was part of the hospital \u2019s duty of care and did not detract from the \u201c open door \u201d regime . They concluded that the monitoring measures put in place by the ORG were not adequate for an establishment categorised as a psychiatric hospital or for a patient with PERSON \u2019s characteristics .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , upholding the legal and factual findings of ORG . ORG held that the ORG had not breached any duty of care , as there had been no indication which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that the applicant \u2019s son would try to commit suicide , namely by leaving the hospital LOC . ORG took into account that during previous periods of hospitalisation the applicant \u2019s son had also left the hospital LOC , and that no link had been established between those \u201c escapes \u201d and a particular risk of suicide in so far as they had only been able to establish the existence of a single suicide attempt , on DATE . ORG considered that the counting of patients at meal and medication times was sufficient and had allowed the hospital staff to verify PERSON \u2019s attendance during lunch and TIME snack on DATE . It concluded that there had been no anomaly in the functioning of the ORG , nor could any anomaly be attributed to either the lack of security fences or walls , or the method of counting patients .", "CARDINAL . In a dissenting opinion , CARDINAL of the judges argued that the hospital should have secured the LOC in some way in order to fulfil its duties of care and supervision . By not doing so , it had allowed patients to leave easily without being discharged , thus breaching those duties . As such , that omission had been the cause of the \u201c escape \u201d and suicide of the applicant \u2019s son .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is located outside GPE on QUANTITY of land , distant from any urban or industrial areas . It is part of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to an on - site inspection made by ORG on DATE in the course of the proceedings against the hospital , the ORG has CARDINAL buildings dedicated to each hospital department . The grounds of the ORG do not have security fences or walls of any other kind . The buildings are surrounded by green areas with trees and other vegetation , and the different buildings are accessed by means of roadways ( arruamentos ) and paths ( passeios ) , which are also surrounded by trees and other vegetation . The main entrance to the ORG has a barrier ( cancela ) and a security guard . CARDINAL of the possible exits from the hospital LOC leads to a shortcut towards a railway station platform ( apeadeiro ferrovi\u00e1rio ) . This shortcut is accessed by taking the road behind building no . CARDINAL . The station platform is around a fifteen to twenty minutes\u2019 walk from that part of the ORG \u2019s premises .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the guidelines prepared by the ORG , meals are taken in the hospital cafeteria and patients must remain there until DATE . Patients are not allowed to leave the department without informing the relevant nurse in advance . An afternoon snack is usually provided at TIME", "CARDINAL . According to articles which have been published in the media in DATE , several patients have managed to escape from the ORG \u2019s LOC since DATE . Some of them were found and taken back to the hospital and others were found dead . For example , different local and national media have reported as follows :", "( i ) on DATE the body of a patient who had escaped DATE was found close to the hospital LOC ( in ORG ) ;", "( ii ) on DATE a man escaped from the ORG and was hit by a car after jumping in front of it ( in PERSON ) ;", "( iii ) on DATE the body of a patient who had escaped from the hospital DATE was found in a river ( in ORG ) ;", "( iv ) on DATE a patient who had been involuntarily hospitalised in the ORG escaped ( in ORG ) ;", "( v ) in DATE CARDINAL different patients escaped from the hospital ; CARDINAL of them was located by the police after stealing a car and another was found dead in a nearby river ( in bombeirospontopt ) ;", "( vi ) on DATE a patient escaped from the ORG \u2019s premises and attacked CARDINAL police officers with a hoe ( in ORG ) ;", "( vii ) on DATE CARDINAL patients escaped from the ORG and stole a car by ousting the driver ( in TviCARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
