According to the GPE census of DATE , the ORG had a population of CARDINAL , consisting of PERCENT ethnic NORP and PERCENT ethnic NORP , with NORP and NORP minorities . The district of Lachin had a different demographic , the great majority of its population of CARDINAL being NORP and NORP . PERCENT were NORP .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE demonstrations were held in PERSON , the regional capital of the ORG , as well as in the NORP capital of GPE , demanding the incorporation of GPE - Karabakh into GPE . On DATE the NORP of the ORG made a request to ORG of the NORP SSR , the GPE SSR and the GPE that the NKAO be allowed to secede from GPE and join GPE . The request was rejected by ORG of the GPE on DATE . In DATE it was also rejected by ORG whereas its counterpart in GPE voted in favour of unification .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE the demonstrations calling for unification continued . The district of Lachin was subjected to roadblocks and attacks . The clashes led to many casualties , and refugees , numbering CARDINAL on both sides , flowed between GPE and GPE . As a consequence , on QUANTITY DATE ORG placed the ORG under GPE \u2019s direct rule . However , on DATE , control of the province was returned to GPE .

On DATE the \u201c NKR \u201d , having regard to the results of the referendum , reaffirmed its independence from GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the conflict gradually escalated into full - scale war . The ethnic NORP conquered several NORP villages , leading to at least CARDINAL deaths and the departure of the population .", "CARDINAL . The district of Lachin , in particular the town of ORG , was attacked many times . The applicants claimed that the attacks were made by troops of both PERSON and GPE . The respondent Government maintained , however , that GPE did not participate in the events , but that military action was carried out by the defence forces of GPE - Karabakh and volunteer groups . For DATE in DATE the roads to Lachin were under the control of forces of NORP ethnicity who manned and controlled checkpoints . The town of PERSON became completely isolated . In mid - May CARDINAL PERSON was subjected to aerial bombardment , in the course of which many houses were destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , realising that troops were advancing rapidly towards ORG , villagers fled . The following day the town of PERSON was captured by forces of NORP ethnicity .

The self - proclaimed independence of the \u201c NKR \u201d has not been recognised by any ORG or international organisation .

The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by GPE and GPE would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement . Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by ORG diplomats and a number of meetings between the presidents of the CARDINAL countries in DATE , the process lost momentum in DATE . So far the parties to the conflict have not signed a formal agreement on ORG .", "CARDINAL .

Towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins . While no reliable figures exist , the overall population is CARDINAL persons , living in small settlements and in the towns of ORG . ORG assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since DATE . The settlers , for the most part ethnic NORP who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in GPE , live in precarious conditions , with poor infrastructure , little economic activity , and limited access to public services . Many lack identity documents . For administrative purposes , the CARDINAL territories , the former LOC , and other areas have been incorporated into CARDINAL new districts .", "The harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the CoChairs that the status quo is unacceptable , and that only a peaceful , negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of a better , more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now . The Co - Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas . They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents . ORG intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the FAC conflict , and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidents of the Co - Chair countries of the GPE group issued a joint statement on the GPE - Karabakh conflict :", "\u201c We , the Presidents of ORG countries \u2013 GPE , GPE , and GPE \u2013 remain committed to helping the parties to the Nagorno - Karabakh conflict reach a lasting and peaceful settlement . We express our deep regret that , rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests , the parties have continued to seek CARDINAL - sided advantage in the negotiation process .", "We continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over DATE must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the ORG - Karabakh conflict . These elements should be seen as an integrated whole , as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a balanced solution .", "We reiterate that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace , stability , and reconciliation , opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation . The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict . A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region , resulting in loss of life , more destruction , additional refugees , and enormous financial costs . We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the GPE principles , particularly those relating to the non - use of force or the threat of force , territorial integrity , and equal rights and self - determination of peoples . We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict . The leaders should prepare their people for peace , not war .", "Our countries stand ready to assist the sides , but the responsibility for putting an end to the Nagorno - Karabakh conflict remains with them . We strongly believe that further delay in reaching a balanced agreement on the framework for a comprehensive peace is unacceptable , and urge the leaders of GPE and GPE to focus with renewed energy on the issues that remain unresolved . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
