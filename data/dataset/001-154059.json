THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The case originated in an application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against GPE and GPE lodged with ORG under LAW ( \u201c the LAW ) by a NORP national , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u201d ) , on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was represented by PERSON of Central Law Practice , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG . By letter dated DATE ORG were asked to notify the ORG by DATE if they intended to intervene . They did not reply to this letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application was communicated to the Government .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , entered GPE in DATE . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General in GPE issued NORP Arrest Warrant ( \u201c EAW \u201d ) in which he was accused of having committed CARDINAL dangerous felonies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested pursuant to the ORG in DATE and detained in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The applicant applied to ORG to have the order set aside on CARDINAL grounds : first , that the lapse of time since the commission of the alleged offences would render his extradition unjust and oppressive ; and secondly , that his extradition would violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention because , if returned to GPE , he would be at risk of reprisals by a notorious criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a doctor at ORG notified the applicant \u2019s representative that he was suffering from paranoid delusions and that he had been referred to ORG . A psychiatric report prepared on DATE recorded that he had been suffering from depression since DATE , that he was suffering from a delusional disorder and that he should be transferred to ORG for treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the authorities at ORG did not accept that he should be transferred there . The applicant \u2019s legal representatives subsequently obtained a report from another psychiatrist , who noted that the applicant appeared to be seriously depressed , that he was suffering from a delusional disorder , and that there was a risk of suicide . The psychiatrist expressed some surprise that the applicant \u2019s transfer to ORG had not been granted and suggested that the refusal decision from ORG should be appealed .", "CARDINAL . The High Court hearing was listed for DATE . The applicant sought an adjournment in order for a full psychiatric report to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the application for an adjournment . It also refused to set aside the order of ORG and refused to grant the applicant permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The High Court \u2019s consideration of how the applicant \u2019s mental health condition would be affected by extradition and the treatment that would be available to him in GPE was limited to the following paragraph :", "\u201c As far as his mental state is concerned , there is evidence before us that the reports on his state , if not already forwarded , will be forwarded and any necessary treatment will be available to him either in hospital if that is necessary or perhaps as an outpatient if he is on bail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A psychiatric report dated DATE recorded that the applicant was suffering from a serious mental illness which required treatment in hospital and which he could not explain by malingering . The applicant sought to re - open the appeal on the basis of this report . However , on DATE ORG refused to certify a point of law of general public importance and thus refused to re - open the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the applicant \u2019s extradition until TIME on DATE to enable him to apply to this ORG for an interim measure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s legal representatives lodged an application before this ORG on behalf of the applicant and requested an interim measure to prevent his extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the ORG to provide , by TIME on DATE , a transcript of ORG hearing of DATE and at the same time to confirm whether or not any assurances had been received from ORG regarding the availability of mental health treatment in detention centres in GPE . The Government duly submitted a copy of the transcript and confirmed that there was no record of any assurances on the applicant \u2019s file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Acting President of the Section decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and indicated to the Government of GPE that the applicant should not be extradited to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the ORG asked the ORG to respond to the following questions by CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Are your Government aware of the medical report by Dr PERSON of DATE ?", "CARDINAL . How do your Government respond to PERSON opinion that the applicant should be transferred to ORG ?", "CARDINAL . NORP In your Government \u2019s view , would the applicant have access to adequate mental health services upon extradition to GPE :", "( a ) in detention pending trial ?", "( b ) if he were found not fit to plead ?", "( c ) if he were to be tried and convicted ?", "CARDINAL . Does the applicant have continuing family and/or personal ties to GPE ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government replied on DATE . In their letter they informed the ORG that the only parties in extradition cases were the defendant and ORG . As a consequence , the Government had not been represented as a party in the present extradition proceedings and were not in a position to provide the additional information requested .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the applicant \u2019s case on DATE , ORG re - referred the applicant to ORG as there had been no change in his mental health condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives notified the ORG that he had been admitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the applicant \u2019s mental health condition subsequently improved significantly and on DATE his transfer was ordered from ORG to ORG . ORG also obtained a number of assurances from ORG : first , given the length of time he had spent in remand in GPE , there was a very real prospect that upon his return to GPE the applicant would be released during the pre - trial investigation stage ; secondly , if he were to be remanded in custody and his health were to deteriorate , he would be hospitalised immediately in the psychiatric department of the central prison hospital ; thirdly , if he were to remain in an ordinary custodial facility , he would be held in a prison which had psychiatric services available ; fourthly , if his fitness to plead were to be in issue , he would be subject to forensic psychiatric examination ; fifthly , there would be provision for compulsory or voluntary hospitalisation for treatment of the applicant \u2019s mental health ; and finally , if the applicant were convicted and sentenced and continued to require specialist psychiatric care , he would be sent to a facility specifically adapted for convicted persons with special needs .", "CARDINAL . Part I of LAW DATE deals with extradition to Category CARDINAL territories which , by designation of the Secretary of ORG , include all the member states of ORG which operate the NORP Arrest Warrant system . GPE is therefore a Category CARDINAL territory .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW requires the judge at the extradition hearing to decide whether a person \u2019s extradition would be compatible with Convention rights within the meaning of LAW DATE . If the extradition would be incompatible , then the judge is required to order the person \u2019s discharge . LAW provides that if the physical or mental condition of the persons whose extradition is requested is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite them , then the judge must discharge them .", "CARDINAL . If the judge at the extradition hearing orders the person \u2019s extradition , section CARDINAL provides for a right of appeal to ORG . Section CARDINAL provides for a right of appeal to ORG against a decision of ORG , with the leave of either ORG or ORG , which leave shall only be granted if ORG has certified that the case involves a point of law of general public importance and the ORG granting leave considers that the point ought to be considered by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
