LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE ( ORG rajono savivaldyb\u0117 ) assigned a plot of land measuring QUANTITY in the settlement of GPE to the applicant for the construction of a house ( hereinafter \u201c the land \u201d ) . In DATE she signed a land purchase agreement with the municipality and bought the land for CARDINAL \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d ( investiciniai \u010dekiai ) . The purchase agreement indicated that the nominal value of the land was CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) . The applicant subsequently obtained a building permit and built a storehouse on the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that Government regulations which allowed land in GPE to be sold to private individuals were contrary to LAW ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) brought a claim before ORG ( ORG rajono apylink\u0117s teismas ) seeking the annulment of the administrative decisions and the purchase agreements on the basis of which plots of land had been sold to the applicant and to several other individuals . The ORG argued that the land in question had to be returned in natura to its former owners and thus had been sold to the applicant and other individuals unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s claim . The court annulled the administrative decision of DATE assigning the land to the applicant and the land purchase agreement of DATE , and ordered GPE to return CARDINAL \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partially quashed the first - instance judgment . It found that the lower court had correctly annulled the administrative decision and purchase agreement , and upheld the judgment in that part . However , it noted that the \u201c single - use investment vouchers \u201d could no longer be used as a means of payment . Thus , in accordance with LAW , the applicant should have received the monetary equivalent of what she had paid in DATE . The court remitted that part of the case for re - examination in order to assess the monetary equivalent . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The remitted part of the case was subsequently re - examined by ORG sitting as the court of first instance . During those proceedings , the applicant argued that the unlawful allocation and sale of the land had resulted from the State authorities\u2019 negligence . The applicant claimed that she , as a bona fide purchaser , was therefore entitled to receive compensation for the full market value as it was at the time of expropriation , in accordance with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for compensation equating to the full market value of the land . The court found that the authorities could not be held solely responsible for the unlawful sale because the applicant had also had a duty to verify whether she had been buying the land lawfully . Thus , the court held that , for the purposes of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the applicant could not be considered a bona fide purchaser and was not entitled to compensation for the full market value . The court awarded her the nominal value of the land in DATE , which it assessed to be LTL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The court also noted that if the applicant considered that she had suffered pecuniary damage , she had the right to institute separate proceedings against the ORG for damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partially amended ORG judgment . It reiterated that the applicant could not be considered a bona fide purchaser merely because she had bought the land from the State \u2013 she had also had a duty to verify the lawfulness of the sale . However , ORG found that the lower court had incorrectly assessed the nominal value of the land in DATE . Referring to the text of the purchase agreement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG ; however , it partially amended the reasoning . ORG stated that the nominal value of the land had been indicated in the purchase agreement , so it had not been necessary to apply LAW and assess the monetary equivalent . As a result , the applicant \u2019s good faith had been irrelevant in determining the amount of compensation and should not have been examined . Nonetheless , ORG considered that that error had not affected the lawfulness of ORG judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
