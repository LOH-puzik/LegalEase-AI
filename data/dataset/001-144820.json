I detect a problem in the system , which allows for such a procedure even in respect of decisions on the return of minor children abroad ( \u2018 international child ORG ) . Irrespective of the outcome of the specific case , the possibility of lodging an appeal on points of law and an extraordinary appeal on points of law in cases of international child abduction protracts the proceedings and negates the object of the [ Hague Convention ] , which is as expeditious a restoration of the original state [ of affairs ] as possible , that is to say the return of the child to the country of the child \u2019s habitual residence within the shortest possible time . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
