On DATE the court adjourned the hearing until DATE , giving no reasons , and then until DATE on account of illness among the judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard the applicant \u2019s final statement . The applicant stated that he had gathered information for ORG using open sources and denied the charges against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after deliberations , ORG remitted the case for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . In its decision ORG stated that the investigating authority had significantly breached the rules of criminal procedure in the course of the preliminary investigation , thus prejudicing the applicant \u2019s right to defend himself . The charges against the applicant in the statement of charges of DATE and in the bill of indictment , notably the content of the materials which the applicant had allegedly gathered , stored and transmitted to a foreign intelligence service , were excessively vague . Those documents contained the titles and general description of the topics about which the applicant had allegedly transmitted information , but did not indicate the content of that information . With regard to some accusations there was a significant discrepancy between their formulation in the statement of charges and the bill of indictment , which fact , in line with the practice directions of ORG , was a ground for remitting the case for additional investigation . With regard to certain other charges , the court noted that the investigating authority had contradicted itself in the statement of charges and the bill of indictment by referring to the same information as classified and non - classified .", "CARDINAL . A general criticism about the charges on CARDINAL topics was that it remained unclear exactly what information the applicant had allegedly gathered , stored and transmitted . This made it impossible for the court to assess the arguments put forward by the prosecution and the defence ; to establish factual questions concerning the sources and circumstances in which the information was collected ; to assess whether the information was truthful and comprised ORG secrets , and to assess the possibility that it was damaging to GPE \u2019s external security . The vague formulation of the charges , which made it impossible for the applicant to know exactly what he was accused of , also violated his right to defend himself .", "CARDINAL . The investigating authority had established the applicant \u2019s guilt based , inter alia , on the applicant \u2019s own statements . At the same time they had failed to set out and analyse in the bill of indictment the applicant \u2019s statements concerning the circumstances in which the information was collected and stored and the content of that information .", "CARDINAL . According to the investigating authority , the applicant \u2019s guilt was corroborated by the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL notebooks . There was nothing in the bill of indictment about the content of those notebooks or its analysis .", "CARDINAL . The bill of indictment referred to mutually exclusive evidence which had not been analysed and was not assessed by the investigating authority . Thus , the applicant was accused of gathering , storing and transmitting secret information concerning \u201c options for the structure of the ORG \u2019s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to DATE \u201d . The bill of indictment referred to CARDINAL expert reports as evidence : ( i ) report of DATE by the commission of experts from ORG , according to which this information was \u201c top secret \u201d ; ( ii ) statements by a certain expert to the effect that this information was partially untrue but did however contain ORG secrets ; and ( iii ) report of CARDINAL DATE by the commission of experts from ORG , according to which the information was untrue and did not contain State secrets .", "CARDINAL . The bill of indictment did not set out the applicant \u2019s arguments and any results of their examination by the investigating authority . Thus , after the charges had been served on him PERSON contended that he had taken certain information , allegedly secret , from various published interviews with NORP military commanders . He asked whether such information had been declassified . Neither the applicant \u2019s arguments nor the results of their examination were set out in the bill of indictment . The applicant had argued that he obtained some information from the foreign press in LANGUAGE . However , the experts submitted to the trial court that they had never examined these publications . The applicant had contended that he had received all of his information , including that which , according to the experts , had comprised ORG secrets , from open sources . These arguments by the applicant had not been properly examined in the course of the preliminary investigation . The results of the examination had not been set out in the bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . During the preliminary investigation , expert examinations had been conducted into the secrecy of the information allegedly gathered , stored and transmitted by the applicant . CARDINAL expert commissions had concluded that part of the information contained ORG secrets of different levels . The experts\u2019 conclusions had been included in the formulation of charges . In their examination the experts had been governed by order no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , containing a list of information subject to classification in ORG , to which the applicant had never had access . By failing to provide the applicant with access to that document the investigating authority had violated his right to defend himself . Furthermore , that list was a secret document and had never received State registration ; it should not therefore have been relied on by the experts ( ORG in its decision of DATE held that this order was a document touching upon human rights which should be registered ; normative acts void of registration were invalid ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial court agreed with the defence that the expert examinations ( reports of DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ) had been ordered and carried out in violation of the law on criminal procedure .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above violations the trial court remitted the case to the NORP regional prosecutor for additional investigation , as required by ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW , and ordered , without giving any reasons , that the applicant should remain in detention .", "CARDINAL . The court held that should the evidence gathered as a result of the new investigation be sufficient to bring charges against the applicant , those charges were to be formulated in detail in a statement of charges , in accordance with the requirements of LAW . A bill of indictment had to comply with LAW and contain , in particular , the detailed formulation of a charge , which was not to differ significantly from the formulation in the statement of charges to the detriment of the accused . The bill of indictment had further to describe and examine evidence produced by the investigating authority and the accused \u2019s arguments in his defence . Expert examination of the information included in the charges should , if necessary , be carried out so that the accused \u2019s rights would be duly respected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel appealed against this decision . They did not dispute the trial court \u2019s findings with regard to the procedural violations by the investigating authority . They argued , however , that the vague formulation of the charges , as well as the violations in preparing the bill of indictment and in ordering and carrying out expert examinations , showed the irreparable incompleteness of the investigation , which warranted the applicant \u2019s acquittal . The trial court should not have remitted the case for additional investigation on its own initiative without relevant requests to that effect by the parties . The flawed preliminary investigation should have resulted in the applicant \u2019s acquittal .", "CARDINAL . The defence also appealed against the decision upholding the applicant \u2019s detention . They submitted that there was no evidence that he would flee . The applicant and his family and relations \u2013 his wife , CARDINAL minor children , parents and brother \u2013 resided permanently in GPE . His wife and children were in a difficult financial situation . The applicant had a number of diseases which could not be treated properly in his detention facility . There was no evidence that the applicant could obstruct the investigation or would engage in criminal activities . The counsel complained about violations of LAW in particular , given that the gravity of the offence was the sole ground for the applicant \u2019s continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision . It maintained that the charges against the applicant had been too vague , and stated that ORG had rightly decided to remit the case for additional investigation and remand the applicant in custody , and that it found no ground to quash or amend that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation department of the ORG of LOC commenced the additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they ordered a new comprehensive expert report on whether the information which the applicant had allegedly transmitted to ORG contained ORG secrets . The defence objected to that decision , arguing that the experts were supposed to compare the statutory list of classified information and the transmitted information , which was in fact legal assessment . The applicant requested that he be allowed to be present at the expert examination and to provide explanations to the experts . He also noted that for unknown reasons the investigating authority had not forwarded to the experts a number of publications used by him . He requested that those publications be sent to the experts for their examination .", "CARDINAL . In his decision of CARDINAL DATE the head of the investigation department rejected the applicant \u2019s requests . He stated , in particular , that all open sources had been forwarded for expert examination , except for those to which the applicant had referred without any ground , as they were mismatched chronologically ( published after the events incriminated to the applicant ) or textually with the information transmitted by the applicant . He stated that the applicant \u2019s presence at the expert examination was not necessary since the materials submitted to the experts , including the applicant \u2019s statements , were sufficient to answer the questions put to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was transferred to the ORG central investigation department in GPE on ORG instruction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission of experts from the ORG of ORG of GPE carried out an assessment of the materials given to them by the investigating authority ( records of the applicant \u2019s interrogations and the publications to which the applicant referred as the sources of his information ) and reached the conclusion that the materials on the following CARDINAL topics constituted State secrets , were true and could not have been obtained from the publications examined by them :", "\u2013 the structure and state of the missile [ early-]warning system ;", "\u2013 the RF Ministry of Defence \u2019s failure to implement in full plans to set up permanent readiness units in DATE ;", "\u2013 options for the structure of the ORG \u2019s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to DATE ;", "\u2013 specific features of the construction and military potential of the MiG-CARDINAL SMT aircraft and the military potential of the modernised MiG-CARDINAL ;", "\u2013 possible directions in the development of NORP air - to - air missiles .", "CARDINAL .

The charges in respect of the remaining items were withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the additional investigation was finalised .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG quashed the decision as unlawful and ordered a fresh examination . It stated in its decision that pre - trial detention could only be extended if legitimate grounds were supported by the relevant factual circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , an investigator from the prosecutor \u2019s office submitted to ORG a copy of a document from which it followed that the applicant had received an entry visa for GPE which had expired in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a new decision extending the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , on the grounds that , in view of his open visa for a trip abroad , he could abscond or otherwise obstruct the investigation and that he was accused of committing a particularly serious offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on the same grounds until such time as the applicant had completed examination of the case file .", "DATE . The defence appealed against the CARDINAL decisions , pointing out , inter alia , that , according to the applicant \u2019s passport , his NORP visa had been issued for the period from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeals , holding that there were no grounds for the applicant \u2019s release and referring to the gravity of the charges .", "CARDINAL .

The judge noted that DATE of the applicant \u2019s detention in custody , from the moment of the receipt of the case by the court , would expire on DATE . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , in cases concerning grave and particularly grave offences a court could prolong the terms of detention in custody for not DATE each time .

The new presiding judge PERSON held a hearing on DATE at which she carried out the selection of a new jury from CARDINAL candidate jurors .", "CARDINAL . The request by the defence to have the case examined by the initial composition of the jury , which , they alleged , had been unlawfully dismissed , was rejected . So too was a motion challenging the presiding judge who , according to the defence , was conducting the trial in a way favourable to the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . One of the questions put to the candidate jurors by the presiding judge was whether there were among them heads or deputy heads of bodies of the representative or executive authorities , deputies , servicemen , clergymen , judges , prosecutors , investigators , advocates , notaries and persons serving in ORG or the ORG . CARDINAL persons responded that they had served in the ORG . They were dismissed at the request of the defence . The defence asked the candidate jurors CARDINAL questions , some of which were addressed to all of them , for example , questions about their place of work , knowledge of foreign languages and Internet use . The defence challenged some of the candidate jurors twice without giving reasons . A candidate juror , PERSON , answered that he worked as a deputy head of a foreign company representative office and spoke NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the individuals who were selected to serve on the jury took the oath .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was adjourned until DATE in order for the applicant to have additional time to examine the case file , as requested by him . On the latter date the defence unsuccessfully challenged the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution witnesses , notably T. , V. , PERSON and PERSON , were examined before the jury .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the presiding judge granted the motion by the defence to have those publications , which , according to the applicant , had been the only source for the information transmitted to ORG , presented to the jury . The publications were presented .", "CARDINAL . The expert reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE were then read out before the jury on a motion by the defence .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the records of the hearing that the defence then requested the examination of ORG as one of the experts who had prepared the report of CARDINAL DATE . The representatives of the prosecution objected , stating that it was impossible to understand from the report which part of the examination had been carried out by a particular expert ; that in DATE and DATE the experts had examined different materials ; and that the DATE report had lacked the \u201c research part \u201d , as a result of which a new expert examination \u2013 conducted in compliance with the legal requirements \u2013 had been commissioned at the stage of the additional investigation in DATE . The prosecution requested that the report of CARDINAL DATE , which had been conducted in breach of the law on criminal procedure , be declared inadmissible evidence . The presiding judge granted the motion by the defence to examine ORG as an expert . Since his examination was connected with the issue of admissibility of evidence the judge ordered ORG \u2019s examination in the jury \u2019s absence and adjourned the decision on the admissibility of evidence until after ORG \u2019s examination . After hearing ORG the judge declared the expert report of CARDINAL DATE inadmissible evidence on the ground that the expert examination had been carried out with breaches of the law on criminal procedure , notably LAW , in force at the material time . Thus , the report did not state what examination had been carried out by a particular expert , what facts a particular expert had established and what conclusions he or she had reached . The judge rejected the motion by the defence to have ORG examined before the jury since \u201c the expert \u2019s examination [ was ] connected with the issue of admissibility of evidence \u201d . Upon the jury \u2019s return to the court room they were told that the expert report of CARDINAL DATE had been declared inadmissible evidence and that the parties could not therefore refer to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE more publications , from which , the applicant alleged , he had obtained information for ORG , were presented to the jury . The defence asked to examine the expert report of DATE before the jury . The presiding judge declared the report inadmissible evidence for the same reasons as the report of CARDINAL DATE . It follows from the records of the hearing that the defence asked to examine as a witness PERSON , CARDINAL of the experts who had prepared the report of DATE and who came to the court at the request of the defence . The defence asked to examine him on issues unrelated to the expert examination in question . The prosecution objected , arguing that at the preliminary investigation PERSON had carried out the expert examination and had later been examined as an expert in the trial before ORG .
