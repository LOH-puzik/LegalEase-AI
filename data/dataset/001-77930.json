The applicant company , a limited liability company with its registered office in GPE , is the owner of the DATE newspaper PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its issue of CARDINAL DATE the applicant company published a CARDINAL - page article about the alleged harassment and rape of CARDINAL winners of beauty contests , Ms O and Ms S , during a representation mission in LOC . The article headed \u201c It 's your own fault girls ... \u201d and subtitled \u201c Raped and harassed in Monte Carlo : CARDINAL beauty winners bring heavy charges \u201d started with the quotation of Ms R , the daughter of the former manager of the NORP public relations agency organising these contests and moderator of such events , saying that \u201c The prince can not rape , he is very ill . We [ Ms R and her father ] rather think that the girls are only boasting and now try to make as much money as possible out of this unfortunate incident . \u201d The article indicated that Ms R was the daughter of \u201c Miss - maker R from PERSON \u201d and noted this was the \u201c first official comment \u201d on the above scandal . It then mentioned that CARDINAL persons had been arrested on suspicion of procuration , described the details of the alleged incident and cited from a memorandum of Ms O and PERSON lawyer . This memorandum referred to the statement made by a bodyguard of the prince who had allegedly said : \u201c It 's your own fault girls ... \u201d The article concluded with further statements made by Ms R asserting inter alia that the public relations agency of her father had not arranged the representation mission at issue .", "CARDINAL . Ms R had made her statements during a telephone interview when contacted by a journalist of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , Ms O and Ms S opened private prosecution for defamation against Ms NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , having heard the private prosecutors , Ms R , the applicant company and a number of witnesses , convicted Ms R of defamation in a printed medium under Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) on account of the statement \u201c The prince can not rape , he is very ill . We [ Ms R and her father ] rather think that the girls are only boasting and now try to make as much money as possible out of this unfortunate incident . \u201d , imposed a fine of approximately EUR CARDINAL on her and ordered her to pay the costs of the proceedings . It noted that the offence was a media offence ( ORG ) , which could only be committed through publication in the applicant company 's newspaper , and found the applicant company jointly and severally liable ( ORG ) for the fine and the costs pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . In its plea of nullity against this judgment the applicant company complained about its joint and several liability under section CARDINAL of LAW . It submitted in particular that the court should have interpreted this provision in conformity with LAW , which prescribed joint and several liability only for failure of compliance with journalistic diligence . The article in question was written in an objective manner , reporting about the conflicting versions of the incident in ORG , and correctly quoted Ms R 's statement without taking sides .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , partly allowing Ms R 's appeal , suspended the fine for a DATE probationary period . For the rest , it dismissed the applicant company 's plea and confirmed ORG judgment . It held that the publisher 's liability under section CARDINAL of LAW was linked to a media offence , which could be committed not only by an employee of a media company but also by a third person . The commission of such an offence fell within the sphere of risk of a publisher who printed a defamatory statement in its newspaper . Its subsequent liability was based on considerations of causality and did not imply any finding of guilt . The court found that the legislator 's choice in favour of the joint and several liability of the publisher reflected the balance struck between the interests involved , namely the interest of the media to exercise the right to freedom of expression , on the one hand , and , on the other , that of the person desirous of protecting his / her reputation , in favour of the interest of the defamed victim to secure financially the proceedings instituted to obtain legal redress . The publisher 's strict liability was in line with its obligation to publish the judgment in its newspaper .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently Ms O and PERSON requested the applicant company to pay the legal costs of the defamation proceedings . Having paid , the applicant company filed a claim against Ms R and requested reimbursement of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) partly granted the applicant company 's claim and ordered Ms R to pay the applicant company PERCENT of the costs of the defamation proceedings . On DATE the ORG confirmed this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant company 's appeal . It noted that section CARDINAL of LAW was not meant to disburden a defamer . The applicant company had paid another person 's debt for which it was jointly and severally liable and was , in principle , entitled to recover under LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) the full amount of the sum paid .", "CARDINAL . However , the special internal relationship ( ORG ) between the applicant company and Ms R stood against full reimbursement , as Ms R had to be considered as an assistant of the applicant company ( ORG ) in the broadest sense of the term . The court noted in this regard that the applicant company had used PERSON statements for its own economic interests . PERSON could only commit the offence via the applicant company which had published the impugned statements . Furthermore , Ms R had acted free of charge and the interview had been carried out on the initiative of the applicant company . When correlating these factors with the guilt of PERSON , the splitting of the liability between the applicant company and PERSON was acceptable .", "CARDINAL . The court finally did not find it necessary to examine whether the applicant company could have claimed full reimbursement if section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of LAW was applicable to its case . It noted in this regard that the requirements under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) were not met as there was no predominant public interest in PERSON statements about the alleged rape of the CARDINAL winners of beauty contests . Ms R had at the time of the interview no relation whatsoever with the public relations agency implicated in these events and the applicant company could , moreover , not trust PERSON to be informed about the background of the events at issue .", "CARDINAL .
