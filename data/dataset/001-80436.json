In DATE the applicants took part in the emergency operation at the GPE nuclear plant . As a result they suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions . The applicants underwent medical examinations which established the link between their poor health and their involvement in the GPE events . Each applicant was consequently granted status of a disabled person and awarded a DATE pension and a special \u201c food allowance \u201d from the ORG , to be adjusted once a year in line with the minimum subsistence amount ( \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c\u0430 ) .", "CARDINAL . At a certain moment in DATE the social security authorities ceased to increase regularly the amounts of the pensions and \u201c food allowances \u201d due to the applicants in connection with their disabilities . Instead , they started to receive their pensions in a fixed amount ( MONEY ( RUR ) per person ) , which was less than they expected . Presuming that that practice was illegal , the applicants brought proceedings against the regional social security office ( \u201c the defendant \u201d ) claiming the increase of the pensions and the \u201c food allowances \u201d in line with the increase of the minimum subsistence amount during the relevant period .", "CARDINAL .

In re - calculating the amounts to be paid the court applied the multiplier of CARDINAL reflecting the increase of the minimal subsistence amount in GPE and based on the data provided by the regional committee on statistics . As a result , the amounts to be received by PERSON PERSON on the DATE basis from the social security office increased to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL : CARDINAL on account of the disability pension plus RUR CARDINAL on account of the \u201c food allowance \u201d . The court ordered the defendant to pay the applicant the recalculated amounts as from DATE , less the sums already paid .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG rendered a similar judgment ordering the increase of the pensions and \u201c food allowances \u201d in respect of other applicants .", "CARDINAL . The defendant appealed against the judgments of CARDINAL and DATE challenging , among other things , the multiplier of CARDINAL applied by the first - instance court . They also claimed that the law only provided for the increase of the disability pension in line with the cost of living , but not the \u201c food allowance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) upheld the judgments of CARDINAL and DATE in full , dismissing the arguments of the defendant .

On DATE , upon the request of the defendant , ORG rectified its own judgment of DATE as regards Mr PERSON , one of the applicants . The court held that since Mr PERSON belonged to the \u201c third category of disability \u201d ( the mildest form of disability , according to the NORP classification ) , the amount of his DATE pensions for DATE should be RUR CARDINAL .

The defendant argued , in particular , that the multiplier CARDINAL applied by the courts at CARDINAL instances was inappropriate , since it only reflected the growth of the cost of living in CARDINAL of the towns of GPE . The defendant insisted that the right multiplier , reflecting situation in the whole GPE , was CARDINAL . Furthermore , the statistical information referred to by the courts had not been properly examined at the hearing .

On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as upheld on appeal , stating that the first and second instance courts ' calculation of the minimum subsistence amount based on the multiplier CARDINAL had been insufficiently supported by evidence . The ORG noted that in support of its findings the lower courts referred to a letter of the Deputy Minister of Labour ; however , the original of that letter was missing and the court had only a photocopy of it . The ORG further noted that the lower courts had not verified the authenticity of that letter , and , therefore , their findings had been based on inadmissible evidence .

As a result , the court held that the amount due to the applicants for DATE was ORG CARDINAL per month and per person . Starting from DATE the pension should have amounted to ORG per month , except for Mr PERSON , whose pension was RUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .

Supervisory review of a judicial decision which entered in force is permitted only \u201c in exceptional circumstances , when , as a result of a judicial error , committed at an earlier stage of the proceedings , which was decisive for the outcome of the case , the rights and judicially protected lawful interests of the participants of the proceedings were significantly affected , and they can not be restored without quashing the judicial decision \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It is primarily for the courts of appeal to oversee the lawfulness and reasonableness of the lower courts ' decisions . The supervisory review may be used only if all \u201c normal \u201d legal avenues have been exhausted by the initiator of the review . ORG referred in this respect to the case of PERSON v. GPE , decided by ORG ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW CCivP supervisory review is possible when there are \u201c serious violations of the substantive and procedural laws \u201d by the lower courts . The wording used by the CCivP is not very precise , but the notion of \u201c serious violation \u201d is not susceptible to any clear definition and can not be reduced to a limited number of instances where the review is possible . The courts should have a certain margin of appreciation in interpreting that provision , to the extent that their case - law is uniform .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CCivP ( see above ) give certain guidelines for defining what kind of judicial errors may trigger the supervisory review . However , given the role of the supervisory review instance , it should not substitute the review by the court of appeal . Referring to the case - law of ORG , ORG noted that the supervisory review should not be an appeal in disguise and that the mere existence of CARDINAL opposite views on the subject of a civil dispute was not a good reason for reviewing the final judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The power of the judge to initiate the review without hearing the parties is not contrary to LAW . However , the decision not to proceed with the case may be challenged in an appeal to the President of the court , who can reverse it . ORG held that such a complaint may be lodged with the President only within the DATE time - limits provided by LAW", "CARDINAL . In addition , the supervisory review complaint can be brought before a higher instance . In paragraph CARDINAL of ORG noted that the existing provisions of the ORG allowed bringing CARDINAL consecutive supervisory review complaints . Furthermore , the time spent by the supervisory review instances on examining these complaints is not included in the DATE time - limit provided by LAW . As a result , the overall duration of the proceedings may be indefinitely long , up to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court recognised that in certain circumstances the current system of supervisory review could be in breach of the legal certainty principle . However , ORG explicitly refrained from declaring the provisions of the ORG unconstitutional .
