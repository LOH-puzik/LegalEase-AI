From DATE to CARDINAL DATE S. , the head of the department , was on temporary leave and seconded to ORG ( ORG ) . Initially , the applicant replaced him .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG for an extended extra duties allowance ( PERSON ) to compensate for her additional work load and responsibility as acting head of the department .", "On DATE PERSON was appointed as provisional head of the department for internal auditing . This appointment was made public in DATE .", "On DATE the responsible civil servant in ORG qualified the applicant \u2019s request as one for a simple extra duties allowance ( PERSON ) and transmitted this request for approval to ORG ( Bundeskanzleramt ) .", "On DATE ORG , in a summary decision ( Dienstrechtsmandat ) , granted the applicant a simple extra duties allowance for the period from DATE until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed objections ( PERSON ) against the summary decision . She submitted that PERSON , head of the department for external auditing , had been appointed as provisional head of the department for internal auditing on DATE . This appointment was only effective as of CARDINAL DATE . As she had not been officially removed from her position as acting head of the department , she continued to occupy that position after M \u2019s appointment . Consequently , she was entitled to an extended extra duties allowance after DATE . Though the calculation of the allowance had to be altered after PERSON had started to work on DATE , the allowance could not be cancelled completely .

She submitted that the former head of the department had decided to stay permanently with ORG . The post of the head of the department was therefore vacant . As she had never been removed from her functions as actual head of the department , and as someone was needed in the department who did not exercise any incompatible functions , she was still the provisional head of the department . Since only the abstract scope of her responsibilities was decisive for the allowance , she had a right to a simple extra duties allowance until DATE , on which date she had been seconded to ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint .
