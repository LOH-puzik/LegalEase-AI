A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix . They are all citizens of GPE and were represented by TRIAL ( ORG ) , a non - profit organisation based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . After its declaration of independence on DATE , a brutal war started in GPE . It would appear that CARDINAL people lost their lives and CARDINAL people were displaced in the course of the war . It is estimated that around CARDINAL people went missing and that around DATE of them is still missing . The conflict came to an end on DATE when ORG in GPE entered into force . In accordance with that Agreement , GPE consists of CARDINAL Entities , ORG and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to atrocities then taking place in GPE , on DATE ORG passed LAW establishing ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , headquartered in GPE . CARDINAL individuals have already been convicted and proceedings are ongoing for CARDINAL accused . In the period from DATE until DATE , local prosecutors in GPE and GPE were required to submit case files to the ORG for review ; no person could be arrested on suspicion of war crimes unless ORG had received the case file beforehand and found it to contain credible charges ( the \u201c Rules of the Road \u201d procedure ) . Moreover , the ORG had primacy over national courts and could take over national investigations and proceedings at any stage in the interest of international justice . As part of the ORG \u2019s completion strategy , in DATE war crimes chambers were set up within ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) with primacy over other courts in GPE as regards war crimes ( for information about that court and its jurisdiction over war crimes cases , see ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . CARDINAL persons have been finally convicted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG on ORG ( \u201c the ICMP \u201d ) was established at the initiative of GPE President PERSON in DATE . It is currently headquartered in GPE . Reportedly , the ICMP has so far identified by DNA CARDINAL missing persons in GPE , whereas local authorities have identified CARDINAL missing persons by traditional methods . In DATE the Government of GPE and the ICMP established a ORG , also headquartered in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It became operational on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the DATE - CARDINAL war , the population of the municipality of PERSON was ethnically mixed : according to a DATE census , out of a total population of CARDINAL , PERCENT were ORG , PERCENT NORP , PERCENT NORP ; PERCENT others . On DATE ORG took control of the city of PERSON pursuant to a secret plan made in advance ( notably , ORG of the ORG of the NORP People in GPE in a State of Emergency , adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE ) . Shortly thereafter , ethnic cleansing began . By DATE , there were practically no FAC and NORP left in the municipality of PERSON ( about the situation in the PERSON area at that time , see the ORG judgment in the PERSON and ORG case , ORG , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , not yet final ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL applicants lived with their families in GPE ( all but Ms PERSON and Mr PERSON ) and the remaining applicants in LANGUAGE , in the PERSON area . Following the takeover of PERSON , tension developed between the new NORP authorities and ORG , which contained a large concentration of Bosniacs : of the CARDINAL inhabitants of GPE town , PERCENT were ORG . ORG was attacked by NORP forces on DATE . The attack began with heavy shelling , followed by the advance of tanks and infantry . The purported reason for the attack was the death of a NORP soldier . As a result of the shelling , over QUANTITY inhabitants were killed . After the local PERSON population had attempted to put up a resistance , a large number of people surrendered on DATE . The military - aged men were taken to ORG camps and the rest of the population to PERSON camp . People who initially fled into the nearby mountains were sought out there or surrendered either to be killed or to be taken to camps . Eventually , the few NORP inhabitants of ORG returned and NORP displaced from other areas moved into GPE ( see the ORG judgment in the PERSON case , LAW , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ; the ORG judgment in the PERSON case , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ; the ORG judgment in the PERSON and ORG case , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .

Around CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE Room CARDINAL at ORG camp , which had up to that time held people from ORG , was emptied . CARDINAL new detainees from different villages , including PERSON , were crammed into that room . For DATE , the detainees were denied food and were subjected to beatings and abuse .

At the arraignment of DATE , the accused pleaded not guilty . However , on DATE , Mr GPE changed his plea to guilty . He was then sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for persecution as a crime against humanity committed in ORG camp in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the CARDINAL other accused , on CARDINAL DATE a Trial Chamber of ORG found them guilty of participation in the commission of killings , beatings , rapes and various other crimes in ORG camps as a part of a widespread and systematic attack against the non - NORP civilian population of the municipality of PERSON , and sentenced them to CARDINAL ( Mr PERSON ) , DATE ( Mr GPE ) and DATE ( Mr GPE ) GPE imprisonment . On DATE an ORG of ORG reduced the sentence of PERSON to DATE and upheld the remainder of the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG assigned a special prosecutor in charge of crimes committed as a part of a widespread and systematic attack against the non - NORP civilian population of the municipality of PERSON in DATE with the aim of stepping up the prosecution of such crimes .

In DATE all the applicants lodged constitutional appeals alleging that the authorities\u2019 reaction to the disappearance of their relatives amounted to a breach of LAW , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and/or CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to join CARDINAL similar cases and rendered a group decision finding a breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It ordered the authorities to release any and all information in their custody pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the missing persons in issue and to ensure that the ORG agencies envisaged by LAW ( ORG and ORG ) become operational DATE . No compensation was awarded .", "CARDINAL . Under its mandate to examine complaints about non - enforcement of its decisions , on DATE ORG concluded that the decision of DATE , mentioned above , was to be considered enforced notwithstanding the fact that some of the ORG agencies envisaged by LAW ( precisely , ORG and ORG ) had not yet become operational . It held that no further action was required from ORG as the failure to enforce a similar decision had already been reported to ORG ( non - enforcement of a final and enforceable decision of ORG amounts to a criminal offence ; for the relevant law in that regard , see GPE v.
