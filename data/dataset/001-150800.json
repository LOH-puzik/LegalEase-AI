The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , which became final on DATE , ORG ( GPE ) authorised the applicant , who was then single , to adopt a child , PERSON , born on DATE to PERSON", "Consequently , under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( no . DATE ) , \u201c PERSON \u201d was registered as the surname of PERSON in the register of births and on the child \u2019s identity documents . However , the registrar refused to indicate the applicant \u2019s forename under the heading \u201c mother \u201d , where the name \u201c S. \u201d was retained , this being the forename of the child \u2019s biological mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG seeking the replacement of the forename \u201c S. \u201d by her own . In her view , the fact that her forename had not been given as that of the mother of her adopted son was both discriminatory and unconstitutional , likely to undermine their personal , family and social development , and thus constituting a violation of , among other provisions , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . She argued that in relation to single - parent adoptions there was a lacuna in LAW which required the court to make provision for such a situation of its own motion , pursuant to LAW or , failing that , to request a preliminary ruling of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that it had no legal basis . It found that LAW , in choosing to regulate only CARDINAL - parent adoptions \u2013 those granted to a couple jointly \u2013 , intended to treat the legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child as \u201c a biological relationship \u201d , which was not possible in the case of single - parent adoptions , where either a mother or a father was absent . Thus the legal situation obtaining in the present case could not be regarded as unconstitutional .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when those proceedings were still pending , a new regulation entered into force entitled \u201c Regulation on the implementation of mediation services for the adoption of minors \u201d ( \u201c the Regulation \u201d ) , enabling a single adoptive parent to have his or her forename registered in the place of that of the biological parent ...", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the court below in a judgment which made no mention of the legislative reform .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was notified of that judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE she applied to the registry office for the registration of her forename as that of the mother of PERSON , relying on LAW of the new ORG .
