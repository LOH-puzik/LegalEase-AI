NORP The applicant was suffering from a terminal illness \u2013 polycystic kidney and liver disease . It appears that it was first diagnosed in DATE . Up to DATE he underwent treatment DATE in GPE , GPE . From then until DATE he received treatment in GPE , GPE . Upon his return to GPE in DATE the applicant was admitted to the ORG civil hospital in R\u012bga on CARDINAL occasions for a total duration of DATE in DATE and on CARDINAL occasions for a total duration of DATE in DATE . It appears that he also visited that hospital CARDINAL times a week for haemodialysis ( artificial kidney ) sessions .", "CARDINAL . At least since DATE the applicant had been recognised as being Category CARDINAL disabled ( the most severe degree of disability ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , on DATE the applicant was convicted of acquisition of narcotics and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , which was suspended due to his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on the street on suspicion of possessing drugs . A preventive measure \u2013 police supervision \u2013 was imposed on him . Following forensic examinations , it was established that the applicant had been in possession of CARDINAL packages of cannabis , in total QUANTITY . Criminal proceedings were opened , charges were brought against the applicant and the case was sent to ORG ( PERSON apgabaltiesa ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG ( PERSON vietu p\u0101rvalde ) to state whether it could ensure appropriate medical treatment for the applicant in custody . On DATE ORG replied that the applicant was suffering from a severe and terminal illness and that his prospects were poor . They contended that they could not provide the necessary medical care to the applicant , or ensure his regular attendance ( CARDINAL times per week ) at a specialised hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG ( NORP tiesu medic\u012bnas ekspert\u012bzes centrs ) to evaluate the applicant \u2019s state of health and determine if he was fit to serve a custodial sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE forensic experts drew up report no . CARDINAL-K , which concluded that the applicant was suffering from a severe and terminal illness \u2013 polycystic kidney and liver disease , as well as from chronic kidney failure , secondary hypertension , secondary anaemia , coronary heart disease , a form of stenocardia , and an old myocardial infarction . It stated that in order to survive he needed CARDINAL TIME haemodialysis sessions per week in a hospital , but that permanent inpatient treatment was not necessary . The forensic experts reached the conclusion that the applicant was fit to serve a custodial sentence upon the condition that his transfers to a specialised centre for haemodialysis were ensured and that he received medicine prescribed by a nephrologist and a cardiologist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of the repeated acquisition of narcotics . The applicant pleaded guilty . The court took into consideration forensic report no . CARDINAL-K and stated its agreement with it ; it had \u201c critically evaluated \u201d ORG contention that they could not provide the necessary medical care .

Taking into account that the applicant had breached a previous suspended DATE custodial sentence , the court joined both sentences and determined a total custodial sentence of DATE . The custodial sentence was suspended until his conviction took effect ; a preventive measure of police supervision was imposed until then .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment . He requested that his sentence be changed to a more lenient one . He argued that , taking into account his state of health and the fact that it was not possible to provide him with the necessary medical care in prison , a custodial sentence would amount to a death penalty . He noted that the first - instance court had rejected ORG contention without any reasoning . He also pointed out that the outcome of the case would affect his partner and their minor son . On DATE ORG ( GPE tiesas GPE tiesu pal\u0101ta ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , while the applicant was still at liberty , the appellate court , upon an application from the police department , decided to change the preventive measure of police supervision to a less restrictive one . It was noted that supervision of the applicant had become difficult because of his state of health . The applicant was instead required not to change his place of residence and he was thus no longer subject to police supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . The court considered that , regardless of ORG contention , the applicant had to receive a custodial sentence under the penal law . It was noted that ORG had an obligation to organise the execution of custodial sentences .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG departaments ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ; the applicant \u2019s conviction took effect . The ORG established that the sentence imposed on the applicant was the minimum sentence provided for in law for the type of offence ; a more lenient sentence ( than that provided for in law ) was impossible since the applicant had reoffended . The ORG noted that a court could release a prisoner under section DATE , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW if he or she had fallen ill with a severe and incurable illness after the pronouncement of the judgment . The applicant , however , had been suffering from an incurable illness since long before his conviction . Moreover , his illness had not prevented him from committing an especially serious offence . The ORG pointed out that under section CARDINAL of the LAW emergency medical care was available to detainees , if necessary in a civil setting . ORG was under an obligation to organise the execution of custodial sentences ; if such execution became impossible , section CARDINAL of the Law of Criminal Procedure provided for the possibility of release on health grounds .

According to the Government , the applicant was placed in the inpatient treatment unit and prison doctors attended to and examined him DATE , on DATE more than once , because of high arterial blood pressure . For the same reason , an emergency ambulance was often called . The applicant received CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions in a civil hospital in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE it was recorded that his health had deteriorated and he was placed in a civil hospital in GPE , where he remained until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was transferred to the prison hospital in GPE for medical treatment ; he remained there for DATE . The applicant was taken for CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions in the ORG hospital during that period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical commission ( consisting of doctors from ORG , the prison hospital and FAC ) examined the applicant . They established that the applicant was suffering from the same illnesses as mentioned in forensic report no . CARDINAL-K , but that his state of health had deteriorated . The applicant \u2019s body had reacted badly to haemodialysis : his arterial blood pressure had been extremely high after the sessions and it had remained high on DATE when he was not on haemodialysis ; this had caused complications for the applicant \u2019s heart ( stenocardia seizures ) , for which qualified medical assistance could not be provided in prison .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the medical commission \u2019s report , the administration of ORG applied to ORG Valmieras rajona tiesa ) for permission to release the applicant on account of his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NORP cilv\u0113kties\u012bbu birojs ) , following a complaint by the applicant , issued an opinion , which was not binding on the domestic authorities , inviting ORG to release the applicant on health grounds . It was noted that the prison authorities were not in a position to provide the requisite medical assistance to detainees because of a lack of financial resources . CARDINAL % of the necessary financial resources had been allocated in DATE for medical assistance in prisons . They noted that these budget cuts had meant in practice that the scope of primary and secondary medical care was significantly reduced and that preventive care ( screening for GPE , ORG and HIV / AIDS ) was largely limited . Therefore , ORG contention that they could not provide the necessary medical care to the applicant held true . It also had to be taken into account that CARDINAL prisoners were being held in penal institutions and that every CARDINAL of them was entitled to an equal amount of medical care . Finally , in support of their argument that the prison authorities were not in a position to ensure adequate medical assistance , they referred to the ORG \u2019s ruling in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the application for release . It also had before it the opinion of ORG . Following a hearing in the presence of the applicant \u2019s representative , the court released the applicant from the further serving of his custodial sentence on the grounds of section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW .
