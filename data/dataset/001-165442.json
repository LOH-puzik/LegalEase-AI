The applicants were brought up in GPE . Since DATE the husband ( the first applicant ) had run his own construction and transport business with exclusively NORP clients and had had his office at GPE military base \u201c GPE camp \u201d ( seemingly referring to ORG ) . Several of his employees had on occasion been warned not to cooperate with the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was the target of a murder attempt carried out by ORG . He had to stay in hospital for DATE . There , unknown men asked for him , after which he was treated in CARDINAL different hospitals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE his brother was kidnapped by ORG members , who claimed that they would kill him because of the first applicant \u2019s collaboration with the NORP . His brother was released through bribery DATE and immediately fled from GPE . The applicants fled to GPE and stayed there until DATE , before returning to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards , ORG members placed a bomb next to the applicants\u2019 house . However , it was detected by the first applicant \u2019s wife ( the second applicant ) , and the NORP forces arrested the perpetrator . During interrogation , the perpetrator confessed that he had been paid by ORG to kill the first applicant and disclosed the names of CARDINAL people who had been designated to watch the applicants . Thereafter , the applicants moved to GPE , although the first applicant continued his business in GPE . During this time , ORG destroyed their home and the first applicant \u2019s business stocks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants returned to GPE . In DATE the first applicant and his daughter were shot at when driving . The daughter was taken to hospital , where she died . The first applicant then stopped working and the family moved to a series of different locations in GPE . The first applicant \u2019s business stocks were attacked CARDINAL times by ORG members , who had threatened the guards . The first applicant stated that he had not received any personal threats since DATE as the family had repeatedly moved around . The son ( the third applicant ) had spent most of his time indoors for fear of attacks and had only attended school for his final examinations . The applicants had never asked the domestic authorities for protection , fearing that the authorities lacked the ability to protect them and might disclose their address , on account of ORG \u2019s collaboration with the authorities . The applicants maintained that , in the event of their return to GPE , they risked persecution by ORG and that the first applicant appeared on ORG death list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE . On DATE his application was rejected since he was registered as having left the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied anew for asylum and a residence permit in GPE , as did the other applicants on DATE . As to their state of health , the first applicant still had an open and infected wound on his stomach where he had been shot in DATE . They submitted several documents , including identity papers , a death certificate for the first and second ORG daughter and a medical certificate for the first applicant \u2019s injury .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL applicants were given an introductory interview by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on DATE . Subsequently , the first and second applicants were given a further interview on CARDINAL DATE , which lasted CARDINAL . The third applicant was interviewed briefly for a second time and the first applicant was interviewed a third time . The applicants were assisted by ORG - appointed counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum application . In respect of the NORP authorities\u2019 ability to provide protection against persecution by non - State actors , the ORG stated :", "\u201c ...", "Every citizen should have access to police authorities within a reasonable visiting distance . During DATE the police authorities have taken numerous measures to fight against corruption , clan and militia connections and pure criminality within the police .", "The current country information , however , shows that there are serious shortcomings in the police \u2019s work on crime - scene investigations and inquests . CARDINAL of the reasons is probably that many police officers are relatively new and lack experience , and that it takes time to introduce a new method of investigation based on technical evidence . This problem is naturally accentuated by the fact that many individual police officers live under a threat emanating from different terrorist groups , which is likely to diminish their effectiveness . Nevertheless , the current country information shows that the number of suspects who have been prosecuted during DATE has increased significantly . Even if CARDINAL of all suspects are eventually prosecuted , this is still an improvement .", "The NORP security forces have been reinforced significantly and no longer have any shortcomings in human terms . Instances of police infiltration , which were previously widespread , have decreased significantly . The leading representatives of the police authority have expressed both their willingness and their ambition to maintain general security in GPE . The current country information also shows that it has become more difficult for ORG GPE to operate freely in GPE and that there has been a significant decline in sectarian violence . DATE violence is mainly aimed at individual targets , especially civil servants , police , security forces and some minorities .", "... \u201d", "Regarding the assessment of the applicants\u2019 refugee status , as well as their need for alternative protection , the ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ...", "ORG notes that [ the first applicant ] had a contract with the NORP until DATE . For this reason [ the first applicant ] has been exposed to CARDINAL murder attempts , his brother has been kidnapped and [ the first and second applicant ] \u2019s daughter has been killed . Furthermore , on several occasions , [ the first applicant ] has suffered physical damage to his house and stock . [ The first and second applicants ] are convinced that ORG is behind these abuses . The family are also afraid of ORG in the event of their return .", "ORG notes that [ the first applicant ] stopped working for the NORP in DATE after his and [ the second applicant ] \u2019s daughter was killed . ORG further notes that [ the first applicant ] stayed in GPE until DATE and that [ the second and third applicants ] lived in GPE until DATE . During this period they were not exposed to any direct abuses . [ The first applicant ] has , however , been indirectly threatened on CARDINAL occasions by the people who guard his stock . Also , his stock has been attacked . [ The first and second applicants ] explained that they had managed to escape from abuses because they were in hiding and living in different places in GPE . ORG notes that [ the first and second applicants ] have CARDINAL daughters who live with their grandmother in GPE and a daughter who is married and lives with her family in GPE . These family members have not been exposed to any threats or abuses .", "ORG notes that the abuses which the family claim to be at risk of being exposed to are criminal acts which their home country \u2019s authorities have a duty to prosecute . In order to decide whether the family can enjoy protection against the abuses they fear , ORG notes the following .", "In accordance with the principle that it is for an asylum - seeker to justify his or her need for protection and that it is primarily for the applicant to provide relevant information for the assessment in the case , the onus must be on the applicant to plead that he or she can not or , owing to a severe fear of the consequences , for example , will not avail himself or herself of the protection of the authorities available in GPE . In addition , the applicant must justify this . The shortcomings which still exist in the NORP legal system are then to be noted and evaluated in the context of the individual assessment of each asylum case . The circumstances on which an applicant relies in arguing that protection by the authorities is deficient are first of all examined in the usual way . In those cases in which the alleged risk of persecution or other abuses does not emanate from the authorities , which as a rule is the case in GPE , the applicant must show what efforts he or she has made to be afforded protection by the authorities . The applicant can do this either by relying on evidence or by giving a credible account of events which appear plausible . When assessing the authorities\u2019 ability to protect against threats of violence emanating from terrorist groups or unknown perpetrators in a specific case , the individual \u2019s situation , as well as the severity of the violence or threats , their nature and their local reach , must be assessed individually ( see ORG , Legal opinion on protection by the authorities in GPE , DATE , GPE DATE ) .", "ORG considers that the family have been exposed to the most serious forms of abuses ( ytterst allvarliga \u00f6vergrepp ) by ORG from DATE until DATE . Such abuses , however , took place DATE and nowadays it is more difficult for ORG to operate freely in GPE . [ The first and second applicants ] never turned to the NORP authorities for protection . [ The first applicant ] has stated that the NORP authorities lack the capacity to protect the family . Further , he has stated that he did not dare to turn to the authorities because he would then have been forced to disclose his address , which could have resulted in ORG being able to find him . [ The second applicant ] has stated that ORG works together with the authorities . As stated earlier , ORG finds that there has been a significant decline in instances of police infiltration , which previously were widespread . Against the background of the fact that [ the first and second applicants ] have not even tried to seek the protection of the NORP authorities , ORG considers that they have not made a plausible case that they would not have access to protection by the authorities in the event of potential threats from ORG upon returning to GPE .", "Against this background , ORG finds that [ the first and second applicants ] have not made a plausible case that the NORP authorities lack the capacity and the will to protect the family from being exposed to persecution within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW or to abuses within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL , first subsection , first point , first line , of LAW . ORG notes in this context that there is no armed conflict in GPE . ORG therefore finds that the family are not to be regarded as refugees or as being in need of alternative or other protection , for which reason the family do not have the right to refugee status or alternative protection status .", "ORG notes that fierce tensions between opposing factions are prevalent in GPE . Nevertheless , against the background of the above reasoning , ORG finds that the family also can not be regarded as being otherwise in need of protection , within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL , first subsection , of LAW . The family do not therefore have any right to a status falling under any other need of protection .", "... \u201d", "In conclusion , ORG found that there were no grounds to grant the family residence permits . Against this background , ORG rejected the family \u2019s application and ordered their deportation from GPE on the strength of LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining that the NORP authorities had been and would be unable to protect them . They had contacted the police following the fire to their home and the first applicant \u2019s business stock in DATE and DATE and the murder of the first and second applicants\u2019 daughter in DATE , but thereafter they had not dared to contact the authorities owing to the risk of disclosing their residence . Together with their written submissions , they enclosed a translated written statement allegedly from a neighbour in GPE , who stated that a masked terrorist group had come looking for the first applicant on DATE at TIME and that the neighbour had told them that the applicants had moved to an unknown place . The neighbour also stated that , just after the incident , the first applicant had called him and been told about the incident . The applicants also submitted a translated residence certificate / police report allegedly certifying that their house had been burned down by a terrorist group on CARDINAL DATE . Furthermore , the applicants submitted a DVD containing an audiovisual recording of a public debate on television concerning corruption and the infiltration of ORG members within the NORP administration . The applicants mentioned in that connection that the first applicant had participated in the public debate , which had been broadcast on the ORG channel in GPE on DATE , that is to say , DATE . Finally , submitting various medical certificates , the applicants contended that the first applicant \u2019s health had deteriorated and that he could not obtain adequate hospital care in GPE .", "ORG made submissions before ORG . It stated , among other things , that the documents submitted concerning the alleged incidents on DATE and CARDINAL DATE were of a simple nature and of little value as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . Concerning the need for protection , the court held :", "\u201c It is undisputed in the present case that the applicants\u2019 grounds for protection must be examined in relation to GPE . The general situation in GPE is not such that as to confer the automatic right to a residence permit . Therefore , an individual assessment of the grounds for protection invoked by the applicants must be made .", "The applicants have alleged that they are in need of protection upon returning to GPE as they risk being exposed to ill - treatment by ORG because [ the first applicant ] \u2019s company did contract - based work for the NORP in GPE until DATE .", "ORG considers that the alleged events took place in the distant past , that it is difficult to see why there would still be a threat as [ the first applicant ] no longer performs such work , and that , in the event that some threats should still exist , it appears likely [ framst\u00e5r som troligt ] that the NORP law - enforcement authorities are both willing and able to offer the applicants the necessary protection . In such circumstances , there are no grounds to grant the applicants any residence permit on the basis of a need for protection .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) . Their request for leave to appeal was refused on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted an application to ORG for a re - examination of their case . They maintained that the first applicant was under threat from ORG because he had been politically active . They enclosed a video showing the first applicant being interviewed in LANGUAGE , a video showing a demonstration , and a video showing a television debate .", "CARDINAL .
