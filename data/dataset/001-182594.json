Moreover , the applicant had claimed that she was not able to use the land , more specifically , to construct buildings on it , but she needed to have a detailed plan of the land prepared in order to start any construction on the land , which she had not done . The court further held that the applicant \u2019s request that the authorities be obliged to remove the underground telecommunications cables was unfounded , because the cables had been installed in accordance with the provisions of domestic law . The applicant \u2019s claim was thus dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , and on DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision .

On DATE ORG held that there was no dispute that the applicant \u2019s rights to QUANTITY had not been restored .

The court stated that the national authorities had taken various steps : they had provided data about unoccupied land and had asked the applicant to decide how she wished her property rights to be restored . The applicant \u2019s requests submitted to the authorities for compensation \u201c in a convertible currency at world market prices \u201d and for compensation at market prices in accordance with the land value map for DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) could not constitute a proper way of expressing her decision , because such methods of compensation had not been defined in the domestic law .

As regards her request that the authorities be obliged to restore her property rights within DATE , the court noted that she had to use an out - of - court procedure , and left that complaint unexamined .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and also asked to be awarded compensation in respect of pecuniary damage amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the first - instance court had been obliged to examine the applicant \u2019s request to have her property rights restored , but it had not examined all the documents submitted . It therefore returned the case to ORG for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that on DATE the applicant had submitted a request to have her property rights to QUANTITY of her father \u2019s land restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the applicant and her sister had agreed that the applicant had a right to have her property rights to QUANTITY of her father \u2019s land restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The authorities had restored her property rights to QUANTITY of land on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , and on DATE her property rights to another QUANTITY of land had been restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The latter decision indicated that the applicant \u2019s property rights to the remaining plot of QUANTITY would be restored at DATE , when the land reform project had been prepared . No land reform project had been prepared , because the land in question was in an area that had been within city boundaries before DATE , so the indication in the decision about the land reform project being prepared had been a mistake . In DATE the applicant had been asked to choose the form of compensation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but she had sent several letters submitting requests that were not possible under domestic law .", "The court further held that the authorities had examined numerous complaints submitted by the applicant and her son . The court further referred to the administrative proceedings regarding the applicant \u2019s alleged inability to use CARDINAL plot of land that had been returned to her ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , and the civil proceedings regarding the sale of the plot of land of QUANTITY to GPE , started by ORG ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . The court also noted that the applicant had been informed about the possibility of receiving a plot of forest of equal value ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court held that there was no dispute that the applicant \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of land had not been restored . However , the applicant \u2019s claims for compensation could only be satisfied if unlawful actions by the authorities had been established . The restitution process was carried out by ORG and its territorial divisions . The court decided that , in the applicant \u2019s case , the authorities had carried out their functions by : sending information about the methods by which the applicant \u2019s rights could be restored ; providing information about vacant land ; and asking the applicant to express her choice as to the method of restitution . The relevant domestic law valid at the time the applicant had asked for compensation \u201c in a convertible currency at world market prices \u201d in DATE had provided that , before DATE , a citizen could declare or change the method of restitution . If no method was chosen , the authorities could choose for the citizen . The relevant domestic law valid at the time the applicant had asked for compensation at market prices and in accordance with the land value map for DATE had provided that , before DATE , a citizen could change the method of restitution and choose compensation in securities instead of monetary compensation . The relevant domestic law valid at the material time when the case had been examined had provided that , until DATE , citizens could change the method of restitution and ask to have their property rights restored by being provided with a plot of forest of equal value in a rural area . If no method was chosen , property rights were restored by means of monetary compensation . The court held that the authorities could only choose the method of restitution for a citizen if he or she had not expressed his or her decision before DATE .", "In the applicant \u2019s situation , ORG had not issued any decision within the required DATE time - limit , and thus the applicant had a right to receive compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The court held that the applicant \u2019s right to have her property rights to QUANTITY restored had not been denied , and decided to award her FAC in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The remaining part of the applicant \u2019s complaint was dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , ORG and the ORG , represented by ORG , appealed . On DATE ORG held that it was clear from the case material that there was no more vacant land in the area where the applicant \u2019s father had had his land . For this reason , the applicant \u2019s demand that the authorities be obliged to return her father \u2019s land in natura within DATE of the court \u2019s decision becoming final ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was unfounded . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument that her father \u2019s plot of land of QUANTITY had been sold to ORG owing to unlawful actions by ORG , the court held that this argument had been rebutted by the decisions issued by the domestic courts in other proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As regards the length of the restitution process , the court decided that there was no information indicating that the authorities had acted unlawfully , and thus the firstinstance decision to award the applicant compensation of EUR CARDINAL had been unfounded . In DATE the applicant had expressed her wish to have her father \u2019s land returned to her in natura ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE she had asked for compensation \u201c in a convertible currency at world market prices \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; in DATE she had asked for compensation at market prices in accordance with the land value map for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; in DATE she had asked for compensation at market prices plus PERCENT interest ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) ; and in DATE she had stated that her choice as to the method of restitution had been expressed in DATE , and she was not going to change her mind ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The authorities had informed the applicant several times that her requested methods of compensation were not possible under domestic law . In DATE the applicant had been informed that if a citizen did not express a decision as to a method of restitution before DATE , the authorities had to issue decisions taking into account the method indicated in the citizen \u2019s last request ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the authorities had indicated the method by which the compensation would be calculated and had stated that the value of the QUANTITY of land which had to be restored to the applicant would be LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) if the applicant preferred to acquire the land in another area , and LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) if she preferred compensation in securities ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . In DATE the authorities had asked the applicant to choose the method of restitution : receiving either an area of land , forest or water of equal value ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the authorities had repeatedly explained that the applicant could receive either a plot of land of equal value or compensation in securities , and should she fail to make a decision then she would be paid compensation in securities ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . In DATE the applicant had been asked to come to ORG of ORG to discuss the issue of restitution ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the authorities had informed the applicant that it had become possible to have a plot of forest of equal value in a rural area ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court further held that the actions of ORG had been lawful , considering that the applicant \u2019s requests had not been possible under domestic law . Moreover , the authorities had stated that a decision to pay the applicant monetary compensation would be issued . The court therefore decided to change the first - instance decision and not award the applicant any compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant sent a letter to the authorities stating that she had expressed her decision on the method of restitution in DATE when she had asked for the return of her father \u2019s land in natura .

In DATE the authorities replied that the remaining part of the land to which the applicant \u2019s property rights had to be restored was ORG redeemable and could not be returned in natura . The authorities further stated that the applicant would be paid monetary compensation . The applicant replied to this letter in DATE and accused the authorities of unlawfully expropriating property . The authorities replied in DATE and repeated that it was not possible to return the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s land in natura . The applicant replied , stating that the authorities\u2019 letter contained no substantive reasons and could not be taken into account . The applicant stated that the issue of restitution in her case would be considered in the courts , and asked the authorities not to bother her with letters containing no substantive reasons .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the authorities asked the applicant to come to a meeting on DATE and familiarise herself with the draft decision restoring her property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision to restore the applicant \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of land by paying her monetary compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant asked the authorities to provide her with copies of plans of vacant land plots situated in the area in which her father had had his land , and to explain how and when her father \u2019s land had been used . The authorities replied in DATE that ORG provided information in map form about vacant land that was not ORG redeemable . The relevant GPE division had to mark the borders of land which an owner had owned DATE in accordance with the information received from ORG . In the applicant \u2019s case , ORG had provided the relevant GPE division with information about vacant land plots . The GPE land reform division had then asked ORG to prepare land plans . CARDINAL plots of land had been returned to the applicant in natura in DATE . In DATE the GPE land reform division had asked ORG to additionally examine whether there was vacant land in the area where the applicant \u2019s father had owned land DATE , but it had been established that there was no more vacant land .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a claim with the domestic court , asking it to annul the decision of ORG of DATE by which her property rights to QUANTITY of land had been restored and it had been decided that she would receive monetary compensation of ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant thought that the land that had not been returned to her had not been used for public use , and that ORG had not provided any information as to why all of her father \u2019s land had not been returned in natura .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints . The court held that her father \u2019s land was not vacant , as it was occupied by cadastral areas with or without buildings , areas containing infrastructure that was relevant for roads , side roads , underground infrastructure and the protective zones surrounding them , and recreational areas . There was a public interest in using that land , thus the land was ORG redeemable and compensation had to be paid for it . The court further assessed the actions of ORG and held that the authorities\u2019 actions had been lawful . This was because the applicant had not agreed with the information indicating that her father \u2019s land was not vacant , and because on one hand she had asked for her property rights to be restored in natura , and on the other hand had asked for compensation at \u201c market \u201d and \u201c world market \u201d prices , although there was no such possibility under domestic law . ORG compensation was also a way to restore property rights , as confirmed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The value of the land had been calculated in accordance with the method approved by the Government ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and the amount calculated for the applicant had been in accordance with that method . Moreover , the court referred to the case - law of the Court , where it had been established that no right to receive a higher amount of compensation was guaranteed under the applicable domestic law or by a decision of the domestic court ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The compensation calculated for the applicant was in line with domestic law and the practice of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
