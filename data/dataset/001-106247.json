The applicants , PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) and her CARDINAL children , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant entered GPE on DATE on a valid visit visa , accompanied by her CARDINAL eldest children . The first applicant remained in GPE following the expiry of her visa and did not come to the attention of the authorities until she claimed asylum in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The basis of her claim was that she had married in DATE and , when her eldest daughter was born in DATE , her husband \u2019s family had raised the idea of having both her and the first applicant herself circumcised . Both the applicant and her husband had been averse to the idea . However , the applicant and her husband had separated when she was pregnant with her son , who was born in DATE , and their marriage ended definitively in DATE . Her third child , a girl born in GPE in DATE , was the result of a brief reconciliation with her husband . The applicant claimed to fear that , without the support of her husband , she would not be able to withstand his family \u2019s pressure to have her CARDINAL daughters , and herself , circumcised .", "CARDINAL . Her asylum claim was refused on DATE . The Secretary of ORG noted that the applicant was no longer in contact with her husband or his family . The applicant had remained in GPE following her first daughter \u2019s birth , and even after separating from her husband , indicating that she did not genuinely fear her in - laws . Her last noted address had been in GPE , which was not where her in - laws lived . It was therefore believed that she could return to that city or relocate elsewhere in GPE and thus avoid her ex - husband \u2019s family , who would not be aware of her return , given their lack of contact . Furthermore , the background evidence indicated that the NORP authorities were taking steps to combat female genital mutilation ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and had successfully outlawed the practice in several states . There were a number of women \u2019s non - governmental organisations that could offer support to the first applicant . It was therefore considered that there was a sufficiency of protection available to her . She also had family , including CARDINAL brothers , living in GPE and would therefore have a support network . Her claim was certified as clearly unfounded , meaning that she could not appeal against the refusal of asylum from within GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was advised by her legal representatives that any application for judicial review of the decision to certify her claim had a very poor chance of succeeding , as her claim was weak . Since her case was publicly funded , her representatives could not bring such an application on her behalf given that there was no reasonable prospect of success . As a result of the withdrawal of publicly funded legal assistance , the first applicant did not seek judicial review of the certification of her asylum claim as clearly unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Directions were set for the applicants\u2019 removal on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , the applicants sought an interim measure from this ORG in order to prevent their removal . On DATE , the Acting President of the Fourth Section , to which the case had been allocated , indicated to the Government of GPE that the applicants should not be removed until further notice . Upon further consideration of the case , the LAW DATE lifted the interim measure previously indicated . The applicants notified the ORG on DATE that , notwithstanding the lifting of the interim measure under Rule CARDINAL , they wished to continue with their complaints under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE , as amended by ORG , etc ) Act DATE , provides that , where a person has made an asylum or human rights claim and the Secretary of ORG has certified that that claim is clearly unfounded , the person may not bring an appeal whilst still in GPE . A claim will be certified as clearly unfounded only where , taking the claim at its highest , on any legitimate view it could not succeed .", "CARDINAL . The only means by which a person can challenge the certification of their claim under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is by judicial review . The test that will be applied by the courts is whether , based on the material before the Secretary of ORG , there is a realistic prospect that an Immigration Judge , applying the rule of anxious scrutiny , would uphold an appeal ( see R ( on the application of ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
