De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr C. Crowley , a lawyer practising in GPE . The Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant joined the ORG in DATE at DATE and served until the expiry of his contract in DATE . He had competed internationally as a boxer . He served in ORG and held the rank of gunner . He married in DATE and had CARDINAL children with his wife .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claims that he was the victim of a series of sexual assaults ( groping and inappropriate touching ) by his superior officer , ORG , who held the rank of ORG . This began in DATE at a time of alleged personal difficulty for the applicant . At this time , he had been involved in a hit - and - run accident for which he was prosecuted as well as for driving under the influence of alcohol . The abuse typically involved ORG touching the applicant intimately , rubbing his own private parts against the applicant \u2019s body and physically forcing the applicant \u2019s hand to touch ORG \u2019s private parts , all of this through clothing . The abuse occurred in ORG \u2019s office and it continued until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that ORG could not have been unaware of ORG \u2019s proclivity to interfere with his subordinates . He alleges that he and CARDINAL other gunner were subjected to protracted ridicule in the mess ( canteen ) as the officer \u2019s \u201c bum boy \u201d . He did not at any time during his military career make a complaint about ORG \u2019s conduct . This , he claims , was partly out of shame and partly because ORG had , allegedly , threatened that he would be locked up if he reported the abuse and that the word of a gunner would not be taken over that of a Sergeant Major . In the applicant \u2019s view , the culture in ORG at that time was against making complaints . In the applicant \u2019s subsequent proceedings against the army , his wife gave evidence to ORG that his behaviour at that time began to deteriorate and that he had changed from being a model father and husband to being unrecognisable . In or DATE the applicant and his wife separated .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had left the army , CARDINAL other complaints were made against ORG by CARDINAL soldiers , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG filed a complaint of sexual assault by ORG which had allegedly occurred DATE during a room inspection and he sought to be discharged from the army because of it . The complaint was investigated by the military police who interviewed ORG and another officer involved in the room inspection .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their investigation report , dated DATE , the military police noted that while ORG claimed that the incident with ORG was the reason for his seeking discharge he had , in fact , already been seeking civilian employment for DATE before that time . It also noted ORG \u2019s disciplinary record . It noted Captain S \u2019s testimony that when he left the room the door was ajar and that ORG had followed him out of the room TIME . It had regard to the fact that ORG had a service record of DATE and had never before been the subject of any allegations . The report concluded that it had not been possible to prove ORG \u2019s allegation . ORG went on leave after this investigation and then decided to retire , leaving the army in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE RM confided in CARDINAL colleagues that he had had similar experiences to CP , but he declined to identify the person responsible . The colleagues DATE both of whom later gave statements to the police \u2013 raised their concerns with Captain PERSON He undertook to deal with the complaint and arranged for RM to meet with the army psychiatrist . He also asked if ORG was involved but RM was unwilling to discuss this and did not make any complaint against ORG at this time .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , the applicant happened to meet a former colleague of his , JW , who told him about the allegations that had been made concerning ORG . The applicant then told him of his experience with ORG but swore him to secrecy . PERSON , nevertheless , raised the matter immediately with his superior officer , Lieutenant Colonel C.", "CARDINAL . In DATE RM made a statement to the police about sexual assaults committed against him by ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . The police commenced an investigation during which they became aware of the allegations made by ORG and the applicant . They took statements from all CARDINAL men DATE . The police also interviewed several military officers and took statements from the CARDINAL soldiers who had brought ORG \u2019s situation to the attention of the military authorities , as well as from Captain PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP The police interviewed PD on DATE . He denied the allegations . DATE , however , during a second interview , he confessed to having sexually assaulted RM . He was then arrested . He continued to deny the allegations made by the applicant and by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the investigation file was submitted to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in respect of the CARDINAL complainants . In DATE the ORG directed ORG \u2019s prosecution in respect of RM \u2019s complaints and sought further information from the police concerning the applicant and ORG . The information was furnished in DATE . The initial decision of the ORG was not to prosecute ORG in respect of complaints made by the applicant and ORG . However , upon a request by the police the file was reviewed by the ORG who then issued a new direction in DATE to prosecute ORG in respect of the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG pleaded guilty to CARDINAL charges of sexual assault upon RM . On DATE he was formally convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended on condition that he enter a bond and agree to be of good behaviour and keep the peace for DATE . He was also fined ORG CARDINAL , which was to be paid to ORG , and was placed on the register of sexual offenders .", "CARDINAL . Following a criminal trial in DATE , the jury acquitted ORG in respect of certain charges and it failed to reach a verdict on other counts . A nolle prosequi ( withdrawal of charges ) was then entered in DATE in respect of the charges on which the jury had failed to reach a verdict .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant issued civil proceedings for damages against ORG , the Minister for Defence , GPE and the Attorney General . He was legally represented and his claim against ORG was settled in DATE in the sum of \u20ac MONEY without admission of liability .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claim against the remaining defendants ( the \u201c ORG defendants \u201d ) was heard by ORG and was based on CARDINAL alternative grounds . Firstly , he alleged that the ORG was vicariously liable for the actions of ORG . Secondly , he alleged that the ORG was directly negligent in that he claimed it had knowledge of ORG \u2019s behaviour such as would have alerted a reasonable person to take steps to inquire into or prevent the activities of ORG and that it had failed so to do . The trial commenced in ORG in DATE and heard numerous witnesses over the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court ( PERSON ) gave judgment on DATE , dismissing the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted that , on the civil standard of proof , that is , on the balance of probabilities , ORG had assaulted the applicant causing posttraumatic stress disorder . It then considered whether the ORG should be held vicariously liable for this . ORG reviewed all the relevant legal authorities that were opened to it on the question of vicarious liability , including NORP , NORP and NORP jurisprudence and it found :", "\u201c All of the above cases were cases which related to young and vulnerable children , which is not the situation in this case . The plaintiff was a married soldier at the time of the first incident and I do not think that the same principles that were applied in the cases of wardens of boarding schools and/or orphanages can be applied to the ORG . I have come to this conclusion after a good deal of consideration and some doubt . The doubt was created particularly by the fact of the control which the first named defendant had over the plaintiff , but overall I feel that the balance in this particular case lies against vicarious liability . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court then considered the separate question as to whether the ORG had been directly negligent and addressed this issue in terms of whether the authorities had been or should have been aware of ORG \u2019s behaviour at the relevant time . It stated :", "\u201c ... [ T]he evidence of the [ applicant ] and many of his witnesses is that there was general chat on a continual basis about [ ORG \u2019s ] activities , that it was well known and that it was the chat of the barrack room and the camp .", "This has been completely denied by all of the defendant \u2019s witnesses . Whereas I grant there is a distinction in rank between the [ applicant \u2019s ] witnesses and the defendant \u2019s witnesses , I came to the conclusion that all of them appear to be attempting to tell the truth .", "Therefore , I am satisfied that there was banter , possibly name calling and certainly general slagging , I think would be the correct way of putting it , and , though that may have been prevalent in the mess room at times , none of it was taken sufficiently seriously by any of the men , the ORG \u2019s and any other officers who may have heard it to be considered anything other than of a humorous nature .", "It is necessary to look at the incidents and at the evidence in light of the times as they then were . These events took place in the DATE \u2019s and DATE , at a time when the antenna of the ordinary reasonable person was far less acute to the potentials for sexual abuse or sexual assault than they are DATE . We must remember that , for DATE , the country has been subject to continual reports of sexual exploitation , sexual abuse and sexual assaults , all of which have tended to make the population a great deal more sensitive to matters which DATE would not have drawn any attention whatsoever .", "I am quite satisfied that had any of the ORG \u2019s or others , any real apprehension regarding the behaviour of [ ORG ] , they would have given notice of such apprehension one way or another through the preferred route as laid down in the ORG code or otherwise . I am reinforced in this view by the speedy action of [ JW ] , when informed by the [ applicant ] of the events which occurred , he immediately repeated to ORG and laid the [ applicant \u2019s ] claim before them , despite the fact that he had been bound by the [ applicant ] to secrecy . It is for this reason , I have come to the conclusion that , on the balance of probabilities , the [ applicant ] failed to discharge the onus of proof on him that , at the time of the incidents when the subject matter of these proceedings occurred , the level or content of the activities which were described in the mess room , in the bar and in the canteen were such as would have alerted a reasonable person and cause them to take steps to either enquire into or prevent the activities of [ ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG , which dismissed the case in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the negligence claim , ORG ( PERSON ) reviewed the evidence and did not interfere with the findings of fact made by ORG . The court acknowledged the evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s claims that the proclivities of ORG were known in army circles and that there was no satisfactory method of bringing a complaint . It also acknowledged the large number of witnesses for the defendants who had contested these claims , meaning there was also ample evidence against the applicant \u2019s case . The court referred to the various avenues of complaint that had been available to the applicant and the persons to whom he could have turned , in confidence , for help , such as the army chaplain or the social worker . The court recalled that its appellate role meant that it should only ensure that the primary findings of fact at trial and the inferences drawn from them were supported by the evidence . The trial judge had heard the witnesses directly and could assess their demeanour . He had been entitled to have regard to the fact that the applicant had never made a complaint about ORG , even though he had used the complaints procedure regarding another unrelated matter , thus demonstrating that he was aware of the existence of a complaints procedure and had been ready to use it . The evidence did not support the claim that soldiers were reluctant to make complaints or that the army was unreceptive to them . An expert witness had confirmed that the complaints procedures in place at that time in the army were good and sufficient by the standards then prevailing . The court also agreed with the trial judge \u2019s remarks about the importance of considering the issues in the light of the times as they then were and observed that it was \u201c a dangerous exercise in hindsight to apply knowledge and standards of DATE to events which occurred DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On the question of vicarious liability , ORG noted that the applicant did not challenge the correctness of the legal principles as emerged from the case law and as outlined by ORG . He had only challenged that court \u2019s application of those legal principles . The applicant had argued that , while his case did not concern a child , the environment of the armed forces was such that the normal rules of adult interaction did not apply given , inter alia , disparities in rank . ORG , however , concluded that the employment relationship between the applicant and ORG did not support finding of vicarious liability . It stated :", "\u201c While undoubtedly [ PD ] exercised a supervisory and disciplinary role where the [ applicant ] was concerned , he was not in the same position as a school teacher or boarding house warden in relation to a child . Nor was the nature of the employment one which would have encouraged close personal contact where some inherent risks might be said to exist as , for example , might arise if [ ORG ] had been a swimming instructor in close physical contact with young recruits . There was no intimacy implicit in the relationship between the [ applicant ] and [ PD ] nor was there any quasiparental role or responsibility for personal nurturing which was found to exist in the cases where vicarious liability was established . To hold otherwise would be to extend to ORG a virtual new species of liability where the defendants would be liable for virtually every act or omission of an employee . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to distinguish the relationship in issue in the applicant \u2019s case from that of a teacher and a child referring back to the case of O\u2019Keeffe v. PERSON [ DATE ] DATE . It held that while the O\u2019Keeffe case had involved a vulnerable child who was sexually abused by a teacher at school , the facts of the relationship between the parties in the instant case could hardly be more different . The applicant in this case was at all material times an adult . He had elected to accept the rigours , the discipline and the camaraderie associated with the life of a professional soldier . It must be accepted that the ORG require an atmosphere of discipline in order to function . A wide extension of liability would undermine the whole operational basis of any army .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s case fell short by a considerable margin of establishing the prerequisites for a finding that the ORG defendants should be held vicariously responsible for the criminal activities of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant took legal proceedings against the army on CARDINAL previous occasions while he was serving member of ORG . The first was a claim to ORG for damages for personal injuries ( deafness ) for which he was awarded compensation . CARDINAL military personnel had sued for damage to hearing caused by inadequate protective material . He also brought a personal injuries action against ORG arising from a road traffic accident and the case was settled .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a claim for compensation to ORG ( \u201c CICT \u201d ) in respect of the injury caused by the sexual assaults of ORG . His claim was rejected in DATE on the grounds of delay in reporting the crime . The applicant appealed . A hearing took place on DATE , leading to a decision of CARDINAL DATE in which he was awarded \u20ac CARDINAL compensation .", "CARDINAL . A general formal complaint system was established by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If an officer thinks himself wronged in any matter by any superior or other officer , including his commanding officer , he may complain thereof to his commanding officer and if , but only if , his commanding officer does not deal with the complaint to such officer \u2019s satisfaction , he may complain in the prescribed manner to the Minister who shall inquire into the complaint and give his directions thereon .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If any man thinks himself wronged in any matter by any officer , other than his company commander , or by any man he may complain thereof to his company commander , and if he thinks himself wronged by his company commander either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter , he may complain thereof to his commanding officer , and if he thinks himself wronged by his commanding officer , either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter , he may complain thereof in the prescribed manner to ORG , who , if so required by the man , shall report on the matter of the complaint to the Minister who shall inquire into the complaint and give his directions thereon .", "( CARDINAL ) Every officer to whom a complaint is made in pursuance of this section shall cause such complaint to be inquired into , and shall , if on inquiry he is satisfied of the justice of the complaint so made , take such steps as may be necessary for giving full redress to the complainant in respect of the matter complained of , and shall in every case inform the complainant in the prescribed manner as to what action has been taken in respect of the matter complained of . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act also provided for the trial of military and criminal charges by court - martial including within DATE of the retirement from ORG of the accused ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided that anyone subject to military law who illtreated any subordinate was guilty of an offence against military law and would , on conviction by court - martial , be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE or to any less punishment awardable by a courtmartial .", "CARDINAL . The Defence Forces Regulations ACARDINAL , adopted by the Minister under LAW , provided general guidance to commanding and other officers as to their responsibilities regarding discipline and misconduct . It also set out ( section CARDINALC ) a procedure for the submission of grievances during the general DATE inspection of the military unit by a General Officer Commanding . Notice of such inspections was given in advance with a reminder of the opportunity to bring forward any complaints .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the \u201c Administrative Instruction ACARDINAL \u201d was adopted pursuant to Regulations ACARDINAL . It was headed \u201c ORG in the LAW \u201d and it codified detailed procedures for making complaints in relation to unacceptable interpersonal behaviour to a company commander . Paragraph CARDINAL of that ORG accepted that the requirement to obey all lawful orders had to be counterbalanced by ensuring respectful and professional treatment and relationships between superiors of subordinates . Paragraph CARDINAL defined what was unacceptable sexual behaviour and gave specific examples including sexual assault and attempting to engage in or engaging in sexual activity by force , coercion or intimidation . Separate provisions governed \u201c sexual harassment \u201d including defining the notion , giving concrete examples and providing particular provisions for complaints having regard to the specific difficulties attached thereto .", "CARDINAL . ORG in the present case summarised the relevant principles applicable to the issue of vicarious liability by listing the factors for establishing whether or not impugned acts were carried out within the course and scope of employment . These principles are set out in the NORP cases of GPE v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL ( CARDINALth ) CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL D.L.R. ( CARDINALth ) CARDINAL ) , both of which concerned the sexual abuse of infant children .", "CARDINAL . In GPE case , ORG noted that the established common - law test was that employers were vicariously liable for employee acts authorised by the employer or unauthorised acts \u201c so connected with authorised acts that they may be regarded as modes ( albeit unauthorised modes ) of doing an authorised act \u201d . In noting that vicarious liability was generally appropriate where there was a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of a risk and the wrong that accrued therefrom , ORG set out the principles by which the sufficiency of the connection between the employer \u2019s creation and enhancement of the risk and the wrong complained of was to be determined . These included :", "\u201c ( a ) NORP The opportunity the enterprise afforded the employee to abuse his or her power ;", "( b ) The extent to which the wrongful act may have furthered the employer \u2019s aims ( and hence be more likely to have been committed by the employee ) ;", "( c ) The extent to which the wrongful act was related to friction , confrontation or intimacy inherent in the ORG enterprise ;", "( d ) The extent of power conferred on the employee in relation to the victims ; and", "( e ) The vulnerability of potential victims to wrongful exercise of the employee \u2019s power . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON case provided CARDINAL further principles :", "\u201c ( a ) A court should determine whether there are precedents which unambiguously determine on which side of the line between vicarious liability and no liability the case falls .", "( b ) If prior cases do not clearly suggest a solution , the next step is to determine whether vicarious liability should be imposed in light of the broader policy rationales behind strict liability . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both of these cases were analysed by ORG in GPE v. ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) and cited by ORG in the present case as the leading GPE authority on the issue . The plaintiffs in that case were residents in a school owned and managed by the defendants and they had been sexually abused by the warden .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON stated ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) :", "\u201c Employing the traditional methodology of LANGUAGE law , I am satisfied that in the case of the appeals under consideration the evidence showed that the employers entrusted the care of the children in ORG to the warden . The question is whether the warden \u2019s torts were so closely connected with his employment that it would be fair and just to hold the employers vicariously liable . On the facts of the case the answer is yes . After all , the sexual abuse was inextricably interwoven with the carrying out by the warden of his duties in ORG . Matters of degree arise . But the present case clearly falls on the side of vicarious liability . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A victim can apply for compensation for injury suffered as a result of violent crime under the statutory Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted . The Scheme is administered by the ORG . The prescription period is DATE but it can be extended , exceptionally . Compensation is paid without any inquiry into liability and on an ex gratia basis . It covers expenses and losses and , since DATE , it does not include compensation for non - pecuniary loss . The ORG will deduct sums received by a victim in compensation from another source including from a civil action against the offender ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
