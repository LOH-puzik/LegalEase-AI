It was set up under the laws of GPE in DATE and has its registered office in GPE . The applicant company was represented before the ORG by Mr J. Havl\u00e1t , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant company filed a criminal complaint ( trestn\u00e9 ozn\u00e1menie ) with ORG . It concerned a transaction involving the forced sale for an allegedly inadequate price by a judicial enforcement officer , via a stock - exchange broker , of shares of a private company for the settlement of an acknowledged debt to the applicant company . It was submitted that the sale had been manipulated in favour of the buyer and that , as a result , the debtor \u2019s capacity to discharge its other obligations towards the applicant company had been impaired . The complaint was aimed at bringing a criminal prosecution against CARDINAL individuals and securing the shares in question . The applicant company later submitted further information and precisely quantified its claim for damages .", "On DATE the investigator set the case aside on the ground that there was no indication that an offence had been committed . The decision indicated that it could be challenged by means of an interlocutory appeal ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) within DATE of its notification .", "The applicant company was informed of the decision of DATE by a letter delivered on DATE . The decision as such , however , was not served on the applicant company at that time .", "In DATE the police investigator informed the applicant company \u2019s representative that he was not entitled to consult the file . The proceedings were at the preliminary investigation stage and the file therefore contained no evidence which could be used in subsequent criminal proceedings . The possibility of inspecting criminal files extended exclusively to files which contained such evidence .", "The applicant subsequently unsuccessfully sought service of the decision of DATE and access to the file by making complaints to the public prosecution service at various levels .", "On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint with ORG against the public prosecution service , contending that its measures had denied the applicant company \u2019s procedural rights as a victim in that the decision of DATE had not been served on the applicant company and the company had not been allowed to consult the file . The applicant company relied , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the LAW and sought that the contested measures be quashed and that its costs and expenses be reimbursed .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE in response to the applicant company \u2019s constitutional complaint , ORG acknowledged that the applicant company \u2019s complaint was justified . The applicant company , in its procedural capacity as victim , had been entitled to be served with the impugned decision and to inspect the file . Concrete measures were being taken with a view to swiftly serving the investigator \u2019s decision on the applicant company and allowing its representative to inspect the file at any time . In his conclusion , ORG expressed the conviction that the reasons for the applicant company \u2019s constitutional complaint had thereby fallen away .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated that the investigator had set the case aside because no damage had been caused to the applicant company . Thus , the latter had not acquired the status of victim within the meaning of LAW . Accordingly , no breach of the procedural rights accruing to victims could have occurred in respect of the applicant company . ORG decision was served on the applicant company on DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE the decision of DATE had been served on the applicant company , which had subsequently lodged an interlocutory appeal contesting the investigator \u2019s factual and legal findings .", "On DATE the applicant company \u2019s legal representative consulted the file . The applicant company subsequently made a substantial submission setting out the reasons for the appeal .", "In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application , the ORG submitted a copy of a decision of ORG of DATE whereby it had dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal as unfounded , holding that despite extensive inquiry no elements had been established which justified a conclusion that any particular individual had committed a criminal offence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
