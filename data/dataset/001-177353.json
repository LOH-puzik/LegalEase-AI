He stated that on DATE in the basement of the court building the escort officers had made him perform different exercises , such as a wall - sit exercise , pushups and a \u201c duck walk \u201d .

However , they stated that video recordings were stored for DATE and then erased .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested an expert medical report .", "In respect of GPE , GPE and GPE the report concluded that their medical documentation contained no records of injuries sustained over the time period in question . In respect of the applicant the report stated that the description of the injuries contained in the medical documentation , in the record of the applicant \u2019s questioning by the police , and in the hearings transcripts was incomplete . Therefore , it was not possible to determine the exact time at which the injuries had been sustained , how extensive they had been , and the degree of trauma or force that had been employed to inflict them . However , it could not be excluded that the injuries had appeared CARDINAL DATE in the circumstances indicated in the record of the applicant \u2019s questioning . While it was indicated in the record of the applicant \u2019s questioning and in the hearings transcripts that injuries had also been inflicted to the applicant \u2019s face , abdomen , buttocks , lower part of the back , back , and left side of the thorax , such injuries had not been identified in the medical examination of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG questioned PERSON \u2019s former cellmate , V.A. , who stated that he had seen red patches on ORG back . PERSON had told him that the escort officers had beaten him in the basement of the court building ; they had also beaten the applicant . According to V.A. this had happened prior to CARDINAL DATE . V.A. had heard that the applicant had also been beaten in the prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the criminal proceedings on the grounds that the elements of the offence had not been made out . There was no irrefutable evidence that the escort officers had inflicted the injuries as alleged . According to the expert report , the injuries had not been recorded in the medical documentation precisely . The persons involved in the criminal proceedings had given contradictory accounts of the circumstances in which the injuries had been inflicted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother lodged an appeal with the prosecution service against the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings , the applicant having on CARDINAL DATE granted her power of attorney ( univers\u0101lpilnvara ) to take any action concerning his property . This included the right to represent the applicant before the police , the courts and other institutions in relation to all rights vested in him as a victim . Prior to the authorisation she had represented the applicant on the grounds of his being a minor . In the wording of the appeal the applicant \u2019s mother indicated that she was acting on behalf of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . She complained of deficiencies in the criminal investigation which had precluded obtaining important information . Namely , the presentation of photographs to the applicant for the purpose of identifying the alleged perpetrators had been organised in a manner intended to impede justice while he had been shown the small black - and - white frontal photographs he had been surrounded by CARDINAL escort officers in an effort to intimidate him . She asked that the investigating authorities organise an identity parade for the applicant and his co - accused and question the applicant \u2019s co - accused regarding the events in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor dismissed her appeal , noting that during the presentation of photographs the applicant had been assisted by his lawyer . They had not made any remarks or requests as regards this procedure . The investigating authorities had established that no force had been used against the applicant and his co - accused and that no threats had been made . From the moment at which the trial had started the ORG had paid particular attention to the applicant and his co - accused . All of the escort officers had been questioned as witnesses . They had had no interest in the outcome of the trial . Therefore , there had been no reason to doubt their account of the events . The applicant \u2019s co - accused had also been questioned and their evidence assessed . There was no need to take any further investigative steps as the constituent elements of the offence under section ORG ) of LAW were lacking in the ORG actions . The prosecutor indicated that her decision was amenable to appeal before a higher prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother appealed against the aforementioned decision before a higher prosecutor . She indicated that she was acting on behalf of the applicant . In addition to the issues raised previously she complained that a long time had passed before criminal proceedings had been instituted . She considered that it had been a deliberate delay to hide any traces of assault . Furthermore , during the internal inquiry ORG had \u201c interviewed \u201d the applicant and the coaccused , who had been minors at the relevant time , in the absence of a lawyer or a representative . After those \u201c interviews \u201d the co - accused had all refused to testify .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a higher prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s appeal . He upheld the findings of the lower prosecutor \u2013 the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings had been lawful as the constituent elements of the offence had been missing . At the same time , he noted that the applicant had not been declared a victim in the criminal proceedings and hence could not be represented by another person . Furthermore , at the time when the criminal proceedings had been instituted he had reached the age of majority . The higher prosecutor indicated that the applicant \u2019s mother did not have the right to complain about the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings and that it had been wrong for the lower prosecutor to examine her complaint on the merits . That being said , the higher prosecutor also examined her complaint on the merits for the reason of legal certainty as the lower prosecutor had done so . He concluded by indicating that the applicant \u2019s mother could not lodge further complaints about the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with the prosecution service against the aforementioned decision . He stated that his mother had been authorised to lodge complaints in his name under the power of attorney that he had granted her on DATE . He further noted that the assessment of the flaws in the proceedings had been superficial and had not properly addressed the points raised by his mother . He emphasised that no explanation had been given for the injuries that he had sustained while in custody or for the delay in the institution of the investigation and the superficial manner in which it had been conducted . He argued that it might have been that the ORG , acting through its agents , had been willing to cover - up his assault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chief prosecutor responded that the applicant \u2019s procedural status was that of a witness and that , unlike victims , witnesses had no right to authorise other persons to exercise their procedural rights on their behalf . Furthermore , the applicant himself did not have a right to challenge the response that had been given to his mother , as he was not the addressee of this letter sent to her . Lastly , because he had not been the one who had lodged the initial appeals , the applicant had missed the time - limit for lodging an appeal against the decision of DATE terminating the criminal proceedings . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s appeal was not examined . The applicant was informed of the fact that in accordance with domestic law this decision was not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG , who then instituted an inquiry and requested information from FAC , ORG ( NORP tiesu medic\u012bnas ekspert\u012bzes centrs ) and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a report in which he observed that , as the criminal investigation was still ongoing , it would be premature to assess the proceedings as a whole . However , with regard to the internal inquiry , the ORG expressed concerns regarding the institutional independence of ORG when analysing offences allegedly committed by the police officers .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the internal inquiry had lasted DATE and DATE beyond a reasonable time - limit . The inquiry had not been carried out with the requisite diligence , as exemplified by the repeated quashing of decisions not to institute criminal proceedings . The ORG expressed concerns that flaws in the internal inquiry might render it impossible to establish whether the applicant \u2019s injuries had been inflicted by the police officers . Thus , the internal inquiry undertaken by ORG could not be regarded as constituting an effective remedy within the meaning of LAW of the LAW . Nonetheless , the ORG considered that it would be premature to pronounce on a violation of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
