The first applicant is the widow of the late Mr PERSON ( \u201c Mr GPE \u201d ) , who died on DATE . The other applicants are his children and all the applicants are beneficiaries of his estate .", "CARDINAL . At the time of his death Mr Jokela possessed , inter alia , the following properties in the centre of GPE municipality : PERSON , PERSON I CARDINAL:CARDINAL , PERSON I CARDINAL:CARDINAL and PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL . The size of the properties came CARDINAL ha in total . Mr PERSON had purchased CARDINAL of the land for CARDINAL markkas ( FIM ) in DATE . A regional master plan ( seutukaava , regionplan ) of DATE had designated part of the land for roadworks . That designation had been maintained in a municipal building plan ( rakennuskaava , byggnadsplan ) of DATE , whereas construction mainly for industrial purposes had been allowed on the remaining part of the properties .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE ORG requested the partial expropriation of Mr GPE 's properties with a view to constructing an overpass pursuant to a road plan confirmed in DATE . The overall area to be expropriated covered CARDINAL of the properties in question ( CARDINAL ha ) . The request was referred to a panel composed of a ORG - appointed land surveyor ( \u201c the expert \u201d ) and CARDINAL lay members chosen by the expert from a list drawn up by the municipality ( \u201c the trustees \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG took over those parts of the properties which were to be expropriated . In DATE Mr GPE sold other parts of the properties PERSON and PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL for FIM CARDINAL per square metre to a well - established service - station company intending to construct a new service station to replace the CARDINAL situated on adjacent land subject to expropriation .", "CARDINAL . After reaching an agreement with ORG in DATE Mr GPE received FIM CARDINAL in compensation for the removal of the buildings , equipment and vegetation from the expropriated land . The removal took place DATE . The agreement did not concern the compensation to be paid for the land itself and the inconvenience suffered . On these points Mr GPE and , following his death , the applicants disagreed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The matter was then referred to the expert and the trustees who , on DATE , fixed the market value ( k\u00e4yp\u00e4 arvo , g\u00e4ngse pris ) of the land at ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per square metre . They apparently arrived at this amount disregarding CARDINAL voluntary sales of land in the vicinity , as they considered that the sellers \u2013 Mr GPE and the municipality DATE had been \u201c in a dominant position \u201d at the time and thus able to dictate the price . Instead , the expert and trustees took into account the prices paid for land within a wider area . The applicants were awarded about FIM CARDINAL in compensation for the land and some additional compensation for the inconvenience suffered .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and ORG appealed to ORG ( maaoikeus , jorddomstolen ) of ORG which , on DATE , held an oral hearing also attended by the expert . The applicants , represented by counsel , argued that the market value of the expropriated land was between ORG and FIM CARDINAL per square metre . In support of their contention , they submitted various pieces of documentary evidence indicating a current value ranging between ORG and ORG CARDINAL per square metre . The evidence included , inter alia :", "( CARDINAL ) an offer of DATE in which the GPE municipality had stated its interest in purchasing CARDINAL ha of the land for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( i.e. FIM CARDINAL per square metre ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) a decision of ORG ( perint\u00f6verolautakunta , arvsskatten\u00e4mnden ) of CARDINAL DATE in which the current value of the applicants ' properties had been estimated at ORG CARDINAL ( i.e. FIM QUANTITY \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) a DATE estimate by the same expert of the value of adjacent land which had been expropriated , for the purpose of carrying out the same roadworks , setting the price at ORG CARDINAL per square metre ( for land used for a service station ) and ORG CARDINAL per square metre ( for an uncultivated field between CARDINAL roads ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) an offer of DATE in which the GPE municipality had proposed to lease certain land in the vicinity for PERCENT of its market value estimated at ORG CARDINAL per square metre .", "CARDINAL . The applicants disputed the view of the expert and the trustees that Mr GPE and the municipality had been able to dictate the prices of the CARDINAL pieces of land previously sold to the service - station company . The municipality had sold the land at a price of ORG CARDINAL per square metre , presumably below the market level in view of the importance attached to maintaining a service station in the vicinity . Even though Mr Jokela had sold his land at a price exceeding FIM CARDINAL per square metre , that had apparently not been considered excessive by the service - station company which otherwise could have asserted its right to redeem that land .", "CARDINAL . In its own appeal ORG had argued that the compensation to be awarded to the applicants should be lowered to ORG CARDINAL per square metre . Its representative did not comment either in writing or at ORG hearing on the above evidence adduced by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . In their written submissions to ORG the applicants further stated their readiness to examine the executive secretary of GPE municipality ( V. ) as a witness in respect of the contents of the municipality 's above - mentioned offer of DATE , \u201c should ORG deem [ such an examination ] necessary \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the applicants allegedly also requested that the building inspector of the municipality ( S. ) be examined as a witness in respect of the status of their land from the point of view of planning . Contrary to the expert and the trustees , PERSON was allegedly of the opinion that the properties had been reserved for industrial purposes already set out in the regional master plan . According to the applicants , their request that S. be heard was not recorded in ORG TIME . The Government , referring to TIME , noted that the applicants ' representative had merely referred to having been in contact with PERSON before the hearing . Following the hearing ORG inspected the area in question .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicants some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL additional compensation for inconvenience and costs but dismissed the remainder of their appeal . It noted that in the regional master plan of DATE the expropriated land had been designated for roadworks . This designation had been maintained in the municipal building plan adopted in DATE . ORG therefore agreed with the assessment of the expert and the trustees as to the market value of the land . It noted , inter alia , the fact that the construction of the overpass had improved the road links connecting those parts of the applicants ' properties which had not been expropriated . ORG expressly ignored the DATE purchases of adjacent land for the purpose of constructing a service station near the overpass . As in fact only CARDINAL plot of land could be sold for such a purpose , the seller had had a monopoly and the price of this land had not evolved freely .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment did not mention the written evidence adduced by the applicants , nor the fact that they had sought to examine witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE inheritance tax is calculated on the basis of the market value of a property at the time of the death PERCENT ( the so - called \u201c safe - assessment margin \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At the time of Mr GPE 's death , those parts of his properties which were subject to expropriation were still considered part of his possessions . In the inventory of the estate conducted by a member of the Bar and his assistant in DATE , the total value of the CARDINAL properties was estimated at FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed the inheritance tax to be imposed on PERSON , PERSON and ORG in respect of , inter alia , the CARDINAL properties . Their market value was assessed at a total of ORG ( i.e. about FIM CARDINAL per square metre ) . No reasons were given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , arguing that the market value of the properties should be reduced to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL at most . On DATE the GPE and ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) declined to examine the first applicant 's appeal ( as no inheritance tax had been imposed on her ) and dismissed the other applicants ' appeal in so far as it pertained to the market value of the properties . It noted , in particular , that the size of the properties came to a total of QUANTITY . m ( CARDINAL ha ) , a third of which had been purchased by the deceased for FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE . Even in the light of the elements adduced by the appellants , the market value of the properties had not been assessed too high . The court relied on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Inheritance and LAW ( perint\u00f6- ja lahjaverolaki , lag om skatt p\u00e5 g\u00e5va och arv DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In GPE the expropriation of real property for public use must be compensated according to its market value , that value being determined in the light of the general price level and the use to which the property was being put at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINALa of LAW ( laki yleisist\u00e4 teist\u00e4 , lag om allm\u00e4nna v\u00e4gar CARDINAL ) the compensation for expropriation must be determined in accordance with the criteria laid down in ORG ( laki kiinte\u00e4n omaisuuden ja erityisten oikeuksien lunastuksesta , lag om inl\u00f6sen av fast egendom och s\u00e4rskilda r\u00e4ttigheter CARDINAL DATE \u201c LAW \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that full compensation within the meaning of LAW is due for any expropriation , although such compensation may be adjusted according to the benefit to the remaining property which the road construction may produce .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW full compensation , corresponding to the market value , must be determined for the expropriated property . The time of the property transfer is decisive for the determination of this value . If the market value does not reflect the real loss sustained by the owner of the property or any related right , the assessment must be based on returns from the property or investments in it . If the purpose for which the expropriation is carried out has significantly increased or decreased the value of the property , the compensation due must be determined without taking this into account ( section CARDINAL ) . In practice , the market value is adjusted to take account of developments other than temporary price fluctuations , up to the end of the expropriation procedure .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Inheritance and LAW provides that the assessment of inheritance tax must be based on the value of the property at the time of the death . The value of the property must be assessed in accordance with the provisions applicable to the taxation of income and capital gains ( sections DATE ) . Under the DATE LAW ( varallisuusverolaki , f\u00f6rm\u00f6genhetsskattelag DATE ) the assessment must be based on the market price of the property . In practice , the market value for the purpose of setting inheritance tax is the price which would most probably be paid for the particular property at the relevant location . The market price thus arrived at is normally reduced by PERCENT so as to avoid any overvaluation of the property at the time of the death .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the competent Tax Commissioner ( verojohtaja , skattedirekt\u00f6ren ) was under a duty to ensure , inter alia , that the value of the property subject to inheritance tax had been correctly assessed in the estate inventory ( section CARDINAL of the Inheritance and LAW ) . The tax was to be imposed by ORG after careful consideration of the information pertaining to the property , including commonly known facts such as the prevailing price levels in the municipality , and changes in the value of such property in general ( section CARDINAL as interpreted in practice ) . In DATE the inheritance tax boards were abolished and the imposition of this tax was assigned to the ordinary tax authorities ( Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of LAW ( jakolaki , lag om skifte CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , proceedings before the land courts were governed by the provisions applicable to the general courts , unless otherwise stated . In accordance with LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) a land court could therefore decide not to admit evidence which was deemed to be irrelevant or had been proposed in order to prove an already established fact or where the evidence could be obtained in a significantly less cumbersome or cheaper manner ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
