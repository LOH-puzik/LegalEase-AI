The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicant that his permits to keep and carry a firearm for defence purposes as well as a hunting rifle had been revoked because on DATE the applicant had been listed in an \u201c operational records file \u201d ( policijos operatyvin\u0117 \u012fskaita ) , a database containing information gathered by law - enforcement authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL in ' Relevant domestic law ' below ) . The applicant was informed that he was to hand in these firearms to the authorities and would receive money for them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested GPE to order the removal of his name from the operational records database . The applicant stated that he had only discovered that his name had been so listed from the aforementioned police letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE District Court refused the applicant 's request , finding that he should have brought his claims before the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that he had never been informed of the reasons for the listing of his name in the operational records file and requesting that it be removed . The applicant also asked the court to order the police to provide him with all the written materials concerning the listing of his name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that it was necessary to decide which court DATE of general or administrative jurisdiction DATE was competent to hear the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE city police officials instituted criminal proceedings on charges of theft when acting in an organised group ( LAW of LAW ) . The applicant was charged on DATE and placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the special chamber responsible for questions of jurisdiction , composed of the judges of ORG and ORG , decided that the applicant 's case should be examined by the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with covering up a crime committed by others ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . In particular , the investigators suspected that in DATE and DATE the applicant had helped to hide stolen cars on the premises of the company where he worked as the director . In his application the applicant maintained that this was not a fresh charge against him but a substitution for the previous charge of theft ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ordered that the applicant be released from house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's action , holding that the listing of his name in the police file was contrary to the principles of the presumption of innocence and the rule of law . Having reviewed the classified materials submitted by the police , the court found no evidence showing that the applicant had been engaged in any criminal activity . The court also noted the absence of any accusatory judgment against the applicant . On the contrary , testimony to his positive attributes , submitted to the court by environmental protection agencies and non - governmental associations , showed the applicant 's goodwill and dedication ( principingum\u0105 ) to protecting nature . For the above reasons , the court ordered the NORP police officials to remove the applicant 's name from the operational records file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police appealed . They contended that , when listing the applicant 's name in an operational records file , the police had respected the applicable rules . In their appeal they observed that the file had been submitted to ORG and that the judges had acquainted themselves with that information . Lastly , the police noted that criminal proceedings on charges of theft had been pending and that the applicant was one of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court 's decision and returned the case for fresh examination . It was noted that the lower court had erred in law and failed to consider certain relevant evidence . The appellate court emphasised that , when adopting a decision , the lower court had to evaluate all the evidence which had been presented at the hearing and to determine which circumstances had been established and which had not . In particular , the lower court had not properly examined the circumstances relating to the criminal proceedings on charges of theft and had failed to evaluate the applicant 's procedural position in them . ORG stressed that it was indispensable to examine all the circumstances relevant to the dispute over the listing of the applicant 's name in the operational records file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim . The court admitted that a person listed in police records could be negatively affected in a number of ways , for example , he could lose the right to carry a firearm or face restrictions when applying for certain jobs . However , the court noted that having examined the \u201c written evidence \u201d in the case , as well as having examined , in the judges ' chambers , the operational file on the applicant , the listing of the applicant 's name in the police file had been lawful and justified . Whilst acknowledging that it had not been possible to disclose the operational file to the applicant , the court noted , nevertheless , that the applicant had been able to substantiate his claims by providing evidence or by asking the court to obtain the relevant materials when it had not been possible for him to obtain them himself . It concluded that he had not adduced any proof in support of his claim that the listing of his name in the operational file was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , noting the lower court 's observation that the listing of his name in the police file could entail negative consequences for him . The applicant also submitted that he was an inspector of nature protection ( gamtos apsaugos inspektorius ) and that he had been attacked by poachers on numerous occasions . Consequently , were the guns to be taken away from him , it would be too dangerous for him to pursue that activity . Furthermore , the applicant alleged that the gun was necessary for defending his family \u2013 living in a remote and insecure rural area DATE and also for his job , as he occasionally transported large sums of money from his company 's safe to the bank .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that he had had no access to the information which had served as the basis for the listing of his name in the police file . No reasons , except for theories ( i\u0161skyrus prielaidas ) had been disclosed to him . Relying on the above , the applicant submitted that his rights of defence had been breached and that the file on him should be destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , upholding the reasoning of the lower court . It noted that , \u201c having evaluated the written evidence in the case and the operational file [ which under the PERSON on State Secrets could not be disclosed to the defence ] , it had been possible to conclude that the listing of the applicant 's name in that operational file had been reasonable and lawful \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
