The applicant then told him that the process could last DATE , but could be sped up . In exchange for CARDINAL NORP lei ( ORG , CARDINAL ( ORG ) at the time ) , the applicant said that he would issue C. with the relevant document without seeing the dog , knowing that it had not been vaccinated .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after that , C. went to R\u00ee\u015fcani police station in PERSON and asked for help in catching the applicant in the act of receiving the bribe . In his report to the police made at that time , PERSON noted that he had asked for vaccination documents for his DATE dog called \u201c GPE \u201d , which was a variety of terrier .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to C. \u2019s report , a number of procedural acts were carried out that same morning :", "( i ) ORG , an officer at R\u00ee\u015fcani police station , issued an order to initiate a criminal investigation , which was countersigned by a prosecutor on DATE at TIME ;", "( ii ) a prosecutor from the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office issued an order giving subject - matter jurisdiction over the investigation of the case to NORP police station , while noting that jurisdiction to handle such cases normally lay with FAC . ;", "( iii ) ORG issued an order giving territorial jurisdiction to R\u00ee\u015fcani police station ;", "( iv ) ORG issued a search warrant for the applicant \u2019s office ( countersigned by ORG investigating judge on DATE ) ;", "( v ) ORG issued a second order to trace the source of the money paid as a bribe ;", "( vi ) a third order was issued by ORG , pursuant to which the money to be given as a bribe was to be marked with a special substance ; and", "( vii ) MDL CARDINAL in CARDINAL banknotes of MDL CARDINAL each was marked by ORG in the presence of C. and a specialist at TIME and a record of this was drawn up .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE C. entered the applicant \u2019s office and told him that he only had MDL CARDINAL . The applicant took the money , stamped and made the relevant notes in the dog \u2019s passport . At TIME officers from R\u00ee\u015fcani police station entered the applicant \u2019s office and discovered MDL CARDINAL in his pocket . The money was subsequently confirmed as bearing the specific mark made earlier for the purpose of proving the act of bribe taking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released against an undertaking not to leave the city .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the record of an interrogation made on DATE , it is recorded that the applicant declared that there were individuals who , for a long time , had wanted to frame him due to his past conflicts with them . He also mentioned a criminal complaint concerning an assassination attempt that took place on DATE which had not been examined and which meant , in the applicant \u2019s opinion , that someone had a motive for making a false accusation against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred the case to ORG in PERSON for examination , as the latter court had territorial jurisdiction over the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the court to exclude all the evidence obtained as a result of the procedural acts of DATE , on the basis that it had been obtained in violation of territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction . The court twice postponed the hearing in order for the prosecution to submit evidence in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution submitted ORG order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) giving territorial jurisdiction to R\u00ee\u015fcani police station . The order had not been included in the file before that date . The applicant \u2019s lawyer objected to the inclusion of that document in the file , stating that its existence had never previously been mentioned and that he had serious reasons for considering that it was backdated . According to the prosecution , the order had been mistakenly annexed to another file and had been discovered shortly before submitting it to the court . According to the Government , the applicant \u2019s lawyer did not raise an objection during the hearing of DATE , but only did so in his final submissions to the court at a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of soliciting and accepting a bribe . The court referred to such evidence as C. \u2019s initial police report and subsequent statements , those of the officers at R\u00ee\u015fcani police station , and to the findings of the search at the applicant \u2019s office on DATE , during which MDL CARDINAL had been found in his pocket .

In respect of the allegation made by the applicant and his lawyer that the entire event had been the result of police entrapment , the court found as follows :", "\u201c The submission that the charges of bribe taking brought against [ the applicant ] were based on police entrapment is unsubstantiated , because [ C. ] declared under oath both during the criminal investigation and before the court that [ the applicant ] had solicited money from him in order to speed up his dog \u2019s vaccination . Moreover , upon his arrest the accused took the money out of his pocket , which proves his intentional actions and [ shows that it was ] not entrapment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He noted the various procedural shortcomings concerning the timing of the issuance of the orders on DATE and claimed that the investigative actions had taken place before the initiation of the investigation itself . He further submitted that it was strange that C. had gone to R\u00ee\u015fcani police station and not to the police station situated in the LOC district , which had territorial jurisdiction to deal with the alleged offence . Nor had he gone to the police station in the district where he lived . Furthermore , according to the documents in the file , the police had given money to C. for him to bribe the applicant with , yet of the MDL CARDINAL given to C. only MDL CARDINAL had been passed on to the applicant , the remainder having disappeared . The applicant submitted that C. had been \u201c artificially involved in the operation of handing money to me , which constitutes incitement to bribe taking \u201d .", "The applicant further claimed that ORG had never had a dog and had therefore had no need to have a dog vaccinated for travel abroad . He referred to the inconsistency between C. \u2019s description of his dog ( stating initially that it was a type of terrier , but later that it was a type of pitbull , while the pet passport submitted to the court was for an LANGUAGE cocker spaniel dog , which , in addition , belonged to another person , PERSON ) . Moreover , according to the documents submitted to the court the dog had been born on DATE and thus could not have been DATE on DATE , as stated by C. Furthermore , C. had refused to say whom he had wanted to visit abroad , even though he had previously stated that he had intended to visit friends , taking his dog with him .", "CARDINAL .
