In DATE the applicant sent CARDINAL letters to ORG and stated that she would accept a plot of land of equivalent value if such a plot was given to her and a preliminary agreement was prepared on the transfer of such a plot .

In DATE the ORG informed the applicant about the procedure for the assessment of the value of land and the calculation methods used , and asked the applicant to agree with the assessment . In DATE ORG informed the applicant that in order to provide her with a plot of land , the authorities had to prepare a document on the transfer of land . ORG also observed that there was no possibility to conclude the preliminary agreement requested by the applicant because it was not provided for in the domestic law . ORG repeated that the document on a transfer of the land had already been prepared and the applicant had to sign it and indicate the area where she would like to receive a plot of land of equivalent value . In DATE ORG informed the applicant about the procedure for restitution and reiterated that the applicant had to sign the document on the transfer of land .

In DATE the ORG established that because the applicant had refused to clearly indicate the form of restitution , she would be paid monetary compensation for the land . It gave the applicant DATE to change the suggested form of restitution .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeatedly did not choose the form of restitution for the land by the time indicated by the authorities , which is by DATE , and on CARDINAL DATE a decision was taken to restore GPE \u2019s property rights by paying monetary compensation of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The compensation was then adjusted ( indeksuota ) and the final sum to be paid was LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . The national authorities indicated GPE as the person to whom the compensation had to be paid . The applicant was sent the decision on CARDINAL DATE . In their observations , the Government provided a document to the ORG , indicating that the compensation had been paid on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant started court proceedings . She asked the court to annul the authorities\u2019 decision of CARDINAL DATE to restore GPE \u2019s property rights by paying him monetary compensation and to pay her LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage . She stated that she wanted the land to be returned in natura or to be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and she did not understand why the authorities kept asking her to make a new choice on the form of restitution DATE . She further asked the authorities to explain why there had been no activity from DATE in the process of the restitution of her property rights . Finally , she complained that compensation calculated at LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) was too low .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG established that in DATE PERSON had asked for his property rights to be restored by being given QUANTITY of land in natura and that that had been a proper expression of his will . As the land in question was already being used by other people , GPE and later the applicant had been asked to choose another form of restitution . However , they had never expressly done so . Moreover , the court held that the applicant had never changed the original wish to have the land returned in natura because she had refused to agree to the document on the transfer of land , which would have allowed her to have a plot of equivalent value returned to her . As a consequence , and in accordance with the domestic law , the national authorities had chosen monetary compensation as the form of restitution , which had not breached any requirements of the domestic law . As for damages , the court held that the authorities had acted correctly and the necessary conditions to pay damages had not been satisfied .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged an appeal . She complained that she had chosen the form of restitution because she wanted land of equal value to be returned to her in natura . She also stated that if her choice had been unclear to the authorities , they should have taken action to clarify it . She further complained that the monetary compensation was unjust and too low .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court stated that PERSON had expressed a wish for his property rights to be restored to him in natura . The court also established that GPE had been aware of the fact that there was no possibility of returning the land to him in natura because it was already being used by other people . PERSON had been asked several times by the national authorities to choose another form of restitution but he had insisted on restitution in natura . The court held that the national authorities had failed to inform GPE about the time - limit for choosing the form of restitution , as the domestic law provided for such information to be sent before DATE and the letter had only been sent to GPE on DATE . The court however observed that that circumstance was not of major significance because ORG had written on DATE that he would never change his mind about the form of restitution . After ORG had died , the applicant had been asked to choose the form of restitution but had persisted in asking to have the land returned to her in natura or to be provided with a plot of equivalent value . The court also held that the applicant had misinterpreted the provisions of the domestic law because she had required that she be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and a preliminary agreement , and had stated that only then would she sign a document on the transfer of land . That had been contrary to the procedure established in the domestic law . The court also considered that although at some point the applicant had indicated that providing her with a plot of land of equivalent value was an alternative way to restore her property rights , she had tied that form to her own rules and requirements , which were not possible under the domestic law . The court further observed that the national authorities had decided to pay the applicant monetary compensation as the form of restitution . Lastly , the court held that the applicant \u2019s argument as to the amount of compensation was unsubstantiated because she had not provided specific arguments proving that the amount of compensation had been determined in breach of domestic requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started court proceedings for debt and interest over the failure of the national authorities to pay her monetary compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the request by the authorities , on CARDINAL DATE the notary dealing with the inheritance procedure for GPE \u2019s property stated that after PERSON \u2019s death she had issued the applicant with certificates of the right to inheritance with regard to movable and immovable property . However , she had not issued the applicant with the document allowing the applicant to get the monetary compensation paid to GPE because the applicant had not provided her with the decision of the national authorities of CARDINAL DATE to restore GPE \u2019s property rights .", "CARDINAL . In their comments to the applicant \u2019s reply to the ORG \u2019s observations , the Government acknowledged that the monetary compensation had never been transferred to the applicant \u201c due to human error \u201d . The national authorities could not transfer the monetary compensation to the applicant because of the absence of the document proving that she was an heir of GPE and the absence of the applicant \u2019s account number . The applicant submitted the relevant documents together with her account number and the compensation was transferred to her account on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
