The applicant suspected that Mr PERSON was working for the intelligence services and that he had been using her husband . On TIME when she was questioned , PERSON told her that Mr PERSON was a good person , and insinuated that Mr PERSON had nothing to do with the murder . As the applicant felt Mr PERSON to be prejudiced she did not tell him about Mr PERSON handing documents to her husband , but she did mention it in the article in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr Say\u0131l did not come to the applicant 's house for DATE after the murder ; and then he only came because the applicant asked him to . On that occasion he denied having brought a booklet to the applicant 's husband on TIME of the murder . This booklet , which had been left in front of her husband 's office , contained photographs of CARDINAL journalists who had been assassinated in DATE . A photocopied picture of her husband had been superimposed on it . DATE , the applicant found the photograph from which the copy had been made upside down in an album amongst her husband 's books . She also found out that a letter , saying that certain journalists had been killed , had been photocopied at a shop where Mr ORG 's brother was working .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the applicant 's husband had been killed , a large number of police officers went into her house , ostensibly to guarantee the security of the house because , according to them , they found the door open and the television switched on . However , they turned everything upside down in the house and it took the applicant and her family DATE to restore order amongst her husband 's books and papers . The police were accompanied by the muhtar , PERSON . The muhtar was never questioned by the police .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , both PERSON and CARDINAL PERSON , who was a colonel , brought a court action against the applicant because of an article that had appeared in PERSON . This is how the applicant found out about PERSON 's surname . The police never took a statement from this individual , although PERSON was interviewed by them . A statement was similarly not taken from PERSON who had dinner with PERSON on TIME of the murder , according to the latter 's statement . Mr Asilhan was now an adviser to the commander of the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later found out that PERSON had been injured in an incident when his car had been shot at . When he was taken to hospital by local people , PERSON shouted that an attempt had been made to kill him because he had killed PERSON . The local people informed the police , but were told to forget about it . PERSON was subsequently taken to a military hospital in GPE where all his expenses were paid . Upon his return to GPE he became the private secretary of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Following the murder , the applicant spoke to Dr PERSON , who told her that no post mortem had been carried out but that her husband 's body had been rayed . She was unable to find out whether this was true until , after she had lodged her application with ORG , she obtained a copy of the post mortem report together with the ORG 's observations . PERSON did not give her the death certificate , in which the cause of death was stated as internal bleeding , until DATE after the incident .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's allegation to the effect that PERSON was involved in her husband 's murder was not just based on newspaper reports . In DATE she had a meeting with PERSON , a member of ORG and chairman of ORG committee . In DATE and in DATE the ORG of the \u201c TRNC \u201d established its own GPE investigation committee , suspecting that there was a connection between PERSON GPE and the murder of PERSON . The applicant made statements to these committees , but did not have transcripts of her statements . The committees came to the conclusion that Mr PERSON had visited GPE , using false identities , on many occasions and that around the time of her husband 's murder he had been staying at the ORG hotel , with his expenses being paid by the army . When Mr PERSON died in a car accident in DATE , an Uzi was retrieved from the car . It is the applicant 's opinion that this Uzi , which had gone missing from the NORP police , was the weapon with which her husband had been shot .", "CARDINAL . Although the roads in the vicinity of the applicant 's house were very quickly closed off by the military after the shooting of her husband , the roads in the outlying area , and especially those leading to the airport , were not . A taxi driver told the applicant that he had taken PERSON to the airport directly after the murder had been committed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant believed that Mr PERSON , Mr GPE , PERSON and Mr \u00c7atli were Government agents , that they had acted collectively and as a team and that they had killed her husband . She did not accept that he might have been killed by a private individual who was angered at her husband 's writings . At the secret meeting with PERSON and PERSON in DATE , she informed them of her suspicions . Mr PERSON said that he had never heard the name of Mr PERSON before but that he would follow it up .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was of the opinion that the security forces were opposed to an effective investigation being carried out into the killing of her husband . Shortly after the killing , PERSON , who was in charge of the judicial investigation , wanted to meet with her at her sister - in - law 's house . The applicant refused because she was afraid at that time . Later on , Mr \u00d6zt\u00fcmen told the applicant 's sister - in - law that he had been given instructions by the security forces not to conduct the investigation effectively and that she , the applicant , should not follow it up either .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been subjected to constant harassment after the death of her husband . She received threatening telephone calls . When she informed the police about this in DATE , they managed to trace a call to CARDINAL ORG who lived CARDINAL streets away . The applicant had never met PERSON ORG , but she knew that he belonged to ORG . Mr PERSON was let off after paying a miserly fine . The telephone calls continued . The applicant bought an indicator to show the number of incoming telephone calls . When she received a telephone call from a man calling himself PERSON who said that he was coming over to determine her fate , she informed the police as the indicator had shown the number that had been used . The police did nothing .", "CARDINAL . One evening , as the applicant was returning home after a meeting and stopped off at a neighbour 's , she was told that there was somebody walking around in her garden . It turned out to be a neighbour and he was near the water tank . He did not explain what he was doing there . The applicant 's sister - in - law , a chemist , advised her to change the water , which they did . DATE , the applicant found that her dog was dead . Its ribs and CARDINAL of its legs were broken . The veterinary surgeon who conducted the autopsy said that the dog had not been run over by a car , because of a lack of tyre marks on the place where it was found . Her dog had been severely tortured elsewhere and then taken to her garden .", "CARDINAL . Also , the applicant 's water and electricity were regularly cut off . Mail addressed to her was either not delivered or was opened . Her telephone calls were monitored . The applicant 's complaints to the police , both orally and in writing , about this harassment led to nothing .", "CARDINAL . The application to establish ORG , which CARDINAL democratic organisations wanted to set up in order to continue PERSON work , was initially refused . The registration fee was increased fivefold and the applicant sold a plot of land to raise the money . Also , the charter of the ORG had to be changed . For example , the phrase \u201c democratic activities \u201d was replaced by \u201c cultural activities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant met with Professor PERSON \u00c7a\u011flar , after he had asked her to send him the details of the case . However , he became cross when the documents which the applicant showed him did not include the agreements which she had concluded with her lawyers . He told her that her lawyers were not very good and that he could win the case for her . As she considered that he was connected to the authorities of the \u201c GPE \u201d or of GPE , she did not want to hand her case over to him .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , her daughter was told she would get a job in the public sector but this did not materialise . She then found a job in a bank . However , her contract of employment was terminated from DATE to the next , allegedly for disciplinary reasons but in reality it was because of the applicant had lodged an application with the ORG . Also , her daughter was standing as a candidate for a party different from the party for which the owner of the bank was standing as a candidate . Her daughter wrote to , and subsequently met , President PERSON about this matter . The President wrote out a cheque for the equivalent of DATE wages and told her to go home . Recently her daughter 's scholarship had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant met with President PERSON . At the presidential palace she met a man with the first name ORG , who was the son - in - law of the police commander PERSON . ORG told her that unless she withdrew her application she would be arrested .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . In DATE he was an assistant inspector at the judicial branch of the NORP police headquarters . Mr PERSON , who was his superior , was the head of the judicial branch , attached to the general police headquarters . Mr PERSON was the chief of NORP police station . In an investigation , the local police station would report to the judicial branch and the judicial branch would report to the head of the judicial branch .", "CARDINAL . The witness was responsible for the investigation into the killing of PERSON . He started his investigation at TIME on DATE . He had known Mr Adal\u0131 by name from the articles he wrote for PERSON , but he had never met him . Although it was possible that Mr PERSON had been killed because of his activities as a journalist , this was not the only line of inquiry he pursued : he also looked into Mr Adal\u0131 's personal life and his personality .", "CARDINAL . Not having been on duty on TIME DATE , The witness did not go to the scene of the crime that night . He was only informed of the murder the following TIME and received a short briefing from Mr \u00d6zt\u00fcmen as to what had been done TIME .", "CARDINAL . Chief Inspector PERSON and his colleagues from the rapid response unit had been the first police officers to arrive at the scene . Whilst out on patrol duty , they heard shots and went to the location of the incident . PERSON informed the general police headquarters . Upon hearing the shots , local people also alerted the police switchboard . Not long afterwards , PERSON and PERSON , the assistant chief of police PERSON and police sergeant PERSON , as well as officers working at the judicial branch and the LOC police station , arrived at the site . This constituted normal police attendance in a murder case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The witness did not consider it necessary to take a statement from PERSON because he , PERSON , had been briefed by PERSON , who had arrived at the scene so soon after PERSON that the latter would not have seen anything different from PERSON . If PERSON had seen or heard anything , he would have told PERSON . In DATE , however , Mr PERSON took a statement from PERSON in order to show that , contrary to what the applicant alleged in her application to the ORG , no military vehicles were present at the scene and that the vehicles of the rapid response unit resembled military vehicles .", "CARDINAL . The witness was further told by PERSON that after the discovery of Mr Adal\u0131 's body , police had entered the applicant 's house , together with the muhtar , in order to check if any of the family members were at home and if they were safe , and also to see if any clues about the murder could be found there . The door of the house was open , the television was switched on and a table and chairs were on the veranda . Nothing untoward was found . No search as such of the house was carried out , merely a visual inspection . It was not considered necessary to take a statement from the muhtar , as no evidence was found in the house and neither did anything untoward happen . No fingerprint examination was carried out at the house , given that the incident had taken place outside the house and the interior of the house was thus not a crime scene . In addition , the applicant herself said that when she had spoken to her husband by telephone at TIME , her husband had told her that he had not received any visitors . CARDINAL or CARDINAL neighbours stated that when they had passed the house TIME , there had been no one in there .", "CARDINAL . From the statements taken by PERSON and his colleagues directly after the incident , it appeared that a dark - coloured car with many lights at the rear had been seen . Its make or registration was not known , and no one had mentioned to the witness that it had been a PERSON car . A search was carried out that night but the vehicle , which had left the scene at high speed , was not found . The witness spoke to PERSON the day after her initial statement had been taken by CARDINAL of his colleagues . She said that she did not know what make or colour the car was . He did not draw up a written report of this statement , given that it did not contain any positive indications . The witness disputed that at the inquest , PERSON had given evidence to the effect that the car was GPE red and that it might have been a PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The witness started his investigation on TIME after the incident by taking statements , together with police colleagues , from the people living in the area of the scene of the crime . This work had already commenced TIME , so that in the end statements were taken from all persons who had been at home at the time of the incident , regardless of whether or not they had any information to offer . It was the local police officers , who knew the area and its inhabitants well , who established who had been at home and who had not . Since no statement was taken from PERSON and her mother , they must have been out when the offence had taken place . The witness knew nothing about the applicant asking PERSON , commander of the security forces , to have the NORP interviewed .", "CARDINAL . The witness took the applicant 's statement on TIME CARDINAL July , after she had returned from GPE . The applicant expressed her opinion that the killing of her husband was connected to the articles he had written about the GPE incident . According to the applicant , the head of ORG , PERSON , had been annoyed by these articles and had telephoned PERSON making threats against her husband . The applicant persistently claimed that the murder had been arranged by the administration of ORG and that she held the head of that organisation responsible . She also aired these suspicions in her interview with PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL in the Appendix ) . Mr PERSON and mr \u00d6zt\u00fcmen were also aware of these allegations . However , not even the smallest piece of evidence could be found to support the allegation . For that reason no statements were taken from the head or other persons belonging to ORG . In any event , a statement could not be taken from Mr PERSON because he had gone abroad . Mr PERSON returned in DATE as the commander of the security forces .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , the applicant alleged that on TIME of the murder the street lighting in FAC , where she lived , had been switched off at the transformer substation in ORG . This matter was examined and it was established through the taking of statements that the street lights had been on that night . It was further established that power for the lighting in the street was supplied from a different substation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her statement to PERSON , the applicant also mentioned PERSON , according to whom Mr PERSON 's killing was a politically motivated murder . PERSON went to see Mr Cavit An , once at his house and once at the clinic where he worked . Mr Cavit An was unable to provide any useful information as to the secret cells allegedly involved in the murder .", "CARDINAL . The witness had not heard that the applicant had been refused permission to see her husband 's body . He was not given any instructions to the effect that , because the applicant had given critical newspaper interviews , he should not give her a copy of the post mortem and ballistic reports . In any event , in order to obtain a copy of such documents , permission from the Attorney - General 's office was required .", "CARDINAL . The witness took CARDINAL statements from PERSON . He first interviewed Mr PERSON because he had been informed that Mr PERSON was a close friend of Mr Adal\u0131 . However , in the light of articles that subsequently appeared in newspapers he felt the need to take a more in - depth statement from Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON attended the mevlit ( religious ceremony ) held at the applicant 's house DATE after the killing . He did not go to the house subsequently because of the allegations which the applicant had made against him .", "CARDINAL . The weapon which was used to kill Mr Adal\u0131 could not be identified . A number of spent cartridges were found at the site from which it could be established that they had been fired by a CARDINAL PERSON firearm , but the make of the weapon remained unknown . Ballistic tests were carried out both in GPE and in the \u201c TRNC \u201d to see if the bullets had been fired by a weapon known to the authorities , but to no avail . These tests included comparisons of sample cartridges held in the archives of the \u201c TRNC \u201d of all the weapons registered in the names of persons in the \u201c TRNC \u201d , such as the weapon belonging to Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the spent cartridges were kept in the archives in GPE . The witness therefore assumed that the NORP authorities had examined whether they had been fired by the QUANTITY found in the car in which PERSON GPE had died in GPE in DATE . He had not been informed of any result . In any event , the investigation showed that Mr PERSON had not been in the \u201c TRNC \u201d at the time of the incident as there were no records of him entering the \u201c TRNC \u201d at the relevant time under any of the identities which Mr GPE was known to have used . He had visited the island , under the name of PERSON , in DATE and in DATE . It was not possible to enter the \u201c GPE \u201d without an entry record being made by the immigration authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not inform the witness or any other police officers that she had received an anonymous telephone call from a woman alleging that PERSON and a man with the first name PERSON had been involved in the killing . However , some time after the incident , a woman , who could not be identified , telephoned Mr PERSON , the then head of the judicial branch , and gave him the name of ORG . Mr PERSON passed the name on to Mr PERSON , who proceeded to take Mr GPE 's statement .", "CARDINAL . On TIME of the incident , PERSON had dinner with PERSON , the then assistant chief of police , in GPE . Although no statement was taken from Mr As\u0131lhan at that time , Mr PERSON did speak to Mr As\u0131lhan about the matter , and Mr PERSON said that Police Officer Muharrem G\u00f6\u00e7 had seen the CARDINAL men having dinner . Mr G\u00f6\u00e7 subsequently confirmed this in a statement to Mr PERSON . In any event , Mr PERSON himself also confirmed that he had had dinner with PERSON NORP on DATE when his statement was taken in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The witness did not consider it likely that PERSON could have been involved in the killing after he had left the restaurant because such an assassination required preparation . PERSON said that he had gone straight home after dropping off Mr PERSON and as Mr PERSON had not formed the opinion that PERSON was speaking anything other than the truth , this matter was not examined further .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness , Mr DATE a self - employed ironmonger \u2013 had no relations with the police or the security forces . He checked to see whether PERSON had a criminal record as there was an allegation that he had been acquitted on a murder charge , but there was no information that he had ever committed any criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . The witness further examined whether PERSON had been admitted to hospital with burns , as was alleged by the applicant in her application to the ORG . He established that PERSON had spent DATE in hospital in DATE for broken ribs . PERSON was not asked about this because his stay in hospital did not coincide with the murder of Mr Adal\u0131 . In any event , had the incident alleged by the applicant really occurred \u2013 namely that PERSON opened fire inside the hospital , saying \u201c I killed PERSON \u201d \u2013 it would have been reported to the police .", "CARDINAL . The information reported to the police was only connected to Mr Demirci and did not mention PERSON . However , at some point there was a report in the press to the effect that PERSON had committed the murder along with PERSON . PERSON statement was not taken at that time given that PERSON whereabouts on TIME of the murder had already been established and it was thus known that PERSON had not been in contact with PERSON that night .", "CARDINAL . The witness nonetheless took a statement from PERSON on DATE , but only because his name had come up in the application to ORG there was not a shred of evidence or any indication that he had been involved in the killing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The witness took a statement from PERSON on DATE , also because his name was mentioned in the application to the ORG . Prior to that , PERSON was not aware that Mr GPE might possess information relating to the incident : Mr GPE 's shop was in GPE Ecvet FAC , far from the scene of the crime . Mr GPE told him that Mr Adal\u0131 had come to his shop at TIME to buy some dried fruit and nuts , as he used to do from time to time . Mr GPE said that he had not telephoned anybody to inform the applicant 's family of the death of Mr Adal\u0131 . The witness could not check the veracity of this claim , as he did not have the name of the person whom Mr GPE was alleged to have telephoned . The witness could not remember whether he had been informed that , according to the applicant , Mr GPE had telephoned the father of her sister - in - law . Mr ORG further stated that he had not received any telephone calls from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was requested by the Agent of the respondent Government , Professor PERSON , to carry out an investigation in connection with the allegations made by the applicant to ORG . He received no specific instructions , only a document containing the applicant 's allegations .", "CARDINAL . Apart from taking statements from a number of persons , Mr ORG also took photographs of a PERSON , a PERSON and a ORG car so that they could be compared . He further investigated the applicant 's claim that PERSON Demirci 's azure blue car had been repainted black . It was established that the car 's colour was its original blue .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . He is currently the chief of police in PERSON . At the time of the impugned incident , he was the head of the judicial branch at ORG in GPE ( GPE ) . He supervised the investigation into the killing of Mr Adal\u0131 . He was the supervisor of PERSON and PERSON . He was informed about the incident by the switchboard and arrived at the scene of the incident within TIME . According to the procedure on conducting investigations , the person who arrives at the scene of the incident must not touch anything and must take security precautions until those in charge arrive . There was a corpse and its position had to be established by his supervisees . When he arrived Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were already at the scene of the crime . The officers marked and numbered the empty cartridges and cordoned the area off with a view to preventing unauthorised persons from walking around . A sketch - map of the scene of the incident was drawn up and a team was set up in order to take testimonies from people nearly .", "CARDINAL . The witness entered Mr Adal\u0131 's house TIME after the incident , along with PERSON , a close relative of the deceased and the local muhtar . The door was open and the TV was on . They looked for a document , an item or anything that could have been the cause of the incident . They did not remove any object . Mr PERSON 's office was in disorder and there were a large number of books which were piled up or arranged in boxes . PERSON told the witness that he had entered the house for a very short time in order to check whether there was anybody in .", "CARDINAL . The witness did not consider it necessary to look for fingerprints since the incident had happened in the street and not in the house . According to the statements given by the deceased 's next door neighbour , Mr PERSON , the deceased was sitting on the terrace by himself and watching television . On the basis of the latter statement the witness excluded the possibility that Mr Adal\u0131 could have been sitting with some other persons on the terrace . The witness identified a glass , a bottle and an ashtray in a photograph shown to him . He emphasised that it was the custom to drop the shells into an ashtray when eating dried nuts , especially pumpkin seeds , and that it was normal for someone to sit on the balcony and drink water during TIME .", "CARDINAL . The witness knew the deceased by sight and through his articles in an opposition newspaper . When investigating into the murder every aspect of the case was considered , be it a political crime or CARDINAL related to Mr Adal\u0131 's activities as a journalist . However , there was no evidence significant enough to lead to any of these conclusions . He was informed about the applicant 's allegation that the head of ORG had made threats against Mr Adal\u0131 personally or against the newspaper because of an article concerning the GPE incident . The prosecuting authorities did not verify this allegation since the applicant could not name anyone and she had constantly made similar inconsistent allegations at the time of the incident and for some time afterwards . They did not consider them to be serious . As an example of her inconsistent allegations , the witness referred to the applicant 's statements in which she had described Mr PERSON as a close friend of her husband who visited their home DATE , and had then complained to the authorities that she suspected of Mr Say\u0131l of involvement in the murder .", "CARDINAL . Following the receipt of an anonymous telephone call alleging that a person named PERSON and another person described as Colonel PERSON were involved in the killing , the prosecuting authorities found Mr GPE and took statements from him about the allegations . It was established that PERSON had been outside PERSON on the night of the incident . In particular , he had been at a dinner in the PERSON area in the company of PERSON , who was the first assistant of the Chief of Police , and Mr Muharrem G\u00f6\u00e7 , a police inspector . Mr GPE confirmed to the witness that he had been out for dinner with PERSON . A statement was also taken from from PERSON . The anonymous caller was a lady who could not be identified .

The witness knew Mr PERSON from the time they had enrolled to the police academy and had attended the same course . However , he denied having told the applicant that Mr PERSON was a very good person and that he had nothing to do with the killing . He had never spoken to the applicant about Mr PERSON . The witness had never taken a statement from the applicant in relation to PERSON and the applicant had never approached him to be supplied with a copy of such a statement . The witness further stressed that no security commander had been dismissed or forced to relinquish his post for any reason , contrary to the applicant 's allegation that the chief of the security forces had been removed from his post because of the articles written by PERSON on the basis of the documents supplied by Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Regarding a tip - off to PERSON , who was then the Chief of Police , about PERSON , the witness stated that they had had no chance to investigate the woman caller since she had not given her name and had asked her identity to be kept secret .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pro - Government newspaper ORG reported that it had received a statement from a fascist group called ORG claiming responsibility for the murder . No investigation was conducted into this allegation as such an organisation did not exist in the \u201c LOC \u201d and the investigating authorities considered that the allegation had been made as a ploy designed to cause confusion .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had never asked the witness to supply her with a copy of the autopsy report . In any event , documents contained in the investigation file were confidential . Only the investigating officer and his superiors as well as the Attorney - General 's office could have access to them . The witness was not involved in the subsequent investigation that followed from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE .

However , they could not find anything . The television was located at the entrance of the house and it was on . There was one plastic chair and CARDINAL table on the terrace . This gave the impression that Mr Adal\u0131 had been sitting on the terrace just before he was killed inn the street . They did not consider taking fingerprints on account of the fact that the incident had taken place outside the house . There was nothing on the terrace ; no glasses and bottles or any trace indicating that cigarettes had been smoked . Had the officers found glasses , they would have been examined for fingerprints .", "CARDINAL . The officers assigned by the witness visited the families living in the close vicinity and further away from the scene of the incident and noted their names .

In DATE Mr PERSON was the commander of the security forces . In DATE of DATE he was replaced by PERSON .
