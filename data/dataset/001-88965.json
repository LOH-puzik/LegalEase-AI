The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE in LOC . He is a journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an article in issue no . CARDINAL\\CARDINAL of the PERSON newspaper . The article appeared under the headline \u2018 Tortured suspects confessed to the theft they had not ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u043f\u044b\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435 , \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u201d ) . It concerned an investigation into the theft of property of a private company . The company director had identified CARDINAL of his former employees as prime suspects . PERSON , CARDINAL of those CARDINAL , had gone to the LOC police station of his own will to clear himself of suspicion . The story then switched to a first - person narrative by PERSON , which was preceded by the author \u2019s statement , in bold and in italics : \u201c I switched on the dictaphone recording of S[. ] \u2019s story \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr S. said that he had been detained TIME at LOC police station . TIME he had been brought to an office where CARDINAL police officers had been present ; PERSON had been among them . PERSON continued as follows :", "\u201c It was a DATE . They [ the police officers ] planned to go to a wedding party after lunch ; they reeked of fresh alcohol , it looked like they had already been drinking . They discussed how to torture me - using a crow - bar or otherwise ? They tied me to a chair , my legs fastened to the chair legs and my arms cuffed behind the chair back . At first they punched me in the chest with their fists , it hurt . I was in a state of shock . Then , a sudden , stunning blow to the neck ... I could not see who delivered the blow and with what object . Someone said : \u2018 What now ? The crow - bar?\u2019 G[. ] says : \u2018 Well , but do not stain my NORP . And he took all the magazines off the table . CARDINAL of them , who squinted a bit , took out a tool that looked like a tyre lever . I do not know how they wanted to torture me . G[. ] says : \u2018 No , let \u2019s try a gas mask first\u2019 . They put a gas mask on me ... I could not breathe in or out , I felt faint and my head shook ... \u201d ( emphasis added , see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The article further continued to relate PERSON story as told by him . After a while Mr S. had signalled his readiness to confess . He had been taken to the office next door , where a young man in civilian clothes had written down his statements . Thereafter , PERSON had been locked in the basement cell of the police station .", "Switching back to author \u2019s speech , the applicant introduced PERSON , a friend of PERSON , who had gone to the police station to confirm Mr S. \u2019s alibi . With the words \u201c Let us give [ M. ] the floor \u201d , the story continued as narrated by PERSON :", "\u201c At LOC police station they took me into office no . CARDINAL on the second floor . The interview was conducted by the investigator G[. ] , a tall athletic man with red hair .", "\u2013 Where is the snatch ?", "\u2013 What snatch ?", "\u2013 ... Your friends have already confessed . You are the \u2018 weak link\u2019 . You are an \u2018 MDP\u2019 \u2013 a morally degraded person ...", "He began beating me . Every word was followed by a blow ...", "\u2013 Where is the loot ? You will tell me ! I am a paratrooper . I used to crush people like you and I will do the same to you ! Ever heard about disappearances ? You will be CARDINAL of them if you do not give back the loot !", "... I heard that if the police accidentally break the leg or arm [ of a detainee ] , operational officers have to finish the victim off and secretly bury him so as to hide the traces of torture ...", "G[. ] says : \u2018 Stop talking like a parrot . Counsel , counsel ... Counsel will be at trial , but now you are under pre - trial investigation . Take him to the cell where the faggots are ! They are hungry , let them explain to him what he is.\u2019 But he did not hit me . Just banged his fist on the table . As if they started to realise that they had made a mistake and were at a loss what to do next . \u201d ( emphasis added , see below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the conclusion the applicant quoted from a medical report which noted multiple bruises and abrasions on Mr S. \u2019s body . He criticised the passive attitude of supervising prosecutors who had refused to initiate a criminal case against PERSON and the other police officers , and noted that the ORG refusals were being appealed against to a court . The real perpetrator had later been identified and convicted of the theft .", "CARDINAL . The senior operational officer of LOC police station , PERSON sued the applicant and the newspaper \u2019s founder for defamation before ORG of GPE . Considering that the extracts in bold above were untrue and damaging to his honour , dignity and professional reputation , he sought compensation for non - pecuniary damage and legal costs . He denied that he had ever used violence against Mr S. or Mr M.", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the contested extracts had been a verbatim reproduction of the personal stories of PERSON and PERSON and represented their value judgments on these events . He had acted in good faith and verified that neither Mr S. nor Mr PERSON had a reason to slander or denigrate PERSON The extracts either did not refer to PERSON personally ( such as \u201c they reeked of fresh alcohol ... \u201d ) or did not contain any information damaging to his reputation ( such as the statement about him being a paratrooper ) . The applicant produced in evidence a dictaphone recording of his conversation with PERSON , when PERSON had been also present . He also relied on the medical report noting PERSON injuries , on the records of the confessions made by PERSON and Mr M. at the LOC police station , and on their complaints about ill - treatment lodged with the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . ORG took oral evidence from Mr S. and Mr PERSON confirmed the accuracy of the story as reproduced in the article . Responding to questions from both parties , he testified that police officers but not PERSON had reeked of alcohol , that he had been tied to a chair , that PERSON had indeed warned them against staining his table , that PERSON had not used violence against him but had been \u201c merely present \u201d . PERSON also confirmed his story as narrated in the article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE granted PERSON action in part . It noted firstly that the applicant and the newspaper could not claim an exemption from liability for defamation on the ground that they had merely reproduced statements made by others , because no such exemption was provided for in the Mass Media Act . Accordingly , they were required to prove the accuracy of the contested statements . However , in the ORG view , neither the medical reports noting injuries on Mr M. \u2019s and Mr S. \u2019s bodies , nor their interview records , nor their oral testimony could be considered relevant evidence or proof of the truthfulness of the allegations that PERSON had tortured them or made intimidating remarks .", "Furthermore ,", "\u201c ... it follows from S[. ] \u2019s oral testimony that G[. ] had not been in an inebriated state during the interview , that he had not suggested using a gas mask , that he had not resorted to physical violence and that S[. ] had not told [ the applicant ] about that . A comparison of the dictaphone recording of S[. ] \u2019s story with the narrative in the article leads to the conclusion that the events were retold in the article in a different chronological order and that the author creatively rewrote PERSON \u2019s statements , increasing the emotional intensity and emphasising G[. ] \u2019s leading part in the use of violence towards the detainees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG , however , accepted that the statement about Mr PERSON \u2019s being a paratrooper was not damaging to his reputation and that Mr M. \u2019s statement about the victims being \u201c finished off \u201d by the police did not concern PERSON personally . The remaining extracts were found damaging to his reputation and liable to rectification .", "CARDINAL . ORG awarded Mr MONEY ( MONEY ) and legal costs against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on an appeal by the applicant and the newspaper , upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of \u201c statements \u201d ( \u201c \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u201d ) that are damaging to his or her honour , dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness . The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that compensation for non - pecuniary damage is payable irrespective of the tortfeasor \u2019s fault if damages were sustained through dissemination of information damaging dignity , honour or reputation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
