He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON - Cosack , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The applicant had been practising as a lawyer since DATE and as a notary since DATE .", "On DATE the President of ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) opened formal disciplinary proceedings against him on suspicion of official misconduct involving a large number of failures to honour his notarial duties DATE .", "Consequently , on DATE the President of ORG provisionally removed the applicant from the office of notary . Given the nature and seriousness of the alleged misconduct , the President considered that there was a risk that the interests of individuals in need of legal advice would be adversely affected if the applicant continued to pursue his notarial activities . On DATE the applicant challenged that decision before ORG . On DATE that court confirmed his provisional removal from office . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal against this decision .", "DATE and DATE the President of ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses . On DATE the applicant was informed that the taking of evidence was terminated and granted a DATE time - limit to submit comments , which was later extended on the applicant 's request until DATE . On DATE the report on the preliminary investigations was finalised .", "On DATE the President of ORG finalised the charges and accused the applicant of CARDINAL violations of his professional duties , inter alia , of falsely certifying contracts , of creating an appearance of partiality and dependence in certifying a great number of contracts and of assisting in activities with clearly dishonest aims .", "On DATE the applicant suggested that the disciplinary proceedings be suspended pending criminal investigations .", "On DATE the President of ORG requested the court to decline to suspend the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG stayed the disciplinary proceedings in accordance with LAW of ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) with respect to the then ongoing criminal proceedings concerning the same facts .", "In criminal proceedings , on DATE , the prosecution filed the bill of indictment with ORG ( Amtsgericht ) .", "On DATE the President of ORG requested ORG to resume the disciplinary proceedings , arguing that the applicant 's ongoing provisional removal from office since ORG could infringe the principle of proportionality .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to annul its decision regarding his provisional removal from office . He further requested the court not to resume the suspended proceedings .", "On DATE ORG rejected the President 's request to resume the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG found for the applicant . It held that , in view of the length of the proceedings ( DATE and DATE so far ) and the unlikelihood that permanent removal from office would be imposed as a disciplinary penalty , the ongoing provisional removal from office was disproportionate .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of abetment to fraud and imposed a fine of QUANTITY ( ORG ) per day for DATE , taking into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant had lost his office as a notary and hence his source of income .", "The applicant continued to practise as a notary until DATE when ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE . ORG found that the disciplinary proceedings had not been protracted . The fact that the proceedings came to a standstill on DATE had been the result of ORG obligation under LAW of ORG to suspend the disciplinary proceedings while the criminal proceedings were pending . Even taking into account the considerable duration of the still pending criminal proceedings , ORG refusal to resume the suspended disciplinary proceedings did not yet overstep that court 's margin of appreciation . The duration of the proceedings , which had been pending for DATE and DATE , did not justify as such the conclusion that the continuation of the provisional removal was disproportionate . Given the gravity of his alleged misconduct and the great number of accusations , the applicant 's conduct had severely endangered the sound administration of justice . The applicant , who had admitted the facts , continued to maintain that his behaviour had been compatible with his notarial duties . Therefore , it could not be ruled out that he would continue to breach his duties if he was allowed to pursue his official functions as a notary . Finally , the court considered that it was very likely that the disciplinary proceedings would end with the applicant 's permanent removal from office .", "By way of a separate decision , also issued on DATE , ORG rejected the President of ORG complaint against the refusal to resume the disciplinary proceedings as inadmissible . The court considered , however , that the length of the proceedings obliged ORG to observe special diligence . It considered that the disciplinary proceedings had to be resumed without awaiting the outcome of the criminal proceedings if the latter proceedings on the applicant 's appeal were not terminated by DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint against ORG decision on his provisional removal from office as there had been no appearance of a violation of the applicant 's fundamental rights .", "On DATE ORG ordered the continuation of the disciplinary proceedings .", "On DATE following a hearing , ORG decided to permanently remove the applicant from office as he had been found guilty of misconduct , partly through negligence and partly intentional , which involved numerous failures to comply with his professional obligations DATE .", "The reasoned judgment with a volume of CARDINAL pages was submitted to the court 's registry on DATE .", "On DATE the L\u00fcbeck Regional Court ( Landgericht ) , in the criminal proceedings , upon the applicant 's appeal , modified the criminal sentence imposed by ORG , and issued a formal admonishment ( PERSON ) to the applicant while reserving its right to impose a fine . The court considered as mitigating factors that the delays in the criminal proceedings \u2013 even taking into account the thorough examination of the facts and the necessity to hear extensive evidence in the first instance proceedings DATE fell within the judiciary 's responsibility .", "On DATE the applicant , in order to avoid losing his license to practice as a lawyer , filed a request that he be permanently removed from notary office ; the request was granted on DATE .", "Therefore , on DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings in accordance with LAW , CARDINAL of ORG as in force at the material time ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with LAW of ORG provides that if criminal proceedings are brought against a notary , disciplinary proceedings instituted on account of the same facts shall be suspended until such time as the criminal proceedings have been concluded . The factual finding of a final judgment in criminal proceedings is binding on the disciplinary panel ( LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with LAW provides that the authority which institutes disciplinary proceedings against a notary can provisionally remove the latter from office as soon as formal disciplinary proceedings are opened .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of LAW , as in force at the material time , ORG discontinues the disciplinary proceedings if the notary has resigned or has been dismissed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
