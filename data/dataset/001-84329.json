This measure was originally planned for a short period of time during which a court - appointed expert was to prepare his opinion on custody rights and aimed at preventing the child \u2019s welfare being jeopardised by serious tensions arising from her GPE divorce proceedings .

She declared that she presently did not wish to have the child \u2019s placement with the foster family terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted its report . They considered that psychotherapy was currently not necessary , as the child \u2019s psychological situation had considerably improved and stabilised .

On DATE ORG , the applicant and PERSON \u2019s father agreed on CARDINAL initial visiting contacts under the supervision of a family assistant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG received H. \u2019s expert opinion . Having on several occasions heard and examined both parents , the child S. , the foster family and ORG , the expert found that PERSON felt at ease within the foster family , where she was well taken care of and encouraged . The expert further noted that both parents were in principle able to raise the child . However , the child \u2019s relationship with her mother was seriously disrupted . An attempt gradually to return the child to the applicant had failed . Having initially agreed to visits , the child had been deeply disturbed by an TIME stay and expressed the wish not to visit her mother again . The expert concluded that the child \u2019s fears could be handled once she could rest assured to permanently remain in the foster family . The expert suggested that the child should remain in the foster family , that ORG should be granted the right to decide about the child \u2019s place of residence and that visiting rights with the parents should be limited to CARDINAL visit per month in order to allow the child to stabilise .

On DATE the applicant confirmed that she requested that a decision be given on her motions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judge heard the child S. who declared that she felt at ease with the foster family and wished to remain there . S. further stated that the DATE contacts with her mother were not good since she did not feel at ease with her , while the DATE contacts with her father were good .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to appoint a curator ad litem to represent the child . On DATE ORG appointed a curator ad litem and requested ORG to report on the development of psychotherapy .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG submitted a report by the psychologist PERSON dated DATE . According to ORG , it had not been able to submit the report earlier as the applicant had not given her authorisation for release of medical information .", "CARDINAL . In her comments , PERSON reported that her attempts to build up contacts with PERSON had failed due to the child \u2019s resistance to any such efforts . She had discontinued psychotherapy on DATE as a continuation of her efforts would be harmful for the child \u2019s development . The expert further noted that S. suffered from a trauma caused by the life circumstances in her family of origin and that she tried to distance herself from her parents . The expert further expressed the opinion that the proceedings had been burdened by a number of shortcomings . Under the present circumstances , the parents had to cope with the fact that it was in the child \u2019s best interest to remain with the foster family . However , it was essential for both the parents and the child that visiting contact were not discontinued completely .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG recommended that PERSON should stay with the foster family until reaching majority and that no contacts should be instigated against the child \u2019s wishes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG proposed that the parents should abstain from making use of access rights for DATE and that contact should be carefully re - established afterwards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant rejected this proposal and submitted that recent visiting contacts between herself and her daughter had developed in a more positive way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pankow - Weissensee ORG , following a hearing attended by the parents , the child \u2019s curator ad litem , CARDINAL representatives of ORG and the foster parents , withdrew parental authority from the parents and transferred it to ORG . Furthermore , visiting contacts between the child and her parents were suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant was unable to accept the child \u2019s wishes and her present life circumstances within the foster family . She was , in particular , unable to accept that a parent - child relationship had developed between the child and her foster parents . Accordingly , she was unable to try to alleviate the conflict constantly arising from this situation . Taking into account the fact that the child was deeply rooted within the foster family , it would be potentially harmful for the child \u2019s well - being to remove her from there , as requested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that PERSON father had shown great understanding with regard to the child \u2019s needs and that he had given his consent to the child \u2019s remaining with the foster family . However , transferring sole parental authority to the father would distort the situation of conflict the child was exposed to and could jeopardise her psychological well - being . It followed that parental authority had to be withdrawn from both parents and transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG considered that , taking into account the child \u2019s serious objections , the applicant \u2019s tendency to massively interfere with the child \u2019s life in the foster family and the need to stabilise and strengthen the child , access rights would very probably jeopardise the child \u2019s well - being and had to be suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( GPE ) . She emphasised that the child \u2019s placement in the foster family had been devised as a temporary measure and considered the measures taken by ORG to be disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child \u2019s curator submitted her comments . She considered that the child \u2019s persistent wish not to see her parents should be respected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child \u2019s father submitted his comments . He considered that the child should remain with the foster family , but requested to be granted DATE access rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of S. , her curator ad litem , her parents , the foster parents and a ORG representative .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearing , ORG quashed ORG decision , transferred sole parental authority to the child \u2019s father and granted the applicant visiting rights once per month for TIME each .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the opinion submitted by the court - appointed expert PERSON and to the comments submitted by the therapist PERSON , ORG considered that the relationship between the child and the applicant had to be regarded as problematic . The applicant \u2019s wish to remove the child from the foster family would cause the child serious psychological damage . All parties heard in the proceedings had confirmed that the child found a sense of security and stability in the foster family , where she had been living for DATE . The child had consistently expressed the wish to live with the foster family as a full family member .", "CARDINAL . ORG conceded that the alienation between the applicant and her daughter had to a substantial degree been caused by the period of time which had elapsed since her placement in the foster family , which was originally planned as a short - time measure . The proceedings could and should have been conducted in a considerably more stringent way . However , the decision had to be taken in accordance with the child \u2019s welfare , which was not defined by earlier shortcomings of the proceedings . The child \u2019s welfare required to assure her that she could remain with the foster family without having to fear that her stable life situation would change for reasons which she could not understand .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , however , that the prerequisites of section DATE of LAW had not been met , as the child \u2019s father was able and willing to accept the child \u2019s wishes and to co - operate with both PERSON and the foster family . Accordingly , sole parental authority was to be awarded to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally found that there were no reasons to suspend the applicant \u2019s access rights . While the child S. , when heard by ORG , had confirmed that she did not have any interest in meeting her mother , she had also declared that she was ready to visit her once per month if the court proceedings and permanent hearings would come to an end . ORG considered DATE visits of DATE each necessary and sufficient to give the applicant and her child the possibility to get closer again . It also stated that the child was free to visit her mother at any other time if she should wish to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against ORG decision , in which she gave a full account of the proceedings before the civil courts and alleged that the impugned decision was disproportionate and violated her right to the enjoyment of her family life under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the applicant \u2019s counsel to submit a copy of ORG decision dated DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted the requested document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication pursuant to the relevant provisions of that court \u2019s Rules of Procedure without giving any further reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ordered the applicant to contribute a specific amount to the costs incurred by the accommodation of her daughter in the foster family from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . On DATE FAC ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . If parents holding joint custody separate permanently , either parent may apply to be awarded full parental authority pursuant to section DATE of LAW . The family courts will follow this request if the other parent gives his or her consent or if it is to be expected that withdrawal of parental authority from CARDINAL parent and transferral to the other best serves the child \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW of the LAW parental authority comprehends the right to order DATE who unlawfully deprives the parents or CARDINAL parent of their child \u2013 to have their child returned .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , a child is entitled to have access to its parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child . The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child \u2019s well - being would be endangered ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Section DATE provides that in cases of a danger to the child \u2019s welfare the court shall order the necessary measures . Pursuant to section QUANTITY measures which entail a separation of the child from the parents are only permitted if the danger can not be averted by other means , including assistance by public authorities . The right of personal custody may only be withdrawn in its entirety if other measures proved unsuccessful or if it has to be assumed that they are insufficient to avert the danger .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on Non - Contentious Proceedings ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen PERSON ) determines that in proceedings concerning a minor child , ORG may appoint a curator ad litem ( PERSON ) for that child to assist him or her if this should be necessary for the protection of his or her interests .", "DATE . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , the appointment of a curator ad litem is usually necessary where the child \u2019s interests conflict substantially with those of his legal representative , where the subject - matter of the proceedings concerns measures to be taken to avert a risk to the child \u2019s well - being involving a separation of the child from his or her family or the withdrawal of full parental authority or where the subject matter concerns the child \u2019s removal from the foster carer , spouse , partner or person entitled to access ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
