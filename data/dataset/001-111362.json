The common complaint in the applications is that each applicant was interviewed by the police without access to a lawyer and the evidence obtained from that interviewed was relied on by the prosecution at trial .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently detained at ORG . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , PERSON , is also a NORP national . She was born in DATE and is currently detained at FAC . She is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the first applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of Saturday DATE , the first applicant had a sexual encounter with a woman who was spending TIME at his flat . TIME the woman attended a police station where she made an allegation of rape against him . The first applicant was then detained by the police and interviewed by them without the presence of a lawyer . In the interview he made a statement that he and the woman had had consensual sex . He was subsequently charged with rape and tried on indictment at ORG of Justiciary sitting at GPE DATE . At trial the prosecution relied on the statement the first applicant had given to the police . On DATE , he was convicted by a majority verdict of the jury . He did not appeal against his conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE before the delivery of the judgment of ORG in GPE v. HM Advocate [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) , the first applicant applied to ORG of Justiciary sitting as a court of criminal appeal ( \u201c the Appeal Court \u201d ) for an extension of time in which to lodge an appeal against conviction and sentence . In the Note of Appeal which accompanied the application for an extension of time , the first applicant submitted inter alia that his trial had been unfair because he had not been give access to a lawyer while in police custody and the prosecution had relied on the contents of his police interview at trial .", "CARDINAL . The application for an extension of time was initially refused by a Single Judge and then , following an oral hearing on CARDINAL DATE , by a bench of CARDINAL judges .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the second applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a trial at ORG of Justiciary sitting at GPE , the second applicant was convicted of murder . In the course of the trial , the prosecution had relied on statements given by the second applicant in the course of a police interview , which took place on DATE without the presence of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was advised by her then legal representatives that she had no grounds for appealing against her conviction and accordingly did not do so within the statutory time - limit . However , it appears that , in DATE and again in DATE and DATE , she was granted extensions of time in which to lodge a ORG , but failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of advice from new legal representatives , the second applicant lodged an application for extension of time in which to lodge an appeal against conviction . The application and an accompanying devolution minute alleged inter alia that the second applicant \u2019s trial had been unfair as a result of the admission of the statements she had given in her police interview .", "CARDINAL . The application was refused by a Single Judge on CARDINAL DATE . The second applicant appealed against that decision and a hearing was convened before CARDINAL judges of ORG on DATE . Before the hearing senior counsel advised the second applicant that none of her grounds of appeal were arguable : in particular , he advised that ORG finding in GPE that its ruling should not apply to \u201c closed cases \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) meant that the second applicant \u2019s ground of appeal relating to the admission of her statements to the police could not succeed . Consequently , at the hearing on DATE , the second applicant sought to withdraw her application for an extension of time . ORG allowed the application to be withdrawn on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the above judgment ( and the time of the present applicants\u2019 trial ) , sections DATE and CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) provided that a person detained at a police station had the right to have the fact and place of his detention intimated to a solicitor , but did not have the automatic right of access to a solicitor either prior to or during a police interview .", "CARDINAL . The compatibility of sections DATE and CARDINAL of the DATE Act with this ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE was considered by ORG of Justiciary sitting as a court of criminal appeal ( \u201c the Appeal Court \u201d ) in ORG v. PERSON , judgment of CARDINAL DATE . ORG considered that it was not necessary to give effect to the PERSON judgment in GPE , finding instead that the guarantees available under the NORP system were sufficient to secure a fair trial of someone who was interviewed without access to a lawyer and whose responses were relied on by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was detained in DATE following an incident in which CARDINAL men had been attacked by a group of youths . He was taken to a police station and interviewed , under caution but without the presence of a lawyer , by QUANTITY police officers . During the interview he made a number of admissions with regard to the offences with which he was later charged . He was then arrested , cautioned and charged with assault and breach of the peace . At trial the audio tape recording of his police interview was played in full to the jury and they were given copies of the transcript . On CARDINAL DATE he was convicted on all charges . He appealed against conviction inter alia on the ground that his interview had been relied on at trial . His appeals to ORG were refused on the papers at the first and second sift stages . He then submitted an application for special leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG unanimously found that : ( i ) PERSON had been incorrectly decided by ORG ; ( ii ) ORG \u2019s case should be remitted to ORG for further consideration ; ( iii ) and its ruling should not apply retroactively .", "CARDINAL . On the third issue , both Lord Hope and Lord PERSON ( with whom the other Justices agreed ) held that , in the interests of legal certainty , the ruling should not permit the re - opening of closed cases , but rather only apply to cases which had not yet gone to trial , to cases where the trial was still in progress and to appeals that had been brought timeously . For all closed cases it was a matter for ORG to decide whether the cases should be referred back to ORG and for that court to decide what course it ought to take if a reference were to be made to it by the Commission .", "CARDINAL . Immediately after the ORG ruling , LAW ( \u201c LAW ) was passed by ORG . It amends PERSON ( GPE ) Act DATE to allow a suspect the right to have intimation sent to a solicitor inter alia that the solicitor \u2019s professional assistance is required by the suspect . It also provides for the right to a private consultation with a solicitor before any questioning begins and at any other time during such questioning . Consultation includes , for example , consultation by means of telephone . The CARDINAL Act also provides that a suspect must be informed of these rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG is a public body with the task of reviewing and investigating cases where it is alleged a miscarriage of justice has occurred . LAW amends the provisions of LAW which give the Commission the power to refer cases to ORG . LAW directs the Commission , in determining whether or not it is in the interests of justice that a reference should be made , to have regard to the need for finality and certainty in the determination of criminal proceedings . LAW also gives ORG the power to reject a case which has been referred to it by the Commission if the court considers that it is not in the interests of justice that any appeal arising from the reference should proceed . The LAW provides that , in determining whether or not it is in the interests of justice that any appeal arising from the reference should proceed , ORG must have regard to the need for finality and certainty in the determination of criminal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
