FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He was represented before the ORG by ORG et PERSON , a law firm authorised to practise in the PERSON d\u2019Etat and ORG , then by its successor firm ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found him guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and stripped him of his civil , civic and family rights .", "On DATE ORG declared that the applicant had forfeited his right to appeal on points of law against that judgment .", "On DATE the applicant began to serve his sentence .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed his application for deferment of sentence on medical grounds ( LAW , introduced by LAW ) . An appeal on points of law by the principal public prosecutor against that judgment was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "By virtue of his status as a former prefect , the applicant had been receiving a civil - service pension , which was suspended by a decision of DATE with effect from DATE ( DATE after the judgment of ORG declaring his right to appeal on points of law forfeit ) , pursuant to LAW , under which an entitlement to , or the enjoyment of , pension rights is suspended by the imposition of a dishonouring penalty with or without physical restraint ( peine afflictive ou infamante ) , for the duration of such penalty .", "An appeal by the applicant against that decision was upheld in a judgment of DATE by the ORG d\u2019Etat , which found as follows :", "\u201c The category of dishonouring penalties entailing physical restraint was superseded by LAW , which was introduced by LAW of DATE , amended by LAW of DATE , and which entered into force on DATE . Whilst the sentence of fixed - term imprisonment , which fell within that category under the old Criminal Code , is indeed provided for in the new Criminal Code , a new sentencing scale now exists . It is apparent from the provisions of the new Criminal Code , in the light of its drafting history , that the legislature sought to limit the number of ancillary or additional penalties which had to be imposed in addition to the principal sentence . The legislature did not indicate which sentences could now be regarded as corresponding to the sentences which , in the old Criminal Code , had been classified as dishonouring penalties entailing physical restraint . Therefore , the entry into force of the new Criminal Code deprived of effect the above - mentioned provisions of LAW . Accordingly , the decision appealed against could not legally have been taken on such basis and must therefore be set aside . \u201d", "Consequently , the ORG d\u2019Etat instructed the Minister for ORG to restore , within DATE following the notification of the judgment , the applicant \u2019s enjoyment of his pension rights with effect from DATE , and to arrange for the necessary payments .", "The applicant also used to receive a pension in his capacity as a former member of parliament . He was notified in a letter of DATE that his pension entitlement had been suspended on the basis of Rule CARDINAL ) of the Former MPs\u2019 ORG , which provides that entitlement to , or enjoyment of , the pension is suspended by the imposition of a dishonouring penalty with or without physical restraint .", "Following the deferment of the applicant \u2019s sentence , his counsel , in a letter of DATE , submitted a request to the Director of ORG seeking the resumption of his pension payments . That request was implicitly rejected and the applicant appealed on DATE to the ORG d\u2019Etat , simultaneously lodging an application for immediate suspension of the implicit decision .", "In proceedings before the PERSON d\u2019Etat , ORG invoked the principle of immunity from legal proceedings , relying on LAW CARDINAL DATE on the organisation of parliamentary chambers and on the fact that the pension funds of parliamentarians did not fall under the ordinary law but under special rules introduced within the ORG that were justified by the principle of separation of powers and parliamentary autonomy ; decisions taken under such special rules were not therefore administrative acts of the administrative authorities and did not fall within the jurisdiction of the administrative courts .", "The applicant took the opposite position , relying in particular on the right to judicial review recognised by ORG and the ORG d\u2019Etat , and also on the ORG and the ORG \u2019s case - law ( specifically , the cases of ORG v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVIII ) . He pointed out that the right to a retirement pension was an economic right protected by LAW . He contended that this right had been acquired with final effect in his case and therefore had to be protected by a fully effective remedy . He urged the ORG d\u2019Etat to depart from traditional case - law according to which the purely institutional aspect of parliamentary decisions prevailed .", "In his submissions the Government Commissioner called upon the PERSON d\u2019Etat to assume jurisdiction , arguing in essence that as a former ORG \u2019s pension was not related to the tasks of the ORG and was independent of the regulations applicable to parliamentarians , a judge could rule on such matters , that the administrative courts alone had jurisdiction to entertain that kind of dispute , and that this was the only solution capable of allowing the former MP to have access to a court in respect of his dispute .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the appeal as follows :", "\u201c ORG for Former MPs was set up by a resolution of ORG adopted on DATE and confirmed by an Act of CARDINAL DATE . LAW DATE constituting an institutional Act on the allowances of members of parliament , adopted on the basis of LAW , provides : \u2018 The funds set up by resolutions of ORG dated DATE and of the ORG dated DATE shall be maintained for the benefit of members of ORG and the ORG ... Pensions paid from these funds shall not be liable to assignment or attachment , except for the purposes of maintenance NORP In an order of DATE by ORG , a single set of rules governing pension and social - security funds for MPs and former MPs was adopted .", "The rules governing the pensions of former MPs form part of the regulations applicable to parliamentarians , of which the specific provisions reflect the nature of their duties . Those regulations thus stem from the exercise of national sovereignty by members of parliament . Having regard to the nature of that activity , it is not for the administrative courts to entertain disputes relating to the rules governing MPs\u2019 pensions . \u201d", "In a letter of DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested the President of ORG to restore his client \u2019s pension , relying on the fact that the category of dishonouring penalties entailing physical restraint had been abolished since the entry into force of the new Criminal Code .", "On DATE the President replied as follows :", "\u201c On DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat gave CARDINAL decisions , CARDINAL concerning Mr PERSON pension as a former civil servant , in which it held that the pension was to be restored with effect from DATE , and the other concerning his pension as a former member of parliament , in which it confirmed that the administrative courts had no jurisdiction to rule on a former ORG \u2019s pension .", "At first sight those CARDINAL decisions seem to concern the same questions . But they are not the same , as you know , when it comes to the merits .", "The dispute between Mr PERSON and ORG is connected with the basic principle of separation of powers and parliamentary autonomy . It is obviously in the light of that principle that the decision of the ORG d\u2019Etat should be considered , as regards your client \u2019s pension as a former MP . That decision should not have been an unexpected CARDINAL for you , as it is totally consistent with the case - law that has always been followed by the PERSON d\u2019Etat concerning internal decisions by parliamentary chambers in respect of regulations governing their members .", "Those regulations are indispensable for the proper exercise of an MP \u2019s duties and do not simply consist of provisions on immunities . The granting of aid , and later of pensions , to former members of parliament was decided at the time of GPE precisely to ensure that politics would not be the privilege of a particular social class . As such , nothing obliged the parliamentary chambers to create a specific system of retirement pensions for MPs . The real purpose of creating such a system DATE , and thus long before legislation was adopted in this field for NORP citizens in general , was not to treat parliamentarians as employees but , firstly , to allow all NORP citizens to enjoy equal access to political office and , secondly , to compensate for the precariousness of such office . The rules on DATE pensions are independent of pension legislation because they are governed by the ORG \u2019s general internal regulations and the decisions of its ORG , and not by statutes enacted under LAW .", "The decision taken by the PERSON d\u2019Etat on DATE is thus totally consistent with the NORP logic whereby the courts may intervene in the functioning of parliamentary chambers only in the cases expressly and exhaustively provided for by law .", "In these circumstances , I do not see any particular reason why ORG should reverse its decision to suspend Mr PERSON pension . No new fact has arisen , to date , in favour of your client , who remains convicted of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity and whose sentence , to my knowledge , has not ceased to take effect . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c National sovereignty shall belong to the people , who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum . \u201d", "...", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ORG shall comprise ORG and the ORG .", "Deputies to ORG shall be elected by direct suffrage ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c An institutional Act shall determine the term for which each chamber is elected , the number of its members , their allowances , the conditions of eligibility and the rules governing disqualification and incompatibility . \u201d", "These Ordinances constituting institutional Acts respectively concern the conditions of parliamentary eligibility and incompatibility and the allowances of members of parliament . Under LAW DATE , MPs\u2019 allowances are in principle exclusive of any other public - service remuneration . However , MPs\u2019 allowances may be combined with the receipt of civil and military pensions of any kind .", "The MPs\u2019 pension fund was created under GPE by a resolution of ORG dated DATE .", "LAW above - mentioned Ordinance of DATE provided :", "\u201c The funds set up by resolutions of ORG dated DATE and of the ORG dated DATE shall be maintained for the benefit of members of ORG and the ORG ; they shall continue to provide pensions to former members of those CARDINAL chambers or previous chambers , or to their surviving spouses and minor orphans ; they may receive donations or legacies .", "Pensions paid from these funds shall not be liable to assignment or attachment , except for the purposes of maintenance payments . \u201d", "The instrument which currently governs pension rights of former MPs is a set of rules annexed to an order of DATE by ORG .", "Pensions paid to former MPs and former senators are not governed by ORG , which does apply , however , to civil and military officials and to their successors .", "The pension fund is funded by contributions deducted from DATE allowances and by a subsidy paid out of the ORG \u2019s budget .", "Pension entitlements are calculated according to DATE of contribution .
