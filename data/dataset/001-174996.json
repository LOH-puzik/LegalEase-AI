By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the applicant . In its reasoning it referred to the right to freedom of expression and the protection of private life as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL .

A wave of bankruptcies hit companies and individuals , the value of the krona plummeted and changes were made to the ruling government , to name a few . The media have covered these events since the crisis began and the individuals involved have also been the subject of news coverage , including [ A ] . In determining whether the content of the news item is a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest , it should be kept in mind that [ A ] himself , as well as the companies he has represented , has been in the media and public debate for DATE . [ A ] has also been very prominent in business , both here and abroad , and in both a negative and positive light . [ Company Z ] , led by [ A ] , was a large shareholder in [ F ] ... , and held an active share in ORG News about [ A ] has therefore more often than not been about his role in the banking collapse , and after the collapse of the NORP banks in DATE the media was full of news on the banking collapse and crisis , the reasons behind them and related matters . The media have been called upon to disseminate all material that could be of public interest , especially if the content might shed light on elements pertaining to parties who have played key roles in the NORP economy . In the light of the circumstances that developed after the banking collapse , [ A ] will have to withstand personal discussion of his actions and participation in business . Loan facilities and transfers of funds occurring in the leadup to the bank failure are important news stories that are relevant to the general public . Restricting that discussion through sanctions should only be done after great consideration .", "[ The applicant ] has stated that the news item is based on sources , both verbal and written , that he finds trustworthy . [ The applicant ] can not be asked to prove these statements , as the journalist \u2019s right to protect his sources and their identity has been upheld in judicial rulings . [ The applicant ] has also sufficiently demonstrated that he tried to contact [ A ] before he delivered the news item and he has therefore not violated ORG procedures in that respect .", "The ORG does not agree with [ A ] that he is accused of actions punishable by law in the news item . The news item must be assessed as a whole and not on the basis of individual statements in the piece . As previously noted , the ORG must consider the circumstances under which the statements are made , that they are necessary for a social debate on the causes and repercussions of the bank failure and also that some discrepancies can occur when dealing with complicated loan facilities and business deals . When the statements on [ A ] are assessed in this light , they are not found to violate the provisions of ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Penal Code no . CARDINAL . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE A appealed against ORG judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG overturned the ORG judgment and ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL ( approximately CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) to A in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , plus interest and LAW ( CARDINAL ORG ) for A \u2019s legal costs before the domestic courts . The CARDINAL words were declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . The judgment contained the following reasoning :", "\u201c ... In assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression , as protected by LAW , and the right to privacy , as protected by LAW , it is important to determine whether the content published can be considered a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest , see ORG judgments of DATE in case no . CARDINAL , DATE in case no . DATE , DATE in case no . CARDINAL and DATE in case no . CARDINAL . The media play an important role in disseminating information and opinions on social issues . The public has a right to information on such issues and there must be particularly strong reasons for determining that limitations on media freedom are warranted in a democratic society . The collapse that occurred in the NORP economy following the failure of the CARDINAL NORP commercial banks in DATE has had a significant and broad effect on all activity in the country and the general public \u2019s quality of life . Public debate and media coverage have been very focused on identifying the preceding events and reasons for the collapse , and reporting on the financial business of individuals has often been personal .", "When the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed as a whole , and the disputed remarks are evaluated in context with other statements in the news report and in consideration of the visual presentation , the comments clearly implied that [ A ] had committed an act which was punishable in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL .", "[ The applicant ] has not presented any documents supporting the legitimacy of the statements , for which he has to bear the burden , as it was incumbent on him rather than [ A ] to secure such evidence . [ The applicant ] has also not demonstrated that he sought information from [ A ] on the content while preparing the news report . He therefore failed in his duty , as outlined in LAW dated DATE , to seek \u201c ... information from both or all parties and attempt to show their points of view as equally as possible \u201d . ORG therefore finds that [ the applicant ] could not have been acting in good faith as pertains to the accuracy of the remarks in the news piece . Therefore [ A \u2019s ] demand for the quoted statements to be declared null and void is granted , pursuant to LAW , cf .
