Before the ORG , the applicant argued , first , that the decision to deport him was not in accordance with the law . The relevant paragraph of ORG , paragraph CARDINAL , had changed on DATE . The earlier version of the rule required the Secretary of ORG to conduct a balancing exercise post-CARDINAL DATE version of the rule established a presumption that the public interest required deportation . The Secretary of ORG would consider all relevant factors in considering whether the presumption was outweighed in a particular case , but it would be only in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation would be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to ORG to deport . The applicant argued that the decision to deport him had been taken on DATE and thus his case should have been considered under the old version of paragraph CARDINAL , which was more favourable to him .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant argued that in light of his extensive private and family life in GPE and the length of his stay there , the decision to deport him was a violation of LAW . He also submitted a report prepared by a consultant clinical psychologist who diagnosed him as having mild to moderate depression , panic disorder , mild mental retardation , borderline intellectual functioning and dyslexia .", "CARDINAL . In a determination dated DATE , the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the relevant date for the decision to deport was DATE , as the decision had remained incomplete until it was communicated to the applicant , and as a consequence his deportation fell to be considered under the later version of paragraph CARDINAL . In the alternative , the ORG found that if it was wrong in this conclusion and therefore had to conduct a balancing exercise pursuant to the earlier version of paragraph CARDINAL , it would have come to the same conclusion . The ORG also held that there had been no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for reconsideration of the ORG \u2019s decision . On DATE a Senior Immigration Judge refused the application , holding that although the ORG had concluded that the decision to deport was made after paragraph CARDINAL was amended , it had also considered the alternative . All relevant matters were considered by the ORG and no material error of law was disclosed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s application for statutory review was dismissed by ORG on DATE .

The applicant was deported to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application to revoke the deportation order was refused by the Secretary of ORG . On DATE ORG dismissed the judicial review application . The applicant brought an out - of - country appeal against this decision but the appeal was dismissed under both ORG and LAW .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG .

The amended version of paragraph CARDINAL , in force since DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c Subject to paragraph CARDINAL , while each case will be considered on its merits , where a person is liable to deportation the presumption shall be that the public interest requires deportation . The Secretary of ORG will consider all relevant factors in considering whether the presumption is outweighed in any particular case , although it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to LAW and the LAW relating to LAW to deport . The aim is an exercise of the power of deportation which is consistent and fair as between CARDINAL person and another , although CARDINAL case will rarely be identical with another in all material respects ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In EO ( PERSON appeals : scope and process ) GPE [ DATE ] PERSON CARDINAL the ORG considered whether the amendment to paragraph CARDINAL substantively changed the rule . It concluded :", "\u201c we have no doubt that the substantive meaning of paragraph CARDINAL after amendment by ORG CARDINAL is very different from that which it previously bore . The range of issues expressly falling for consideration in the exercise of the discretion to make a deportation decision in the old version is such as to suggest a general duty to look at the issues already considered in the evaluation of the human rights claim and to apply what might be termed a lower standard to them . That range of considerations does not feature in the new version , which instead introduces a presumption in favour of deportation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , referred to in both versions of paragraph CARDINAL , provides as follows :", "\u201c A deportation order will not be made against any person if his removal in pursuance of the order would be contrary to GPE obligations under LAW relating to ORG [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Rules relating to the revocation of a deportation order are contained in CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( as amended ) , supplemented by LAW ( \u201c IDIs \u201d ) . There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although ORG to LAW of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal . Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation DATE after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave , persons who obtained leave by deception , and family members deported under LAW ) of LAW DATE . With regard to criminal conviction cases , the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now \u201c spent \u201d under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules , however , indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course . This is expanded on in GPE A to LAW of the IDIs , which indicates that revocation would not normally be appropriate until DATE after departure for those convicted of serious offences such as violence against the person , sexual offences , burglary , robbery or theft , and other offences such as forgery and drug trafficking ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
