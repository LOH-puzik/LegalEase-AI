On DATE a police enquiry or a preliminary investigation was opened into the incident . In a decision of DATE , ORG brought charges against the applicant and another individual for median bodily injury ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) and ordered their arrest . A police report of DATE considered them to have absconded as they had not been found at their known addresses . The applicant claimed , however , that the police never visited his official residence nor sent him a notice inviting him to appear for questioning . Thus , he claimed not to have been informed of the proceedings or that the authorities were looking for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed on the national mostwanted list .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed , which the Government did not expressly challenge , that during this period he presented himself to the authorities and was charged with offences stemming from CARDINAL other preliminary investigations which were being conducted against him at the time .

In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on the basis that he had absconded and had been placed on the national most - wanted list as a result .

During the hearing the prosecution presented the domestic court with a list of pending criminal investigations against the applicant which allegedly supported their argument that he might re - offend or abscond . His lawyer , however , challenged that assertion and noted that in some of those cases the applicant had presented himself to the authorities during the period when he was allegedly in hiding ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In any event , the court found , in spite of the fact that the applicant had voluntarily presented himself to the authorities , that there was sufficient evidence that he might abscond or re - offend considering that he had already absconded in the context of the proceedings , had been placed on the national most - wanted list , had a prior conviction and there were other criminal proceedings opened against him . The court also considered that there was sufficient evidence that the applicant had perpetrated the offence with which he had been charged .", "CARDINAL .
