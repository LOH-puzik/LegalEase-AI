Instead , he got out of the car and went into the mechanic \u2019s workshop FAC , which belonged to his father , the second applicant . Although PERSON continued to shout towards the first applicant , requesting him to stop and come back , the latter did not pay any attention . Accordingly , PERSON and GPE decided to apprehend him in order to draw up an administrative offence report . They followed him , took hold of his hands and attempted to walk him towards the police car . However , the first applicant resisted by pulling his hands away , pushing the police officers away and falling on the ground in order to drag PERSON down with his weight .

NORP In addition , criminal proceedings were instituted against both applicants for assault on a representative of public authority .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contested the ORG \u2019s version of events , which was largely based on the testimony of the police officers during the first applicant \u2019s trial , to which they objected . The applicants alleged that the police officers had assaulted the first applicant and detained the second applicant for no reason . The first applicant claimed that the police officers had forcibly held his arms behind his back , pushed him to the ground , tried to break his ribs with their knees , and dragged him to the ground on the premises of the workshop FAC , where he had first been stopped . They had also taken his mobile phone . When he had managed to break free of the police ORG grip , he had fled .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the first applicant was transferred to FAC , where he remained until his release pending trial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG replied to various enquiries by the first applicant . He mentioned , among other things , that under the internal prison regulations they were not allowed to hand over blankets supplied by relatives to detainees ; that there were no rules regarding smells in the cells ; and that the use of buckets as toilets was temporary ( since DATE ) and due to financial problems . Works were in progress to rectify this .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the second applicant \u2019s complaint to ORG of DATE about , among other things , the fact that he had had to sleep on a bare wooden platform for DATE , received no reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an inspector of ORG , PERSON , instituted a criminal inquiry against the applicants in connection with the events of DATE . She initially classified the events as \u201c assault on a representative of public authority \u201d under section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . At TIME on DATE , the applicants were detained at the police station on the basis of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the former Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE inspector PERSON sent the case to the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG for the purpose of bringing charges against the applicants . She classified the offence as \u201c resisting a representative of public authority \u201d ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . On DATE a prosecutor brought charges against the first applicant under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor lifted the second applicant \u2019s detention order because there was not sufficient evidence to bring charges against him . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings against the second applicant for lack of evidence that he had committed an offence under either section CARDINAL or CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was placed in FAC . On DATE he was released . On CARDINAL DATE the preliminary investigation was completed and the case materials were sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The hearings in the first applicant \u2019s trial before ORG took place CARDINAL and CARDINAL . A verdict was pronounced on DATE whereby the first applicant was convicted of resisting a representative of public authority using violence , as defined in section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . He was given a suspended sentence of DATE years\u2019 imprisonment . The court heard the testimony of the police officers , the applicants and several direct and indirect witnesses , and examined circumstantial evidence .", "In particular , witness ORG testified during the trial that when the applicant had been arrested at FAC he had not resisted . Rather , the police officers had used force against him and pushed him to the ground in order to handcuff him . The court did not believe ORG because in his testimony at the pre - trial stage he had testified to the contrary : that the first applicant had resisted and the police officers had not used force . The court gave more credence to the CARDINAL statements PERSON had given at the pre - trial stage . Witnesses PERSON and GPE testified that the first applicant had resisted the police officers , but had not struck them . Witnesses ORG , GPE and GPE testified that the applicant had not resisted as he had been on the ground , although he had tried to run away . In addition , witnesses GPE and I.T testified that police officer GPE had confiscated GPE \u2019s mobile phone when the latter had tried to call the police . Witness [ X].B. testified that when running away from FAC the first applicant had asked him for a mobile phone to call the second applicant .", "None of the witnesses testified that they had heard the first applicant or the police officers swearing or threatening each other . The testimony of all the witnesses in fact related to the events at FAC and not to the events at the LAW country house .", "Further , the court gave credence to the testimony of the police officers , who claimed that the first applicant , before entering the premises of FAC , had made violent threats against them . There was no other evidence in support of the testimony of the police officers . The court did not give credence to the first applicant \u2019s submissions that the police officers had used force against him at FAC , and thus rejected that testimony as his defence position .", "All in all , the court concluded as follows :", "\u201c [ The first applicant ] actively resisted the police officers . He tried to break free of the ORG grip , pushed the police officers , did not allow them to lead him away ; while being restrained he fell to the ground , using his body weight in an attempt to escape from their grip , did not allow them to lead him away and tried to break free of their grip using one and then the other hand ; he wriggled on the ground and would not follow the police officers , who were thus obliged to struggle with him in order to get him into the police vehicle , whereupon he broke free and fled \u201d .", "During the trial the prosecutor dropped the charges against the first applicant in relation to his resistance at Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i . The court found that there was no evidence of it and did not give credence to the testimony of the police officers in that respect . The court also held that there was no evidence that the police officers had kicked and pushed the first applicant . It did not give credence to the testimony of the first and second applicants in that respect . The court also found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the first applicant had struck the police officers at FAC . He was not found responsible for inflicting minor bodily injuries on the police officers , and their civil claims in that regard were rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an appeal by the first applicant , ORG set aside the district court \u2019s judgment and acquitted him . The court heard evidence from his mother and the family doctor . The police officers were not present . The first applicant \u2019s mother testified that in her opinion the actions of the police officers could have been motivated by revenge since the first applicant had previously dated ORG sister .", "The regional court concluded that the actions for which the first applicant had been convicted were to be classified as an administrative offence under LAW . The court noted that the district court had agreed with the prosecutor \u2019s recommendation to withdraw the charges concerning resistance by the first applicant at Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i . Similarly , the district court had dismissed the charges of active violence against the police officers at FAC causing them minor bodily injuries , and the applicant was not held responsible in that regard .", "The regional court did not agree with the district court that the police ORG testimony had greater credence . It did not agree that the first applicant \u2019s testimony and the supporting testimony of the witnesses ought to be dismissed as lacking credence . The court considered that the statements of the police officers and of the first applicant were to be evaluated equally critically . These persons had an equal interest in giving testimony to justify their actions , the police officers in respect of the arrest of the first applicant and his bodily injuries , and the first applicant in relation to driving a car without a valid driving licence and resisting the police officers .", "The court dismissed as incorrect the district court \u2019s conclusion that the testimony of the police officers had been consistent . It highlighted various inconsistencies between the testimony they had given at different times . It also dismissed their claims that they had acted politely towards the first applicant and had complied with the rules on discipline . The court also took into account the apparent conflict between the applicants and ORG . In particular , the events of DATE were noted . The court expressed doubts about the objectivity of the police officers of that police department towards the applicants . Concerns about their objectivity were evident from the preliminary investigation procedure as a whole . First of all , no bodily injuries had been recorded in the first applicant \u2019s detention order even though the police officers had used force against the applicant . Second , even though the first applicant had been examined by an ambulance doctor twice and a diagnosis established , no mention of it had been contained in the forensic report . The court noted that it had been impossible for the first applicant to prove that he had sustained concussion because he was being held in custody , whereas it had been a duty incumbent on the investigating authorities to examine his physical condition and on the forensic expert to take it into account . Third , the same officer ( PERSON ) had taken decisions in both the first applicant \u2019s case and that of the police officers ; in such circumstances her impartiality was questionable . The court also concluded that the prosecutor dealing with the case had been keen to send the first applicant \u2019s case for trial as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon appeals on points of law submitted by the prosecutor and the police officers , the ORG of ORG set aside the judgment of ORG and sent the case to a regional court for fresh consideration .", "The ORG ruled that the appellate court had erred in its conclusion that the actions for which the first applicant had been convicted by the first - instance court were not of a criminal nature within the meaning of CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . His actions had not been passive and had thus been wrongly classified by the appellate court as an administrative offence under LAW . The ORG concluded that the appellate court had not adequately evaluated the facts of the case and the actions of the police officers from the perspective of their lawfulness .", "In reply to the first applicant \u2019s request for criminal proceedings to be instituted against the police officers and PERSON , the ORG noted that it did not have competence to comply with such a request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the first applicant \u2019s appeal against the district court \u2019s judgment anew , and upheld the ruling . A prosecutor , both police officers , the first applicant and his counsels attended the hearing .", "ORG established that the first applicant had actively resisted the police officers and thus committed a criminal offence under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . The court found no evidence that the police officers had struck or kicked the first applicant at FAC .", "ORG did not give credence to the testimony of the first applicant \u2019s mother before ORG regarding a possible revenge motive , since the case materials did not support it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senator of ORG informed the first applicant that his appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG had been dismissed without a review on the merits since it disputed the assessment of the evidence and such a complaint did not fall within the competence of the cassation court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE inspector PERSON of ORG adopted a decision refusing to institute the criminal proceedings against police officers J.S and FAC in response to the first applicant \u2019s complaint . She noted :", "\u201c A review of the case materials does not bear out the allegation that the police officers abused their official position in relation to [ the first applicant ] ; they acted in compliance with the powers vested in them to prevent and stop [ the first applicant \u2019s ] misdemeanours .", "Having fully reviewed the case materials , I consider that inspector PERSON and cadet V.D. of ORG did not abuse their official position within the meaning of section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , therefore it is refused to institute the criminal proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s counsel complained to ORG and to ORG that the investigation by officer PERSON , as supervised by prosecutor GPE , had been biased . He mentioned that they had repeatedly made requests for a forensic examination to be carried out to establish whether the first applicant had any bodily injuries , and that it had not been carried out until DATE . In his complaint to ORG , the first applicant \u2019s counsel requested that the investigation be handed over to another investigative authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG replied that there was no evidence that the forensic examination had been delayed . She noted that such an examination had been requested on DATE . She did not consider that the investigation had not been objective .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG attached to ORG replied to another complaint , noting that after an examination of the case materials there was no evidence that ORG and ORG were not interested in carrying out an objective and detailed investigation . The request to hand over the investigation to another investigative authority was therefore refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG stated , in reply to a complain by the first applicant \u2019s mother , that with regard to the events of DATE at the mechanic \u2019s workshop FAC and the Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i country house , criminal proceedings had been instituted for assault on the police officers . The actions of PERSON and GPE had been reviewed in these proceedings and it had been concluded that they had not exceeded their official authority within the meaning of LAW . The first applicant \u2019s mother was informed that on DATE the case had been sent to the prosecutor \u2019s office and that charges had been brought against the first applicant in this connection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG wrote to the first applicant \u2019s mother informing her that he had reviewed her complaints about the police officers of ORG and their actions on DATE . He also noted that the information provided by her was of significant importance for the criminal proceedings against the first applicant and thus she should address all her complaints to ORG in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a complaint by the first applicant \u2019s mother , a prosecutor of ORG stated that the decision to refuse to institute the criminal proceedings against the police officers had been left unchanged as she did \u201c not see any reason to overturn that decision \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to a note by an inspector at ORG dated DATE , the first applicant had been transported from the short - term detention facility in PERSON :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief of ORG replied to various enquiries by the first applicant . He noted that during the course of reviewing the possible criminal case materials against the police officers , inspector PERSON had questioned them . She had also added transcripts of the first applicant \u2019s testimony during the criminal proceedings against him to the case materials , as well as the testimony of witnesses GPE and GPE She had not , however , held a confrontation between the police officers and the first applicant , because a confrontation between the first applicant and PERSON and the second applicant and ORG had taken place during the preliminary investigation in the criminal case against the first applicant .

On DATE a prosecutor of ORG attached to ORG , following a complaint by the first applicant , quashed the DATE decision on the ground that the review had been deficient : a forensic report on the first applicant \u2019s medical examination had not been included in the case - file materials ; the second applicant had not been questioned about the events of DATE ; and the applicable regulations regarding the criteria for the use of force had not been mentioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a second decision refusing to institute the criminal proceedings was adopted by ORG . The first applicant did not receive a copy of that decision . No copy has been made available to the ORG .", "DATE . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG attached to ORG , upon another complaint by the first applicant , informed him of the decision of CARDINAL DATE and of his right to lodge a complaint against that decision , even if he had not received a copy , with ORG . Mention was also made of the judgment of DATE , whereby the first applicant was \u201c found guilty under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW and therefore [ his ] suggestions about the fabrication of that criminal case by ORG and [ his ] complaint that officer PERSON of ORG had reviewed the case materials [ were ] groundless \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG , upon a complaint by the first applicant , informed him that he did not see any grounds to overturn the decision of DATE because the first applicant mentioned no new facts and because there was no evidence that the police officers had struck the applicant with their fists or legs as stated in the judgment of DATE . The prosecutor \u2019s letter contained a reference to the fact that the applicant had been informed about the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .
