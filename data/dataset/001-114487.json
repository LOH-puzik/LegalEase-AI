These obligations arise notably in respect of those violations recognized as criminal under either domestic or international law , such as torture and similar cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment ( article CARDINAL ) , summary and arbitrary killing ( article CARDINAL ) and enforced disappearance ( articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL and , frequently , CARDINAL ) . Indeed , the problem of impunity for these violations , a matter of sustained concern by ORG , may well be an important contributing element in the recurrence of the violations . When committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population , these violations of the LAW are crimes against humanity ( see Rome Statute of ORG , article CARDINAL ) .", "Accordingly , where public officials or ORG agents have committed violations of the LAW rights referred to in this paragraph , the GPE Parties concerned may not relieve perpetrators from personal responsibility , as has occurred with certain amnesties ( see General Comment DATE ) ) and prior legal immunities and indemnities .

The relevant part of the PERSON case ( judgment of DATE ) reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The fact that torture is prohibited by a peremptory norm of international law has other effects at the inter - state and individual levels . At the inter - state level , it serves to internationally de - legitimise any legislative , administrative or judicial act authorising torture . It would be senseless to argue , on the one hand , that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture , treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio , and then be unmindful of a ORG say , taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators through an amnesty law . If such a situation were to arise , the national measures , violating the general principle and any relevant treaty provision , would produce the legal effects discussed above and in addition would not be accorded international legal recognition . Proceedings could be initiated by potential victims if they had locus standi before a competent international or national judicial body with a view to asking it to hold the national measure to be internationally unlawful ; or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a foreign court , which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the national authorising act . What is even more important is that perpetrators of torture acting upon or benefiting from those national measures may nevertheless be held criminally responsible for torture , whether in a foreign ORG , or in their own ORG under a subsequent regime . In short , in spite of possible national authorisation by legislative or judicial bodies to violate the principle banning torture , individuals remain bound to comply with that principle . As ORG at GPE put it : \u201c individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience imposed by the individual ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in a report on a case with respect to the GPE massacres in GPE in DATE during which CARDINAL persons were allegedly killed by members of the NORP armed forces with the participation of members of ORG , and which had led to a petition before ORG , the latter held that :", "\u201c ... the application of [ GPE DATE Law on ORG to Achieve National Reconciliation ] constitutes a clear violation of the obligation of ORG to investigate and punish the violations of the rights of the GPE victims , and to provide compensation for damages resulting from the violations ... The present amnesty law , as applied in these cases , by foreclosing the possibility of judicial relief in cases of murder , inhumane treatment and absence of judicial guarantees , denies the fundamental nature of the most basic human rights . It eliminates perhaps the single most effective means of enforcing such rights , the trial and punishment of offenders . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in a report on the situation of human rights in GPE , ORG stated , with regard to GPE General Amnesty Law for Consolidation of Peace , as follows :", "\u201c ... regardless of any necessity that the peace negotiations might pose and irrespective of purely political considerations , the very sweeping General PERSON [ for ORG ] passed by GPE ORG constitutes a violation of the international obligations it undertook when it ratified LAW , because it makes possible a \u2018 reciprocal GPE without first acknowledging responsibility ... because it applies to crimes against humanity , and because it eliminates any possibility of obtaining adequate pecuniary compensation , primarily for victims . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment in the GPE case in DATE involving the question of the legality of NORP amnesty laws , ORG stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG considers that all amnesty provisions , provisions on prescription and the establishment of measures designed to eliminate responsibility are inadmissible , because they are intended to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations such as torture , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution and forced disappearance , all of them prohibited because they violate non - derogable rights recognized by international human rights law .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in accordance with the arguments put forward by ORG and not contested by the ORG , considers that the amnesty laws adopted by GPE prevented the GPE next of kin and the surviving victims in this case from being heard by a judge ... they violated the right to judicial protection ... they prevented the investigation , capture , prosecution and conviction of those responsible for the events that occurred in GPE , thus failing to comply with LAW DATE ORG ] , and they obstructed clarification of the facts of this case . Finally , the adoption of self - amnesty laws that are incompatible with the [ DATE ORG ] meant that GPE failed to comply with the obligation to adapt internal legislation that is embodied in LAW [ DATE ORG ] .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that it should be emphasized that , in the light of the general obligations established in ORG ) and CARDINAL of the [ DATE ORG ] , GPE Parties are obliged to take all measures to ensure that no one is deprived of judicial protection and the exercise of the right to a simple and effective recourse , in the terms of LAW of the [ DATE ORG ] . Consequently , GPE Parties to the [ DATE ORG ] which adopt laws that have the opposite effect , such as self - amnesty laws , violate Articles CARDINAL and DATE , in relation to ORG ) and CARDINAL of the [ DATE ORG ] . Self - amnesty laws lead to the defenselessness of victims and perpetuate impunity ; therefore , they are manifestly incompatible with the aims and spirit of the Convention .
