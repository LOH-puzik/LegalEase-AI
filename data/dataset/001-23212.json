{"ITEMID": "001-23212", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "PARADIS and OTHERS v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The application was lodged with the ORG by a mother , PERSON , on behalf of her CARDINAL children PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . PERSON , born DATE , is a NORP national . Her CARDINAL children were born in DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicants currently live in GPE , GPE .", "In DATE , PERSON married PERSON , a NORP national and went to live with him in GPE with PERSON , her daughter by a first marriage . The children PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were born into her marriage to O.", "In DATE , PERSON and all QUANTITY children moved out of the family home and went to live in a women \u2019s refuge .", "On DATE , ORG obtained a court order granting him temporary custody of his CARDINAL children , who thereupon returned to him . O. and his parents cared for the children . PERSON saw them on a regular basis .", "On DATE , ORG , in proceedings before a single judge , granted PERSON sole custody of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON on a permanent basis . It granted ORG access commencing on CARDINAL DATE and continuing on alternating DATE thereafter , from DATE to CARDINAL:CARDINAL on DATE . For DATE , ORG declared that ORG was to have the children from TIME on DATE to TIME on DATE , while PERSON was to have them from DATE . In succeeding DATE , the access on DATE was to be alternated . The children were to pass CARDINAL of their GPE holidays with the custodial parent and the other CARDINAL with the access parent . Notwithstanding the DATE access provided , O. was to have access on Father \u2019s Day from TIME . PERSON was to have the same access time on DATE . During DATE , each parent was to have DATE of access incorporating and not in addition to the regular weekend access . O. was to have such other and further access as the parties would agree to .", "ORG ordered that the paternal grandparents be given access to the children during the father \u2019s access periods . In addition , they were to have access on DATE as agreed between themselves and PERSON .", "Given that the maternal grandparents lived in GPE , ORG ruled that PERSON should be at liberty , on DATE notice , to take the children to GPE for visits , not to exceed DATE in duration .", "It also ruled that PERSON , PERSON and PERSON should otherwise remain in GPE , except for day trips to GPE or other GPE of GPE , unless prior written agreement were obtained .", "ORG ordered PERSON to execute an irrevocable undertaking to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of GPE and not to remove the children for periods beyond those provided for in the court order . It also ordered her to undertake in writing not to apply for NORP passports for them until they were of an age to make a personal decision on citizenship . PERSON was granted exclusive possession of the matrimonial home .", "In his reasoning , the single judge noted that PERSON seemed to be better capable of raising the children than O. , whom the judge portrayed as unreliable and whose credibility seemed to have been undermined by implausible and untrue allegations before the court . The judge was convinced that ORG would not be able to care properly for his children without the continued intervention of his parents . He stressed that the access rights granted to O. were minimum rights that could be enlarged following further discussion and negotiation between the parties .", "PERSON never executed the undertakings contained in the court decision .", "On DATE , PERSON and all QUANTITY children left GPE for a CARDINAL GPE stay in GPE after having obtained O. \u2019s consent . However , once DATE had elapsed , they did not return to GPE .", "On DATE , PERSON filed an action for divorce before ORG , sitting in family matters , and requested sole custody of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON .", "On DATE , ORG sentenced her to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for acting in contempt of court . Revoking its decision of DATE , it granted NORP sole custody of his children .", "On DATE , ORG rejected O. \u2019s request to return PERSON , PERSON and PERSON to GPE under the auspices of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( hereafter LAW ) . It found that as PERSON had had sole custody of the children both at the time when they had left GPE , and at the time when she had refused to return , LAW had not been violated . ORG also observed that the applicability of LAW to situations where a parent \u2019s custody right was limited by special conditions was legally controversial . In any case , ORG had not been in possession of custody rights at the relevant time and had not complained of a violation of his rights to access .", "On DATE , ORG issued a \u201c certificate of wrongness \u201d wherein it found that the removal and subsequent retention of the children PERSON , PERSON and PERSON from GPE , without returning them after a DATE visit to GPE , was a wrongful removal and retention within the meaning of LAW .", "Following O. \u2019s appeal , appeals proceedings were initiated before ORG , in the course of which PERSON and PERSON were heard . ORG ordered the preparation of a psychological expert opinion in order to find out whether the children themselves were opposed to returning to GPE or whether their refusal was based on their mother \u2019s influence . The expert was also asked to assess whether the CARDINAL children had attained a degree of maturity that would allow them to realise the consequences of their decision .", "In the expert opinion dated DATE , the expert found that PERSON and PERSON \u2019s refusal to return to their father derived from the tensions between their parents . The main reason for their refusal to return lay in the negative experiences with their father which dated back to the time when they had been in contact with him . Although their hostile attitude towards their father was partially based on their mother \u2019s tales of past events , it was mostly a consequence of the children \u2019s own memories which made them fear their father . Regarding their degree of maturity , the expert found that both children were able to give reasons for their decision that corresponded to their age .", "On DATE , ORG revoked ORG decision and ordered PERSON to return PERSON , PERSON and PERSON to GPE by DATE . In the event that she should refuse to comply with this order , ORG authorised the court \u2019s bailiff to return the children to their father . The bailiff was authorised to use force if necessary in order to overcome LOC resistance , to search her apartment and to ensure the children \u2019s removal .", "In its decision , ORG endorsed ORG \u201c certificate of wrongness \u201d of DATE . Based on the expert opinion , it did not consider that returning the children to GPE would be contrary to their best interests . In particular , nothing suggested that there was \u201c a grave risk that returning them would expose them to physical or psychological harm or place them in an intolerable situation \u201d within the meaning of LAW . ORG noted that PERSON had not managed to establish that ORG had sexually harassed either PERSON or PERSON . Although it believed the children \u2019s allegations that he had often applied inappropriate methods when punishing them in the past , ORG did not consider that this meant that they would be in danger of suffering physical or psychological harm if they returned to GPE . PERSON allegations that he had often beaten her and the children with objects were considered unsubstantiated . ORG failed to comprehend why PERSON had not trusted the NORP authorities or courts to protect her and the children from her husband \u2019s violent actions .", "ORG also did not consider that PERSON and PERSON \u2019s refusal to return to their father could prevent them from going back to GPE . Based on the expert report , it found that with DATE they had not yet attained an age and degree of maturity at which it would be appropriate to take account of their views under LAW . According to ORG , nothing suggested that PERSON and PERSON were particularly mature for their age . Given the fact that they were greatly influenced by their mother and by the tensions between their parents , ORG did not attach much weight to the children \u2019s objections to being returned to GPE .", "It showed itself aware of the difficulties a removal back to GPE would occasion for the children . From a legal point of view , however , this alone could not suffice to prevent their return , as otherwise any parent wrongfully removing a child could , by delaying the child \u2019s return , prevent such a return from ever taking place .", "On DATE , ORG refused to entertain the complaint lodged by PERSON on behalf of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON .", "On DATE , following ORG \u2019s request , ORG issued a special order to execute the decision of DATE , under the condition that NORP request ORG to refrain from executing the sentence issued against PERSON for contempt of court . According to ORG , this was necessary to ensure that PERSON could accompany the children to GPE , as it considered a separation from their mother at this stage to be detrimental to their best interests . It obliged PERSON to submit propositions regarding a financially secure accommodation for PERSON and the children , as well as alimony payments for all of them . He was also held to submit financial securities for the payment of their plane tickets .", "In order to stop the imminent execution of the court decision of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON requested legal aid with a view to declaring the execution of this decision inadmissible .", "On DATE , ORG rejected her request for legal aid , finding that her claim had no prospect of success . It found that nothing suggested that ORG had deliberately misled ORG , thereby inducing it to decide in his favour . In this context , ORG referred to the certificate of wrongness issued by ORG of DATE .", "ORG did not follow LOC arguments that the aim of LAW could no longer be reached due to the lapse of time since . It noted that she herself had delayed the execution proceedings by submitting requests and motions to the courts . Moreover , PERSON had agreed to return to GPE with the children under certain conditions . ORG noted that on DATE , ORG in GPE had agreed to withdraw all criminal charges accusing PERSON of child abduction upon confirmation of the competent police authorities in GPE that they had arrived in GPE . PERSON was now therefore at liberty to enter GPE .", "On DATE , ORG ordered the court bailiff to execute the decision of DATE .", "On DATE , the bailiff , accompanied by the police , CARDINAL representatives of the local ORG as well as O. , his parents and his lawyer , attempted to remove the children from LOC home . Following the children \u2019s explicit refusal to accompany him , the court bailiff decided not to pursue the enforcement measure .", "On DATE , ORG rejected O. \u2019s request that , in order to implement the above decision , the court bailiff be vested with the right to use force against the children or to permit O. to use such force , should the children persist in their refusal to leave their mother \u2019s home . Given the danger that such an action could pose to the children \u2019s well - being , ORG did not wish to grant this request without consulting a psychological expert .", "On DATE , following ORG \u2019s appeal , ORG vested the court bailiff with the right to use force against the children or to let third persons of his choice use such force , in order to ensure the execution of the court order of DATE . It ordered the local ORG to attend the execution and to assist the court bailiff if appropriate and necessary .", "ORG found that PERSON had not submitted any new facts that would allow it to deviate from its decision of DATE . In particular , the argument based on the amount of time that the children had already spent living in GPE did not lead to a different assessment of the situation , for otherwise any illegal child abduction could evolve into a permanent illegal situation , merely due to the passing of time .", "ORG noted that no special psychological education and experience were needed to realise that in general , children will tend to oppose any changes in their living conditions , in particular if such changes are initiated by a parent with whom they have had no contact for a long time and who is thus considered a stranger . According to ORG , the children \u2019s refusal to return to GPE , insofar as it was not a result of their mother \u2019s influence , was mostly due to their fear of change and of an unknown future . It did not see their refusal as an indication that a return to their father by force would cause traumatic disturbances to their future development , thereby endangering their best interests . ORG assumed that the children would quickly recover once they had returned to GPE , even if their return was brought about by force .", "It did not consider that a less severe measure , such as ordering PERSON to pay a fine , would be effective , as only the children \u2019s removal from LOC home , if necessary by force , would ensure their safe return to GPE .", "On DATE , ORG refused to entertain the constitutional complaint of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , in which they had complained about ORG decision of DATE to vest the bailiff with the right to use force against PERSON , PERSON and PERSON or to let third persons of his choice use such force , in order to ensure the execution of the court order on their return to GPE .", "Also on DATE , ORG , following O. \u2019s request , issued a new court order in which it ordered the bailiff to execute ORG order of DATE , taking into account the decision of DATE . It vested the court bailiff with the right to search PERSON premises and , if necessary , request aid from the police . The competent ORG was also held to assist the execution proceedings .", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are :", "( a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "( b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Contracting States shall take all appropriate measures to secure within their territories the implementation of the objects of the Convention .
