In particular , ORG took into account the fact that the applicant had complained of excessive delays with the president of ORG and challenged them further on appeal on each occasion .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG took several steps as follows . It asked for further information from inter alia the applicant \u2019s employer .
