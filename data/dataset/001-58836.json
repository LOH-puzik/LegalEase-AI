The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , CARDINAL men wearing balaclava masks , some of whom were armed with firearms , entered the bungalow of the PERSON family and , seizing the keys to their white ORG Cavalier car , drove off in it . TIME , at TIME , the white ORG Cavalier stopped in front of CARDINAL cars parked side by side on FAC , GPE , and began shooting at the occupants . The drivers of both vehicles were killed , and a third person , in the passenger seat of CARDINAL vehicle , was wounded .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the police found a white ORG Cavalier which had been set on fire . They discovered in the car CARDINAL black and a dark blue balaclava masks , a pair of black gloves and CARDINAL cartridge cases .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , at an army checkpoint on FAC , QUANTITY from the spot where the abandoned vehicle was found , a red ORG car was stopped . The car contained CARDINAL men : PERSON and PERSON and the applicant . TIME a number of police officers arrived under the command of PERSON . On being questioned by PERSON , the applicant stated that he had been helping the PERSON brothers with sheep since TIME , that he had washed at the GPE ' and had something for tea there . He stated that he was going for a drink in town . The applicant was arrested under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of ORG ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE and taken to PERSON , GPE . Access to a solicitor was deferred pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) for a period of TIME . Thereafter , and up until he was charged , the applicant was seen DATE by a solicitor .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after arrival at FAC , head hair combings were taken from the applicant and sent for forensic examination along with the clothes he was wearing at the time of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed by police officers who cautioned him before each interview in terms of LAW ) Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The applicant was told that :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court , your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you . If you wish to say anything , what you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was asked if he understood the caution and made no reply . He made no reply to questions about his movements on DATE and about fibres from the balaclavas and gloves found on his hair and clothing . He maintained silence throughout the interview and throughout CARDINAL further interviews , which took place DATE . The applicant was denied access to legal advice during police interviews .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during interview no . CARDINAL , a police constable cautioned the applicant pursuant to LAW , requesting him to account for his presence at FAC about the time the murder of the CARDINAL men in GPE was committed . The applicant was warned that if he failed or refused to do so , a court , judge or jury might draw such inference from his failure or refusal as appeared proper . The applicant made no response and refused to sign the written request . During the same interview , the applicant was cautioned , pursuant to LAW , in respect of adverse inferences which might be drawn from any failure to account for a number of fibres found on his person by means of a hair combing which linked him to the commission of an offence . During interview no . CARDINAL on DATE , a caution was administered under LAW fibres found on the applicant 's clothes which were forensically linked to material found in a ORG Cavalier allegedly used by the culprits . The applicant made no reply and refused to sign the written request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged , inter alia , with the murder of ORG , and PERSON . , the attempted murder of ORG and with possession of CARDINAL loaded ORG assault rifles with intent . The applicant pleaded not guilty and was tried before Lord Chief Justice PERSON sitting without a jury .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution case linking the applicant to the hijacking of the car and the shooting incident was based on forensic evidence . The link was between a balaclava and the gloves found in the car and the applicant . According to the prosecution , the fibres found in the hair combings taken from the applicant and found on his clothing matched exactly the fibres of the CARDINAL black balaclavas and the fibres of the pair of gloves found in the car .", "CARDINAL . The forensic expert witness called by the prosecution testified that :", "\u201c Considering the presence of fibres to match CARDINAL separate fibre sources from the car on [ the applicant ] and his clothing would strongly support the proposition that there had been direct and intimate contact with the black masks and gloves from the car . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At his trial the applicant gave evidence to the effect that at the relevant time he had been working with sheep at the GPE ' farm on TIME CARDINAL DATE and had then stayed at the farm for a meal until TIME He further stated that on DATE , DATE , when he was at work , he had worn black gloves and a rolled up balaclava as protective clothing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant called several witnesses to support his alibi , including the PERSON brothers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL counts of murder , CARDINAL count of attempted murder , CARDINAL count of possession of CARDINAL rifles and a handgun together with a quantity of ammunition with intent , contrary to LAW ) Order DATE , CARDINAL count of assaulting and falsely imprisoning PERSON , and CARDINAL count of hijacking a Vauxhall Cavalier motor car , contrary to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his judgment the judge found the applicant guilty , having regard to circumstantial evidence of a forensic nature linking the applicant with the ORG car allegedly used by the gunmen and the applicant 's presence in the vicinity of the shooting ( QUANTITY from its location ) . The forensic evidence consisted of the following :", "( a ) CARDINAL fibres were found in the head hair of the applicant matching exactly the fibres from one of the balaclava masks and CARDINAL fibres were found in the head hair of the applicant matching exactly the fibres from the pair of black gloves ;", "( b ) CARDINAL fibre matching exactly the fibres from CARDINAL of the black balaclava masks was found on the jacket of the applicant and CARDINAL fibres matching exactly the fibres from the pair of black gloves were found on the jacket of the applicant ;", "( c ) CARDINAL fibres matching the fibres from the pair of black gloves were found on the outside of the jeans of the applicant and large numbers of fibres matching exactly the fibres of the pair of black gloves were found in both side pockets of the jeans of the applicant ;", "( d ) CARDINAL fibre exactly matching the fibres of CARDINAL of the black balaclava masks was found in each of the side pockets of the jeans of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The judge accepted the evidence of the prosecution forensic expert witness that the presence of fibres to match the CARDINAL separate fibre sources from the car , namely the black balaclava masks and the pair of black gloves on the head hair and on and in the clothing of the applicant strongly supported the proposition that there had been direct and intimate contact between him and CARDINAL or both of those black balaclava masks and the pair of black gloves .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the judge relied on the \u201c very strong adverse inference \u201d which he drew against the applicant under LAW and CARDINAL of the DATE Order . The judge stated :", "\u201c Yet the [ applicant ] made no reply to the questions repeatedly put to him throughout the interviews and gave no information whatsoever about his movements on DATE and no account of wearing a balaclava and gloves at his work on DATE , but gave detailed evidence in respect of these matters for the first time at his trial . I therefore draw a very strong adverse inference against him under LAW . ... it would have been a simple and easy thing for him to have told these matters to the interviewing police officers .", "PERSON [ counsel for the applicant ] submitted that the court should not draw an adverse inference under LAW by reason of the fact that when the [ applicant ] was stopped at the vehicle check - point on TIME DATE he told PERSON TIME , when asked how he came to be in the company of the other CARDINAL men , that he had been giving them a hand with sheep all afternoon since TIME , and that he later told PERSON TIME , that he had been at the GPE ' TIME working with sheep since TIME , that he had a fry at the GPE ' , and that he had got washed in that house . PERSON submitted that the purpose of LAW was to stop an accused at his trial putting forward an ambush defence . As the [ applicant ] had told the police who stopped him at the vehicle check - point that he had been at the GPE ' working with sheep all afternoon , the purpose of LAW had been achieved , and that it would therefore be wrong to draw an adverse inference against the [ applicant ] under LAW because he refused in interviews to repeat to the police his defence or to answer questions about it . I reject that submission . ... Notwithstanding that the [ applicant ] told PERSON in brief terms that he had been working at the GPE ' farm since TIME , common sense clearly indicates that if the defence which he advanced in the witness box was true , he would have told the police of it after he was cautioned in PERSON under LAW and was questioned at length about his movements on DATE and was asked if he had an explanation for the fibres found on his hair and clothing . In addition I draw a very strong adverse inference against the [ applicant ] under LAW . The [ applicant ] failed to account for these fibres after each caution was read ... although he gave an explanation at the trial that he had been wearing gloves and a balaclava at his work on DATE , which explanation was clearly designed and intended to show that the fibres found on his hair and on his clothing came from gloves and a balaclava which he was wearing ... on DATE . This was an explanation which he could easily have given to the constable who served the Article CARDINAL caution on him , and by reason of this failure to do so I draw a very strong adverse inference against him that the evidence which he gave at the trial about wearing a balaclava and gloves at work on DATE was false . PERSON submitted that I should not draw that inference because the cautions lacked clarity and detail ... and ... did not give the [ applicant ] sufficient information to enable him to understand that he was being requested to account for the presence of fibres from a pair of gloves and from a balaclava ... on his hair and clothing . ... I do not accept that submission . It follows from the very strong inferences which I have drawn against the [ applicant ] under LAW Article CARDINAL that I reject the evidence of the witnesses who sought to give the [ applicant ] an alibi by stating in the witness box that he was in the GPE ' farm at FAC during the period when the gunmen were going to the GPE ' bungalow , imprisoning PERSON and hijacking his car , murdering PERSON and J.A.W.Mc . ... For the same reason I reject the evidence of PERSON that the accused wore a balaclava and gloves at work on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge continued with reference to LAW :", "\u201c Having regard to the matters clearly put and explained to the [ applicant ] ... I think it is clear that the accused knew perfectly well that the LAW cautions referred to the fibres from the balaclava masks and pair of gloves found in the gunmen 's cars , but he failed to give the explanation which he later put forward at trial and this failure gives rise to the very strong adverse inference which I draw against him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge did not draw any inference under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judge also held :", "\u201c It follows from the very strong adverse inferences which I have drawn against the [ applicant ] under LAW Article CARDINAL that I reject the evidence of the witnesses who sought to give the [ applicant ] an alibi by stating in the witness box that he was in the GPE ' farm ... during the period when the gunmen were ... murdering ... and escaping from the place where the car was set on fire . The [ applicant ] had ample time to get to the GPE ' farm before TIME from the place where the car had been set on fire . ...", "In addition , and apart from the very strong adverse inferences which I draw under LAW and DATE , having seen them in the witness box I regarded the [ applicant ] and PERSON as dishonest and unreliable witnesses whose evidence I did not believe . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on the grounds , inter alia , that the trial judge had erred in drawing an adverse inference under LAW when the accused was questioned about his movements on DATE since he had already given an account of his movements to PERSON when he was stopped on TIME ; that the inference drawn from his failure to give an explanation of the forensic findings concerning the fibres found on him by mentioning to the police that he had been wearing a balaclava and gloves on DATE before the killing should not have been CARDINAL of significant weight ; that the police did not give him sufficient information to enable him to understand the nature of the forensic evidence for which he was requested to account ; and , finally , that it was not open to the trial judge to reject the applicant 's explanation that he had kept silent because it was simply his policy not to speak to the police .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG ( Lord Justice PERSON ) of GPE agreed with the trial judge in the following terms :", "\u201c ... [ T]he drawing of an inference under LAW is not automatic . ... Before an inference may be drawn against an accused , the tribunal of fact must be of the view that it is proper to do so . This will allow for consideration of the adequacy of a single statement of a relevant defence and whether any explanation for a failure to repeat it is acceptable . Moreover , the court which invokes LAW can weigh the strength of the inference to be drawn against the accused . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON continued :", "\u201c As we have already held , the mere recital on a single occasion of the gist of a defence on which an accused subsequently relies on trial will not usually prevent the invocation of LAW . Whether such a statement will prompt the court not to draw an inference against the accused will depend on an evaluation by the tribunal of fact of all the relevant circumstances including the accused 's explanation for his failure to repeat the statement of his defence on interview . ... Where ... allegations are put to a suspect in interview which , if unchallenged , are clearly indicative of his guilt and where he fails , until trial , to put forward his answers to these or an explanation of them consistent with his innocence , this will justify the drawing of a strong inference against him . In this case the significance of the forensic evidence could scarcely be more obvious and important . It called for the production of the appellant 's explanation at the earliest moment . The failure to produce that explanation on a point of such obvious and immediate importance justified the drawing of a strong adverse inference against the appellant . When that failure went unexplained ( save by reference to a policy which was neither justified nor elaborated upon by the [ applicant ] ) the drawing of a strong adverse inference against him was virtually inevitable . PERSON [ counsel for the applicant ] submitted that the manner in which the forensic evidence was described by the [ police ] must have confused the appellant as to the nature of the forensic evidence which existed against him . Like the learned trial judge we do not accept this proposition . PERSON submitted that it was not open to the learned trial judge to conclude that such a policy [ by the applicant not to speak to the police ] did not exist . We reject this argument . ... A person may have and apply such a policy but he must realise that the tribunal of fact may then draw an adverse inference from his silence . This [ applicant ] was seen DATE by his solicitor after an initial CARDINAL-hour deferral and if he chose to remain silent it was his free choice . This does not avoid the possibility of Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL being used to his disadvantage , however . To accept that a suspect may successfully rely on a ' policy ' of silence to avoid the adverse effect of the ORG would ' drive a coach and CARDINAL through the statute ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c We are entirely satisfied that the learned trial judge approached his task in a careful and critical manner , he adverted to all the evidence and he was satisfied of the guilt of the [ applicant ] having not only heard the evidence but observed the witnesses . In our judgment these convictions were in no way unsafe or unsatisfactory . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL .
