PERSON declared that this had simply been a mistake as , at the material time , he and his colleagues had never realised that it was forbidden to transcribe such conversations into a written record . Once this had been pointed out to him in DATE by the public prosecutor , it was too late as copies had already been distributed . It had then been agreed to record such conversations but not to transcribe them . He further declared that it was technically not possible to prevent such conversations from being intercepted . As to CARDINAL conversations held in DATE which had nevertheless been transcribed , PERSON declared that , unlike many others , these CARDINAL conversations had accidentally slipped through the control system .", "On DATE and DATE , further hearings were held before ORG in the course of which oral evidence was taken from police detective PERSON , who stated that it was his understanding that it was not allowed to transcribe intercepted conversations falling within the ambit of the privilege of non - disclosure , but that use could be made of the information contained therein .", "No further information about these proceedings has been submitted by the applicants .", "In DATE , it appeared in separate but interrelated sets of criminal proceedings pending before ORG \u2013 in which applicants ORG . DATE , CARDINAL and ORG acted as defence lawyers DATE that the obligation under the ORG to destroy evidence falling within the ambit of the privilege of non - disclosure enjoyed by lawyers under LAW ORG had not been complied with . The CARDINAL applicants detected this when listening to copies of optical disks that had been added to the case file and on which telephone conversations were stored that had been tapped in the course of the criminal investigations , known under the codenames \u201c TCARDINAL - CARDINAL \u201d and \u201c NORP \u201d .

This system stored the intercepted telephone conversations on a so - called Optical Disk . Once stored it was no longer possible to manipulate these recorded conversations . That means that they could no longer be deleted . Given the fact that the system was saved regularly ( TIME ) , conversations with privileged persons were also stored on ORG .", "The so - called \u201c privileged persons \u201d conversations were recorded by the PERSON team in the criminal investigation system used . The telephone conversations were recorded in the processing system concerned as \u201c privileged person \u201d or \u201c confidential \u201d . The conversations were thus not transcribed or summarised . \u201d", "In the course of a hearing held in camera before ORG on DATE , the public prosecutor stated that no formal records of destruction had been drawn up as it was technically impossibly to delete specific conversations stored on an optical disk , and that in CARDINAL regional police telecommunication tapping rooms ( tapkamers ) not a single recorded conversation had been deleted since DATE . The public prosecutor explained that , since DATE , a number of police tapping rooms were working with the \u201c Comverse \u201d system for recording intercepted telephone conversations . Such conversations were stored on optical disks . Since the system had to comply with predefined security norms , in which the impossibility to manipulate stored data was an important factor , the system had been set up so that nothing could be added or altered to that data . For this reason it was not possible to delete conversations with privileged persons that had been saved on an optical disk .", "On DATE , ORG examined a request by applicant no . CARDINAL to extend the time - limit of DATE fixed to review the optical disks , and to be provided with the written records of the destruction of conversations with privileged persons and with the indexes of each of the optical disks in the form of an ORG or Excess computer programme file . After having deliberated , ORG granted the first request and rejected the remainder , holding :", "\u201c Noting the high number of intercepted conversations and that listening to the optical disks , owing to the absence of a search function ... , is a time consuming exercise , ORG accepts that the defence needs more time ... to listen to the disks . [ This ] request is ... [ therefore ] ... reasonable . Since the optical disks , for the purposes of control , must thus be made available again , ORG will fix the delay at a maximum of DATE as from the date of this decision .", "The public prosecutor has declared in court that no written records of destruction have been drawn up , as the deletion of specific conversations stored on optical disks is technically not possible .

Noting this and in the absence of any reason to doubt the statement of the public prosecutor , the request [ to be provided with ] the written records of destruction is rejected .", "The public prosecutor has further declared that no indexes exist of the different optical disks in the form of an ORG , Excess or other computer programme file and that , owing to the great number of intercepted and recorded conversations , it is not possible to create an index at short notice . Considering this to be plausible , noting again the great number of recordings , ORG rejects the request to be provided with the indexes asked for , the more so as [ the defence ] will now be given [ ample time ] to listen to the audio data carriers . \u201d", "By letter of DATE , in reply to a letter sent by applicant no . CARDINAL on DATE , the public prosecutor stated that he had instructed the police to delete those conversations falling within the ambit of the privilege of non - disclosure that had been stored on optical disks and which had been added to the case file . The public prosecutor indicated that he assumed that the destruction would take place within DATE .", "According to a written record dated DATE , drawn up by police officer PERSON , the public prosecutor had instructed him on DATE to select and delete from the optical disks all intercepted conversations in which privileged persons had participated . In the ORG investigation a total of CARDINAL contacts of that nature had been selected and a total of CARDINAL contacts in the TCARDINAL - CARDINAL investigation . The audio data of all of these conversations had been deleted without making a distinction as to the contents or relevance of these conversations . The written record also contains a remark that the investigation team had not in any manner made use of the contents of stored conversations with privileged persons . An overview of the selected conversations was appended to the written record .", "On DATE , in the context of the criminal proceedings pending before ORG , the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) at ORG took evidence from the expert - witness PERSON , who was working for the company ORG According to ORG it was in fact technically possible not to store selected data on an optical disk and to delete data from it , but most ORG stored all data as selection was a labour intensive exercise . Mr ORG further stated that only ORG could delete data but not a user , although the system could be set up so that users could also be authorised to delete data . Furthermore , searches for telephone numbers , keywords or remarks could be carried out in the main system . According to his evidence , the \u201c Comverse \u201d system was used by the police in CARDINAL regions . The applicants nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and ORG attended this hearing and were given the opportunity to put questions to Mr ORG", "At a hearing held on DATE , ORG granted the request made by applicant no . CARDINAL to take evidence from police officers GPE and C.T on recorded conversations with privileged persons and the destruction of those recordings .", "PERSON declared before ORG that , on the basis of tapping logs , he had made a selection of conversations with privileged persons , i.e. the conversations between the suspect and his lawyer , doctor or counsellor ( vertrouwenspersonen ) . The scope of his selection had been as broad as possible , but he could not certify that his selection had in fact covered every conversation of that kind . He himself had only deleted the data in the tapping logs ( i.e. the record containing the references to the conversations concerned ) , but not the actual conversations themselves . He had done so after DATE . He had drawn up a written record of the selected conversations and he had given the list of the conversations to be deleted to his colleague Mr PERSON", "Mr PERSON testified before ORG that his commanding officer , PERSON , had ordered him to delete the conversations with privileged persons . Together with his colleague PERSON , he had selected the conversations with privileged persons and a written record of that selection had been made . He further stated that , after having obtained authorisation from the Systems Manager of the ORG tapping room , he had deleted CARDINAL conversations from the optical disks . He had started with this on DATE and it had taken him in total TIME . He had not reformatted or demagnetised the disks as this would have deleted all of the recorded conversations . Lastly , he stated that , apart from those held by the defence , no copies of the disks had been made .", "After having taken evidence from these witnesses and after having given applicant no . CARDINAL the opportunity to question them , ORG ordered , at the request of applicant no . DATE , and sharing the parties ' concern about the recording of conversations with privileged persons , that the optical disks containing such conversations were to be handed over to , and held by , the investigating judge at ORG .", "On an unspecified date , at the request of the defence lawyers and in consultation with the public prosecutor , the investigating judge at ORG decided to carry out an on - site inspection ( schouw ) of the police tapping room at the GPE police headquarters .", "The inspection took place on DATE in the presence of , amongst others , applicants ORG . DATE , CARDINAL and ORG and the public prosecutor . A check of conversations with lawyers that should have been deleted disclosed that the contents of CARDINAL conversation , selected at random , had been deleted , but that the \u201c conversation - related \u201d data were still on record , and that another conversation , selected by applicant no . ORG , had erroneously only been deleted from the list instead of from the disk , and that the record of the contents of that conversation was still in existence and could be listened to . Consequently , the investigating judge decided to take the audio data carriers with him and that they were to be held by him pending a ( further ) decision by ORG .", "No further information has been submitted as regards these proceedings by the applicants .", "In view of the above incidents , ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) expressed , in its letter of DATE to the Minister of ORG , its serious concerns about the manner in which the judicial authorities were dealing with their obligation to destroy privileged data . It summoned the Minister of Justice to clarify within DATE where , in the police regions , the \u201c Comverse \u201d system was not being used , and where systems were used in which tapped telephone conversations falling within the privilege of nondisclosure were not removed and destroyed . It further requested the Minister to indicate in what manner and within what delay it was intended to ensure that the privileged data stored since DATE under the \u201c Comverse \u201d system would be erased , and what measures the Minister intended to take in order to prevent breaches of LAW ORG in the future .", "As the Minister did not provide the ORG with the clarification requested within DATE , the ORG , ORG ( PERSON ) , and applicants ORG . DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL and ORG took summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) against ORG ( the Minister of Justice ) before ORG of The Hague , seeking an injunction against ORG for the destruction of all stored information having been conveyed by or to lawyers enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure \u2013 at least to applicants ORG . DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL and ORG DATE and which should have been destroyed , pursuant to former LAW ORG , or which had to be destroyed pursuant to LAW ORG . They further requested ORG to order ORG to transmit to all lawyers concerned , at least the CARDINAL applicants , a notification within the meaning of Article CARDINALbb of the ORG , as well as a copy of the written record of destruction . They lastly requested ORG to order ORG to state publicly in what manner , and in accordance with what procedure , the provisions of LAW ORG and the ORG would be complied with in respect of lawyers enjoying the privilege of nondisclosure .", "In its judgment of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , the President of ORG of The Hague rejected the plaintiffs ' first CARDINAL requests and granted their third request . The President further decided that this ruling was immediately enforceable ( uitvoerbaar bij voorraad ) . Insofar as relevant , the President held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . For the determination of the question whether it concerns \u2013 according to the plaintiffs \u2013 a structural , or DATE according to the defendant DATE an isolated problem , a thorough investigation is required . There is no room for this in the framework of summary injunction proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore the defendant can not be ordered in summary injunction proceedings to destroy what the investigating judge should have destroyed on grounds of ( former ) Article CARDINALh of the ORG . It is clear that , until DATE , it was the investigating judge , exclusively , who had been assigned the obligation to destroy . In addition , the investigating judge remains competent as regards taps that had already been ordered on DATE . In this respect reference is made to the transitory rules [ according to which ORG CARDINALf - h of the ORG remained applicable in those cases in which tapping orders had been issued DATE ] and to the letter of the President of [ the coordinating and the national consultative platforms for investigating judges ] addressed to the investigating judges in the GPE on DATE , in which the President has taken note ex officio , and in which the following position as regards the transitory legal situation has been given :", "The key - notion is the preliminary judicial investigation against a concrete suspect . Within that preliminary judicial investigation specific legal rules ( either formerly or currently in force ) are applicable . The former legal rules remain applicable to preliminary judicial investigations opened before DATE . Moreover , the management ( beheer ) of taps remains with the investigating judge . When a preliminary judicial investigation has been opened on or after DATE , the new legal rules apply in their entirety .", "CARDINAL . The above [ considerations ] result in the rejection of the claims set out under CARDINAL . and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the future , the defendant must ensure in any event that the implementation of the legal rules is tightened . This would be necessary even if , as claimed by the defendant , this was an isolated problem . The defendant has stated ... that , to this end , measures have already been taken and [ that further measures ] will be taken in the near future .", "CARDINAL . Having noted this and the established fact that mistakes have been made , and as it appears from the cases cited by the plaintiffs , in particular the PERSON criminal case ( the PERSON - investigation ) and the GPE criminal case , that not every public prosecutor is , or was , aware of the correct way of proceeding as regards the obligation to destroy recordings of conversations with privileged persons , the claim cited above under CARDINAL . is eligible for an award in the manner set out below . ...", "The President orders the defendant to inform the plaintiffs by DATE at the latest in what manner and according to what procedure the provisions of LAW ORG , and the LAW in relation to the investigation of telecommunications in respect of lawyers enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure , will be complied with . \u201d", "Neither party filed an appeal against the ruling of DATE .", "By letter of DATE , the Minister of ORG informed the plaintiffs in the above summary injunction proceedings that , in DATE at the latest , a description of the procedure for compliance with LAW ORG would be laid down in a formal instruction of ORG ( College van procureurs - generaal ) and that , in anticipation thereof , ORG had transmitted on DATE to the chief public prosecutors ( hoofdofficieren van justitie ) at ORG , the chief advocates - general ( hoofdadvocaten - generaal ) at ORG and the heads of the service departments of ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) , an overview of the pertinent legal rules and a schematic description of the procedure . ORG had requested the addressees to ensure that wide attention be given to these documents within the public prosecution and police services concerned . The overview and schematic description were appended to the Minister 's letter .", "On DATE , ORG issued a formal instruction on the \u201c Destruction of intercepted conversations with persons enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure \u201d ( PERSON CARDINAL ge\u00efntercepteerde gesprekken met geheimhouders DATE \u201c the Instruction \u201d ; see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) , which entered into force on DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG and applicants ORG .

It considered itself competent to do so under LAW and LAW , irrespective of the competence of the judge in criminal proceedings . It further accepted that the ORG had an interest in the matter . As regards the scope of its enquiry , the ORG decided to concentrate on the current practice of recording telecommunications with lawyers and , as to the destruction of recorded conversations , on compliance with the Instruction of CARDINAL March CARDINAL . For the time being it decided not to deal with the question of compliance with the obligation of destruction DATE when digital tapping systems came into use .", "The ORG published its report on this enquiry on DATE . On the basis of information provided by the Minister of ORG , ORG , ORG Landelijk Parket ) and the petitioners , as well as the comments submitted in response thereto , the ORG noted the following :", "\u201c An order for the interception of telecommunications contains a telephone number . The telecom provider transmits digital conversation data being passed by that telephone number to a police tapping room . CARDINAL different digital interception systems are used in the police tapping rooms . The manner in which the different interception systems function is comparable .", "The digital data transmitted by the telecom provider are stored on a hard disk in the interception system . During the storing on the hard disk , the conversations can be listened to on line . This direct listening is exceptional . The data are copied from the hard disk to an optical disk . This copying is also called archiving . Both before and after archiving , conversations having been stored on a hard disk can be listened to . When the hard disk is full , the conversations stored on the hard disk are overwritten by newly entered conversations . The listening to recorded conversations takes place , as a rule , by playing an optical disk with the aid of a special technical listening device ( uitluisterunit ) . The data obtained through recording telephone conversations are stored in a ( special ) police register .", "The listening to recorded conversations is firstly made by a member of the investigation team that has been entrusted with the investigation in which context the interception order has been given . If , in listening to a recorded conversation , the suspicion arises , or it appears , that it concerns a conversation with a lawyer , a transcript of the recorded telephone conversation is submitted to the public prosecutor in charge of the criminal investigation concerned . The public prosecutor assesses whether the conversation contains information that falls within the ambit of the privilege of non - disclosure . If , according to the public prosecutor , that is the case , the public prosecutor will then order the destruction of the recorded telephone conversation to the extent that it contains privileged information .", "According to the explanation attached to the Instruction [ of DATE ] , a generic order for destruction may be given as regards recorded conversations with a specific lawyer . ... To date , no use is made in practice of the possibility to give such an order .", "It has been established that there has been a lack of clarity between the public prosecution service and the petitioners about the manner in which an order for destruction must be carried out . It has also been established that deleting [ digital data ] can be effected in various manners and that not all manners are effective , as has appeared in the [ criminal proceedings before ORG ] . The instruction does not prescribe in what manner the destruction must take place . In the explanation to the ORG a reference is made to the explanation attached to the LAW [ on the storage and destruction of items not added to the case file ] , where it is stated that simply deleting [ digital ] files is not sufficient , but that the data carrier must be processed in such a manner that the destroyed data can no longer be recuperated .", "ORG ( Nederlands Forensisch Instituut ) has , upon the instruction of the public prosecution service , carried out a further investigation . CARDINAL of the results was that , as regards the ORG [ interception system ] , it appeared to be possible \u2013 through the efforts of an academic scientific researcher and a research assistant having DATE experience respectively \u2013 to recuperate deleted conversations within a time span of TIME . \u201d", "The conclusions of the ORG read as follows :", "\u201c As to the current practice in respect of intercepting and recording confidential telecommunications with a lawyer or other provider of legal assistance , the ORG has reached the opinion that this is unlawful . It follows from the recent legislative history , in line with the case - law on this issue , that the interests in the protection of these confidential communications prevails over the interests in finding the truth in criminal cases , also when it concerns the exercise of special powers of investigation . The systematic interception , recording and becoming acquainted with these confidential communications by the police and the public prosecution department is a breach of that . This also leads to a violation of the provisions of LAW and of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG .", "The ORG 's understanding of LAW is that the interception and recording of communications , which in the lawyer - client relation must be regarded as confidential , can only take place with the utmost restraint . Only such an interpretation is compatible with the above norm on the need to respect these confidential communications . LAW offers a basis for the public prosecutor to take note of recorded telecommunications with a person who presumably , or certainly , is a person enjoying the privilege of nondisclosure , within the meaning of LAW ORG , if and insofar as it is not possible otherwise to do justice to respect confidentiality .", "Should this interpretation be incorrect , the question then arises whether , on this point , LAW is compatible with the special position , recognised by law and treaty , held by persons , who on grounds of their profession , enjoy the privilege of non - disclosure . However , so far the ORG has not drawn this conclusion and , instead , furthers a norm - conforming working method in the interception and recording of conversations with lawyers and other providers of legal assistance . The public prosecution department is to amend the ORG in conformity with this restrained working method .", "As to the obligation of destruction , the ORG is of the opinion that LAW ORG is not respected in the cases that have arisen . The public prosecution department is to take those measures within their powers to ensure as far as possible that , after the destruction of privileged data , it will not be possible in the context of criminal proceedings to become acquainted , via relatively simple means , with destroyed data . \u201d", "The ORG formulated the following CARDINAL recommendations :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Lawyers and other providers of legal assistance are to ensure that there is clarity about their capacity when participating in telecommunications . To this end the lawyer can make it unambiguously clear at the beginning of a telecommunication that he participates in his capacity as a lawyer , where it concerns a confidential communication with his client .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecution department is to prescribe a number recognition system to select conversations in which lawyers participate exclusively in their professional capacity . As regards an unrecognised number , only the first conversation has to be listened to . A separation of functions ... in listening to and assessing conversations could offer a final safeguard ...", "CARDINAL . The public prosecution department is to give concrete substance to the norm that destroyed conversations should no longer be accessible , specifically in the context of criminal proceedings , by including in the ORG a sufficiently specific norm on which the actual implementation of the obligation of destruction in respect of the different tapping systems can be based .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecution department is to give effect to its responsibility for compliance with the obligation of destruction by making further agreements with the police force managers ( korpsbeheerders ) who are responsible for the actual implementation of the obligation of destruction . The public prosecution department is to verify that adequate implementation be given to the obligation of destruction and will ensure that , on this point , it will be informed DATE after the introduction of a new Instruction . \u201d", "On DATE , in response to the negative publicity the matter had attracted in the media , the Minister of ORG and the Minister of the Interior and ORG ( Minister PERSON en ORG ) informed ORG of ORG ( ORG ) that they intended to commission a vulnerability risk assessment of the telecommunication interception systems . On DATE , these Ministers transmitted to ORG an accountants ' report on the CARDINAL different systems used in the GPE . The main conclusion of this report ( dated DATE ) reads , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c During our investigation we have found , in all of the CARDINAL interception organisations examined , important lacunas in both the management of the interception system and the technical security of the interception systems themselves . This means that there exist , in all the interception organisations examined , risks that may lead directly to accessing , altering or ( non)deletion of intercepted information or therewith connected metainformation ( such as traffic data ) ... by unauthorised third persons . In our opinion , such risks are to be addressed without delay .", "How far such risks have also in fact led to abuse has , given the aim of the assessment , has not been examined . A mitigating circumstance in the insufficiency of the technical security is that the interception systems are used within the compartmented surroundings of the police so that the hereto related risks are primarily of an internal police nature . \u201d", "The Ministers stated , in their accompanying letter to ORG , that although no cases of abuse had been reported , the management and data security in the interception centres assessed had been found to be insufficiently formalised . They informed ORG of the measures already taken and the measures planned for the future to remedy the shortcomings as soon as possible .", "By letter of DATE , the Minister of Justice informed the ORG that he did not subscribe to the findings of the ORG made in its report of DATE . The Minister considered that the practice of intercepting all conversations conducted via a tapped telephone number , including telephone conversations with a lawyer , with a subsequent control by the public prosecutor whether any of these conversations fell with the scope of the privilege of non - disclosure enjoyed by lawyers was in accordance with LAW . Consequently , the Minister would not follow the ORG recommendations .", "On DATE , the ORG informed the Minister of ORG that , given the difference of opinion about the meaning of the applicable domestic legal rules , it now advised the Minister to amend these legal rules , by setting rules aimed at preventing that information conveyed to or by a person enjoying the privilege of non - disclosure be rendered public . The ORG further advised the Minister to entrust to the investigating judge the task of selecting what information should be classified as privileged .", "It is open to the public prosecutor , under LAW of LAW ( ORG ) , to request the investigating judge to open what is called \u2013 in order to distinguish it from the subsequent investigation at the trial \u2013 a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) . It is the task of the investigating judge to conduct such an investigation in which he / she is to ensure that evidence is obtained in accordance with the law . The judge must also act impartially by collecting evidence which might exculpate the suspect . It is on the basis of the judge 's investigation that the prosecution decides whether to take the matter further , by committal for trial , or whether to close it .", "LAW ORG , as amended on DATE , reads as follows :", "\u201c Access to all documents in the case file , either the originals or copies thereof , may not be denied to the suspect as soon as the preliminary judicial investigation has been closed or has ended , or , where there has been no preliminary judicial investigation , as soon as the notification of further prosecution or the summons for appearance at the trial in first instance has been served [ on the suspect ] . \u201d", "The trial court may suspend proceedings for further inquiries by the investigating judge ( LAW .", "Until DATE , the rules about the interception of communications made through public telecommunication networks or services were set out in Articles CARDINALf - h of the ORG . Further rules on the practical exercise of the power to intercept communications were set out in the LAW ( PERSON ) of DATE , a copy of which could be obtained by any interested person . The text of these Guidelines had further been published in , inter alia , ORG ( Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Mensenrechten ) of DATE . These Guidelines , which did not have the formal character of law , had been issued as a model letter from the senior public prosecutors to the police . The above rules initially covered only communications by telephone . As from DATE , when ORG ( Wet op de Computercriminaliteit ) entered into force , they also covered communications by fax and e - mail .", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , the tapping of telecommunications could only be ordered in relation to offences for which detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) could be imposed , i.e. offences of a certain gravity carrying a punishment of imprisonment of DATE or more ( LAW . The tapping could only concern communications in which a suspect was likely to participate , and it could only be ordered where the investigation urgently required it . It was subject to the prior authorisation of the investigating judge , and a written record ( procesverbaal ) of the tapping had to drawn up within TIME .", "Under LAW ORG , records without importance for the investigation had to be destroyed as soon as possible by order of the investigating judge and a written record of destruction should be drawn up without delay . As to the destruction of information obtained through the interception of telephone conversations , the standard practice in fact differed from the Guidelines . On the basis of , inter alia , the ORG 's findings in the cases of ORG and PERSON v. GPE ( judgments of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A and B ) as regards the possibility of inspection by the judge and by the defence , the official records and transcripts of tapped telephone conversations were not destroyed immediately but were kept until shortly after the closure of the case . Anyone requesting access to such material was required to give reasons for such a request .", "Where no suspect could be identified immediately and in order to obtain a tapping authorisation from the investigating judge , a preliminary judicial investigation against a person or persons unknown ( \u201c NN \u201d ) could be opened . As soon as the name(s ) of the suspected perpetrator(s ) could be established , the preliminary judicial investigation was to be put in the name of the suspect(s ) concerned ( LAW of the ORG ) .
