The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a professor of theology . As a professor of theology he was qualified to teach NORP religious education and courses in ethics and culture , as provided under the relevant domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of a proposal from the applicant \u2019s local priest , the archbishop of ORG ( PERSON ) issued the applicant with a canonical mandate ( missio canonica ) ( no . DATE ) authorising him to teach NORP religious education .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the intervention of ORG of ORG ( PERSON ured rije\u010dke ORG ) , the applicant was offered , without having to undergo a public competition , a contract of employment of indefinite duration as a layman teacher of NORP religious education in CARDINAL ORG high schools in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appointment was based on the Agreement of DATE between ORG and GPE on education and cultural affairs and the relevant complementary domestic regulations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE below ) . He was thereby employed in the public service and remunerated by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the time , the applicant was married to T.F.

The applicant \u2019s subsequent divorce from GPE was registered before the civil authorities , and in DATE he married another woman in a civil ceremony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that his civil marriage to another woman while still bound , in the eyes of the ORG , by the religious marriage to his previous wife was contrary to NORP doctrine and disqualified him from teaching religious education . The relevant part of the letter read :", "\u201c It has been established that in DATE this year you concluded a civil marriage although you are still bound by ORG to a third person . The local ORG of ORG issued you a mandate to teach NORP religious education in school . Each religious education teacher must demonstrate that he is \u2018 outstanding in true doctrine and the witness of a NORP life\u2019 ( ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and must participate in the sacramental and evangelical community of a parish . The new situation does not enable you to do this .", "You are therefore invited to explain in writing as soon as possible the manner in which your canonical situation can be harmonised with canonical mandate no . DATE and then , by DATE , to come for a meeting in ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After obtaining the applicant \u2019s explanation of his situation , on DATE ORG withdrew his canonical mandate to teach NORP religious education .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the CARDINAL schools in which the applicant was employed of the new situation . The relevant part of the letter read :", "\u201c We should inform you that on DATE canonical mandate no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL - DATE was withdrawn from the teacher of religious education , PERSON .", "The canonical mandate was withdrawn under LAW of the LAW between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs ( ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) because of a breach of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . PERSON explained his situation in writing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( regular termination of an employment contract ) , the schools dismissed the applicant from his teaching job on the grounds that he could no longer be a teacher of NORP religious education without a canonical mandate . They stressed that it had been impossible to find another position for the applicant or to offer him an alternative post within the schools . The applicant was given two months\u2019 notice and the right to an indemnity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings in ORG ( PERSON ) , challenging the decisions on his dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil action on the grounds that as stipulated in the LAW between the Holy See and GPE and the related Agreement between the Government of GPE and ORG on NORP religious education in ORG schools and pre - school institutions , he could not teach NORP religious education without a canonical mandate . ORG also found that the schools had examined the possibility of appointing the applicant to another suitable post , but that as there was no such post , they had justifiably terminated his contract of employment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the judgment of ORG by lodging an appeal before ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) . He argued that he had not breached LAW or any other relevant legislation and that the LAW between the Government of GPE and ORG did not require that a person whose canonical mandate had been withdrawn should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , endorsing the findings and reasoning of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) and a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) respectively . He relied , inter alia , on ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , and the corresponding provisions of the LAW , arguing that there had been an unjust interference with his private and family life as a result of the decisions on his dismissal , and that his dismissal had been of a discriminatory nature . He contended , in particular , that the conclusion of a second marriage contract in a civil ceremony could not be a reason for dismissal under LAW or any other ORG laws . He therefore considered that his dismissal based on the fact that he had divorced his former wife and remarried in a civil ceremony had disproportionately affected his private life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as unfounded , endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts . In particular , ORG stressed that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been based on the withdrawal of his canonical mandate , which was a necessary requirement for employment as a teacher of NORP religious education as provided for under the relevant domestic law . ORG also held that it was not for the schools or the courts to enter into the examination of the reasons for the withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s canonical mandate by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant supplemented his constitutional complaint by extending his arguments to the judgment of ORG . He contended in particular that ORG refusal to examine the reasons for his dismissal had essentially deprived him of the possibility to have those reasons effectively challenged in court .", "CARDINAL . A public hearing was held and on CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , finding that there had been no violation of his right to respect for his private and family life , or any discrimination against him . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c DATE . It follows from the available material and the [ appellant \u2019s ] constitutional complaint that the appellant \u2019s first marriage had been concluded in a religious ceremony before an official of the religious community and that [ the appellant ] was divorced on the basis of a final court decision as provided for under the relevant NORP law . ORG notes that the appellant subsequently concluded a new marriage in a civil ceremony without any restriction imposed by the ORG . It follows that the ORG did not inhibit his determination to remarry , nor did it prevent him from remarrying and founding a new family .", "Accordingly , the appellant \u2019s right to marry under LAW and his constitutional right to respect for his family life under LAW and LAW has not been breached .", "...", "DATE . ... [ ORG starts by observing that GPE and ORG concluded an Agreement on education and cultural affairs , signed in GPE on DATE . The Act ratifying that Agreement came into force on DATE and thereby this international treaty became part of the internal legal order of GPE with precedence in terms of its legal effects over the [ domestic ] statutes .", "By LAW undertook certain obligations which must be abided by and respected . Primarily , it undertook to secure NORP religious education in all ORG elementary and high schools and all pre - school institutions as a mandatory class for all those who have chosen that course , under the same conditions applicable to other mandatory classes .", "[ The Agreement ] stipulates that NORP religious education will be taught by qualified religious education teachers who are suitable for that position , in the opinion of ORG authorities , and meet the requisite legal requirements of the NORP legislation . It also stipulates that teachers of religious education must hold a canonical mandate ( missio canonica ) issued by the diocesan bishop , and that withdrawal of the mandate leads to an immediate loss of the right to teach NORP religious education . Under the ORG , teachers of religious education are members , together with their pupils , of the educational corps ... GPE undertook to regulate the programme and functioning of NORP religious education in schools of all types and levels by a special agreement DATE .", "ORG considers it necessary to note at this point that the appellant is wrong when he argues that the Agreement between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs does not require a canonical mandate as a condition for employment and that such a requirement only flows from the ORG between the Government of GPE and ORG on NORP religious education in ORG schools and pre - school institutions of DATE . The appellant specifically contends that the Agreement between the Government [ of GPE ] and ORG is a bilateral agreement which \u2018 is not a statute and does not have the status of an international treaty\u2019 and thus could not be binding for [ him and the ORG ] nor could it be applied to [ his ] case , as was done by the [ lower ] courts .", "Although the appellant relies on an erroneous premise that the canonical mandate , as a condition for employment as a teacher of religious education , has been stipulated ( only ) by the Agreement between the Government [ of GPE ] and ORG , it could be held that in essence he considers that the consequences of the withdrawal of the canonical mandate on his contract of employment , and his position of teacher of religious education , are contrary to LAW .", "ORG reiterates that the requirement to hold a canonical mandate in order to teach religious education , and the consequences of its withdrawal ( loss of the right to teach NORP religious education ) , are provided for LAW between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG considers it necessary to examine the special requirement stipulated by the FAC agreements for employment as a teacher of religious education \u2013 the canonical mandate .", "ORG TIME notes that the Government of GPE have so far concluded CARDINAL agreements on questions of mutual interest with different religious communities , in particular with :", "- ORG in GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ;", "- the NORP community in GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- ORG in GPE and ORG in GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the NORP ( Pentecostal ) Church in GPE , ORG in GPE and GPE of GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- ORG in GPE , ORG and ORG in GPE ( ORG nos . DATE ) ;", "- the NORP community Bet GPE in GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) ; and", "- the Coordination of NORP townships in GPE ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) .", "All these agreements have been concluded under LAW on the Legal Status of Religious Communities ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL ) and they all contain identical provisions concerning , for example , mandatory religious education classes for those who have chosen them , the teaching of these courses under the same conditions as other mandatory courses , and the necessity for teachers of religious education to hold the requisite mandate to teach religious education , which can always be withdrawn \u2018 for reasons of deficiencies related to the correctness of teaching and personal morality\u2019 .", "Such a requirement , given the nature of their job and its proximity with the mission of dissemination of the church \u2019s teaching , in ORG view , is not an excessive burden for persons who have chosen to become teachers of religious education . The assessment of a person \u2019s adequacy [ to teach religious education ] by the competent church authorities is a concretisation of the freedom of the church \u2019s activity and the right to religious freedom , which [ also ] includes the right of parents to a religious education of their children .", "ORG . The enforcement of the obligation undertaken by an international agreement , namely the organisation of NORP religious education in ORG elementary and high schools and pre - school education institutions , as provided for under the ORG between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs and the ORG between the Government of GPE and ORG , brought religious education teachers into the employment system of GPE . Although their employment status is not fully defined by these Agreements , the provisions of the LAW between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs in themselves show that the employment status of religious education teachers is a sui generis employment status \u2013 in order to teach religious education they must be suitable for that position in the opinion of the ORG authorities ; they must hold a canonical mandate and the withdrawal of the mandate leads to the loss of the right to teach NORP religious education .", "At the public hearing DATE on the basis of evidence given by ORG for legal affairs of ORG , Education and ORG of GPE , it has been undoubtedly established that the employment of all teachers of religious education was conducted without an open competition , although that has not been provided for under the relevant law . It was only [ later ] , after the public hearing , by section CARDINAL of the amendments to the Act on Tuition and Education in GPE and High Schools ( ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that a new section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was introduced , which provides that a contract of employment without an open competition may be concluded for the position of religious education teacher .", "In DATE ORG and ORG forwarded to all county offices for education , culture , information , sport and technical culture a letter concerning the employment status of religious education teachers in elementary and high schools ; more precisely , concerning their hiring and dismissal .", "The letter indicates that a contract of employment is to be concluded with religious education teachers meeting the relevant requirements , and that if the diocesan bishop by means of a decree withdraws the canonical mandate to teach NORP religious education from a religious education teacher due to deficiencies related to the correctness of the teaching and personal morality , the contract of employment is to be terminated under LAW as an extraordinary dismissal .", "DATE . It therefore follows that the appellant also entered the ORG education system without participating in an open competition . At the public hearing he stated that , on the basis of the local priest \u2019s recommendation the bishop had given him the mandate , the Ordinary had acted as an intermediary , and the school had given him the employment . Thus , by having the canonical mandate and meeting all other requirements , the appellant and the defendants concluded a \u2018 classical\u2019 contract of employment under LAW , which does not mention the canonical mandate or the consequences of its possible withdrawal .", "At the public hearing , when asked whether he had been aware of the consequences of his conduct on the right to teach religious education , the appellant stated that he had passed the exam in canon law which he could not have passed without learning [ also the issues ] concerning those consequences . It follows that the appellant knew that his position depended on the mandate given by the diocesan bishop and that he would lose it if the mandate were withdrawn .", "Accordingly , although he had concluded a \u2018 classical\u2019 employment contract under LAW , the appellant could not have expected , after he had lost the canonical mandate as a consequence of entering into a new civil marriage while he was still in a \u2018 ORG marriage with a third person , that he would be able to continue to teach religious education . However , he could have expected , irrespective of the internal instructions of the Minister , that the schools where he was employed would take all necessary measures to employ him in another post . This is because the withdrawal of the canonical mandate leads to the loss of the right to teach NORP religious education and not dismissal or the loss of his degree in theology . Under LAW of the By - law on the educational level and pedagogical - psychological education of teachers in high schools ( ORG nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , a degree in theology [ opens the possibility ] of teaching courses in ethics and culture .", "According to the findings of the first - instance court , the defendants had examined the possibility of employing the appellant in another post but , as such a post had not existed , they terminated his contract of employment by so - called regular dismissal , which gives rise to the right to a notice period and an indemnity . In so doing , the defendants acted in the usual manner for terminating a contract of employment by so - called regular dismissal . ORG therefore finds that the appellant has not been treated differently from other workers , including employees in schools , in the situation of a termination of a contract of employment by so - called regular dismissal .", "The assessment of the lawfulness of the termination of the appellant \u2019s contract of employment was , in the light of the relevant labour law , conducted by the [ competent ] courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . In view of the fact that for the position of teacher of religious education there is a further special requirement , without which it is impossible to conclude a contract of employment ( a canonical mandate ) , and having found that the appellant , due to the withdrawal of [ the canonical mandate ] no longer met the requirements for teaching NORP religious education , and the fact that the defendants had tried to find him another post ... , the [ competent ] courts , in ORG view , applied a constitutionally acceptable interpretation according to which the appellant \u2019s contract of employment had been terminated in accordance with the relevant law .", "ORG . Against the above background , in view of the GPE conduct following the withdrawal of the appellant \u2019s canonical mandate and in view of the manner in which the competent courts provided him with judicial protection in terms of the ORG \u2019s obligations under the FAC agreements , ORG finds that the appellant has been afforded sufficient protection of his [ employment rights ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON appended a concurring opinion to the decision , agreeing with the findings of the majority . However , he argued that ORG had not sufficiently appreciated the fact that the applicant had voluntarily consented to his position depending on the canonical mandate , which the diocesan bishop was authorised to issue and to withdraw .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of ORG gave a dissenting opinion in which she argued , in particular , that the normative framework for the employment of teachers of religious education , based on the Agreement between the Holy See and GPE on education and cultural affairs , had not been implemented sufficiently precisely in the relevant domestic employment system , which had left a number of issues undetermined .", "CARDINAL . The decision of ORG was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON applied to the PERSON First - instance ORG diocesan ORG ( GPE \u017eenidbeni ORG prvog stupnja u ORG ) for the annulment of her religious marriage to the applicant on the grounds that , when entering into the marriage , he had demonstrated \u201c a positive act of the will excluding marriage itself \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , canon CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON First - instance ORG diocesan ORG accepted GPE \u2019s application and annulled her religious marriage to the applicant . The decision was then forwarded for examination to the ORG - diocesan ORG ( Me\u0111ubiskupijski prizivni sud u GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were held in the applicant \u2019s absence because he had failed to respond to the court \u2019s summons . During the proceedings , an email sent by the applicant to GPE on DATE was admitted as evidence . In the email the applicant stated that if he \u201c could return all other sacraments [ he ] would gladly do it . This way , if [ he ] managed to get rid of only one , which , as [ they ] both knew , never existed , [ his ] heart would be happier . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
