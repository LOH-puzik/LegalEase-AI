Currently she lives illegally in GPE . She is represented by Mr GPE Heckscher , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON PERSON , of ORG , and their Co - agent , PERSON PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant applied for a visa for GPE at ORG in GPE . She maintained that the purpose of her stay was business . A visa valid for DATE was granted her . She entered GPE on DATE , at DATE .", "DATE , on DATE , in GPE she married an NORP national , henceforth called ORG . The latter was born in DATE and had entered GPE illegally on DATE , when he was DATE . Having married a NORP national on DATE he was granted a temporary residence permit , which became permanent on DATE . ORG divorced his NORP wife on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant and ORG contacted ORG ) , which advised them that at the relevant time they did not fulfil the requirements set out in section CARDINAL , subsection ( ii ) d of LAW ( GPE , No . CARDINAL of DATE ) for obtaining a family reunification , as according to that provision an alien residing in GPE , who was neither a NORP national nor a refugee had to have held a permanent residence permit in GPE for more than DATE . The applicant left GPE on DATE .", "DATE after her marriage with ORG , on CARDINAL DATE , in GPE the applicant gave birth to ORG .", "On DATE , on a visa valid for DATE , the applicant reentered GPE together with ORG and applied for a residence permit .", "By decision of DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) d of LAW ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) , taken together with section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG refused to grant the applicant a residence permit because it could not be established that the spouses\u2019 aggregate ties with GPE were at least as strong as the spouses\u2019 ties with another country . The applicant was ordered to leave the country within DATE from DATE on which she was notified of the decision .", "GK on the other hand was granted a temporary residence permit until DATE ( when the child turns DATE and comes of age ) .", "On DATE , in GPE , the applicant gave birth to the couple \u2019s second child , ORG , who was granted a temporary residence permit until DATE .", "On DATE , at the Aliens Authorities\u2019 request , the police confirmed that the applicant was still living with her husband and thus remained illegally in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s request of DATE that ORG re - open her case was refused on DATE , and the applicant was ordered to leave the country immediately .", "By letter of DATE to ORG , the applicant requested anew that she be granted a residence permit . In support thereof she maintained that ORG would not allow her to take any of the children with her back to GPE ; that in her view ORG was not capable of taking proper care of the youngest child ; and that she had initiated proceedings against ORG in order to revoke their shared custody of ORG ( in order to bring this child with her to GPE ) . Also , she applied for a residence permit by invoking humanitarian grounds as set out in section QUANTITY , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) of LAW ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "The applicant \u2019s letter was forwarded to ORG ( NORP for flygtninge , ORG ) , which on DATE refused the applicant \u2019s request since a residence permit pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) of LAW could only be granted if the residence permit seeker was also an asylum seeker .", "The police contacted the applicant at the spouses address on DATE and summoned her to come for an interview at the police station on DATE . On DATE , the applicant and ORG informed the police that they agreed to the applicant leaving voluntarily with their CARDINAL children . It was planned that she left for GPE on DATE .", "On DATE , however , the applicant appealed against the Aliens authorities\u2019 decisions of DATE and DATE to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant and ORG were legally separated . On DATE they signed an agreement before GPE ( PERSON ) maintaining shared custody of the children who due to an agreement between the separated spouses were to live with ORG . According to the agreement , the applicant was entitled to access to her children DATE from DATE , and TIME on DATE . DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel wrote to ORG that the applicant withdrew her consent to leave voluntarily .

In reaching its decision ORG maintained that it could not be established that the spouses\u2019 aggregate ties with GPE were stronger than the spouses\u2019 ties with another country as required by section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) b - d and sections CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( vii ) . In this respect , it noted inter alia that both spouses were born and raised in GPE ; that ORG only entered GPE at DATE ; that the parents of both spouses lived in GPE ; and that the spouses communicated in NORP and ORG .", "Furthermore , the ORG found that no exceptional personal circumstances existed which would make the issuing of a residence permit appropriate . Finally , noting that the applicant had resided illegally in GPE since DATE , ORG did not find that particular reasons made it appropriate to exempt the applicant from complying with the rule of procedure set out in section QUANTITY c , subsection CARDINAL in LAW , according to which an application for a residence permit under section CARDINAL c , subsection CARDINAL of LAW has to be submitted or examined before entry into the country .", "Finally , the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that a refusal to grant her a residence permit would be in violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It noted that the fact that the spouses had been legally separated and made an agreement regarding the applicant \u2019s access to the children could not alter the outcome , since according to the applicant \u2019s counsel the reason for the legal separation had merely been an attempt to improve the applicant \u2019s chances to stay in GPE .", "In the meantime , in a letter of DATE , in which the applicant stated her address to be that of her husband , in vain she requested help from the Queen of GPE .", "On DATE , on request , the applicant \u2019s counsel informed the police that he was unaware of the applicant \u2019s address ; that he only spoke to her on the telephone ; and that she wished to obtain a divorce from ORG since allegedly such would be the only possible way of staying in GPE .", "The applicant did not bring her case before the ordinary courts .", "According to ORG , the applicant is still married to ORG and she continues to live illegally in GPE .", "LAW ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) applicable at the relevant time .", "Upon application , a residence permit could be issued inter alia to an alien over DATE who cohabited at a shared residence , either in a marriage or in a regular cohabitation of prolonged duration , with a person permanently resident in GPE over DATE who had held a permanent residence permit for GPE for more than DATE ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) d ) . However , if the person permanently residing in GPE did not possess NORP citizenship , it was a condition for issuing a residence permit to the alien ( spouse or cohabitant ) that the spouses\u2019 or the ORG aggregate ties with GPE correspond at least to the spouses\u2019 or GPE ties with another country , or that exceptional personal circumstances otherwise made it appropriate ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , taken together with section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) b - d and section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( vii ) ) .", "Furthermore , a residence permit could be issued inter alia to an alien upon application , if exceptional reasons made it appropriate ( section CARDINAL c , subsection CARDINAL ) . Such a residence permit had to be obtained before entry into GPE . After entry , such an application could not be submitted or examined or be allowed to suspend enforcement in GPE , unless particular reasons made it appropriate ( section CARDINAL c , subsection CARDINAL ) . In certain specified cases an alien who has been notified of a final administrative decision ( made under section CARDINAL ) may request within DATE after the decision is made known to him that ORG bring the case before the competent courts for a review ( LAW ) . The later provision is , however , a supplement to the general rule in CARDINAL of the LAW ( see below ) .", "LAW of DATE ( PERSON ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executives\u2019 authority ; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not , by taking the case to the courts of justice , avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority . \u201d", "Review by the courts of the ORG \u2019s general and specific decisions pursuant to section CARDINAL of the LAW is a common legal remedy . Consequently , in cases where an alien claims that a refusal to grant a residence permit or a deportation order would be in violation of the LAW , the courts examine intensively whether the ORG \u2019s decision is in accordance with GPE \u2019s obligations under the Convention , including LAW . The Government have submitted various recent judgments ( including one printed in ORG ( ORG p. CARDINAL ) , in which pursuant to section CARDINAL of the LAW the domestic courts thoroughly examined an alien \u2019s allegation that the ORG \u2019s refusal to grant a residence permit was in breach of LAW . The courts can not grant an alien a residence permit but they can annul the decision of the ORG and thus send the case back to the ORG for a renewed examination , for instance if the courts find that the refusal to grant a residence permit constitutes a violation of the GPE right to respect for family life according to LAW .", "An application pursuant to section CARDINAL of the LAW has no automatic suspensive effect . However , the Government have submitted CARDINAL ORG decisions printed in ORG DATE p. CARDINAL and p. CARDINAL , in which an alien , having been refused a residence permit by the ORG , brought the case before the courts and requested that it be granted suspensive effect . In both cases ORG ruled that even in the absence of a specific legal authority , an application pursuant to section CARDINAL of the LAW may be granted suspensive effect if very particular circumstances ( ganske s\u00e6rlige omst\u00e6ndigheder ) exist ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
