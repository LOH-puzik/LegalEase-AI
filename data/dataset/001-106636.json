On DATE the ORG \u2019s President wrote a letter to the Prime Minister ( no . DATE ) , in which he \u201c informed [ him ] of the ongoing insolvency proceedings against ORG pursuant to the instructions of the President of GPE of DATE and CARDINAL DATE \u201d . The following was noted , inter alia , in the above letter :", "\u201c The arrears of the former ORG [ its ] creditors who undertake entrepreneurial activities in GPE , are , first of all , the result of its improper compliance with its contractual obligations .", "Having received oil owned by customers , the refinery is obliged to return finished oil products to its owners as agreed . The companies had to supply most of those oil products , [ in turn ] , to NORP agricultural enterprises .", "The systematic violations by ORG of its contractual obligations , as well as its evasion of enforcement of the judicial decisions , have not only resulted in the arrears , but have also led to their accrual . ...", "In the course of the examination of the case , the court , within its competence , took appropriate measures for settlement of the debts between ORG and its creditors . ORG concluded civil law agreements with some of the creditors governing the terms and conditions of the ORG repayment , which are being implemented and which offers some hope that all the arrears can be settled that way . This is the expectation that the debtor itself expressed in its application to the President of GPE . However , despite this , the debtor is evading complying with the procedure of debt repayment agreed with [ the applicant company ] .", "Having regard to the difficult economic situation of ORG , [ the applicant ] company considerably reduced [ its ] claims ... - from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL ....", "I note for your information that the arrears of ORG in respect of [ the applicant company ] emerged in DATE and are confirmed by judgments of ORG of GPE . The lawfulness of those judgments has been verified by the supervision instances , including by LAW of ORG , which upheld them .", "However , since the commencement of the insolvency proceedings , ORG has not enforced the judgments despite the fact that they have the force of law . Its statement that by the conclusion of the agreements with the creditors concerning the terms of and procedures for the repayment of the arrears it was released from the necessity to comply with the judgments is unlawful .", "GPE , on the instruction of ORG of DATE ... , investigated and fully confirmed the fact of ORG \u2019s non - compliance with its contractual obligations , as a result of which the claims of [ the applicant company ] were found to be fully justified .", "In its letter of CARDINAL DATE ... this authority noted that during DATE the leadership of the GPE regional authorities had grossly violated NORP legislation , having ordered ORG to divert , free of charge , the oil products belonging to [ the applicant company ] . This undermines the statements of the debtor that it was not its fault that those oil products had not been delivered to their owners .", "The debtor did not even use the aid provided by the Government for repayment of the arrears . In DATE PERSON provided ORG with resources ... and approved a schedule of delivery of oil products during the period from DATE which was to remain in force until the full repayment of the debt to [ the applicant company ] . The [ debtor ] company delivered QUANTITY of those oil products during DATE and refused further repayment of the arrears , which exceeded this volume by several times .", "The demand to terminate the proceedings contradicts the law and can not be satisfied until the complete repayment of the arrears . ...", "In the course of the examination of the case , the court exhausted all legally envisaged possibilities of saving the debtor from insolvent liquidation . The creditors have made it clear that it is not their goal to have the debtor liquidated or to get its assets into their possession . They insist on gradual repayment of the debts in compliance with the agreed schedules and , subject to that , do not object to termination of the proceedings upon the complete repayment of the arrears .", "Given the complexity of the settlements between the debtor and the creditors and the lack of clarity as to the final time - frame of the repayment of the arrears , which inevitably leads to the accrual of damages due to inflation and a loss of income for the creditors , and with a view to the recovery of the debtor company , it is deemed necessary to create a taskforce to investigate the problem onsite .", "In our opinion , it would be desirable to investigate and finally determine the destiny of the oil products produced by ORG from the oil owned by customers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG created a taskforce to establish the reasons for the arrears of NORP vis - \u00e0 - vis its foreign and domestic creditors and to study the consequences of settlement of their claims . It consisted of representatives of : ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , ORG , ORG , and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the taskforce issued its report , which contained , inter alia , the following findings . ORG was the biggest oil refinery in GPE and was able to satisfy up to PERCENT of the fuel needs of the country . All the oil it had refined during DATE belonged to NORP commercial entities , which had showed increasing interest in the company given its proximity to the NORP border . The report concluded that the company was insolvent . It noted that the final amount of its arrears vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant company , as confirmed by the ORG in its ruling of DATE , was UAH CARDINAL . The main reason for the company \u2019s indebtedness had been the decision of the ORG authorities ( in DATE \u2013 according to the report in question , in DATE according to all the other documents in the case file ) to divert the oil products produced by ORG from oil owned by customers for ORG needs .", "CARDINAL . The report also contained the following statement :", "\u201c The taskforce supports the proposal [ apparently , advanced by ORG ] that ORG of GPE must also take into account ... the ORG \u2019s share of the company \u2019s assets and the other factors which were not taken into account during the previous hearings . This concerns fulfilment of the obligations in kind , since their translation into pecuniary terms caused the amount of the arrears to be overstated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , the taskforce considered that the amount of the outstanding debt of the company vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant company had to be verified , by means of expert reports if required . It further underlined a finding of the ORG in another case , according to which the indexation of debt to inflation had not been envisaged by the relevant legislation , and maintained that a similar line should be followed in the present case . It recommended suspending the insolvency proceedings until the \u201c factual indebtedness of ORG vis - \u00e0 - vis commercial enterprises was established on the basis of a documentary audit \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the above report , the taskforce had been created at the request of the ORG \u2019s President , such request having been expressed in a letter ( no .

On DATE ORG rejected a request from ORG for an extension of the time - limit for challenging the ORG \u2019s ruling of DATE under the supervisory review procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s President lifted the ban on changing the status of ORG \u2019s shares which had been imposed by the ORG \u2019s ruling of DATE . This was done at the request of ORG , which intended to conduct a non - commercial competition for the sale of the ORG \u2019s shares in the company equal to PERCENT of its share capital . The sale was intended to help the company overcome its financial crisis and avoid insolvency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Deputy Prime Minister wrote a letter to the ORG \u2019s President in which he asked him to also lift the ban on transferring the ownership of ORG \u2019s shares . The letter stated :", "\u201c ... the members of the taskforce created at your request by an order of the ORG noted that the amount of [ ORG \u2019s ] arrears vis - \u00e0 - vis its domestic creditors requires further clarification and in - depth and thorough verification .", "Given the fact that ORG runs the biggest and the most modern oil refinery in GPE and having regard to its importance to the economy and security of the ORG , ... you are requested to consider the findings of the taskforce , to lift the ban on the sale of the company \u2019s shares and to postpone the examination of the insolvency proceedings pending a determination of the final amount of its arrears vis - \u00e0 - vis the domestic creditors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Deputy Prime Minister instructed ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , ORG , ORG , Derzhnaftogazprom and ORG to ensure that a \u201c thematic documentary audit of the agreements for oil refining entered into by ORG in DATE and the amount of [ its ] arrears vis - \u00e0 - vis the domestic creditors \u201d be undertaken by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that it had checked the agreements entered into by ORG in DATE and found that the company had delivered oil products to ORG agricultural enterprises pursuant to governmental instructions . There had been no documents or information suggesting that the Government had ever paid for that . As a result , the arrears of ORG ( then called the Refinery ) had emerged vis - \u00e0 - vis its customers , commercial enterprises , and as of DATE had been equal to QUANTITY of oil products .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected a request by ORG for an expert assessment of its arrears in respect of the applicant company , noting that it had already established the final amount of those arrears . On DATE and DATE ORG upheld that ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a request with ORG for review of the ruling issued by the ORG \u2019s President on DATE . It claimed that he had lacked the power to make such a ruling . The applicant company submitted that the creditors had not previously challenged the ruling because it had been issued in order to enable a non - commercial competition to be held for sale of the ORG \u2019s shares , amounting to PERCENT of the share capital in the company , and the competition had been subject to a guarantee that the arrears would be repaid by the company \u2019s new owners . Referring to the fact that such a competition had never taken place and that , according to the media , there was instead a new plan to sell PERCENT of the shares ( a controlling share ) without any guarantee of repayment of the debts , the applicant company had sought to have the ruling of DATE overturned and its claim secured by a ban on the sale of the ORG \u2019s shares in ORG until the insolvency proceedings were complete .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s President wrote a letter to the First Deputy Prime Minister , in which he noted that the original claim of the applicant company in respect of ORG had been reduced through an agreement between the parties from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to ORG MONEY , with the latter figure having been confirmed by the court . The letter stated that the creditors had agreed to a restructuring of ORG \u2019s arrears for a term of DATE , subject to an approved debt repayment schedule being formalised by a judicial decision and having its enforcement guaranteed . At the same time they had agreed , subject to the aforementioned conditions , to reduce the amount of the arrears payable in kind . With reference to the aforementioned points , the ORG \u2019s President underlined that the court had exhausted all procedural possibilities for saving the debtor from insolvent liquidation . He proposed to take into account the above suggestions of the creditors for overcoming the company \u2019s financial crisis made in the extrajudicial restructuring process , as the situation pertaining at the time had led to the accrual of the arrears due to inflation and to a loss of income for the creditors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON committee submitted its proposals for restoring the solvency of ORG and preventing its insolvency to the First Deputy Prime Minister . It proposed , inter alia , to transfer into the trust of the PERSON committee the ORG \u2019s shares in ORG in an amount equal to the company \u2019s arrears as a guarantee of the repayment of those arrears . The PERSON committee drew the attention of the First Deputy Prime Minister to what it described as \u201c unlawful pressure by the authorities on the creditors and on the court , as well as the unacceptable protraction of the search for a solution to [ this ] acute problem \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE asked the Speaker of ORG \u201c to apply to ORG with a view to termination of the insolvency proceedings \u201d .

On DATE wrote a letter to the President of GPE in which it noted that extensive efforts were being made to overcome its financial crisis and that there was interest in it from a potential foreign investor . It considered , however , that \u201c the position of a number of non - State creditors of the company [ was ] an obstacle to obtaining an effective result from the measures taken by the ORG authorities and to realisation of the investor \u2019s potential \u201d . It underlined that the applicant company was \u201c blocking the possibility of resolving the problem in a civilised manner \u201d . The company asked the President \u201c to give instructions to the relevant ORG authorities to verify , within the legal framework , the soundness of [ the applicant company \u2019s ] claims against ORG , the nature of their emergence and to determine the correct amount of the arrears . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It established the final arrears owed by ORG to the applicant company in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . The report considered that the findings of the ORG concerning the outstanding debt to the applicant company had been wrong and in contradiction of the applicable legislation .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE the ORG imposed a moratorium on allowing the LOC claims in the case and appointed an administrator of the debtor \u2019s property ( an individual person ) .", "CARDINAL .
