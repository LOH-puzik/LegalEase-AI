BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE . He lives in GPE and is a sales manager .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , he was arrested by the police at his home and taken to NORP where he was questioned in connection with a car theft .", "Warrants of arrest for forgery and uttering forged documents were issued against the applicant on DATE , on DATE and on DATE . The first warrant - notice no . CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL - was issued by Mr. PERSON , an investigating judge at the NORP criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ) , and the second and third - notices nos . ORG and CARDINAL - by Mr. PERSON , the other investigating judge at the same court .", "CARDINAL . ORG Prior to that , in the capacity of judge ( juge assesseur ) of the same court sitting either on appeal ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) or at first instance ( judgments of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) , Mr. PERSON had already dealt with criminal proceedings brought against Mr. PERSON in connection with a number of offences ; those proceedings had led variously to an unconditional or conditional discharge ( relaxe ) ( DATE and DATE , respectively ) or to conviction .", "More recently , Mr. PERSON had had to examine , in his capacity of investigating judge , a criminal complaint filed by Mr. PERSON ( DATE ) and , in his capacity of judge dealing with the attachment of property ( juge des saisies ) , certain civil cases concerning him ( DATE ) . In regard to each of these cases , the applicant had applied to ORG to have the case removed , on the ground of bias ( suspicion l\u00e9gitime ; Article CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) , from Mr. PERSON or from the NORP court as a whole ; each of these requests had been held inadmissible or unfounded .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the outset Mr. PERSON dealt with cases nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL but he was on several occasions prevented by illness from attending his chambers . He was replaced , initially on an occasional and temporary basis and , as from DATE , on a permanent basis , by Mr. PERSON , who retained responsibility for case no . CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG In case no . CARDINAL , a single - judge chamber of the NORP court ( Mr. PERSON ) sentenced Mr. PERSON on DATE to DATE imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL BF . He did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG After preliminary investigations lasting DATE , a chamber of the court ( the chambre du conseil ) ordered the joinder of cases nos . CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG and on CARDINAL DATE committed Mr. PERSON for trial . These cases related to CARDINAL alleged offences committed by CARDINAL accused , headed by the applicant ; there were CARDINAL persons intervening to claim damages ( parties civiles ) .", "For the purpose of the trial , the court , which over DATE had CARDINAL or CARDINAL titular judges , sat as a chamber composed of a president and CARDINAL judges , including Mr. PERSON . Mr. PERSON stated that he protested orally against the latter \u2019s presence , but he did not have recourse to any of the legal remedies open to him for this purpose , such as a formal challenge ( proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9cusation ; LAW ) .", "After a hearing which lasted DATE on CARDINAL and DATE , the court gave judgment on DATE . Mr. PERSON was acquitted on CARDINAL counts and convicted on the remainder , note being taken of the fact that he was a recidivist . He was accordingly sentenced , in respect of CARDINAL matter , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL BF and , in respect of another , to DATE imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL BF ; his immediate arrest was ordered .", "CARDINAL . ORG Both the applicant and the public prosecutor \u2019s department appealed . On DATE , ORG reduced the first sentence to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL BF and upheld the second . In addition , it unanimously imposed a third sentence , namely DATE imprisonment and a fiscal fine ( amende fiscale ) , for offences which the NORP court had - wrongly , in ORG view - treated as being linked with others by reason of a single criminal intent .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON appealed to ORG , raising some CARDINAL different points of law . CARDINAL of his grounds , based on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , was that Mr. PERSON had been both judge and party in the case since after conducting the preliminary investigation he had acted as CARDINAL of the trial judges .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE ( Pasicrisie DATE , I , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . It held that this combination of functions violated neither LAW nor any other legal provision - such as LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention - nor the rights of the defence . On the other hand , ORG upheld a plea concerning the confiscation of certain items of evidence and , to this extent , referred the case back to ORG ; the latter court has in the meantime ( on DATE ) directed that the items in question be returned . ORG also quashed , of its own motion and without referring the case back , the decision under appeal in so far as the appellant had been sentenced to a fiscal fine . The remainder of the appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG Investigating judges , who are appointed by the Crown \" from among the judges of the court of first instance \" ( LAW ) , conduct the preparatory judicial investigation ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . The object of this procedure is to assemble the evidence and to establish any proof against the accused as well as any circumstances that may tell in his favour , so as to provide the chambre du conseil or the chambre des mises en accusation , as the case may be , with the material which it needs to decide whether the accused should be committed for trial . The procedure is secret ; it is not conducted in the presence of both parties ( non contradictoire ) nor is there any legal representation .", "The investigating judge also has the status of officer of the criminal investigation police ( police judiciaire ) . In this capacity , he is empowered to inquire into serious and lesser offences ( crimes et d\u00e9lits ) , to assemble evidence and to receive complaints from any person claiming to have been prejudiced by such offences ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL in fine and CARDINAL of LAW ) . When so acting , he is placed under the \" supervision of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ( ORG prosecutor ) \" ( LAW CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) , although this does not include a power to give directions . \" In all cases where the suspected offender is deemed to have been caught in the act \" , the investigating judge may take \" directly \" and in person \" any action which the procureur du Roi ( public prosecutor ) is empowered to take \" ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Save in the latter category of case , the investigating judge can take action only after the matter has been referred to him either by means of a formal request from the procureur du Roi for the opening of an inquiry ( Articles DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) or by means of a criminal complaint coupled with a claim for damages ( constitution de partie civile ; Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "If a court includes several investigating judges , it is for the presiding judge to allocate cases amongst them . In principle , cases are assigned to them in turn , from DATE ; however , this is not an inflexible rule and the presiding judge may depart therefrom , for example if the matter is urgent or if a new case has some connection with one that has already been allocated .", "CARDINAL . ORG In order to facilitate the ascertainment of the truth , the investigating judge is invested with wide powers ; according to the case - law of ORG , he may \" take any steps which are not forbidden by law or incompatible with the standing of his office \" ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , p. CARDINAL ) . He can , inter alia , summon the accused to appear or issue a warrant for his detention , production before a court or arrest ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) ; question the accused , hear witnesses ( Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the same Code ) , confront witnesses with each other ( Article CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) , visit the scene of the crime ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) , visit and search LOC ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the same Code ) , take possession of evidence ( LAW ) , and so on . The investigating judge has to report to the chambre du conseil on the cases with which he is dealing ( LAW ) ; he takes , by means of an order , decisions on the expediency of measures requested by the public prosecutor \u2019s department , such orders being subject to an appeal to the chambre des mises en accusation of ORG .", "CARDINAL . When the investigation is completed , the investigating judge transmits the case - file to the procureur du Roi , who will return it to him with his submissions ( LAW , first paragraph ) .", "It is then for the chambre du conseil , which is composed of a single judge belonging to the court of first instance ( Acts of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) , to decide - unless it considers it should order further inquiries - whether to discharge the accused ( non - lieu ; LAW ) , to commit him for trial before a district court ( tribunal de police ; Article CARDINAL ) or a criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ; Article CARDINAL ) or to send the papers to the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) , depending upon the circumstances .", "Unlike his NORP counterpart , the NORP investigating judge is thus never empowered to refer a case to the trial court himself . Before taking its decision , the chambre du conseil - which sits in camera - will hear the investigating judge \u2019s report . This report will take the form of an oral account of the state of the investigations ; the investigating judge will express no opinion therein as to the accused \u2019s guilt , it being for the public prosecutor \u2019s department to deliver concluding submissions calling for CARDINAL decision or another .", "CARDINAL . ORG Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW prohibits \" the concurrent exercise of different judicial functions ... except where otherwise provided by law \" ; it lays down that \" any decision given by a judge who has previously dealt with the case in the exercise of some other judicial function \" shall be null and void .", "This rule applies to investigating judges , amongst others . Article CARDINAL specifies that \" proceedings before an assize court shall be null and void if the presiding judge or another judge sitting is a judicial officer who has acted in the case as investigating judge ... \" .", "Neither can an investigating judge sit as an appeal - court judge , for otherwise he would have \" to review on appeal , and thus as last - instance trial judge , the legality of investigation measures ... which [ he ] had taken or ordered at first instance \" ( Court of Cassation , DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , p. CARDINAL , and Revue de droit p\u00e9nal et de criminologie , DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On the other hand , under the third paragraph of LAW , as amended by LAW of DATE , \" investigating judges may continue to sit , in accordance with their seniority , to try cases brought before a court of first instance \" . According to the drafting history and decided case - law on this provision , it is immaterial that the cases are ones previously investigated by the judges in question : they would in that event be exercising , not \" some other judicial function \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , but rather the same function of judge on the court of first instance ; it would be only their assignment that had changed ( Parliamentary Documents , ORG , no . CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG , DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , p. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; ORG judgment of DATE in the present case , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In the case of PERSON , ORG confirmed this line of authority in its judgment of DATE , which followed the submissions presented by the public prosecutor \u2019s department . After dismissing various arguments grounded on general principles of law , ORG rejected the argument put forward by the appellant on the basis of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention :", "\" However , as regards the application of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) ... , when a case requires a determination of civil rights and obligations or of a criminal charge , the authority hearing the case at first instance and the procedure followed by that authority do not necessarily have to satisfy the conditions laid down by the above - mentioned provision , provided that the party concerned or the accused is able to lodge an appeal against the decision affecting him taken by that authority with a court which does offer all the guarantees stipulated by LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) and has competence to review all questions of fact and of law . In the present case , the appellant does not maintain that the court of appeal which convicted him did not offer those guarantees ...", "In any event , the principles and the rule relied on in the ground of appeal do not have the scope therein suggested ;", "From the sole fact that a trial judge inquired into the case as an investigating judge it can not be inferred that the accused \u2019s right to an impartial court has been violated . It can not legitimately be feared that the said judge does not offer the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused is entitled .", "The investigating judge is not a party adverse to the accused , but a judge of the court of first instance with the responsibility of assembling in an impartial manner evidence in favour of as well as against the accused .", "... . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
