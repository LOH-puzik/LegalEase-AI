The applicant relied on the conclusion of the psychological experts ' report , arguing that \u201c NORP calendar CARDINAL \u201d did not promote hatred against the NORP , NORP or NORP , nor did it claim the superiority of the NORP over other nations . According to the appellate court , these were the conclusions of experts in CARDINAL field only , whereas the rest of the evidence , namely the political science and bibliographical experts ' reports , attested that the comments in the calendar were based on the ideology of extreme nationalism , which rejected the idea of civil society 's integration and endorsed xenophobia , national hatred and territorial claims .", "CARDINAL . The court disagreed with the applicant 's argument that her defence rights had been violated because the first - instance court had failed to call the experts to have them challenged at the hearing . ORG stated :", "\u201c The [ applicant 's ] argument that the [ first - instance ] court violated procedural legal norms because the experts were not present at the court hearing , is not valid . The first- instance court , relying on its inner belief , evaluated the experts ' conclusions both as to their reasonableness and as to their comprehensiveness .
