On DATE the First - Instance Panel of ORG of GPE , rejecting the prosecutor \u2019s request to place the applicant in pre - trial detention , ordered the applicant \u2019s release under police supervision . The applicant was released at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE , reversing the lower - instance decision , placed the applicant in pre - trial detention for DATE . It justified its decision solely by noting that the applicant had been charged with a serious crime carrying a possible penalty of more than DATE imprisonment . This fact in itself , in ORG view , substantiated the risk of the applicant absconding , given that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , as in force at the material time , provided that the seriousness of an offence could constitute grounds for the imposition of pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of ORG upheld the order of CARDINAL DATE . Like the lower - instance court , the appellate court did not address the possibility of imposing a more lenient measure of restraint in order to ensure the aims of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that his pre - trial detention be replaced by a more lenient measure of restraint . The prosecutor agreed to the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG released the applicant on bail on payment of a security of GEL MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . When ordering his release , the court took into consideration the applicant \u2019s good references and the fact that he had fully compensated the injured party for the damage caused by his allegedly fraudulent activities .", "CARDINAL .
