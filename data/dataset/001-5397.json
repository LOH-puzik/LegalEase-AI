NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in PERSON . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by its Agent , PERSON , Attorney , Office of the Attorney ORG ) .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the national courts\u2019 judgments , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a qualified teacher who also holds a degree in special educational needs . From DATE to DATE he worked as a teacher in a prison and , from DATE to DATE , as a social environment worker ( milj\u00f8terapeut ) in a community home for young people .", "The applicant began working at ORG psychiatric division in ORG ( \u201c the hospital \u201d ) on DATE . His job was classified as a social environment worker in order for him to receive a salary corresponding to his qualifications but , de facto , he mainly served as a non - qualified nursing assistant . On recruiting him the hospital expressly retained the right to make changes to his \u201c duty arrangements and place of service \u201d .", "The applicant had applied for a job on the hospital \u2019s security ward - Ward CARDINAL , which was to be opened following the closure of the national hospital for the care for particularly difficult and/or dangerous psychiatric patients and the decentralisation of the services provided by the latter . ORG hospital had sought to recruit psychiatric nurses but there was a shortage of qualified candidates .", "Awaiting the opening of LAW , the applicant served for a brief period on LAW . He worked on LAW from DATE until DATE , partly during the daytime and partly on night duty . During this period there was a certain amount of disturbance on the Ward , partly owing to the hospital \u2019s use of physical restraint of the patients , particularly by means of devices such as belts and straps . In the view of the applicant , as well as other employees , the hospital used physical restraints too often and arbitrarily . He raised the matter internally and also in several letters to the Chief County Medical Officer and ORG in DATE . The disturbances at the hospital were CARDINAL of the reasons why , in DATE and DATE , a special inspection was carried out of the hospital \u2019s psychiatric division . As to the use of physical restraints , it was noted in the conclusions of the inspection report that \u201c physical restraints are employed too much without proper reason ... There has been no adequate supervision and control \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant wrote to the hospital management stating , inter alia , that the possibility of expressing professional disagreement had been exhausted , and that he therefore asked to be allowed to leave LAW . Accordingly , the applicant was temporarily transferred on DATE to work on LAW . However , the applicant did not wish to work with patients needing nursing assistance and , again at his own request , was transferred on DATE to work TIME shifts on Ward CARDINAL on a one year temporary assignment . The applicant worked on Ward CARDINAL until DATE , when he was granted sick leave . By this time serious problems had arisen between him and the other person working night shifts on that ORG and several unsuccessful meetings with superiors had been held to try to solve the problem . A further meeting was held in DATE with inter alia the hospital management , a union representative and the applicant , still on sick leave . Due to the acuteness of the problem , it was decided to place the applicant as a social environment worker in the hospital \u2019s ORG ( serving the hospital at large ) where , it was hoped , his pedagogic skills could be put to use . On his return to duty on DATE he worked in ORG .", "The applicant was , however , not satisfied with his new functions and , on DATE , was again granted sick leave . By DATE he was fit for work , but informed the hospital that he did not intend to return to ORG because he could not accept the transfer from TIME duty on Ward CARDINAL with the resultant reduction in salary . The applicant later failed to resume work despite the fact that his employer had let it be known that this would be regarded as absence without leave . The applicant never returned to work at the hospital . No formal decision was ever made by the applicant \u2019s employer concerning his dismissal .", "In DATE the applicant sued the hospital for unlawful dismissal , but in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found against him . On appeal , this judgment was upheld on DATE by ORG , which concluded that he was himself responsible for having brought his employment to an end .", "As ORG had done , ORG praised the applicant for having aired his critical views on the use of coercive measures . However , it found no basis for associating the hospital \u2019s treatment of him with the conflict on LAW . Nor was there anything to indicate that his transfer to ORG had been motivated by a desire to transfer an allegedly troublesome employee from a nursing ward .", "ORG found that during the relatively brief periods the applicant had worked on DATE , CARDINAL there had , except for his brief assignment on Ward DATE , been incidents perceived as negative by certain colleagues . This had been so even if there were colleagues with whom he had worked well . In general , ORG noted , his relations with colleagues had showed a negative trend . The problems had come to a peak on LOC , where the situation had become untenable .", "A colleague had , at CARDINAL point , passed on confidential information that the applicant had been depressed owing to the serious illness and death of a close relative . This information was later abused by a chief physician who had stated during a meeting on personnel policy matters that he considered the applicant mentally ill . The hospital Director later expressed regret about this occurrence , noting that the applicant had not requested any evaluation of his medical state at the said meeting . In this connection , ORG stated :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] argues that the chief physician of LAW responded to his criticism of the conditions on the LOC by asserting that he was mentally ill . Statements of this kind DATE if it is correct that this was said DATE may result in liability for the employer under section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL , first paragraph , of LAW , although it may rightly be questioned whether it was reasonable to expect the senior consultant to respond in such a manner \u2026 However , ORG can not see that [ the applicant ] has been able to ORG establish as probable that this particular isolated incident , which was only touched upon during the submission of evidence before ORG , has caused him any financial loss . As regards compensation for any non - pecuniary damage , ORG notes that such a claim must be brought against the person who has caused the damage , i.e. the chief physician . It is accordingly unnecessary for the ORG to go more closely into the procedural provisions laid down in section CARDINAL A of LAW . \u201d", "ORG , which heard the case anew , sat with CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL \u201c lay \u201d judges particularly qualified to handle labour disputes , CARDINAL representing the employer \u2019s side and another the employee \u2019s side . Normally there shall be CARDINAL such \u201c lay \u201d judges DATE from each side \u2013 outnumbering the professional judges , unless the parties agree only to have CARDINAL , like in the present case . The hearing before ORG lasted for DATE during which a total of CARDINAL witnesses were heard ( of whom CARDINAL were heard for the first time in the case ) .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the applicant leave to appeal under LAW ) no . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( tvistem\u00e5lsloven ) . It observed that the appeal could not be upheld without ORG departing form ORG judgment on a point where it was essential for the latter to hear evidence from the parties and witnesses or to carry out investigative measures , which it was not open to ORG to do ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
