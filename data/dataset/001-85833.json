The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE . On crossing the border , he omitted to report a certain sum of cash in his customs declaration and the customs office seized his money . The applicant appealed to a court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE set aside the seizure order and ordered the ORG to repay the applicant the equivalent in NORP roubles of the MONEY ( ORG ) seized . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant 's request ORG amended the operative part of the judgment on DATE and ordered the ORG to pay CARDINAL into the applicant 's bank account in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a writ of execution and sent it to the bailiffs ' service in GPE . On DATE the GPE bailiffs sent the writ back to GPE , for reasons which are unclear .", "CARDINAL . After the judgment in his favour had remained unenforced for DATE , the applicant complained to the ORG ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered judgment in the above case . It noted the ORG 's acknowledgment that the writ of execution had been lost in the process of being transferred from the GPE bailiffs to the GPE office . However , in the ORG 's view , the logistical difficulties experienced by the ORG enforcement services could not serve as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt ; the applicant 's complaints concerning the non - enforcement of the judgment should have prompted the competent authorities to investigate the matter and to ensure that the enforcement proceedings were brought to a successful conclusion . The ORG found a violation of the applicant 's \u201c right to a court \u201d under LAW and of his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions LAW CARDINAL ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG granted the applicant 's claim for the interest on the judgment debt . It rejected , however , the claim for the outstanding amount on the ground that \u201c the ORG 's obligation to enforce the judgment at issue ha[d ] not been yet extinguished and the applicant [ was ] still entitled to recover this amount in the domestic enforcement proceedings \u201d ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) . It also made awards in respect of nonpecuniary damage and costs and expenses ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , a duplicate of the writ was issued and presented to ORG for enforcement .", "CARDINAL . In its observations on the applicant 's claim ( see below ) , ORG mentioned that on DATE payment of the outstanding amount into the applicant 's account in GPE had been authorised .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that it would not enforce the judgment because ORG decision of DATE had misspelled CARDINAL letter in his patronymic name and because the writ of execution had incorrectly designated the debtor as the \u201c Chief ORG of the ORG \u201d ( the correct name of the entity does not contain the word \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG corrected the spelling mistake in the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sum of USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL was credited to the applicant 's bank account in GPE . An amount of DATE was withheld by the ORG - owned bank ORG as commission for the wire transfer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil claim against the GPE bailiffs , ORG and ORG . He sought compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage allegedly incurred as a result of the unlawful actions of the bailiffs and the continued failure to enforce the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE found that the GPE bailiffs had acted unlawfully in that they had never instituted enforcement proceedings and had had no legal grounds for sending the writ back to GPE . However , it refused the claim for damages , finding that the applicant had not incurred any pecuniary damage as a result of the non - enforcement of the judgment of DATE . As to nonpecuniary damage , NORP law did not provide for compensation in situations such as the applicant 's .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant , reproducing verbatim the text of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an application for supervisory review . On DATE the Presidium of ORG granted his application , quashed the judgments of DATE and DATE in part and remitted the claim for damages for fresh examination by ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG listed CARDINAL hearings which were subsequently adjourned for various reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a new judgment . It rejected the applicant 's claim in respect of pecuniary damage on the ground that no admissible evidence had been produced in support of it . It accepted the claim for non - pecuniary damage in part , finding as follows :", "\u201c ... the court takes into account the fact that the ORG judgment of DATE found the [ GPE ] bailiffs ' actions to have been unlawful , and the fact that enforcement of the judgment was protracted and did not actually occur until DATE . This was not disputed by the parties .", "The court therefore finds that there has been a violation of the claimant 's right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time on account of an unlawful delay in the enforcement of a judicial decision , which implies that just compensation must be paid to the individual who sustained damage as a result .", "and the physical and mental suffering caused to the claimant on account of the belated enforcement of the judgment , and also the fact that the claimant is a pensioner and [ has the title ] ' Honoured Coach of GPE ' , the court considers it necessary to award him MONEY as compensation for non - pecuniary damage , to be paid by ORG .", "The court finds no grounds to award a larger amount of compensation as the claimant did not produce evidence showing that the defendants had caused him physical or mental suffering of an irreversible nature ... \u201d", "ORG further rejected the applicant 's claim for legal costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal , reproducing verbatim ORG reasoning .", "CARDINAL . A court may hold the tortfeasor liable for non - pecuniary damage caused to an individual by actions impairing his or her personal nonproperty rights or affecting other intangible assets belonging to him or her ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the infringement of an individual 's property rights is recoverable only in the cases provided for by law ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for non - pecuniary damage is payable irrespective of the tortfeasor 's fault if damage was caused to an individual 's life or health as a result of unlawful criminal prosecution or dissemination of untrue information , and in the other cases provided for by law ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG found that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was compatible with LAW in so far as it made ORG liability for damage caused by the administration of justice subject to special conditions . Nevertheless , it stated explicitly that the term \u201c administration of justice \u201d did not cover the judicial proceedings in their entirety but extended only to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case . Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature DATE fell outside the scope of the notion of \u201c administration of justice \u201d . State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act , such as a breach of the reasonable - time requirement in relation to court proceedings , could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction against a judge , if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings . ORG emphasised , however , that the constitutional right to compensation from the ORG for the damage caused should not be bound up with the individual fault of the judge concerned . An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred as a result of the violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . ORG held that ORG should legislate on the grounds for and procedure governing ORG compensation for damage caused by unlawful acts or failures to act of a court or a judge , and should determine territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction in respect of such claims ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
