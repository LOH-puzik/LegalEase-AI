She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant married an NORP national in GPE . Subsequently they moved to GPE . In DATE their son was born .", "On DATE the applicant and her former husband agreed that they would \u201c seek to have clarified further rights , like alimony and pension rights , by their lawyers according to NORP law \u201d .", "By a decision of ORG of DATE , on her former husband \u2019s request , the applicant was divorced . The court found that , on the basis of NORP law \u2013 the law applicable to the facts of the present case \u2013 the petition was well - founded . At that time , no motion for a compensation of pension rights had been lodged .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for subsequent compensation of pension rights ( nachtr\u00e4gliche ORG ) . It found that , on account of the fact that both parties were of NORP nationality , section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of ORG between ORG and the GPE ( Niederlassungsabkommen , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the Agreement \u201d , see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below ) excluded the application of section QUANTITY sentence of LAW to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law and practice \u201d below , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the LAW \u201d ) DATE which alone could be the basis for compensation of pension rights . It pointed out that the Agreement intended to attribute all the consequences of a divorce and the divorce itself to the law of the parties\u2019 common nationality . It also held that the fact that under NORP law compensation of pension rights was not known did not violate the NORP ordre public .", "On DATE ORG confirmed this decision . It also found that LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the Agreement clearly excluded the application of section QUANTITY sentence of LAW . It pointed out that pension rights adjustment had only been established in DATE and was not known in many countries . It also found that the applicant \u2019s and her former husband \u2019s statement , namely that they would seek to have clarified by their lawyers their further rights , such as alimony and pension rights , irrespective of the question whether it qualified as choice of law , in any event lacked the required notarial certification .", "On DATE ORG dismissed a further appeal by the applicant . It also found that , given the apparent absence of a choice of law by the parties and the lack of a violation of the NORP ordre public , the Agreement excluded the application of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL second sentence of LAW . On DATE ORG dismissed her appeal that she had been denied a fair hearing .", "On DATE , without stating further reasons , ORG refused to hear the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "The balancing of pension rights acquired by CARDINAL partner in the course of the marriage has been introduced into NORP law in DATE ( in the states ( ORG ) of the Former GPE it has been introduced in DATE ) . This comprehensive balancing of all private and public pension entitlements between spouses is aimed at protecting the \u201c weaker \u201d partner , in particular women who often did not work at all . It is related to both , family law and social law .", "Apart from NORP law only NORP law has a compensation of pension rights in the sense of a comprehensive balancing of pensions . Other forms of social safeguards on divorce , existing in some other countries , only in parts can be compared to the compensation of pension rights in NORP law .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to the NORP Civil Code provides that rules in international conventions , in so far as they have become directly applicable in national law , take precedence over the LAW .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW lays down that a provision of the law of another country shall not be applied where its application would lead to a result which is manifestly incompatible with the fundamental principles of NORP law . A violation of this ordre public reservation has been found in some cases concerning the application of sharia law , namely in a case concerning polygamy . It is applied very restrictively .", "According to section DATE first sentence of LAW a choice of law concerning the general effects of marriage must be notarially certified .", "Under NORP conflict of laws rules , compensation of pension rights is , in general , governed by the law applicable to the general effects of marriage ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL first sentence of LAW ) . This , primarily , is the law of the country of shared nationality of the spouses ( section LAW ) . It shall only be carried out if NORP law is applicable and if such balancing is recognised by the law of CARDINAL of the countries of which the spouses were nationals at the time when the divorce petition was served .", "Pursuant to section QUANTITY sentence of LAW it can exceptionally be carried out , even if the conditions of the first sentence are not given , provided that ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL spouse applies for it , ( CARDINAL ) the other spouse has acquired an inland pension right during the subsistence of the marriage and ( CARDINAL ) in so far as carrying it out would not be inconsistent with equity in light of mutual economic circumstances of the parties during the time spent in the country ( known as \u201c irregular pension rights adjustment \u201d ) .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG provides that in respect of personal , family and inheritance issues the law of the common nationality of the parties is applicable .
