The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently serving a DATE prison sentence for armed robbery of PERSON , murder of PERSON and for attempted murder of a policeman during his arrest . He was convicted in DATE ( the conviction was amended in DATE ) and began serving his sentence in penal colony ORG IK-CARDINAL , and then in GPE FBU IK-CARDINAL and FBU IK-CARDINAL , all situated in the NORP LOC .", "CARDINAL . In the LOC colonies the applicant was diagnosed with several chronic diseases . However , there is no evidence that his finger or toenails were affected by a fungal infection at that time . It appears that in DATE he was also seen by colony doctors in connection with dermatitis and eczema . Otherwise , the materials of the case file indicate that the applicant \u2019s state of health was satisfactory , he exercised regularly \u2013 mostly doing weightlifting DATE and , as can be seen from the applicant \u2019s photos taken in DATE , he was very muscular and must have been a physically strong man ( he weighed QUANTITY and was QUANTITY tall ) .", "CARDINAL . The administration of the colonies where the applicant was detained during that period characterised the applicant rather positively as belonging to a group of convicts loyal to the administration . Some time after his transfer to colony ORG IK-CARDINAL he informed the administration of a conflict between him and several other convicts , who allegedly belonged to a gang . An internal inquiry carried out in DATE concluded that the applicant was simulating conflicts with his co - detainees in order to get a transfer to another colony , closer to GPE . However , the administration later changed its opinion and recommended that the applicant be transferred for security reasons . As a result , in DATE the applicant was transferred to FBU IK-CARDINAL , a penal colony situated in the town of GPE .", "CARDINAL . As can be seen from the applicant \u2019s disciplinary file , during DATE of his detention in FBU IK-CARDINAL his behaviour and attitude were considered by the administration of the colony as \u201c positive \u201d . He was attributed to the category of \u201c loyal \u201d convicts and obtained various disciplinary bonuses ( such as additional family visits ) . He was on good terms with most of his co - detainees . At the same time , he had a conflict with some of the hardened criminals . In DATE he was temporarily placed , for his own safety and based on a reasoned decision of the colony administration , in the PERSON ( the punishment and isolation unit ) , which was also occasionally used as a \u201c safe place \u201d in such situations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that soon after his transfer to the Plavsk colony he had learnt of the existence of an informal group of loyal convicts which helped the colony administration . That group ( which the applicant called \u201c the death squad \u201d ) was composed solely of ethnic NORP . Their role was to threaten , beat or kill those convicts who opposed the colony administration , or those who had influential enemies outside the colony or refused to pay money to the administration . CARDINAL of the cells in the colony ( no . CARDINAL ) was turned into a torture room and was used by the members of the group to \u201c break down \u201d those convicts who resisted the administration .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the group was responsible for CARDINAL deaths which had occurred in the colony DATE the death of PERSON . in DATE , and that of Mr Kl . in DATE . Both convicts were found asphyxiated on the premises of the PERSON ; officially both deaths were characterised as suicides , although in respect of Mr Kl . an investigation into an alleged \u201c forced suicide \u201d was opened and then suspended for want of a suspect . In DATE the case of Mr Kl . was reopened because of the failure of the investigator to establish the origin of the injuries found on the body of the deceased that did not fit with the scenario of suicide .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , some time after his transfer to the Plavsk colony CARDINAL of the officers of the colony proposed that he join the \u201c death squad \u201d . Out of fear of reprisals , the applicant had agreed . He started his \u201c apprenticeship \u201d under the guidance of several colony officials and other convicts . However , DATE after joining the \u201c death squad \u201d he understood that he might be required to do terrible things . In addition , the colony administration realised that he was of NORP origin . His relations with the supervising officers and other loyal convicts deteriorated . The applicant decided to quit and try to obtain a transfer to another colony . Having learnt of his intention to quit , the colony administration decided to punish him for refusing to cooperate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon his arrival at the Plavsk colony ( hereinafter \u201c the colony \u201d ) , the applicant underwent a medical check - up which revealed several chronic diseases , in particular , kidney diseases ( such as nephrolithiasis , urolithiasis , and nephroptosis ) .", "CARDINAL . It is unclear whether the applicant was suffering from a fungal infection ( mycosis ) at that time . According to the transcript of the applicant \u2019s medical record made on DATE by ORG of ORG , before DATE the applicant did not suffer from mycosis . It can be seen from an extract from the applicant \u2019s medical file ( to the extent that it is legible ) that the applicant underwent a check - up on DATE . His overall state of health was recorded in the report as \u201c satisfactory \u201d . The record did not contain any mention of an injury or abnormality on his hands or feet .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , a certificate issued by the chief doctor of the colony , Dr Pr . , indicated that the applicant had a fungal infection on his feet . That certificate had no date on it ; an authentic copy was dated \u201c CARDINAL DATE \u201d . Another certificate issued by PERSON . and dated CARDINAL DATE specified that on DATE of his arrival to the colony the applicant had been offered hospitalisation , but he had refused . The applicant \u2019s medical notes apparently also contained the following handwritten entry dated DATE : \u201c foot mycosis \u201d . The applicant asserted that those entries had been added to his medical file much later , in DATE , and that the certificates issued by PERSON . had been backdated and did not reflect his real condition at that time .", "CARDINAL . From the documents submitted by the Government it appears that on CARDINAL DATE the applicant underwent another medical check - up . The extract of the record of DATE , to the extent that it is legible , does not mention any injury or abnormality on the applicant \u2019s hands or feet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in the PERSON . According to the Government , it was done at the applicant \u2019s own oral request , because of a conflict with other convicts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was subjected to a body search , during which Mr Sch . and Mr Dm . ( warders ) , Mr GPE . , Mr Vr . ( convicts ) , and several other convicts , whose names the applicant did not know , insulted him . In the applicant \u2019s words , they were trying to provoke a fight . Colony officers hit him several times with a rubber truncheon .", "CARDINAL . After that he was taken to cell no . CARDINAL in the GPE . Several colony officials gathered in that cell : the acting head of the colony , PERSON . , and CARDINAL colony officials , Mr Kzh . , and PERSON . , an officer from the prison security department . They handcuffed the applicant to a bench and started to beat him severely with a wooden stick wrapped in cloth . They also used a gas mask to induce suffocation . He lost consciousness several times . Other colony officials were also present during the beatings , including PERSON . and PERSON . Some time later other people arrived : the deputy head of the colony , Mr PERSON . , another officer from the prison security department , Mr. PERSON . , the personnel officer , Mr Vl . , the chief doctor , PERSON . , and PERSON Yud . The chief doctor checked his pulse and eyes several times to see whether the applicant was conscious . PERSON . and Mr PERSON . personally took part in the beatings . The applicant presented a very detailed account of what they were doing and saying . After a heavy blow to the head the applicant passed out .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicant found himself in cell no . CARDINAL . Mr PERSON . and PERSON . , PERSON . , PERSON . ( convicts ) and some other convicts arrived bringing with them a wooden tool resembling a clamp and some other tools . The applicant \u2019s hands were fixed in the clamp and his feet were tied to the legs of the stool . They put a gas mask on him and started to insert needles under his nails and then began tearing his nails away with the pincers : first his toenails , then his fingernails . The applicant described in detail where he had been sitting , and how he had been tied up . At a certain point the applicant started to vomit and passed out . Mr Vb . and Mr GPE . then gave him an injection and ordered him to wipe his blood off the floor with a rug . While doing that he managed to collect and hide some of his finger and toenails .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was beaten again . He gave the names of people who had beaten him ( Mr Sh . , PERSON . , PERSON . , PERSON . , and PERSON PERSON . ) . He spent TIME naked and handcuffed in a seated position by an open window .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant saw PERSON . and PERSON . They returned his clothes to him and gave him an injection . As the applicant understood from their dialogue , the injection was supposed to make the bruises disappear . In the evening he was allowed to call his wife , but was ordered not to tell her anything about what had happened to him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that for DATE after that episode he did not take any outdoor exercise , since he had been afraid of being attacked by other convicts loyal to the administration of the colony in the areas of the exercise yard not covered by the video surveillance cameras .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a family visit , the applicant managed to pass CARDINAL of his nails to his mother . According to the applicant , he concealed the nails by sticking them to his body with tape . The applicant \u2019s mother saw numerous bruises on his body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife formally complained to ORG that her husband had been tortured . She sought to initiate criminal proceedings against the colony officials involved in the alleged torture . To her request she attached a hand - written statement by the applicant dated CARDINAL DATE in which he had described the ill - treatment and had identified colony officers and convicts involved in it . On DATE her complaint was forwarded to ORG , with a cover letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complaint was allocated to investigator PERSON . of ORG . At TIME he decided to open a preliminary inquiry into those events .", "CARDINAL . Having arrived to the colony the investigator questioned the applicant , who confirmed his earlier account , and CARDINAL colony officials , who unanimously denied the applicant \u2019s allegations . Later on DATE the applicant underwent a medical check - up by a doctor , a trauma surgeon . Having visually examined the applicant \u2019s hands and feet the doctor concluded that the applicant \u201c did not have any traumatic injuries or post - traumatic changes to his finger or toenails \u201d , but that his finger and toenails had been \u201c deformed \u201d by fungal infection ( \u201c onychomycosis \u201d , or \u201c ringworm of the nail \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the colony was visited by a delegation of the Commission on ORG . The head of the delegation had a private conversation with the applicant himself and the colony administration officials and concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations were lies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator visually examined cell no . CARDINAL . The investigator did not find any traces of blood or other evidence to confirm the applicant \u2019s account . The examination took place in the presence of several colony officials , namely PERSON . , Mr DATE . , PERSON . , and PERSON . In the record of the examination the applicant made a handwritten remark to the effect that he had felt intimidated by the presence of the colony officials during the examination . After the examination the applicant gave the investigator one of the nails which he had kept .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned CARDINAL other colony officers and convicts and recorded their written explanations . The witnesses had been informed of their right not to testify against themselves or against their close relatives . However , they had not been warned about criminal liability for perjury . They all denied any ill - treatment of the applicant ; they also denied having heard of it , or having seen any traces of ill - treatment on the applicant . Written statements obtained from many of those witnesses were similar in their language , structure and content . It appears that none of them was questioned in detail about their contact with the applicant DATE , or about their whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . Among other witnesses , the investigator obtained explanations from PERSON . While describing the applicant \u2019s health condition at the time of his arrival at the colony in DATE PERSON . mentioned eczema and dermatitis on the hands and feet , but no fungal infection . He also testified that the applicant had not complained of any health problems before DATE . None of the convicts questioned by the investigator mentioned any abnormalities on the applicant \u2019s hands or toes before the events complained of .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned CARDINAL examinations of the applicant , a medical CARDINAL and a psychological CARDINAL , and formulated a number of questions for the experts to answer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting head of ORG for the Execution of Sentences decided not to proceed with the internal disciplinary inquiry for want of evidence of any abuse of power on the part of the colony officials . It was established , inter alia , that on DATE the applicant had been placed in the PERSON \u201c at his own oral request \u201d , because of a conflict with other convicts . The decision to close the inquiry did not contain any reference to the injuries found on his body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to cell no . CARDINAL in the PERSON . According to him , it was freshly painted , not ventilated and very cold DATE the applicant had to put all of his clothes on . In the cell the applicant was constantly under videosurveillance , even when using the toilet , which had no partition . In that cell the applicant met with a journalist , in the presence of several colony officials ( including those allegedly involved in the beatings ) . He confirmed to the journalist his account of the events and demonstrated his hands without nails . He also tried to give the journalist a sample of his saliva , asking him to give it to an expert for examination , but the colony officials present at the meeting opposed to it , so the journalist did not take the sample . The journalist later testified that he had smelt the odour of fresh paint in the cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned the applicant again . The applicant confirmed his account . In addition , in his written comments added to the record of his questioning he complained that the investigator in charge of the case had refused to investigate the case thoroughly , that he had discouraged the applicant from pursuing the case , and warned that it would not bring the applicant anything but trouble , that he might be killed , that the colony officials had friends everywhere , in particular in the prosecutor \u2019s office , and so on . The applicant indicated that on DATE he had met with CARDINAL of the colony officials involved in the torture and had seen in their hands copies of the official materials of the inquiry . They had allegedly told him that the investigator , PERSON . , had been helping them to conceal the evidence of the crime , and that he had been well paid by them to do so .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigator obtained a copy of the video footage from the surveillance cameras on the LOC of the PERSON . Copies of the video surveillance recordings were submitted to him by Mr Kzh . Having watched the recordings , the investigator drew up a report stating that no beatings could be seen on them . It was not specified what time period and what area of the LOC premises those recordings covered , or what they showed exactly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned an expert examination from ORG . The investigator sought to establish whether the applicant suffered from any skin condition affecting the nails .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s relatives hired a lawyer , Mr St. , to represent the applicant \u2019s interests in that case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE CARDINAL doctors from ORG examined the applicant . After a visual examination of his hands and feet they concluded that the applicant suffered from \u201c onychomycosis of the finger and toenails \u201d . The report had a postscript indicating that the applicant had been diagnosed with mycosis in DATE , when he had arrived at the colony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a visual examination by PERSON from ORG confirmed that the applicant did not have any fingernails , but that this was related to a fungal infection . The examination also revealed traces of beatings ( caused by CARDINAL blows to different parts of his body , including the shoulders , chest , belly and hips ) , received CARDINAL prior to the examination . The expert considered that all those blows had been to parts of the body \u201c accessible to the applicant \u2019s own hand \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the colony administration organised a press conference on the premises of the colony . The applicant was afforded an opportunity to answer the journalists\u2019 questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to his lawyer expressing his wish to provide a sample of his saliva on a cotton ball in the event that the nails he had given to his mother were examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychological expert examination of the applicant was carried out on the premises of the colony . It did not reveal any significant details . The doctors were unable to conclude whether or not the applicant was prone to self - harm or to fantasising . The doctors recommended conducting an additional psychological examination of the applicant in a hospital .", "CARDINAL . Several \u201c psychological profiles \u201d of the applicant were obtained from the administration of the GPE and prisons where he had been detained before . They described the applicant as mentally stable , self - confident , a religious person , obedient to the prison rules , and not belonging to any criminal gang within the colony . A psychological profile drawn up by the staff of the NORP colony was quite different ; the applicant was described as a skilful , ambitious , arrogant and egotistical person , who liked to dominate others and to \u201c show off \u201d . The investigator also obtained personal characteristics and a disciplinary record of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned the relatives of the applicant , who had seen him shortly after the described events . The investigator also obtained one of the applicant \u2019s nails from his relatives . The applicant \u2019s relatives described the state in which they had found the applicant on DATE and the circumstances in which they had received the nails from him . In particular , PERSON . , the applicant \u2019s sister , testified that she had visited him in the colony together with their mother . According to her , when the applicant had entered the meeting room , he had been fully dressed and was wearing outdoor clothes . He had explained to her that it had been very cold in the cell . Then he had described to her and their mother what had happened to him over DATE and had given them the nails . She had seen shreds of skin on the nails and traces of needles on them . According to her , at that moment the applicant \u2019s hands had been so damaged that he had been unable to wash himself and had had to ask his mother to help him with that . It had taken him DATE to write his first description of the events . When he had taken off his shoes his socks had been stained with blood and traces of injections had been visible on his arms and legs . She had also seen yellowish bruises on his body ; the applicant had been very pale and weak . The applicant \u2019s mother gave evidence in similar terms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer wrote to the investigator , asking him to organise for an expert in mycology to examine the applicant , to take samples of his blood , skin and scrapes from the nail beds to examine whether they contained traces of a fungal infection , to establish whether the nails in the possession of the applicant \u2019s relatives did indeed belong to the applicant , and to examine whether or not the applicant had had a brain concussion . The investigator replied to the applicant \u2019s lawyer that since no criminal investigation had been opened , the alleged \u201c victim \u201d had no right to request such investigative actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator decided not to open an investigation on the ground that there was no indication that a crime had been committed . The testimony of the applicant and his relatives was not , in the investigator \u2019s opinion , credible . The investigator held that the applicant \u2019s allegations were not confirmed by other evidence collected during the inquiry , namely the answers of the colony officers and convicts , the video recordings , and the results of the forensic examinations which had concluded that his fingernails had been affected by a fungal infection and that all the bruises on his body had been located in places accessible to the applicant \u2019s own hand .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s lawyer , Mr GPE , commissioned an expert examination of the fingernails he had received from the applicant \u2019s relatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE concluded that the fingernails they had been given had not been affected by a fungal infection . On DATE the applicant sent his lawyer samples of his saliva on a cotton ball for genetic examination . The lawyer sent that sample together with CARDINAL fingernail to an expert .", "DATE . On DATE an expert from ORG \u201c ORG \u201d concluded , on the basis of the DNA analysis of the samples of saliva provided by the applicant and the nails submitted by the applicant \u2019s mother , that the fingernail had belonged to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE experts from a private forensic laboratory \u201c Granat \u201d answered the questions put by the applicant \u2019s representative . They concluded that the fingernails had been extracted with the help of a blunt and hard tool , from a living person with blood type A II .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the colony governor asking him to allow the expert to visit the colony and examine him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his lawyer , concluded an agreement with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical expert from that ORG , PERSON , visited the applicant in the colony . She examined the applicant and discovered several long scars , mostly on the right side of his body . His fingernails were CARDINAL of the normal size ; his toenails were CARDINAL of the normal size , and very thin . The expert did not detect any visual signs of a fungal infection , but established that the applicant \u2019s fingertips and toes had been injured and then infected . She concluded that the applicant had lost finger and toenails by \u201c traumatic extraction \u201d , which had happened within a short period of time . She took samples of his blood , urine , and subungual matter . A visual inspection showed the presence of blood in the urine ; the expert concluded that it was the result of kidney damage . She also concluded that the applicant had had a traumatic head injury , high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels . The colony officials took part in the taking of samples and signed , inter alia , the blood collection record .", "CARDINAL . When PERSON was about to leave , the colony administration stopped her , referring to the absence of authorisation from the investigator , and ordered her to destroy the samples . According to her , the colony officers offered her money if she agreed to sign a statement that she had never examined the applicant and had never been in the colony . When she refused , the colony officers threatened to plant prohibited goods in her bag if she insisted on taking the samples back . She was held on the colony administration premises until she agreed to give or destroy the samples she had collected . Thus , she had to tear up the written record of the sample collection which contained the applicant \u2019s blood samples , but she kept the shreds of it with the signatures of the colony officials , so she managed to examine them later in the ORG \u2019s laboratory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Kzh . , who had seized the samples from Ms M. , wrote a report explaining the circumstances of PERSON visit . He explained that the samples had been seized from her because her participation in the expert examination had not been approved by investigator PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE sent the applicant a written reply to his questions . The letter indicated that a diagnosis of mycosis could be confirmed only following a microscopic examination for the presence of fungi . A fungal infection may affect all nails on the hands and feet , and is very often provoked by a trauma , and not by the fungi . Long - term mycosis may result in the infection spreading to other parts of the body , especially to the soles of the feet and the groin , but can also remain located in the nail area . The letter excluded that nail mycosis could disappear by itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote a report to her superior , describing the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a report in which it concluded that the blood on the fingernails and the blood on the \u201c shreds \u201d of the record belonged to the same person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) sent a letter to ORG concerning a criminal investigation in an unrelated case . That case involved several lawyers who worked together with Mr St. , the applicant \u2019s lawyer . It appears from that letter that the ORG obtained information from the telephone operating company about the telephone calls of Mr St. , their time and duration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered ORG to conduct an additional inquiry . It ordered it , in particular , to question the warders in detail , to establish the identity of some other persons involved in the alleged torture and question them , to search cell no . CARDINAL ( the \u201c torture room \u201d ) , to assess the applicant \u2019s psychiatric condition , to examine other allegations of ill - treatment in the colony in respect of other convicts referred to by the applicant , to establish the cause of the injuries found on the applicant \u2019s body , and to question him again . ORG indicated , in particular , that the list of investigative actions to be taken was not exhaustive and that", "CARDINAL . The case was again entrusted to investigator PERSON . of ORG . Investigator PERSON . added information concerning the death of the convict PERSON . to the case - file materials . He also added materials in respect of Mr DATE . \u2013 the investigation in that case was pending and the main suspicion at that time was that Mr Kl . had died as a result of a \u201c forced suicide \u201d . It can be seen from the decision of DATE concerning the investigation in the case of Mr Kl . that he had been beaten before his death , whereas the death itself had been caused by asphyxiation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE investigator PERSON . questioned CARDINAL people \u2013 colony officials and convicts . The investigator concluded from the written explanations obtained from them that the applicant had not been ill - treated . The wording of their testimony was identical in some places .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator visited the colony and examined cell no . CARDINAL . He did not find any visible traces of blood on the floor . He also continued to question the colony officials and convicts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned the doctors of ORG who had examined the applicant earlier . The doctors confirmed that the applicant \u2019s finger and toenails had been deformed by a fungal infection . The wording of their testimony was identical in some places .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned an expert examination of the CARDINAL fingernails he had earlier received from the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical examination was completed . Although some of the pages from the examination report in the ORG \u2019s possession are missing , it appears that the experts concluded that the blood on the fingernails was of the same group as the applicant \u2019s blood . Furthermore , they did not find any traces of \u201c mechanical extraction \u201d on the \u201c outer edges \u201d of the fingernails , but did not exclude the \u201c traumatic \u201d origin of their removal due to the shape of the \u201c inner edges \u201d of the nails .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Chief Investigator of the LOC gave formal instructions to the investigator in charge of the inquiry about further investigative actions to be taken . In particular , the investigator was ordered to carry out an additional expert examination of cell no . CARDINAL with the use of special techniques , to carry out a medical examination of the applicant in order to establish whether he was indeed suffering from a fungal infection , and to clarify contradictions in the statements of some witnesses .", "DATE . On DATE the investigator examined cells nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , and CARDINAL in the colony with the use of an ultraviolet lamp . No traces of blood were found there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned ORG to carry out a second medical examination of the applicant . On DATE the ORG refused to conduct the examination requested with reference to its earlier findings to which they had nothing to add in the absence of any new facts or materials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator ordered an examination of the fingernails received from the applicant and his relatives . The expert from ORG concluded that CARDINAL of the nails ( received by the investigator from the applicant himself ) did have traces of fungal infection , whereas the other ( received from the applicant \u2019s wife ) did not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator tried to question the applicant , but the applicant refused . The applicant told the investigator that he would give evidence only if a criminal case was opened , and only in the capacity of the injured party and in the presence of his lawyer . The applicant also refused to be questioned with a polygraph .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator requested an additional expert examination of the applicant \u2019s case by ORG . However , on DATE the head of ORG refused to conduct the examination since the questions put by the investigator were the same as those addressed in the report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned CARDINAL colony officials , allegedly involved in the torture . They denied any ill - treatment ; their testimony was identical in some places .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to another colony in GPE , FBU IK-CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned CARDINAL convicts , Mr Abr . and PERSON . Those convicts had been detained in the PERSON at the time of the events at issue , next to the cell where the applicant had allegedly been ill - treated . According to the written text of their testimony , both convicts had not heard any screams or other sounds and had not seen the applicant . The type - written text of their testimony contained a handwritten note by the investigator stating that both witnesses had refused to sign it .", "DATE . On DATE the investigator decided to test the credibility of the witnesses with a polygraph . The applicant refused to undergo the test without having obtained the opinion of his lawyer . CARDINAL of the officers of the colony underwent the test . They denied any involvement in the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator decided not to initiate a criminal investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations . In support of his decision the investigator referred mainly to the testimony of the colony officials , who had denied any ill - treatment . Their major argument was that if the applicant had been beaten or ill - treated , other convicts would have learnt of it , and that would represent a serious security issue , maybe even cause a riot . They all claimed that nobody had heard the noise of beatings or screams . The convicts questioned by the investigator testified that they had not heard the screams , neither had they seen traces of torture or beatings on the applicant . The investigator also referred to the testimony of the doctors who had examined the applicant as part of the official inquiry and who had confirmed their findings that the applicant had suffered from a fungal infection which could lead to the \u201c deformation of , or damage to the nails \u201d . They had also not detected any signs of the forceful extraction of the nails . The investigator considered that the expert examinations carried out by PERSON and by PERSON , hired by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , were unreliable , since they had been conducted \u201c by inappropriate persons using extra - procedural methods \u201d . The investigator also summarised the applicant \u2019s medical history . That summary states that the fungal infection was not detected before the examination of the applicant on DATE . The investigator concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations were untrue and refuted by other evidence obtained in the course of the previous inquiries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Donskoy Town Prosecutor quashed the decision of the investigator and ordered him to continue the inquiry . On DATE the Deputy Chief Investigator of ORG also ordered the investigator to continue the inquiry . In particular , he ordered him to question the applicant in the presence of his lawyer , to carry out investigative actions specified in the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and to assess the conclusions of expert PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer .
