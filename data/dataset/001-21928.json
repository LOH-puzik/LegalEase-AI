{"ITEMID": "001-21928", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "CALISKAN v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Efraym Caliskan , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of introduction of the application , he was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , following the apprehension of the NORP leader PERSON by the NORP authorities , a protest demonstration took place in GPE in the course of which protesters occupied the residence of the NORP Ambassador and members of the Ambassador 's household were prevented from leaving the LOC . On DATE , the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of having been involved in the events in the residence of the NORP Ambassador .", "The applicant was released from custody on DATE after having been served with an indictment to stand trial on charges in relation to the events in the NORP Ambassador 's residence . On DATE , he was handed over to the aliens ' police ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) . He was subsequently placed in aliens ' detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) .", "At some unspecified point in time , the applicant applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . This request was rejected by the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) at an unspecified point in time . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) against the ORG Secretary 's refusal of his request for asylum . As the applicant had been placed in aliens ' detention he was not required , like asylum seekers not placed in such detention , first to file an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the ORG Secretary of ORG before filing an appeal with ORG . The applicant further requested ORG for an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings .", "In a decision taken on DATE , ORG rejected an appeal filed by the applicant against his placement in alien 's detention .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second appeal with ORG against his placement in aliens ' detention .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal against the ORG Secretary 's decision to reject his request for asylum . It further rejected the applicant 's request for an injunction on his expulsion .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's second appeal against his placement in aliens ' detention . Insofar as relevant , it held :", "\u201c ORG considers at the outset that the lawfulness of the measure of placement in aliens ' detention has , as such , already been determined in its decision of DATE . The present appeal concerns the question whether , after a balancing of all interests involved , a further continuation of the placement should reasonably be considered as unjustified .", "ORG is of the opinion that it can not be said that there are no real prospects for expulsion within a reasonable time . On behalf of the < ORG Secretary > it has been submitted that the alien will be presented to the NORP < consular > authorities at short notice , given that his request for an injunction in connection with his request for entry to the GPE as a refugee or on humanitarian grounds was rejected on DATE and the appeal ... declared illfounded . ORG sees no reason to find that < the ORG Secretary > is proceeding with insufficient diligence . ORG further finds that < the ORG Secretary > , pending the alien 's presentation to the NORP authorities , can reasonably adopt the position that the alien 's placement in aliens ' detention should be maintained .", "As to the complaint of the alien 's representative that < the ORG Secretary > has given undertakings to the effect that the issue of expulsion of NORP who are being prosecuted for their alleged participation in the occupation of the NORP Ambassador 's residence in GPE will only be addressed once the criminal proceedings have come to an end , ORG considers as follows . It appears neither from the case - file nor the oral submissions in the present case that < the ORG Secretary > has made solid and legally binding undertakings as to the expulsion of persons who occupied the NORP Ambassador 's residence . Neither can such an undertaking be read into the replies given by < the ORG Secretary > to questions of members of ORG of ORG . ORG further does not perceive a need for the alien who has been placed in aliens ' detention to be allowed to remain in the GPE pending his trial . After his expulsion , the alien may apply for a visa in order to attend his trial , as has been indicated at the hearing by the representative of < GPE", "Having regard to the above , ORG considers that the appeal is illfounded . The placement in aliens ' detention will not be lifted . Having regard to Article PERSON of LAW there is no reason to award compensation . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsions of NORP nationals of NORP origin . On DATE , the applicant was released from aliens ' detention .", "On DATE , the applicant 's representative informed the ORG that the applicant , following his release on DATE , had gone to GPE for a family visit . The applicant 's representative further stated that the applicant had been apprehended , detained and expelled from GPE to GPE despite the fact that there were asylum proceedings ongoing in the GPE . According to his representative , the applicant was detained in GPE and tortured for DATE .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of public order , public policy or national security so require , the following categories of aliens may be detained :", "a. aliens whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the GPE by virtue of any of the provisions contained in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending the decision on an application for a residence permit , a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees .", "CARDINAL . An alien shall not be detained when , and detention shall be terminated as soon as , he intimates that he wishes to leave the GPE and is in fact in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph CARDINAL and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than DATE .", "... \u201d", "An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in aliens ' detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in aliens ' detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in aliens ' detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from aliens ' detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in aliens ' detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien 's interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes . Furthermore , an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected ( cf . ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in aliens ' detention and in principle a person placed in aliens ' detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in aliens ' detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG requested ORG to suspend until DATE its examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions on expulsions , filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , in view of a recent report of CARDINAL such asylum seeker having encountered serious problems after his expulsion to GPE . As the veracity of this report was not certain , the Minister of ORG had been requested to investigate the matter and to submit his findings as to the origin , background and veracity of the report before DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that the results of an investigation into the facts on the basis of which the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin had been temporarily suspended had led to the lifting of that suspension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
