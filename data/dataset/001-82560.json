NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention and domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He has worked inter alia as a kindergarten assistant for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has CARDINAL sons L. and A. ( born respectively on DATE and DATE ) with PERSON , a NORP national , with whom he entered into a relationship in CARDINAL/CARDINAL and cohabited from DATE until DATE . In DATE ( before A. was born ) the applicant and PERSON reached an agreement whereby he had certain access rights to L.", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE he has cohabited with PERSON and her adolescent son .", "CARDINAL . A dispute arose as to the applicant 's access to PERSON On DATE reported him to the police for allegedly having sexually abused PERSON She based her allegations on statements made by PERSON mother gave statements to the police and PERSON was interviewed by a judge without anything significant emerging in the case . In DATE ORG discontinued the investigation , which decision ORG confirmed on appeal in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought judicial proceedings before ORG ( byrett ) , claiming a right of access to his CARDINAL sons ( sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . On DATE ORG refused a request by PERSON to have an expert witness appointed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG granted the applicant access DATE and for CARDINAL of the holiday periods and devised a plan for stepping up access . To give the above immediate effect , ORG issued an interlocutory order .", "In reaching the above conclusions , ORG rejected the accusations made by the boys ' mother that the applicant had sexually abused PERSON It observed that according to PERSON there were CARDINAL occasions on which the applicant had been on his own with his son , namely in that they had been in a room with the door shut in PERSON 's apartment . In her view it was most probable that the abuse had occurred on these occasions , though she did not have concrete evidence to this effect . ORG found it excluded on the evidence before it that the applicant had sexually abused PERSON It attached decisive weight to the fact that the applicant 's access to his son had taken place each time under the supervision of CARDINAL other person and that on the CARDINAL occasions on which he and the son had been on their own in the latter 's room , it was for a very short time and in a situation where the child 's mother could have entered the room at any moment . The visits in question took place DATE for a small child - before DATE when the son had made the statements that aroused the mother 's suspicions that the applicant had sexually abused L. Finally , ORG had regard to the fact that the physiological and psychiatric examinations carried out did not support the allegation that abuse had occurred . It found that the allegation had been the result of manipulation and fabrication by the mother as part of a strategy to obstruct the applicant 's access . There was reason to assume that this had already had damaging effects on PERSON , who had stated that he did not wish to live or to be with his father . The boy had become a go - between in a conflict between adults . ORG stated that the applicant was more suitable than the mother to assume the DATE care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON 's lawyer lodged a disciplinary complaint against the judge who had heard the case before ORG for having acted with prejudice against his client in expressing distrust and treating her with disrespect during her testimony . The judge was imposed a mild reprimand by ORG , which found that there were grounds for criticising his conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against ORG judgment and interlocutory injunction to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , requesting in the main that the applicant be refused a right of access to the children . She referred inter alia to the fact that the court appointed expert considered that GPE 's strong negative attitude to his father was consistent with abuse having taken place . The applicant , denying that any abuse had occurred , requested ORG to reject her appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned ORG judgment and refused the applicant access to his CARDINAL sons , inter alia after obtaining an expert report from a court appointed psychologist , dated DATE , and hearing evidence from the latter . It also had regard to a report of DATE by a psychologist who had been counselling the boy at the mother 's initiative and the psychologist 's oral evidence to the court .", "CARDINAL . The High Court noted that from the psychologist 's report of DATE it emerged that the boy had felt great anxiety about the idea of meeting his father ( he would kill himself rather than see his father ) ; PERSON was unable to describe the reasons but his statements seemed founded on actual experience . Any access should be established gradually . Forcing the boy to have contact would be psychologically damaging .", "CARDINAL . The High Court observed that the applicant and L. met CARDINAL times in DATE , CARDINAL times in DATE , CARDINAL times in DATE and that no access had taken place during DATE ( since DATE ) . It did not consider that the mother had sabotaged access although it understood that the fact that access had to take place under supervision by her sister or her father had made it difficult for the applicant to exercise access .", "CARDINAL . The High Court 's judgment included the following reasoning :", "\u201c CARDINAL arguments have been made against the father being granted a right of access .", "Firstly , it is argued that the father has subjected [ L. ] to sexual assault . There is a complaint to the police dated DATE from which it appears that an investigation of the case was initiated . The mother made statements to the police on DATE and DATE , and there was also an interview of [ L. ] by a judge without anything of significance for the case coming to light . According to information presented , the case was dropped by the public prosecutor . This decision was appealed to ORG on DATE but the public prosecutor 's decision was not reversed . The fact that there was insufficient evidence in the criminal case is , however , not decisive in this case , see ORG ( [ PERSON ( ORG Reports)]-CARDINAL - CARDINAL . It is further assumed that in a case involving minor children , no risk whatsoever may be taken in such circumstances , also concerning the issue of access rights , see Rt \u2013 DATE - CARDINAL . In view of the information available in the case , where quite detailed descriptions have been provided of the abuse , together with [ L. ] 's strong objections to seeing his father , ORG finds that there are many elements that may indicate that abuse has occurred . ORG has nevertheless not found it necessary for its decision to go further into or take a stance on this .", "Secondly , it is contended that the implementation of access rights vis - \u00e0 - vis the father is impossible in view of the fact that [ L. ] is opposed to this . In light of the information available , the High Court assumes that [ L. ] is opposed to having access to his father , which is to be accorded weight pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . Nevertheless , the implementation of access may not , in principle , be made dependent on the child not being opposed to being with his father . This question will depend on the concrete circumstances .", "...", "According to the report , the boy is unable to describe why he has such great anxiety about meeting his father . [ Psychologist O. ] considers the information he has obtained to be an expression of the boy 's actual experiences . The report further states that if contact between the father and the boy is to be established , this must take place gradually over a longer period of time and in such a manner that [ the child welfare services ] can constantly monitor how this develops . If [ L. ] 's strong anxiety is maintained , forced contact is at present deemed to constitute a psychological assault on the boy , according to the report . [ Psychologist O. ] has given testimony before ORG , which in its essentials concords with the aforementioned report . According to [ Psychologist O. ] , [ L. ] has stated that he would not visit his father even in the presence of CARDINAL party , his mother or someone else .", "In his report , the expert states inter alia the following :", "' On the whole [ L. ] has a good level of functioning , though everything having to do with his father is an obviously vulnerable and difficult point for him . My own impression from an interview with [ L. ] accords well with what [ Psychologist O. ] has described . [ L. ] indicates with his entire being both in the interview and afterwards that this is a very uncomfortable and difficult topic . '", "The expert evaluated CARDINAL alternative resolutions for the access issue . The first alternative is an ordinary access arrangement between the father and the boys . The expert concluded that it is both impossible and indefensible to go straight to such an arrangement . He refers to the fact that [ L. ] 's aversion and emotional reactions to contact with his father are so strong that such an arrangement could not be started without strong physical coercive measures . Furthermore , he refers to the fact that [ L. ] has made serious threats about what he would do , namely take his own life . The expert also pointed to the strain this would inflict on [ L. ] and that this may jeopardise his further development . This would , in addition , inflict substantial strains on the mother . As the second alternative the expert considered a limited access arrangement , with supervision , possibly with the aim of increasing it to ordinary access . The expert pointed out that such a process may involve relatively high human ( and financial ) costs and that it would be a stressful process for [ L. ] and the rest of the family . Furthermore , it was noted that the outcome may be uncertain , since neither the mother nor [ L. ] will , at the outset , be very motivated to attaining concrete results in the form of contact with the father . The expert concluded that this is a possibility , but that it would require support by both parties and having sufficient resources in and around the family at their disposal . He also pointed out that the chances of failing abysmally would be present . The third alternative considered is no access at all between the father and the boys . To justify such a solution , the expert referred to the necessity of safeguarding the good progress the boys are making and of sparing them , especially [ L. ] , from further uncertainty and conflicts connected with the issue of access .", "The expert did not reach any unambiguous conclusion in his report , except from finding that an ordinary access arrangement appears to be quite impossible to implement . As far as the other alternatives are concerned , he has kept the options more open . In his testimony before the court and after having been present during the appeal hearing , the expert expressed the view that he strongly favours that there should be no access between the father and the boys . In addition to [ L. ] 's clearly expressed unwillingness to have access to his father , the expert referred to the difficult situation that the family and [ L. ] in particular have been in over DATE . He further referred to the fact that the mother was the sole provider for the children , and that she and the family had reached their ' limit of tolerance ' . It is also the understanding of ORG that the expert deems the costs of a supervised arrangement to be too high and the benefits to be too uncertain for the expert to have been able to recommend access under supervision as an alternative .", "ORG agrees that an ordinary access arrangement would not be an acceptable alternative , but has evaluated in particular whether an arrangement with supervised access would be possible . Like the expert , ORG has concluded that such an arrangement would be disproportionately demanding and that it presumably may be difficult to find persons with the necessary competence who are willing to subject themselves to such a time consuming process as is in question here . ORG also agrees with the expert that the strain that such a process will necessarily inflict on the family must also be considered , especially since the mother has sole care of the children . On the basis of its impressions during the hearing , ORG agrees with the expert that the ' tolerance limit ' for whatever additional strains that can be inflicted appears to have been reached . Even if neither the [ Psychologist O. ] nor the expert appears to have been able to clarify the reasons for [ L. ] 's strong objections to the decision . In view of this , there would in the view of ORG be an not unappreciable risk that the boy 's development may be directly jeopardised by having to go through such a process that is under discussion here . In addition , considerable flexibility would be required of both parties , which , on the basis of ORG impressions from the hearing , is uncertain , on the part of the mother , but especially on the part of the father .", "Despite the fact that ... , a refusal to grant access may be justified only in very special circumstances , ORG has concluded that there should be no access in this case since , on the basis of an overall assessment , this would not be in the best interest of the children . Even though the issue of access is at the outset to be considered separately with regard to each of the boys and even though it is assumed that [ A. ] does not have the same antagonistic relationship to his father as [ L. ] , the High Court finds no reason to grant access with regard to [ A. ] as well . As ORG understands the expert , it would cause unpleasant tensions within the family if CARDINAL of the children were to have access and that such an arrangement was not advisable , something with which ORG agrees . Given the strains that the family has been DATE , in ORG view , it is now important that peace prevails in this matter .", "Having reached this conclusion , ORG does not find it necessary to establish a provisional arrangement in respect of the access issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court Judgment contained the following unanimous conclusion regarding the substantive questions :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is not granted a right of access to [ L. ] , born on * , * , DATE , and [ A. ] , born on * , * , DATE . \u201c", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG judgment as a whole , asking primarily that it be quashed and in the alternative that he be granted a right of access to his children . He challenged ORG procedure , namely its omission to deal with the interim order by ORG .", "He moreover appealed against ORG assessment of the evidence , notably its reasoning regarding the allegations on sexual abuse , including the following passage , which in his view was \u201c curious \u201d .", "\u201c In view of the information available in the case , where quite detailed descriptions have been provided of the abuse , together with [ L. 's ] strong objections to seeing his father , the High Court finds that there are many elements that may indicate that abuse has occurred . ORG has nevertheless not found it necessary for its decision to go further into or take a stance on this . \u201d", "The applicant submitted that in the light of the evidence it was hard to understand ORG conclusion on sexual abuse , even more so when it was stated in the judgment that it \u201c has not found it necessary for its decision to go further into or take a stance on this \u201d . In the applicant 's view , this was obviously an error ; should a judge find that there were many elements to indicate that sexual abuse had occurred , it was evident that this conviction would also have an effect on a decision regarding access for the parent found to be a probable abuser . The applicant further disputed the lawfulness of ORG rejection of any access rights , which decision could not be reconciled with the rule that the best interests of the child should prevail . In the applicant 's view , GPE 's horror picture of his father should be removed by arranging for access . This was a clear case of the so - called Parental Alienation Syndrome , with clear hatred , fear and anxiety , unlike the ambivalence shown by children who have been exposed to actual abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has submitted a medical certificate dated DATE by PERSON , which stated :", "\u201c I the undersigned have known [ the applicant ] since DATE .", "He has had a very tough time psychologically during the period since the judgment . He feels that he has been unjustifiably held liable of sexual abuse against his son and feels powerless in the system . He has been very depressed lately . He is struggling with problems of sleeplessness , bad appetite and loss of weight . He is isolating himself . At times he has had suicidal thoughts . This has adversely affected his family life and members of his family have had a particularly difficult time during DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant has moreover filed a statement by PERSON , GPE , of DATE , which concludes :", "\u201c It is highly probable that [ the applicant ] has developed symptoms that are compatible with ORG after what he had experienced in GPE . This has been further fortified by a situation combining anxiety and depression in the form of an adaptation disturbance as a result of his fight to get access to his children , especially when the court deprived him of his right of access .", "He presents a relatively high level of pressure from suffering but which he nevertheless manages to master satisfactorily . He receives regular treatment by a psychologist and medical treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the time of the national courts ' consideration of the present case , the right of access between a parent and a child was governed by sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( Lov om barn og foreldre ( barnelova ) ) .", "Under section CARDINAL the child had a right of access to both parents , even if they lived apart , and the parents had mutual responsibility for implementing the right of access . Under section CARDINALA the parent with whom the child did not live had a right of access to the child unless otherwise agreed or determined . The provision contained more detailed rules on the extent of access , its implementation and the procedure . It provided that decisions should first and foremost be based on what was best for the child .", "CARDINAL .
