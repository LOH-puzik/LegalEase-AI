The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL plain - clothes policemen observed the applicant on CARDINAL different occasions take a tiny plastic bag ( a socalled \u201c bubble \u201d ) out of his mouth and hand it over to another person in exchange for money . Believing that these bags contained drugs , the police officers went to arrest the applicant , whereupon he swallowed another bubble he still had in his mouth .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police officers did not find any drugs on the applicant . Since further delay might have frustrated the conduct of the investigation , the public prosecutor ordered that emetics ( Brechmittel ) be administered to the applicant by a doctor in order to provoke the regurgitation of the bag ( Exkorporation ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken to a hospital in LOC . According to the Government , the doctor who was to administer the emetics questioned the applicant about his medical history ( a procedure known as obtaining an anamnesis ) . This was disputed by the applicant , who claimed that he had not been questioned by a doctor . As the applicant refused to take the medication necessary to provoke vomiting , he was held down and immobilised by QUANTITY police officers . The doctor then forcibly administered to him a salt solution and the emetic ipecacuanha syrup through a tube introduced into his stomach through the nose . In addition , the doctor injected him with apomorphine , another emetic that is a derivative of morphine . As a result , the applicant regurgitated one bubble containing QUANTITY of cocaine . TIME after being arrested and taken to the hospital , the applicant was examined by a doctor and declared fit for detention .", "CARDINAL . When visited by the police in his cell TIME after being given the emetics , the applicant , who was found not to speak NORP , said in broken LANGUAGE that he was too tired to make a statement about the alleged offence .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to an arrest warrant that had been issued by ORG , the applicant was remanded in custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that for DATE following the treatment to which he was subjected he was only able to drink soup and that his nose repeatedly bled for DATE because of wounds he had received when the tube was inserted . This was disputed by the Government , who stressed that the applicant had failed to submit a medical report to prove his allegation .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the administration of the emetics , the applicant underwent a gastroscopy in the prison hospital after complaining of continuous pain in the upper region of his stomach . He was diagnosed as suffering from irritation in the lower area of the oesophagus caused by the reflux of gastric acid . The medical report did not expressly associate this condition with the forced administration of the emetics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison on DATE . He claimed that he had had to undergo further medical treatment for the stomach troubles he had suffered as a result of the forcible administration of the emetics . He did not submit any documents to confirm that he had received medical treatment . The Government , for their part , maintained that the applicant had not received any medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions dated DATE to ORG , the applicant , who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings , objected to the use at his trial of the evidence obtained through the administration of emetics , a method he considered to be illegal . By using force to provoke the regurgitation of the bubble of cocaine , the police officers and the doctor concerned were guilty of causing him bodily harm in the course of their duties ( ORG ) . The administration of toxic substances was prohibited by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His bodily functions had been manipulated , since bodily activity had been provoked by suppressing the control reactions of the brain and the body . In any event , administering emetics was a disproportionate measure and therefore not authorised by LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It would have been possible to obtain evidence of the alleged offence by waiting for the bubble to pass through his system naturally . The applicant further argued that the only other method authorised by LAW would have been irrigation of the stomach .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , suspended , and probation . It rejected the defence \u2019s argument that the administration of emetics under LAW was a disproportionate means of recovering a bubble containing just QUANTITY of cocaine .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction but reduced the length of the suspended prison sentence to DATE . It further ordered the forfeiture ( PERSON ) of MONEY that had been found on the applicant at the time of his arrest on the ground that it was the proceeds of sale of CARDINAL drug bubbles .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the evidence obtained following the public prosecutor \u2019s order to provoke the regurgitation of the bubble of cocaine was admissible . The measure had been carried out because further delay might have frustrated the conduct of the investigation . Pursuant to LAW , the administration of the substances in question , even if effected against the suspect \u2019s will , was legal . The procedure had been necessary to secure evidence of drug trafficking . It had been carried out by a doctor and in compliance with the rules of medical science . The defendant \u2019s health had not been put at risk and the principle of proportionality had been adhered to .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against this judgment on points of law . He argued in particular that LAW did not authorise the administration of emetics , as it did not permit the administration of life - threatening substances by dangerous methods . Furthermore , Article CARDINALa prohibited measures such as the one in question that resulted in a suspect effectively being forced to contribute actively to his own conviction . He further submitted that the impugned measure had violated ORG and CARDINAL of LAW ( Grundgesetz \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , and disregarded in particular the right to respect for human dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that ORG judgment did not contain any error of law that was detrimental to the accused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He reiterated that the administration of emetics was a disproportionate measure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible under the principle of subsidiarity .", "CARDINAL . It considered that the administration of emetics , including apomorphine , a morphine derivative , raised serious constitutional issues with respect to the right to physical integrity ( LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and to the principle of proportionality which the criminal courts had not yet addressed .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found that the applicant had not availed himself of all the remedies at his disposal ( alle prozessualen GPE ) to contest the measure before the criminal courts in order to avoid any underestimation of the importance and scope of the fundamental right laid down in LAW , first sentence , of LAW ( um eine PERSON und ORG .

The view taken by the majority of the NORP courts of appeal ( see , inter alia , the decision of ORG of DATE , ORG - RR CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , and the judgment of ORG of DATE , PERSON DATE , pp .

Pursuant to LAW , third sentence , of LAW , interferences with these basic rights are permitted if they have a statutory basis . ORG has already found on several occasions that , as a statutory provision enacted by ORG , Article CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure meets this requirement ... Furthermore , it has found more specifically that the administration of emetics in reliance on that provision did not give rise to any constitutional objections of principle either ( see ORG , StV DATE , p.

That point is not in issue in the present case ... ORG ... stated that [ on the facts of ] the case decided by the GPE ( ORG it too would have excluded the use of the evidence obtained because of the clearly disproportionate nature of the measure . It did , however , expressly and convincingly demonstrate that the facts of the present case were different . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , however , the GPE ( ORG held that LAW did not authorise the administration of emetics . The case concerned the administration of an overdose of ipecacuanha syrup to a suspected drug dealer by force through a nasogastric tube and his injection with apomorphine . The court found :", "\u201c The forced administration of emetics was not covered by LAW . Even Article CARDINALa does not justify the administration of an emetic by force . Firstly , the administration of an emetic constitutes neither a physical examination nor a bodily intrusion carried out by a doctor for examination purposes within the meaning of that provision . It is true that searching for foreign objects may be justified by LAW ... However , the emetic was used not to search for foreign objects , but to retrieve objects \u2013 whose presence was at least probable \u2013 in order to use them in evidence ... This aim was more akin to searching for or seizing an object within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . of LAW than to a physical examination ... \u2013 although those provisions do not , on the face of it , include forcible interference with a person \u2019s physical integrity as a possible measure . ...", "Secondly , an accused is not the object of criminal proceedings ... The forced administration of emetics violates the principle of passivity [ ORG ] , since its purpose is to force the accused actively to do something that he is unwilling to do , namely regurgitate . This is neither permitted under LAW nor compatible with the position of the accused in criminal proceedings . ...", "Consequently , the conduct of the prosecuting authorities constitutes unlawful interference with the accused \u2019s physical integrity ( LAW , first sentence , of LAW ) . ...", "The forcible administration of emetics in the absence of any legal basis therefor also violates the duty to protect human dignity and the accused \u2019s general personality rights ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . ...", "The prohibition on obtaining the evidence [ in that manner ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to many legal writers , LAW authorises the administration of emetics to suspected drug dealers in order to obtain evidence ( see also the authors cited above at paragraph CARDINAL ) . This view is taken , for example , by PERSON ( NStZ DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and PERSON zur GPE und zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz , PERSON , Article CARDINALa StPO , \u00a7 DATE ) and by PERSON and PERSON ( ORG , CARDINALth edition , Article CARDINALa , \u00a7 DATE administration of emetics permitted for the investigation of serious offences ) .", "CARDINAL . A considerable number of legal writers , however , take the view that LAW , Article CARDINALa in particular , does not permit the administration of emetics . This opinion is held , for example , by PERSON DATE , pp . CARDINAL , and KritV DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , who considers that Article CARDINALa does not authorise a search \u2013 as opposed to an examination \u2013 of the interior of a defendant \u2019s body . Vetter ( NORP des \u00a7 CARDINALa ORG \u2013 PERSON am PERSON der Brechmittelvergabe i m strafrechtlichen ORG , Neuried DATE , pp . DATE , CARDINAL ) considers that the forcible administration of emetics through a nasogastric tube is irreconcilable with the rules of medical science , disproportionate and liable to damage the defendant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . Medical experts disagree as to whether the forcible administration of emetics through the insertion of a nasogastric tube is advisable from a medical point of view . While some experts consider that emetics should be administered to a suspect in order to protect his health even if he resists such treatment , others take the view that such a measure entails serious health risks for the person concerned and should not therefore be carried out .", "CARDINAL . The medical experts who argue in favour of the forcible administration of emetics stress that even if this measure is not primarily carried out for medical reasons , it may nevertheless serve to prevent a possibly life - threatening intoxication . As the packaging of drugs swallowed on arrest is often unreliable , it is preferable from a medical standpoint for emetics to be administered . This measure poses very few risks , whereas there is a danger of death if the drugs are allowed to pass through the body naturally . Drugs can be extracted from the stomach up to TIME , in some cases CARDINAL , after being swallowed . Administering emetics is a safe and fast method ( the emetic usually takes effect within TIME ) of retrieving evidence of a drugs offence , as it is rare for them not to work . Even though the forcible introduction of a tube through the nose can cause pain , it does not pose any health risks as the act of swallowing can be induced by the mechanical stimulus of the tube in the throat ( see , inter alia , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , \u201c ORG \u2013 Erfahrungen i m LOC \u201d , Kriminalistik CARDINAL/CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The emetic ipecacuanha syrup has a high margin of safety . ORG to be expected merely take the form of drowsiness , diarrhoea and prolonged vomiting . Rare , more serious complications include ORG syndrome or aspiration pneumonia . These may occur if the person concerned has sustained previous damage to his or her stomach or if the rules governing the administration of emetics , notably that the patient is fully alert and conscious , are not observed ( see , for example , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , cited above , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and ORG and ORG , \u201c Position Paper : Ipecac Syrup \u201d , ORG , ORG , vol . DATE , no . DATE , pp . CARDINAL , in particular , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Those medical experts who argue against the administration of emetics by force point out in particular that the forcible introduction of emetics through a nasogastric tube entails considerable health risks . Even though it is desirable for drugs to be eliminated from the suspect \u2019s body as quickly as possible , the use of a nasogastric tube or any other invasive method can be dangerous because of the risk of perforation of the drug packaging with potentially fatal consequences . Furthermore , if the tube is badly positioned liquid may enter the lungs and cause choking . Forced regurgitation also involves a danger of vomit being inhaled , which can lead to choking or a lung infection . The administration of emetics can not therefore be medically justified without the consent of the person concerned , and , without this consent , this method of securing evidence will be incompatible with the ethics of the medical profession , as has been illustrated in particular by the death of a suspect following such treatment ( see , inter alia , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , PERSON , DATE , pp . DATE ; ORG of ORG , report dated DATE in response to ORG request to assess the dangers involved in the forcible administration of emetics ; and the resolution adopted by the CARDINALth German Medical Conference , Activity Report of ORG , point CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . There is no uniform practice on the use of emetics to secure evidence of a drugs offence in the NORP L\u00e4nder . Since DATE , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL L\u00e4nder ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) have used this measure on a regular basis . Whereas some ORG discontinued its use following the death of a suspect , others are still resorting to it . In the vast majority of cases in which emetics have been used , the suspects chose to swallow the emetic themselves , after being informed that it would otherwise be administered forcibly . In other ORG , emetics are not forcibly administered , partly because , on the basis of medical advice , it is regarded as a disproportionate and dangerous measure , and partly because it is not considered a necessary means of combating drugs offences .", "CARDINAL . There have been CARDINAL fatalities in GPE as a result of the forcible administration of ipecacuanha syrup to suspected drug dealers through a tube introduced through the nose into the stomach . In DATE a NORP national died in GPE . According to the investigation , he had suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of stress caused by the forcible administration of emetics . He was found to have been suffering from an undetected heart condition . In DATE a ORG national died in GPE . The investigation into the cause of his death has not yet been completed . The emergency doctor and a medical expert suggested that the applicant had drowned as a result of a shortage of oxygen when water permeated his lungs . Criminal investigations for homicide caused by negligence have been launched against the doctor who pumped the emetic and water into the suspect \u2019s stomach and against the emergency doctor called to attend to him .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the fatality in GPE , the Head of ORG ( Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt ) has ordered the forcible administration of emetics to be discontinued in GPE for the time being . Pending the outcome of the investigation , a new procedure has been set up by the Senators for ORG and the ORG . Under this procedure , a person suspected of swallowing drugs must be informed by a doctor about the risks to his health if the drugs remain in his body . The suspect can choose to take emetics or a laxative if a medical examination discloses that it poses no risks to his health . Otherwise , he is detained in a specially equipped cell until the drug packages are passed naturally .", "CARDINAL . The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , as adopted by ORG on DATE ( resolution CARDINAL ) , provides :", "\u201c For the purposes of this Convention , the term \u2018 torture\u2019 means any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession , punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating or coercing him or a third person , or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind , when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity .

In GPE v. GPE ( CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) , ORG reversed the petitioner \u2019s conviction for unlawful possession of drugs . On the basis of information that the petitioner was selling narcotics , CARDINAL state officers entered his home and forced their way into his bedroom . They unsuccessfully attempted to extract by force drug capsules which the petitioner had been observed to put into his mouth . The officers then took him to a hospital , where an emetic was forced through a tube into his stomach against his will . He regurgitated CARDINAL capsules which were found to contain morphine . These were admitted in evidence in the face of his objection . ORG held on DATE that the conviction had been obtained by methods in violation of ORG in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON , delivering the opinion of the ORG , found :", "\u201c Applying these general considerations to the circumstances of the present case , we are compelled to conclude that the proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combating crime too energetically . This is conduct that shocks the conscience . Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner , the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there , the forcible extraction of his stomach \u2019s contents DATE this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities . They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation .", "It has long since ceased to be true that due process of law is heedless of the means by which otherwise relevant and credible evidence is obtained . This was not true even before the series of recent cases enforced the constitutional principle that the GPE may not base convictions upon confessions , however much verified , obtained by coercion . ... It would be a stultification of the responsibility which the course of constitutional history has cast upon this ORG to hold that in order to convict a man the police can not extract by force what is in his mind but can extract what is in his stomach .", "To attempt in this case to distinguish what lawyers call \u2018 real evidence\u2019 from verbal evidence is to ignore the reasons for excluding coerced confessions . Use of involuntary verbal confessions in ORG criminal trials is constitutionally obnoxious not only because of their unreliability . They are inadmissible under the Due Process Clause even though statements contained in them may be independently established as true . Coerced confessions offend the community \u2019s sense of fair play and decency . So here , to sanction the brutal conduct which naturally enough was condemned by the court whose judgment is before us , would be to afford brutality the cloak of law . Nothing would be more calculated to discredit law and thereby to brutalize the temper of a society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In State of GPE v. PERSON ( DATE WL CARDINAL ( ORG . CARDINAL Dist . ) ) , ORG held on DATE that the pumping of the defendant \u2019s stomach in the face of his objections was not an unreasonable search and seizure . The defendant was observed engaging in a hand - to - hand transaction typical of drug dealing . When police officers ordered the defendant to their vehicle , he put something in his mouth and ran off . In the opinion of the court , flushing out the defendant \u2019s stomach by gastric lavage by a physician in a hospital setting was not an unreasonable measure , even though the defendant violently objected to the procedure and had to be sedated . Swallowing the cocaine , which had been seen in the defendant \u2019s mouth , put his life in jeopardy and he was destroying evidence .", "CARDINAL .

Applying the PERSON factors to the facts of this case , it is apparent that the pumping of Williams\u2019 stomach was a lawful search and seizure . First , the officers observed PERSON in an area known for illegal drug activity engage in a hand - to - hand transaction indicative of drug activity . When he saw the officers , he put whatever was in his hand in his mouth and then ran away . This behavior was a \u2018 clear indication\u2019 to the officers that PERSON had secreted drugs in his mouth . Moreover , it was reasonable for the officers to conclude that Williams\u2019 life could be in jeopardy after they observed crack cocaine in his mouth and saw him trying to chew it and swallow it . Furthermore , PERSON was destroying the evidence necessary to convict him of drug possession . Accordingly , this case falls within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it is apparent that the method and manner of the search were not unreasonable . The facts indicate that a physician administered Williams\u2019 medical treatment in a hospital setting , according to accepted medical procedures ...", "CARDINAL . In PERSON , ORG expressed an acceptance of a search conducted in a reasonable manner by a physician . The physician is certainly more qualified than a police officer to determine the extent to which a procedure is life threatening .", "CARDINAL . Assuming that [ a defendant ] swallowed the cocaine , if the drugs were packaged in such a way as to be impervious to intestinal processes , the physician would certainly be in a position to pump the stomach of the [ defendant ] , which is a reasonable medical procedure less traumatic than the forced emetic in DATE . Again , this is the kind of conduct that PERSON finds more reasonable because it is done in the confines of a hospital with appropriate medical supervision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a survey based on information obtained from the governments of the member ORG via their Agents or , if the government concerned had not provided information , from ORG in the country concerned . According to the survey , emetics are forcibly administered to suspected drug dealers in practice in CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d and GPE ) . In CARDINAL countries emetics are not used against a suspect \u2019s will to retrieve drug bubbles that have been swallowed ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .

The applicant partly contested the ORG \u2019s findings . He noted that the ORG had said that CARDINAL countries other than GPE ( GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d and GPE ) permitted the administration of emetics to suspected drug dealers and used the measure in practice . However , he said that the Government had failed to adduce any evidence of emetics being administered by force against the accused \u2019s will in those member GPE . With respect to GPE in particular , the applicant disputed that the forcible introduction of a nasogastric tube as in his case was legal . As regards the administration of emetics in GPE , GPE and GPE , he contested the existence of any legal basis for such a measure in those countries , irrespective of the position in practice . Consequently , GPE was the only ORG which was proven to actually resort to the impugned measure . In all the other member GPE the authorities waited for the drugs to pass through the body naturally .", "CARDINAL . Other materials before the ORG confirm the parties\u2019 findings that emetics are not forcibly administered in practice in GPE examined ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) .
