The applicant LOC are all situated in the municipality of PERSON in the county of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON have , since ancient times , inhabited the northern parts of LOC and LOC . Originally living by hunting , fishing and collecting , the PERSON activities changed over time to concern mainly reindeer herding . Their historical use of the land has given rise to a special right to real estate , the reindeer herding right ( rensk\u00f6tselr\u00e4tten ) . Presently regulated in GPE by LAW ( Renn\u00e4ringslagen , CARDINAL ) , it comprises the right to use land and water for the PERSON 's own sustenance and that of his reindeer . The right may only be exercised by the members of a LOC village . Such villages are both geographical grazing areas and economic entities . They do not have any public legal status ( see GPE and CARDINAL Other GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , Decisions and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL in fine ) . The reindeer herding area comprises CARDINAL of the surface of GPE and is divided into DATE land and DATE grazing land . In certain parts of the country , the borders of the herding area are controversial and have not been statutorily defined , especially as concerns the DATE grazing land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a large number of private owners of land in the municipality of H\u00e4rjedalen instituted proceedings against CARDINAL LOC villages , the CARDINAL applicants and the Idre Nya Sami village , before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON . On DATE more landowners initiated a similar action against the Sami villages . The landowners sought a declaratory judgment ( negativ fastst\u00e4llelsetalan ) that the Sami villages had no right to reindeer grazing on their land without a valid contract to that effect concluded between the landowner and the village .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a summons and decided that the CARDINAL cases were to be examined jointly . At a preparatory meeting on DATE , the court rejected the villages ' request for dismissal of the cases on procedural grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP villages submitted their response , contesting the landowners ' action . The villages claimed that they had the right to DATE grazing within their respective areas based on ( CARDINAL ) prescription from time immemorial ( urminnes h\u00e4vd ) , ( CARDINAL ) the provisions of the reindeer grazing and reindeer husbandry acts of DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , ( CARDINAL ) custom , or ( CARDINAL ) public international law , more specifically LAW of ORG , as compared with LAW , LAW , of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL extensions of the time - limit fixed by ORG , the landowners replied to the PERSON villages ' submissions on DATE . An additional preparatory meeting was held on DATE , at which the parties discussed , inter alia , the possibility of reaching a settlement . Furthermore , the villages were ordered to elaborate on their claim based on custom and to specify their means of evidence . They did so on DATE following CARDINAL extensions of the time - limit set . At the same time , they requested that the court inspect some of the properties concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having been granted several extensions , the landowners submitted a specification of the means of evidence offered . During DATE , the parties exchanged views on questions of evidence and submitted specifications of supplementary evidence . On DATE ORG sent a summary of the respective positions to the parties for comments . A further preparatory meeting took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During DATE and DATE , further comments were exchanged . On CARDINAL and DATE a preparatory meeting was held in order to plan the schedule for the main hearing . DATE and DATE , further views were exchanged , among other things on the LOC villages ' request for an inspection .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the request for an inspection on the ground that the villages had not shown that an inspection of certain properties was necessary for an examination of whether they had a right to DATE grazing on the land in question .", "CARDINAL . The parties were summoned for the main hearing at DATE . On DATE some more landowners initiated a similar action against the Sami villages . This case was joined to the other CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The main hearing started on DATE and ended on DATE . It lasted for DATE . ORG heard a large number of experts and witnesses and had regard to substantial documentary evidence . During the hearing , as well as on CARDINAL previous occasions , the court struck out the case in regard to some of the landowners following withdrawal of the action on their part . The CARDINAL joined cases eventually comprised property belonging to CARDINAL landowners .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the developments of the LOC culture and reindeer herding since prehistoric times , ORG issued a CARDINAL judgment on DATE . It found that , from DATE to DATE , there had not been any DATE grazing which had established a right for the PERSON to such grazing on the relevant properties and that , from DATE , the actual DATE grazing , as DATE recorded by the socalled ORG bailiffs ( lappfogdar ) , had not lasted long enough in the respective parishes to create a right to grazing on those properties based on prescription from time immemorial , such prescription requiring DATE use of the land . For these reasons , the LOC villages could not claim a right to use the properties under the various laws , including the Reindeer Husbandry Act presently in force . Moreover , the court found that a right to real property could not legally be established through \u201c custom \u201d and that a right to DATE grazing on the properties in question could not be based on the provisions of LAW and ORG . The court therefore concluded that there was no right of the LOC villages to reindeer grazing on the plaintiffs ' land without a valid contract and accordingly gave judgment in favour of the landowners . The court ordered the LOC villages jointly to pay the plaintiffs ' legal costs , amounting to MONEY ( SEK ; CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sami villages appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON . They demanded that ORG judgment be quashed , that the landowners ' action be rejected and that the decision on litigation costs not be enforced . They completed their appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the landowners responded and requested that the NORP villages not be allowed to invoke circumstances in their defence that had not been presented to ORG . In a submission of DATE , the villages , on their part , made an additional demand that ORG judgment be set aside and the case remitted to that court on the ground that a procedural error had occurred . During DATE , the parties exchanged views on these and other matters . The landowners submitted their comments on the villages ' additional demand on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG ruled on CARDINAL different procedural issues . Among other things , it rejected the LOC villages ' request that the appealed judgment be set aside and the case remitted . It also rejected the landowners ' request that the villages not be allowed to invoke certain circumstances in their defence , with CARDINAL exception . Thus , the court did not allow the villages to argue that DATE grazing without protests from landowners for a period of DATE would qualify for a continued right to such grazing based on prescription from time immemorial or the provisions of the reindeer grazing and reindeer husbandry acts . Furthermore , ORG rejected the LOC villages ' requests for an inspection of the locus in quo and for an order against the landowners to produce maps of the areas concerned . In its reasons for the various rulings , the court referred , inter alia , to the provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) concerning the conditions for invoking new circumstances and evidence not previously examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parties were ordered to complete their respective actions by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sami villages claimed that there was a procedural hindrance ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngshinder ) as they lacked the capacity to act as parties in relation to the issue concerned by the proceedings in question . By a decision of DATE , ORG rejected this claim , stating that , under the provisions of LAW , they had the necessary legal capacity . On DATE the villages appealed against that decision to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) . At their request , ORG granted the villages an extension of the time - limit set for the completion of their appeal until ORG had rendered its decision on the procedural issue . By a decision of DATE , ORG refused the villages leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a submission of CARDINAL March CARDINAL , the NORP villages demanded that the ORG , through the Chancellor of ORG ( NORP ) , intervene on their side in the proceedings . At DATE , the Chancellor informed ORG that he did not intend to apply to participate in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the NORP villages were ordered to complete their appeal , which they did on DATE , after having been granted extensions of the time - limits set . Shortly thereafter , the landowners were ordered to submit the means of evidence they invoked , which they did on DATE , also following time - limit extensions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the landowners applied for the Sami villages ' appeal to be dismissed and in DATE the villages reiterated their demand that ORG judgment be quashed and the case remitted . By a decision of DATE , ORG rejected these requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP villages requested that the court obtain an opinion from an expert ( sakkunnig ) . Following the landowners ' objection and the villages ' further comments , the court rejected this request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the court ordered the parties to make submissions on the question of which landowners were to be considered opposite parties in the appellate proceedings . The Sami villages submitted several comments DATE and the landowners made their submissions in DATE , after extensions of the time - limits set .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having interpreted one of the landowners ' submissions as a motion for dismissal of the Sami villages ' appeal , ORG rejected that motion . On DATE the villages adduced some written evidence not previously presented . The landowners objected to that evidence but , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court allowed the villages to present it .", "CARDINAL . The main hearing in ORG was held DATE and lasted DATE . The appellate court heard the same evidence as ORG and , as already mentioned , some additional written evidence introduced by the PERSON villages .", "CARDINAL . Following some landowners ' withdrawal of their action and ORG village 's withdrawal of its appeal , ORG , by decisions of DATE and DATE , struck out the case and set aside ORG judgment \u2013 including the Idre Nya Sami village 's liability for litigation costs \u2013 in so far as it concerned these same parties .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment and ordered the applicants to pay the plaintiffs ' legal costs in the appellate proceedings , amounting to MONEY CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG initially referred to the conclusion by ORG in the so - called \u201c LOC \u201d ( PERSON , NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) that the rights pertaining to reindeer herding were exhaustively regulated by LAW . Consequently , the right of DATE grazing was dependent on the conditions for prescription from time immemorial being met , those conditions having been regulated in the old LAW ( ORG ) of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards prescription from time immemorial and the burden and standard of proof in this respect , ORG stated the following :", "\u201c Under LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the old LAW , the following applied to proof of prescription from time immemorial . ' If someone pleads prescription from time immemorial and fault is found with this claim , let him then show by means of old letters and writings deemed sufficient in law , or by means of credible men who have good local knowledge and can bear witness , on oath , that they neither know themselves nor have heard from others that the situation has ever been different . If he is unable to do this , the prescriptive right shall then be without force and effect . ' According to the preparatory works for the DATE LAW and the [ DATE ] LAW , in cases subject to dispute , the question of whether a right to winter grazing applies in a certain area is to be examined by a court on the basis of the evidence that is required under general law for proof of prescription from time immemorial ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL , and Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . The burden of proof that DATE grazing has taken place on the property owner 's land to such an extent that the LOC villages have a right to continued DATE grazing may therefore be deemed to rest with the PERSON villages .", "In this case , the LOC villages claim that a right to DATE grazing based on prescription from time immemorial has come into being as PERSON have been in LOC since prehistoric times , as reindeer were early on associated with the PERSON culture , as reindeer management took on a completely nomadic form in DATE or , at all events , during DATE , and it can be assumed that even then , in DATE , depending on the weather conditions and access to food , the reindeer belonging to the PERSON wandered in search of food , and as the custom that developed at that time has endured until modern times . However , in the opinion of ORG , for a right to DATE grazing on the disputed lands to be deemed to have arisen on the basis of prescription from time immemorial , it must be required in addition that the results of the investigation indicate with sufficient strength that PERSON have used the lands in question or parts of them for DATE grazing for their reindeer with at least some regularity without hindrance , that is , without objection from other holders of rights . \u201d", "The court further held that account had to be taken of the special features of reindeer husbandry . The herding required much space and necessitated movement between various grazing areas . The right to DATE grazing based on prescription could not require that reindeer grazed in a particular area DATE . However , a basic condition for that right was that the area had been used in such a way that every instance of grazing could be seen as part of a recurring pattern , although absence from the area in question could be more or less prolonged .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined extensive evidence dating back DATE and drew the following conclusions . As regards the period before the entry into force of LAW ( most notably , DATE ) , it had not been shown that free DATE grazing DATE that is , in the absence of contracts or the authorities ' permission \u2013 had taken place in LOC . On the contrary , the individual landowners had protested against reindeer grazing on their land . At the time of the enactment of the DATE and DATE Acts , the disputes between the domiciled population and the nomadic GPE about the use of the land at issue had been particularly sensitive in PERSON , and the investigation did not show that any DATE grazing had occurred outside the boundaries of the \u201c reindeer grazing mountains \u201d . According to the evidence presented with respect to the situation in DATE , grazing outside these mountains had existed during wintertime only in limited areas and protests from landowners had been commonplace .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court thus found , in agreement with ORG , that , DATE , there had not been such DATE grazing outside the reindeer grazing mountains which , together with the grazing that had taken place during DATE , could create a right to use the relevant properties on the basis of prescription from time immemorial . The longest period in DATE during which DATE grazing had occurred in CARDINAL area without landowners ' objections was DATE , thus insufficient to establish a right based on prescription .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG on DATE . Their appeal was completed on CARDINAL DATE . In DATE , they submitted documents as to the question of who was to represent them before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Samefonden ) has granted the applicants a loan of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) to pay the litigation costs incurred in the domestic proceedings . The loan , which is free of interest , is due on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The nature and scope of PERSON rights to land and water are governed by FAC . A person of PERSON descent may use land and water in order to maintain himself and his reindeer ( section CARDINAL ) . The reindeer herding right is a usufruct of economic value founded on prescription from time immemorial ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . It is to be exercised irrespective of contracts and free of charge , without limitations in time and space and on land belonging to the ORG as well as to private subjects , in accordance with the conditions laid down in sections CARDINAL of the LAW . These provisions also contain restrictions on the exercise of such rights depending , inter alia , on whether the land belongs to the ORG or to private subjects . The reindeer herding right includes the right of members of a LOC village to engage in hunting and fishing , to graze reindeer and to erect certain structures and buildings needed for reindeer herding , as well as to collect wood and timber from the forests . It pertains to all PERSON , but may only be exercised by members of a GPE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW defines the areas where reindeer herding may be conducted ( rensk\u00f6tselomr\u00e5det ) . In so far as the county of PERSON is concerned , herding may be carried out throughout DATE on the so - called \u201c reindeer grazing mountains \u201d ( renbetesfj\u00e4llen ) and in those areas within the county which , at DATE , belonged to the ORG and were made available specifically for reindeer grazing . Winter grazing may be carried out from DATE to DATE in such areas outside the reindeer grazing mountains where , since time immemorial , reindeer grazing has been conducted during certain times of DATE .", "Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , defines \u201c reindeer grazing land \u201d as land that has been declared to constitute reindeer grazing land through the process of delimitation of ORG lands ( avvittring , that is , a process taking place DATE with the aim of separating private land from ORG land and imposing taxes on the former ) or that has been used as such land since time immemorial . The notion of \u201c reindeer grazing mountains \u201d refers to mountains reserved for the PERSON for reindeer grazing through the process of delimitation of ORG lands and the areas which have since then been made available for extension of the mountain grazing areas .", "CARDINAL . A LOC village is a geographical grazing area and an economic entity . Its main object is to manage reindeer herding within the grazing area of the village to the common benefit of its members ( section CARDINAL ) . A village may acquire rights and undertake commitments and represents its members with regard to issues related to reindeer husbandry ( section CARDINAL ) . The members of a LOC village are PERSON who participate or have participated in reindeer herding within the community 's grazing area , as well as their closest family members ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , the reindeer herding right is based on prescription from time immemorial . This was specified in LOC through a DATE amendment , following ORG conclusion in the \u201c LOC \u201d that the right to certain mountain areas in northern GPE could be based on prescription from time immemorial in combination with occupation . Provisions on ownership and other , more limited , rights to land based on prescription from time immemorial are mainly found in the old LAW of DATE . For a right of ownership or usufruct based on such prescription to arise , the land had to have been occupied or used for such a long time that nobody knew or had heard that the situation had ever been different ( LAW , LAW , of the old Code ) .", "CARDINAL . The qualification period required is estimated to be DATE ( see PERSON , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL , with references ) . Section CARDINAL of the Act on Implementing the new LAW ( ORG om inf\u00f6rande av nya jordabalken ; PERSON ) stipulates that the provisions of the new LAW are not to interfere with any rights to land based on prescription from time immemorial that have arisen before the new LAW came into force ( DATE ) . This implies that any historical provision that could have given a person or entity rights to certain land before that date is still valid . As more specifically regards the PERSON right to DATE grazing based on prescription from time immemorial , the area has not been geographically demarcated in FAC . If there is a dispute about whether a particular piece of land has traditionally been used for herding during certain times of DATE and thus may be used for DATE grazing DATE the issue is to be decided by the courts on the basis of the evidence presented ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL , Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL , and the report by ORG , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( R\u00e4ttshj\u00e4lpslagen , DATE ) in force at the material time , legal aid could be given to natural persons who fulfilled certain conditions , in particular that their financial resources were limited . A legal entity like a LOC village was thus not entitled to legal aid .", "CARDINAL . ORG is regulated in sections CARDINAL of the Reindeer Husbandry Ordinance ( Renn\u00e4ringsf\u00f6rordningen , DATE ) . The ORG 's purpose is to subsidise and promote reindeer husbandry , PERSON organisations and PERSON culture . As regards the promotion of reindeer husbandry , the subsidies can be used for the purchase and lease of land for reindeer herding , rationalisation of reindeer husbandry and other measures . The means are administered by ORG ( NORP ) . Decisions on how the means are to be used are taken by the board of ORG , which consists of CARDINAL persons of PERSON origin .", "CARDINAL . The revenue of ORG mainly consists of charges for leases to others than reindeer owners of land belonging to the ORG where reindeer husbandry may be carried out all the DATE round . Such revenue , which includes , for instance , licensing fees for hunting and fishing , is divided equally between the LOC village concerned and ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its budget proposal for DATE ( Government PERSON ) , which was approved by ORG , the ORG laid down that some of the revenue of ORG could be used to part - finance the lease of land for DATE grazing in the areas concerned in the present case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
