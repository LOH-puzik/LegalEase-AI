Following the intervention of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in DATE , GPE was placed under international administration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in response to a prior query , informed GPE \u2019s ORG that the pension system in GPE was based on the concept of \u201c ongoing financing \u201d . Specifically , pensions were secured through current pension insurance contributions . Consequently , as the NORP authorities had been unable to collect any such contributions in GPE since DATE , persons who had received their pensions from ORG of the NORP Pensions and ORG ( \u201c SPDIF \u201d ) could not expect to continue receiving them . ORG also reminded the Ombudsman that Regulation no .

The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the death of her husband , the first applicant \u2013 together with her daughter PERSON , n\u00e9e PERSON was granted a survivor \u2019s pension by ORG in GPE , with retroactive effect as of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the said court found that it did not have territorial jurisdiction and forwarded the case file to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the proceedings . It explained that the international status of GPE was yet to be resolved and that in the meantime the NORP authorities were unable to collect any pension insurance contributions in that territory . The status of GPE was therefore a preliminary question which had to be settled before the first applicant \u2019s claim could be adjudicated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE quashed ORG decision of DATE , holding that the status of GPE was not a valid reason to suspend the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG quashed that decision , reiterating that the status of GPE was not a valid reason to suspend the proceedings in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE , which had jurisdiction to deal with the matter following the reorganisation of the NORP judiciary , ruled against the first applicant . It explained that she had not exhausted the administrative remedies before the ORG and had , in any event , failed to properly substantiate her calculation of the accrued pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which also had jurisdiction to deal with the matter following the above - mentioned reorganisation of the NORP judiciary , quashed that judgment on the grounds of inadequate reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ruled against the first applicant , this time primarily based on her failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the SPDIF .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled partly in favour of the first applicant ( G\u017e . CARDINAL ) . In so doing , it ordered the ORG to pay her the pension arrears DATE and DATE with statutory interest , as well as the costs of the proceedings . The court opined that the suspension of payment of the first applicant \u2019s pension had been unlawful from a domestic legal perspective and had also been in breach of LAW No .

Article CARDINAL provides that pension instalments which have not been paid owing to circumstances caused by the pensioner can be sought only for DATE on which he or she lodged a request to that effect .", "CARDINAL . The Opinions state , inter alia , that the pension system in GPE is based on the concept of \u201c ongoing financing \u201d . Specifically , pensions are secured through current pension insurance contributions . Since the NORP authorities have been unable to collect any such contributions in GPE since DATE , persons who have been granted ORG pensions in GPE can not expect , for the time being , to continue receiving them . It is further stated that Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL on pensions in GPE , adopted by UNMIK , provides for a separate pension system for persons living in the territory ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that the prescription period for seeking civil compensation is DATE from the date on which the claimant first learnt of the damage in question , but that , in any event , the absolute deadline is DATE from the time the damage occurred .", "DATE . In response to the situation in GPE , this ORG states , inter alia , that a person \u2019s recognised right to a pension may only be restricted on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Recognised pension rights can not depend on whether current pension insurance contributions can be collected in a given territory .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further explains that administrative proceedings ( upravni postupak ) and , if necessary , judicial review proceedings ( upravni spor ) would be the appropriate avenue to challenge any restriction of a person \u2019s pension rights .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG notes that , in this context , the civil courts are competent to adjudicate only cases involving claims of malfeasance ( nezakonit i nepravilan rad ) on the part of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the competent court may not only quash the impugned administrative decision but may also rule on the merits of the plaintiff \u2019s claim , should the facts of the case and the very nature of the dispute in question allow for that particular course of action .", "DATE .

As of DATE , ORG considered a total of CARDINAL appeals related in CARDINAL way or another to the general issue of payment or reinstatement of pensions suspended by the SPDIF ( see U\u017e . nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , decisions rendered DATE and DATE ) . In a total of CARDINAL out of those CARDINAL cases ORG found violations of the NORP constitutional rights . In CARDINAL cases the violations concerned the length of proceedings before the ORG or the competent courts ; in CARDINAL cases they concerned the inconsistent domestic case - law as regards whether persons seeking reinstatement of their pensions should provide the supporting documentation themselves or whether it should be obtained by the ORG proprio motu ; and in CARDINAL case ORG quashed an earlier decision adopted by an appellate court for lack of proper reasoning . The said appellate court had rejected the request for payment of accrued pensions because the claimant had allegedly failed to make proper prior use of the administrative remedies which it deemed relevant . In decisions PERSON . nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG also referred to the PERSON judgment , stating that it had taken that case - law into account but that the appellants had simply not complained that their property rights had been breached . Their complaints had focused instead on the inconsistent domestic case - law , as mentioned above . The other appeals were dismissed for various procedural reasons . In any event , ORG always considered only the complaints as specified by the appellants and \u201c could not go beyond that \u201d .", "CARDINAL . These regulations provide for a separate system whereby all persons aged CARDINAL or over \u201c habitually residing \u201d in GPE have the right to a \u201c basic pension \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
