THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr H.J.M. Nijholt , a lawyer practising in Emmen .", "On DATE , following previous incidents in which stones with hostile notes had been thrown through windows and fires lit before the front door , the applicant \u2019s parental home in GPE ( GPE ) \u2013 where her father was working as the assistant of the Minister of ORG DATE was raided by a number of masked men , who shouted to the applicant and her parents that they should disappear . The applicant left her parental home as soon as she could . After having spent TIME in the house of a friend , a foreign missionary named PERSON who was the Minister of ORG , she returned to her home at TIME . She found the house ransacked and a large blood stain in the room where she had last seen her father . The following day , the applicant and PERSON travelled to GPE where the applicant stayed until DATE with another missionary named PERSON , whereas PERSON returned to PERSON , where he made enquiries about the applicant \u2019s parents without obtaining any results .", "On DATE , the applicant left GPE via GPE airport and travelled by air to the GPE , where on DATE she applied for asylum at the Zevenaar asylum seekers centre .", "On DATE , the applicant was interviewed by a GPE immigration official in order to establish her identity , nationality and travel itinerary . The applicant stated that she was born in PERSON , and that she had gone to school between DATE and DATE in GPE ( GPE ) where she and her parents had then been living . She and her parents had moved to PERSON in DATE . She further stated that PERSON had made all arrangements for , and had accompanied her on the journey to , the GPE . Once in the GPE , PERSON had taken her to GPE where , according to him , she would find help . The applicant initially stated that she had held a birth certificate but that this document had been taken from her by those who had brought her to Zevenaar . She subsequently stated that this document had been made by the \u201c travel agent \u201d . She also declared that she had never held a passport or other identity document .", "On DATE , a second interview was held with the applicant on her reasons for applying for asylum . She stated , inter alia , that she was a NORP speaker and did not speak NORP , that she and her family had moved to PERSON when she was a little child not yet attending school , and that she and her parents had returned to PERSON in DATE because her father had wished to establish a church there . After having attended school in ORG for DATE , she had not wanted to go back to school as she had been bullied and assaulted by other pupils because she was not a NORP . She further declared that she had seen her birth certificate for the last time in her parental home in PERSON and that , to her knowledge , her parents had not had any problems with the NORP authorities .", "According to the conclusions of a medical age verification test carried out on DATE and commissioned by the GPE immigration authorities as the applicant did not hold any identity documents , the applicant was in fact DATE and not CARDINAL as submitted by her .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request , holding that no credence could be attached to the applicant \u2019s asylum account and that , in any event , it had not been established that the applicant had a well - founded fear of persecution or that it would not be possible for her to settle elsewhere in her country of origin . The applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in PERSON rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that she could not be held responsible for not having any identity or travel documents . In so far as the applicant challenged the results of the age verification test , which had been taken into account by the Deputy Minister in the assessment of the credibility of her account , ORG found \u2013 referring to the findings in a ruling given on DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) \u2013 that the procedure by which the Deputy Minister had obtained the medical opinion about the applicant \u2019s age fell short of the requirements of due care to be respected in administrative proceedings . Consequently , this opinion could not have been taken into account in the assessment of the credibility of the applicant \u2019s asylum account . However , it further found that the other elements taken into account by the Deputy Minister in this respect , namely various inconsistencies in the applicant \u2019s account , were sufficient for carrying the conclusion that no credence could be attached to the applicant \u2019s asylum account . The applicant further argued that a return to her country of origin would entail undue hardship on account of the general unsettled situation there . On this point ORG noted that ORG , in CARDINAL rulings given on DATE and DATE , had accepted as reasonable the position taken by the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie \u2013 the successor to the Deputy Minister of Justice ) on the basis of official reports ( ambtsberichten ) on the situation in LOC in GPE drawn up on , respectively , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( GPE PERSON ) that there was no categorical emergency situation in the sense that in the entire Russian Federation there was a risk for the life and limb of persons of NORP origin and that , on this basis , ORG had further accepted the Minister \u2019s decision not to introduce a policy of class protection based on country of origin ( categoriale bescherming ) in respect of asylum seekers of NORP origin . On the basis of the findings in these QUANTITY rulings , ORG concluded that the situation in the applicant \u2019s country of origin was not such that her expulsion to GPE would entail undue hardship on account of the general situation there .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE . It upheld the ruling of CARDINAL DATE of ORG , holding :", "\u201c The grievances raised do not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling ( kan niet tot vernietiging van de aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) . Having regard to LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) , no further reasoning is called for , since the arguments submitted do not raise questions requiring determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this decision .", "On the basis of LAW of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , in force at the relevant time , an alien is eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if , inter alia ,", "( a ) he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the LAW relating to LAW DATE , or", "( b ) he or she has established that he or she has well - founded reasons to assume that he or she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "To help in the assessment of asylum applications and the establishment of whether it is safe to return rejected asylum seekers , the Minister of ORG regularly publishes official country assessment reports ( ambtsberichten ) on the situation in asylum ORG countries of origin . In drawing up these reports , the Minister uses published sources and reports by non - governmental organisations as well as reports by GPE diplomatic missions .", "The decision of DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s request for asylum was based on information contained in the country reports of , respectively DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , on the basis of which ORG accepted in CARDINAL rulings given in DATE the decision of the Minister for ORG not to introduce a policy of class protection based on country of origin ( categoriale bescherming ) in respect of asylum seekers of NORP origin . Consequently , an asylum request filed by a person hailing from GPE is determined on an individual basis .", "According to the most recent official country report on LOC , drawn up on DATE by ORG , NORP having fled GPE since DATE can in practice not obtain a permanent residence registration in other parts of GPE and NORP encounter numerous problems as a result of discrimination both on the part of the authorities ( including law enforcement and judicial authorities ) and that of the general population . This applies to all parts of GPE , albeit not everywhere to a same degree . In particular , unregistered NORP can encounter problems in the exercise of their economic and social rights . The discrimination against NORP is greatest in GPE , GPE and GPE , where the highest local authorities ( such as Mayor PERSON of GPE ) display an explicitly negative attitude towards NORP as a result of which the rights of NORP are not always respected . NORP also encounter a lot of discrimination in GPE and GPE . It frequently occurs in these regions that public officials discriminate against NORP , mostly by stalling and insisting on a multitude of bureaucratic formalities . However , where an objection or appeal is filed , such abuses are mostly corrected by the municipal or judicial authorities . In the NORP areas of GPE , PERSON , GPE , GPE , PERSON and PERSON , the position of NORP is relatively good . For a long period , a NORP community has been living in Tjumen and PERSON . However , on account of the arctic climate , these are not popular places of residence .", "The \u201c Paper on the Situation of Asylum - Seekers from GPE in the context of the situation in GPE \u201d , issued in DATE by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) concludes :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Legislative mechanisms and related assistance that would facilitate the settlement of IDPs ( internally displaced persons ) beyond GPE and PERSON are not available . Forced migrant status can only be obtained , in practice , on the basis of an individual fear of persecution by NORP fundamentalists and is therefore not available to the majority of IDPs . Compensation for lost property is not yet available for IDPs who fled GPE .", "DATE . NORP IDPs from the current conflict have had virtually no access or possibility to sojourn legally in FAC and GPE . In GPE - GPE , GPE and GPE , the low number of NORP IDPs can be explained both by restrictive regulations and practice preventing the sojourn of the concerned persons , as well as by the reluctance of the IDPs themselves to venture into regions where the authorities and local residents hold a hostile attitude towards them .", "CARDINAL . In other administrative districts of GPE , the combination of local restrictive regulations on freedom of movement and freedom of choice of place of sojourn / residence , anti - NORP feelings among the public , and concerns among local authorities to contain ethnic tensions and to prevent terrorist acts , deprives NORP IDPs of a genuine internal relocation alternative .", "CARDINAL . As opposed to persons holding residence registration , there is currently no assurance in practice that a person holding registration at the place of sojourn will be issued an extension of such registration or that , in case of travel or stay abroad , such registration will be extended upon return at the place of sojourn .", "CARDINAL . It has been reported by some local NGOs defending the rights of forced migrants that ethnic NORP IDPs are not always well received by the local population and local authorities in their areas of destination . Many of them have reported difficulties in obtaining issuance or renewal of sojourn registration . However , there is no indication of widespread police harassment , as is the case in many regions for NORP IDPs . In those regions that condition sojourn registration upon the presence in that territory of close relatives , ethnic NORP IDPs may be able to rely upon the presence of family members displaced during DATE conflict . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG issued the \u201c FAC from GPE , GPE \u201d . This document states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Since DATE ORG \u201c Paper on the Situation of AsylumSeekers from GPE in the context of the situation in GPE \u201d , some positive developments have taken place in GPE , GPE ( hereinafter \u201c GPE \u201d ) . These include the adoption of a LAW , the organization of presidential elections , a number of amnesty declarations and the introduction of compensation mechanisms for lost housing and property . Despite this , the overall situation in GPE still raises grounds for serious concern due to targeted persecution , including arbitrary detentions , widespread violence , insecurity and violations of human rights , as well as ongoing hostilities significantly affecting the civilian population and leading to continued forced displacement . Moreover , NORP militants have claimed responsibility for an increasing number of attacks outside GPE , including the assault on law enforcement structures in GPE , in DATE , and the horrific attack in GPE , GPE - GPE , in DATE , which lead to the death of over QUANTITY civilians in DATE , including CARDINAL children . ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG security assessment maintains GPE at Phase V , preventing ORG ( including ORG ) from establishing a presence in GPE . As a result , ORG can not effectively monitor the situation of internally displaced persons or refugees who return to GPE . Some limited presence of national staff is currently under discussion .", "CARDINAL . Considering this situation and the lack of a genuine internal flight alternative within GPE , ORG maintains the position that :", "NORP whose place of permanent residence was GPE prior to their seeking asylum abroad should be considered in need of international protection , as they either :", "a ) have a well - founded fear of persecution and would therefore qualify as refugees under LAW relating to LAW ; and/or", "b ) have left GPE owing to serious and indiscriminate threats to life , physical safety or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order . \u201d", "According to GPE Department of State Annual Report on ORG for DATE in respect of GPE , which covers the period from DATE to DATE , religious matters are not a source of social tension for most citizens , although many citizens firmly believe that at least nominal adherence to ORG ( GPE ) is at the heart of the national identity . However , there are manifestations of hostility toward NORP and other non - NORP denominations . Instances of religiously motivated violence continue , although it often was difficult to determine whether xenophobic , religious , or ethnic prejudices were the primary motivation behind violent attacks . Conservative activists claiming ties to the GPE disseminated negative publications and staged demonstrations throughout the country against NORP , NORP , ORG , and other religions considered non - traditional . By most estimates , NORP constitute the third largest group of believers in GPE . Representative offices of foreign religious organisations are required to register with state authorities , and they are barred from conducting services and other religious activities unless they have acquired the status of a group or organisation . In practice , many foreign religious representative offices have opened without registering or have been accredited to a registered religious organisation . Representatives of minority religions have expressed the view that some Government officials , particularly in the security services , believe that minority religions \u2013 especially NORP , but also NORP , some NORP denominations and other groups DATE constitute security threats that require greater monitoring and possibly greater control . In DATE , GPE and ORG authorities adopted laws restricting missionary activity . The Kursk law was based on a DATE law that was passed in neighbouring ORG . Under these laws , foreigners visiting the region are forbidden to engage in missionary activity or to preach unless specifically allowed to do so according to their visas . Foreign religious and other workers have been deterred or prohibited from entering war zones in LOC , and information about religious activity in the area therefore is less available and reliable than for other regions .", "ORG report further mentions a number of incidents involving GPE communities , including the firebombing of a ORG on DATE in GPE following an allegedly pejorative coverage in a news broadcast on a local television channel in which NORP were presented as a \u201c totalitarian sect \u201d ; an unexplained explosion in DATE in a building belonging to a congregation of unregistered NORP in GPE ; picketing and distribution of NORP pamphlets by a youth group founded by the missionary department of ORG \u2019s NORP during DATE services at NORP churches in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
