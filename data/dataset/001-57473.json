Mr. PERSON , who is DATE , is a shipping clerk resident in GPE , GPE .", "Mr. PERSON is a homosexual and his complaints are directed primarily against the existence in GPE of laws which have the effect of making certain homosexual acts between consenting adult males criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions currently in force in GPE are contained in the Offences against LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) and the common law .", "Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , committing and attempting to commit buggery are made offences punishable with maximum sentences of life imprisonment and DATE imprisonment , respectively . Buggery consists of sexual intercourse per anum by a man with a man or a woman , or per anum or per vaginam by a man or a woman with an animal .", "By LAW of LAW , it is an offence , punishable with a maximum of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , for any male person , in public or in private , to commit an act of \" gross indecency \" with another male . \" PERSON indecency \" is not statutorily defined but relates to any act involving sexual indecency between male persons ; according to the evidence submitted to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it usually takes the form of mutual masturbation , inter - crural contact or oral - genital contact . At common law , an attempt to commit an offence is itself an offence and , accordingly , it is an offence to attempt to commit an act proscribed by LAW . An attempt is in theory punishable in GPE by an unlimited sentence ( but as to this , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Consent is no defence to any of these offences and no distinction regarding age is made in the text of the Acts .", "An account of how the law is applied in practice is given below at DATE .", "CARDINAL . Acts of homosexuality between females are not , and have never been , criminal offences , although the offence of indecent assault may be committed by CARDINAL woman on another under the age of DATE .", "As regards heterosexual relations , it is an offence , subject to certain exceptions , for a man to have sexual intercourse with a girl under DATE . Until DATE the age of consent of a girl to sexual intercourse was CARDINAL in both GPE and GPE and in GPE , but by legislation introduced in DATE of consent was increased to CARDINAL in GPE . While in relation to the corresponding offence in GPE and GPE it is a defence for a man under DATE to show that he believed with reasonable cause the girl to be over DATE , no such defence is available under GPE law .", "CARDINAL . DATE Acts were passed by ORG . When enacted , they applied to GPE and GPE , to all GPE , then unpartitioned and an integral part of GPE , and also , in the case of LAW , to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE the current law on male homosexual acts is contained in LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) as amended by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) .", "LAW , an Act consolidating the existing statute law , made it an offence for any person to commit buggery with another person or an animal ( section CARDINAL ) and an offence for a man to commit an act of \" gross indecency \" with another man ( section CARDINAL ) .", "LAW , which was introduced into ORG as a Private Member \u2019s PERSON , was passed to give effect to the recommendations concerning homosexuality made in DATE in the report of ORG established under the chairmanship of Sir PERSON ( ORG and \" PERSON report \" ) . ORG regarded the function of the criminal law in this field as", "\" to preserve public order and decency , to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious , and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others , particularly those who are specially vulnerable because they are young , weak in body or mind , inexperienced , or in a state of special physical , official , or economic dependence \" ,", "but not", "\" to intervene in the private lives of citizens , or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour , further than is necessary to carry out the purposes we have outlined \" .", "ORG concluded that homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private was part of the \" realm of private morality and immorality which is , in brief and crude terms , not the law \u2019s business \" and should no longer be criminal .", "The DATE Act qualified sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act by providing that , subject to certain exceptions concerning mental patients , members of the armed forces and merchant seamen , buggery and acts of gross indecency in private between consenting males aged DATE or over should not be criminal offences . It remains a crime to commit a homosexual act , of the kind referred to in these sections , with a person aged less than DATE in any circumstances .", "The age of majority for certain purposes , including capacity to marry without parental consent and to enter into contractual relations , was reduced from CARDINAL to CARDINAL by LAW DATE . The voting age and the minimum age for jury service were likewise reduced to CARDINAL by ORG and LAW DATE , respectively .", "In DATE , ORG rejected a PERSON aimed at reducing the age of consent for private homosexual act to CARDINAL . Subsequently , in a report published in DATE , a committee established by ORG , namely ORG , recommended that the minimum age for homosexual relations between males should be reduced to CARDINAL . A minority of CARDINAL members favoured a reduction to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant lodged his complaint in DATE , the relevant law applicable was substantially similar to that currently in force in GPE . Section CARDINAL of the Sexual Offences ( GPE ) Act DATE , a consolidating provision re - enacting section CARDINAL of LAW , provided for the offence of gross indecency ; the offence of sodomy existed at common law . However , successive Lord Advocates had stated in ORG that their policy was not to prosecute in respect of acts which would not have been punishable if LAW had applied in GPE . ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \" LAW \" ) formally brought NORP law into line with that of GPE and GPE . As in the case of LAW , the change in the law originated in amendments introduced in ORG by a Private Member .", "CARDINAL . Under an Act of ORG , ORG , a separate ORG for GPE was established with power to legislate on all matters devolved by that LAW , including criminal and social law . An executive known as the Government of GPE was also established with Ministers responsible for the different areas of the devolved powers . By convention , during the life of ORG ( DATE ) the ORG rarely , if ever , legislated for GPE in respect of the devolved matters - in particular social matters - falling within the former ORG \u2019s legislative competence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG was prorogued and GPE was made subject to \" direct rule \" from GPE ( see the judgment of DATE in the case of GPE v. GPE Series A no . DATE , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , par . CARDINAL and DATE ) . Since that date , except for DATE when certain legislative and executive powers were devolved to ORG and Executive , legislation for GPE in all fields has been the responsibility of ORG . There are CARDINAL members of ORG , out of a total of CARDINAL , who represent constituencies in GPE .", "Under the provisions currently in force , power is conferred on Her Majesty to legislate for GPE by ORG . Save where there are reasons of urgency , no recommendation may be made to Her Majesty to make an ORG under these provisions unless a draft of the LAW has been approved by ORG . It is the responsibility of the Government to prepare a draft Order and to lay it before ORG for approval . A draft can only be approved or rejected in toto by ORG , but not amended . The function of ORG in making an Order once it has been approved by ORG is purely formal . In practice , much legislation for GPE is effected in this form rather than by means of an Act of ORG .", "CARDINAL . No measures comparable to LAW were ever introduced into LOC Parliament either by the Government of GPE or by any Private Member .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the failure of GPE to work out a satisfactory form of devolved government for GPE , the then Secretary of ORG for GPE announced in ORG that ORG would thenceforth by looking closely at the need for legislation in fields which it had previously been thought appropriate to leave to a future devolved government , in particular with a view to bringing GPE law more closely into harmony with laws in other parts of the country . He cited homosexuality and divorce as possible areas for action . However , recognising the difficulties about such subjects in GPE , he indicated that he would welcome the views of the local people , including those of ORG ( \" ORG \" ) and of Members of ORG representing GPE constituencies .", "CARDINAL . ORG , which is an independent statutory body , was accordingly invited to consider the matter . As regards homosexual offences , ORG received evidence from a number of persons and organisations , religious and secular . No representations were made by ORG in GPE or by any of the CARDINAL GPE Members of ORG .", "ORG published its report in DATE . ORG concluded that most people did not regard it as satisfactory to retain the existing differences in the law with regard to homosexuality and that few only would be strongly opposed to changes bringing GPE law into conformity with that in GPE and GPE . On the other hand , it did not consider that there would be support for legislation which went further , in particular by lowering the age of consent . Its recommendations were that the law of GPE should be brought into line with LAW , but that future amendments to LAW should not automatically apply to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG published a proposal for a draft Homosexual Offences ( GPE ) DATE , the effect of which would have been to bring GPE law on the matter broadly into line with that of GPE and GPE . In particular , homosexual acts in private between CARDINAL consenting male adults over DATE would no longer have been punishable .", "In a foreword to the proposal , the responsible Minister stated that \" the Government had always recognised that homosexuality is an issue about which some people in GPE hold strong conscientious or religious opinions \" . He summarised the main arguments for and against reform as follows :", "\" In brief , there are CARDINAL differing viewpoints . CARDINAL , based on an interpretation of religious principles , holds that homosexual acts under any circumstances are immoral and that the criminal law should be used , by treating them as crimes , to enforce moral behaviour . The other view distinguishes between , on the one hand that area of private morality within which a homosexual individual can ( as a matter of civil liberty ) exercise his private right of conscience and , on the other hand , the area of public concern where the ORG ought and must use the law for the protection of society and in particular for the protection of children , those who are mentally retarded and others who are incapable of valid personal consent .", "I have during my discussions with religious and other groups heard both these viewpoints expressed with sincerity and I understand the convictions that underlie both points of view . There are in addition other considerations which must be taken into account . For example it has been pointed out that the present law is difficult to enforce , that fear of exposure can make a homosexual particularly vulnerable to blackmail and that this fear of exposure can cause unhappiness not only for the homosexual himself but also for his family and friends .", "While recognising these differing viewpoints I believe we should not overlook the common ground . Most people will agree that the young must be given special protection ; and most people will also agree that law should be capable of being enforced . Moreover those who are against reform have compassion and respect for individual rights just as much as those in favour of reform have concern for the welfare of society . For the individuals in society , as for Government , there is thus a difficult balance of judgment to be arrived at . \"", "Public comment on the proposed amendment to the law was invited .", "CARDINAL . The numerous comments received by the Government in response to their invitation , during and after the formal period of consultation , revealed a substantial division of opinion . On a simple count of heads , there was a large majority of individuals and institutions against the proposal for a draft Order .", "Those opposed to reform included a number of senior judges , ORG , ORG and other organisations , generally of a religious character and in some cases engaged in youth activities . A petition to \" Save GPE from Sodomy \" organised by ORG led by Mr. PERSON , a Member of ORG , collected CARDINAL signatures . The strongest opposition came from certain religious groups . In particular , ORG saw the proposal as an invitation to NORP society to change radically its moral code in a manner liable to bring about more serious problems than anything attributable to the present law . ORG argued that such a change in the law would lead to a further decline in moral standards and to a climate of moral laxity which would endanger and put undesirable pressures on those most vulnerable , namely the young . Similarly , ORG in GPE , whilst understanding the arguments for the change , made the point that the removal from the purview of the criminal law of private homosexual acts between consenting adult males might be taken by the public as an implicit licence if not approval for such practices and as a change in public policy towards a further relaxation of moral standards .", "The strongest support for change came from organisations representing homosexuals and social work agencies . They claimed that the existing law was unnecessary and that it created hardship and distress for a substantial minority of persons affected by it . It was urged that the sphere of morality should be kept distinct from that of the criminal law and that considerations of the personal freedom of the individual should in such matters be paramount . For its part , ORG accepted that homosexual acts in private between consenting adults aged DATE and over should be removed from the realm of criminal offence , but in amplification commented that this did not mean that the ORG considered homosexuality to be an acceptable norm .", "Press reports indicated that most of the political formations had expressed favourable views . However , none of the CARDINAL GPE Members of ORG publicly supported the proposed reform and several of them openly opposed it . An opinion poll conducted in GPE in DATE indicated that the people interviewed were evenly divided on the global question of the desirability of reforming the law on divorce and homosexuality so as to bring it into line with that of GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the then Secretary of ORG for GPE , in announcing to ORG that the Government did not intend to pursue the proposed reform , stated :", "\" Consultation showed that strong views are held in GPE , both for and against in the existing law . Although it is not possible to say with certainty what is the feeling of the majority of people in the province , it is clear that is substantial body of opinion there ( embracing a wide range of religious as well as political opinion ) is opposed to the proposed change ... [ T]he Government have [ also ] taken into account ... the fact that legislation on an issue such as the one dealt with in the draft order has traditionally been a matter for the initiative of a Private Member rather than for Government . At present , therefore , the Government propose to take no further action ... , but we would be prepared to reconsider the matter if there were any developments in the future which were relevant . \"", "CARDINAL . In its DATE report for DATE , ORG reiterated its view that law should be reformed . It believed that there was a danger that the volume of opposition might be exaggerated .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG was prorogued in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , there has been no initiative of any kind for legislation to amend DATE Acts from any of the mainstream political organisations or movements in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the general law , anyone , including a private person , may bring a prosecution for a homosexual offence , subject to the Director of Public Prosecutions\u2019 power to assume the conduct of the proceedings and , if he thinks fit , discontinue them . The evidence as to prosecutions for homosexual offences DATE reveals that none has been brought by a private person during that time .", "CARDINAL . During the period from DATE there were CARDINAL prosecutions for homosexual offences in GPE . The large majority of these cases involved minors that is persons DATE ; a few involved persons DATE or mental patients or prisoners . So far as the Government are aware from investigation of the records , no one was prosecuted in GPE during the period in question for an act which would clearly not have been an offence if committed in GPE or GPE . There is , however , no stated policy not to prosecute in respect of such acts . As was explained to ORG , instructions operative within the office of ORG reserve the decision on whether to prosecute in each individual case to the Director personally , in consultation with the Attorney General , the sole criterion being whether , on all the facts and circumstances of that case , a prosecution would be in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the maximum sentences prescribed by DATE Acts are appropriate only for the most grave instances of the relevant offence and in practice no court would ever contemplate imposing the maximum sentence for offences committed between consenting parties , whether in private or in public . Furthermore , although liable to an unlimited sentence , a man convicted of an attempt to commit gross indecency would in practice never receive a sentence greater than that appropriate if the offence had been completed ; in general , the sentence would be significantly less . In all cases of homosexual offences the actual penalty imposed will depend on the particular circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has , on his own evidence , been consciously homosexual from DATE . For some time he and others have been conducting a campaign aimed at bringing the law in GPE into line with that in force in GPE and GPE and , if possible , achieving a minimum age of consent lower than DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the police went to Mr. PERSON \u2019s address to execute a warrant under LAW DATE . During the search of the house a quantity of cannabis was found which subsequently led to another person being charged with drug offences . Personal papers , including correspondence and diaries , belonging to the applicant in which were described homosexual activities were also found and seized . As a result , he was asked to go to a police station where for CARDINAL he was questioned , on the basis of these papers , about his sexual life . The police investigation file was sent to ORG . It was considered with a view to instituting proceedings for the offence of gross indecency between males . The Director , in consultation with the Attorney General , decided that it would not be in the public interest for proceedings to be brought . Mr. PERSON was so informed in DATE and his papers , with annotations marked over them , were returned to him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
