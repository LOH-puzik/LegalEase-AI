At the time , the medical situation of the co - suspect PERSON , ORG desire to consider the cases together , and the fairly long duration of the detention on remand led to the decision to suspend the detention on remand until such time as the trial would resume .", "As soon as these reasons cease to apply ORG must consider the situation afresh .", "This does not mean that ORG will look back to see how well things have gone and what ripples your release has caused ( CARDINAL rumoer er over uw vrijlating is ontstaan ) , but that it will consider whether the serious reasons and grounds still exist .

Your personal interest in awaiting the determination of your case in freedom does not outweigh the prosecution interest . Your detention on remand should therefore continue , given also that there is no question at the present time of applying Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "The president stresses that ORG will continue to consider ex officio whether it is necessary for the detention on remand to continue , and whether there may be grounds to order a variant as regards the modalities of its execution .", "ORG dismisses both the principal and the alternative requests . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
