The applicant , who is a national of the ORG , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant resided in GPE , at which point he returned to GPE ( as the ORG was then called ) after having obtained a laissez - passer from ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was working in GPE , the ORG , as the personal secretary of a prominent member of the opposition party Union pour la PERSON Progr\u00e8s Social ( \u201c UDPS \u201d ) , who was also the editor of the opposition newspaper ORG . In DATE the applicant was contacted by unknown men who asked him to help assassinate his boss . The applicant refused , but DATE his boss disappeared and was then found unconscious and badly beaten . He died DATE in a local hospital . On DATE the applicant was arrested and put in prison ; he was never shown an arrest warrant . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the central PERSON prison in GPE . During the interrogations he was told he had been arrested because he had refused to help assassinate his boss . He was also told he would not live to see DATE . The applicant was beaten during the interrogation . On DATE the applicant managed to escape with the assistance of a guard who happened to be from the same tribe as the applicant . He stayed in the guard 's house while travel documents were arranged and on DATE the applicant flew to GPE . After arriving in GPE , the applicant was driven to the GPE where he requested asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted a residence permit for the purposes of asylum for an indefinite period ( verblijfsvergunning asiel voor onbepaalde PERSON ) on DATE since there were sufficient grounds to believe that he would be persecuted should he return to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request for naturalisation . On the basis of this request , the applicant was interviewed by an official from ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) on DATE . During the interview the applicant was confronted with the fact that , on DATE , he had been convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment in GPE for participation in a criminal organisation and possession of cocaine , by the GPE tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married PERSON with whom he had already had a son who was born on DATE . PERSON , also a national of the ORG , requested a residence permit for the purpose of staying with her spouse ( verblijfsvergunning voor verblijf bij echtgenoot ) and the permit was granted to her .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) notified the applicant of her intention ( voornemen ) to revoke the applicant 's residence permit pursuant to article CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) , which allows the withdrawal of a residence permit on the basis of a criminal conviction of a certain severity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her letter the Deputy Minister noted that the applicant had enjoyed legal residence in the GPE since DATE and that his conviction in GPE dated back to DATE . She further concluded that , according to NORP sentencing guidelines , a sentence of DATE imprisonment would have been imposed on the applicant had the offence been committed in the GPE . The Deputy Minister concluded accordingly that the length of the sentence , compared to the length of time the applicant had been living in the GPE , justified revoking the applicant 's residence permit . Considering that the applicant had been granted asylum in the GPE , the Deputy Minister held that a forced return of the applicant would have to be in compliance with the non - refoulement principle contained in FAC . In this regard the Deputy Minister considered that an individual report ( ambtsbericht ) from ORG explained that there had already been some doubts , given certain inconsistencies in the applicant 's story , when he had applied for asylum and that a new individual report had confirmed these doubts created by the inconsistencies . Moreover , since the applicant had left the ORG , regime changes had taken place in that country in DATE . The Deputy Minister considered that since the applicant had not shown that he had anything to fear from the new regime , he had not established that he would still face a real and personal risk of persecution in his country of origin . Finally , the Deputy Minister considered that revoking the applicant 's residence permit did not constitute an interference with the applicant 's right to respect for family life under the ORG since the interests of public order outweighed the interests of the applicant . Furthermore , it had become known that the applicant and his wife had separated , that he had not had any contact with her or their child for DATE and that there were no indications that he was actively participating in the upbringing of their son . In any event , since the applicant , his wife and their son all had NORP nationality , there were no objective obstacles for them to continue their family life in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his written comments ( zienswijze ) of DATE , the applicant disputed the finding that he would have been sentenced to DATE imprisonment in the GPE for an offence similar to the CARDINAL he had committed in GPE . The applicant argued that there was no set indication of the length of a sentence but that the individual circumstances of the person concerned would always be taken into consideration . It was therefore not possible to determine what kind of sentence he would have received had he been tried by a NORP court . The applicant further submitted that the grounds on which he had been granted his residence permit were still valid and that the reports used by the Deputy Minister in no way detracted from that . A forced return to the ORG would therefore entail a violation of the Convention . The applicant also submitted that he could exercise his family life only in the GPE , since his wife and child were living there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before an official board of inquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) and on DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie , the successor to the Deputy Minister of DATE hereafter \u201c the Minister \u201d ) issued a decision to revoke the applicant 's residence permit . The Minister considered that the estimate of a CARDINAL sentence in the GPE for the NORP offence was indeed correct , as an advisory letter from the prosecutor at ORG of ' s - Hertogenbosch ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) stated that a CARDINAL sentence would have represented the minimum length of sentence the prosecutor could have sought based on the facts available to him . The Minister further noted that the applicant 's statement regarding his arrest in GPE before the official board of inquiry differed from the original statement he had given during the interviews that were conducted pursuant to his request for naturalisation on DATE . From these new statements the Minister concluded that the applicant had been fully aware of his actions when transporting the drugs across the border between the GPE and GPE . The Minister further noted that although the applicant had stated during the hearing before the board that he had had no further contact with judicial authorities , he had in fact been convicted of a number of insurance offences as well as violations of the DATE Road Traffic Act ( Wegenverkeerswet DATE ) . Concerning the risk of persecution that the applicant would face upon his return to the ORG , the Minister considered that the reports of ORG did disclose discrepancies in the applicant 's story . The Minister further considered that it had been concluded in the intention to revoke the applicant 's residence permit that the situation in the ORG had changed since the applicant had last been in that country and that he had failed to establish that he would still be at risk of persecution there . A forced return to the ORG would thus not be in violation of ORG , nor would it be contrary to LAW . Moreover , the applicant had been convicted of a drugs - related offence . For these reasons the Minister considered that the interests of the ORG in protecting public order outweighed the interests of the applicant . Finally , the Minister noted that the applicant and his wife ( with whom he had been reconciled by then ) and child all had NORP nationality and that there were no objective obstacles for them to continue their family life in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . By submissions of DATE and DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of the Minister to ORG of The Hague . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . ORG considered that the Minister had been correct in applying article CARDINAL of LAW and that the estimated sentence of DATE imprisonment , had the offence been committed in the GPE , was reasonable as well . ORG further determined that the Minister had been correct in taking notice of the reports from ORG in finding that the applicant 's original story contained inconsistencies . The resulting lack of credibility of the applicant 's story was sufficient to show that the applicant would not face a real , personal risk of treatment contrary to LAW upon his return to the ORG . The Minister had therefore been entitled to attach more weight to the protection of public order in relation to the interests of the applicant . ORG finally considered that the applicant had failed to establish a possible violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment of ORG to ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON \u2013 \u201c the NORP \u201d ) on essentially the same grounds . The applicant added , however , that according to a letter dated DATE from the prosecutor in PERSON ( which the Minister had neglected to add to the case file and for which ORG had reopened the proceedings so that it could be introduced ) , the prosecutor in PERSON did not have possession of the complete NORP case file and had thus only been able to estimate the length of the sentence that could be imposed . Furthermore , a judicial sentencing document submitted in the proceedings showed that a similar offence in the GPE would attract a custodial sentence of DATE . A sentence of that duration would not engage the consequences of LAW of LAW , meaning that the applicant 's residence permit would not be in jeopardy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The ORG considered that the Minister had correctly applied the provisions of LAW of LAW in determining the length of imprisonment had the offence been committed in the GPE , based on the information obtained from the prosecutor in PERSON . In particular , the ORG considered that the indication of DATE and DATE sentence applied solely in relation to the possession of cocaine and did not include the charge of participation in a criminal organisation . The remaining grounds of appeal submitted by the applicant were dismissed summarily as not raising any points of law warranting determination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant currently lives in the GPE and has since divorced his wife but continues to visit her and their child regularly .", "CARDINAL . After the introduction of the application the applicant informed the ORG by a letter of DATE that he had spent DATE in an aliens ' detention centre in GPE after being apprehended there without a valid residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's original asylum application was submitted under article LAW DATE ( PERSON ) , pursuant to which aliens coming from a country where they had a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political conviction , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted by the Minister of ORG as refugees .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens have been governed by LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) , LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit DATE ) , the Regulation on Aliens CARDINAL ( ORG DATE ) and LAW CARDINAL ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) . LAW ( PERSON ) is also applicable , except where otherwise stipulated .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to article QUANTITY of LAW , an asylum - based right of abode that was valid at the time that LAW entered into force automatically entails a permanent residence permit under that LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under the policy laid down in article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW in conjunction with article LAW ( c ) of LAW , an alien who has been given a custodial sentence ( at least part of which was not suspended ) by a NORP or foreign court in a judgment that has become final and conclusive , for intentionally committing an offence punishable by a custodial sentence of DATE or more , could be refused permission for continued residence in the country . Underlying this policy is the principle that the longer an alien has lawfully resided in the GPE , the more serious the offence has to be before it may justify refusing continued residence ; the authorities thus apply a \u201c sliding scale \u201d ( glijdende schaal ) . The seriousness of an offence is determined on the basis of the sentence attached to it . To determine whether an alien may be refused permission for continued residence , the length of the sentence imposed is compared to the length of time that the alien had been living in the GPE when he or she committed the offence .", "CARDINAL . The revocation of a residence permit is also assessed in the light of the principle of non - refoulement and whether returning the alien to his country of origin would be in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The respondent ORG 's policy on asylum seekers from the ORG is devised by the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) and , was temporarily \u2013 DATE and DATE devised by the Minister for ORG . It is based on official country reports published by the Minister of ORG and external sources .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the applicant 's initial request for asylum , his application was assessed on the basis of the official country reports of DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE in conjunction with ORG Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Democratic Republic of Congo ( formerly GPE ) of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the period when the applicant 's residence permit was revoked , applications from the ORG were assessed on the basis of the GPE official country report of DATE . Since then further reports have been issued by the GPE Minister of ORG in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and the latest in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The GPE authorities operate on the basis that the human rights situation in the ORG remains a cause for concern , but that it is not such that every asylum seeker should automatically be deemed a refugee within the meaning of the DATE Convention relating to LAW . The latest official country report of DATE classifies the general security situation as such :", "\u201c During the entire reporting period the NORP authorities were unable to control their territory in large parts of the country , as well as to ensure the safety of citizens and maintain their monopoly on the use of force . In both the GPE and GPE province the security situation remained under pressure due to military operations of the NORP army against the FDLR , after which the ORG resorted to large scale retaliations . Other rebel factions , including several ORG , caused a large decrease in security . In the Haut- en ORG districts in the LOC province there was an increase in attacks by the PERSON despite military actions by the LAW . In the district of GPE militias of the ORG and FPJC fought with the ORG and launched assaults on villages . In all areas where ORG units were stationed and active the security situation was such that soldiers displayed severe misconduct towards the civilian population . The former rebel faction ORG , which had recently integrated into the ORG , played a key role in these infractions . At the end of the reporting period the security situation in the Equateur province deteriorated because of violent confrontations between a number of ethnic groups who later turned against the ORG . In the remaining parts of the country the security situation remained stable , although some security incidents occurred in the Bas - Congo province . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report describes the overall situation in the ORG as follows :", "\u201c Efforts to stabilize the eastern region of GPE witnessed significant setbacks during the reporting period . The processes relating to the GPE statements of commitment ( actes d'engagement ) and the GPE communiqu\u00e9 stalled , and large - scale hostilities between ORG ( ORG ) and the ORG national pour la d\u00e9fense du peuple ( ORG ) , led by PERSON , resumed on DATE . The fighting , which spread throughout GPE , has further exacerbated the humanitarian crisis , displacing over CARDINAL people and bringing the number of internally displaced persons in the eastern part of the country to CARDINAL . Exchanges of fire across the border between GPE and GPE , as well as a resurgence of armed groups in GPE and a resumption of atrocities committed by the Lord 's Resistance Army ( PERSON ) , further compounded the crisis in the area . While the security situation remained stable elsewhere in GPE , little progress was achieved in the key peace consolidation tasks , including the delivery of basic services and the extension of ORG authority . Preparations for local elections continued , but key legislation , without which the necessary preparatory work can not proceed , has yet to be adopted , risking further delays in the conduct of the elections . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning freedom of speech in the ORG and the treatment of ORG supporters , the report stated :", "\u201c Generally individuals could privately criticize the government , its officials , and private citizens without being subject to official reprisals . However , on DATE , ORG agents in GPE arbitrarily arrested and detained a member of ORG Goma for discussing politics with local citizens . The victim , who was released on DATE after the PERSON intervened , claimed that he was subjected to cruel , inhumane , and degrading treatment while in detention . No action had been taken against the responsible ORG agents by DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning political rights and parties , the report stated :", "\u201c The ORG is not an electoral democracy . The DATE elections were a significant improvement over previous elections , but serious problems remained . The opposition ORG ( UDPS ) party did not participate as a result of the party leader 's call for a boycott of the recent constitutional referendum . International observers noted voter registration irregularities and corruption . The campaign period included clashes between opposition militants and government forces as well as an attempt on opposition leader PERSON life . The DATE ORG elections were similarly plagued by political corruption , with allegations of vote buying . Local elections initially scheduled for DATE were delayed until DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the treatment of failed asylum - seekers upon return to the ORG , the report noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The ORG response on the ill - treatment of failed asylum seekers returned to GPE noted : ' The NORP human rights NGO ' Voix des Sans Voix ' informed the office that rejected asylum - seekers are received upon arrival at the airport by agents of ORG , who question them why they left and applied for asylum . The NGO had an office at the airport and are closely monitoring the situation . They mentioned that there were many failed asylum - seekers who are sent back by western NORP countries , but they are not aware of any of these persons detained and/or tortured upon return . They reported that some of the failed asylum - seekers had to pay some money to the police ( CARDINAL to CARDINAL USD ) .

' did not hold the information to confirm the existence of instances of the detention , abuse or torture of failed asylum - seekers . The ORG response concluded ' With the limited information available to ORG , it does not have evidence that there is a systematic abuse , including detention and mistreatment , of failed asylum - seekers returned to the ORG through GPE airport .

All of his interlocutors had said that the stories of abuse that they had heard had all come from LOC , and that their investigations had shown the allegations to be either false , or doubtful due to lack of evidence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
