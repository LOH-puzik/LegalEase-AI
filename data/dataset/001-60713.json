On DATE Mr PERSON , store manager , was shot dead in the manager 's office of a ORG supermarket in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and another man , by the name of PERSON , were arrested on suspicion of having committed a robbery at the Late Saver shop , PERSON . At the time , they were in possession of an CARDINAL-mm Beretta replica handgun . Charged in connection with this offence , Mr Grant admitted to the offence and several other TIME shop robberies . The applicant denied involvement in any of the offences . On or CARDINAL DATE an anonymous informant told the police that the applicant had been involved in the murder of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON appeared in custody at ORG and were further remanded in custody to reappear on DATE . On DATE Detective Chief Inspector PERSON requested permission for the cell and the visiting areas used by the applicant and PERSON to be bugged with audio and video technology , alleging that all regular methods of investigation to identify PERSON murderer had failed . The Chief Constable of ORG granted authority on DATE for an unlimited period for both the police stations at GPE and PERSON . On DATE similar authority was sought and obtained for the installation of a listening device with video system to be placed in the visiting area of GPE police station , where the applicant was then held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested for the murder and questioned . In the interviews with the police which followed , the police told the applicant that he was not obliged to say anything . He availed himself of that right .", "CARDINAL . During this time visits to the applicant by his female friend , ORG , were recorded on audio and videotape in the prison visiting area DATE . The applicant and PERSON were held for long periods in the same cell and recordings of their conversations were made from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was brought to NORP police station . PERSON was a long - standing police informant with a criminal record who had been arrested on DATE for unrelated offences . He was placed in the applicant 's cell for the purpose of eliciting information from the applicant . As asserted by the applicant , PERSON had every incentive to inform on him . Telephone conversations between PERSON and the police included comments by the police instructing PERSON to \u201c push him for what you can \u201d and disclosed evidence of concerted police coaching . After DATE he associated regularly with the applicant who was remanded at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken away from the prison to be interviewed by the police concerning ORG robbery . He was attended and advised by his solicitor . During the course of the interview , the applicant was invited to comment on the recordings made in DATE and DATE . He made no comment to any question . According to the applicant , he was interrogated at length by the police in an attempt to \u201c rattle \u201d or unsettle him , such that he would be more talkative and vulnerable to PERSON upon his return to the prison . H. had been fitted with recording devices . The recording thereby obtained was adduced in evidence at the applicant 's trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed again in the presence of his solicitor on DATE and DATE and remained silent when faced with the allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE made a CARDINAL- to CARDINAL-page witness statement detailing his conversations with the applicant and was released on bail on DATE . His sentence was postponed until after he had given evidence at the applicant 's trial . The high point of ORG 's evidence was the assertion that the applicant had admitted his presence at the murder scene . This asserted admission was not part of the recorded interview and was disputed . The thrust of the applicant 's case was that he was discussing robberies and did not accede to ORG 's efforts to channel their conversation into a discussion of the murder . The audio- and video - recordings ( or transcripts thereof ) were utilised in the trial of the applicant . No evidence , other than the alleged admissions , connected the applicant with the killing of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's trial on CARDINAL count of murder and a count of conspiracy to PERSON began before a jury . He was represented by leading counsel .", "CARDINAL . During his trial , the applicant 's counsel challenged the admissibility of extracts from covert audio- and video - recordings of conversations of the applicant with PERSON and ORG , under sections DATE and CARDINAL of ORG PACE ) . The judge concluded that there was evidence on the tapes from which the jury could infer that the applicant was involved in the events of DATE , and it was not so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to assess for themselves . The judge also rejected the applicant 's counsel 's arguments under sections DATE and CARDINAL of PACE that the evidence from ORG was obtained by oppression or by such impropriety as to render it inadmissible . He considered that the use of an informant to talk and listen to the accused over a substantial period of time did not result in any unfairness to the accused . The fact that H. might be considered as having much to gain in giving evidence was also a matter to be left to the jury in their assessment of the reliability of his evidence . The evidence was accordingly admitted before the jury . The judge 's ruling on the admissibility of the evidence was given on DATE , after a voir dire ( submissions on a point of law in the absence of a jury ) and consisted of a judgment of CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . In his summing - up to the jury on CARDINAL and QUANTITY DATE , the trial judge gave directions on the way in which the jury should assess the reliability of the disputed evidence . He told them that they were to judge whether the police had deliberately wound up the applicant during the interview on DATE and how to approach the evidence put forward by H. :", "\u201c So at DATE with regard to H. you have his evidence about the conversations that he had with [ the applicant ] and what [ the applicant ] said . You have the tape recordings of the conversations on DATE when PERSON had been wired up , between [ the applicant ] and PERSON , and you have the transcripts of the conversations between PERSON and the police . I suggest ... that you approach the evidence of PERSON with the very greatest caution and care . He is a professional criminal . He behaved , and has behaved as he acknowledged , dishonestly and criminally for DATE . He saw the likelihood of advantage to himself , both in terms of bail and in the sentence that he was likely to receive . You have heard that he has not yet been sentenced on matters for which he was in custody in DATE . The defence say if you consider the whole picture you simply can not rely upon ORG ; quite unsafe to do so . The prosecution say the contents of the tapes of DATE can be relied on and are consistent with what PERSON says [ the applicant ] had said to him previously , before he , PERSON , was wired up . Of course tapes of ... conversations can not possibly constitute any independent confirmation of what PERSON says about what [ the applicant ] had said to him previously , because , and you will understand the logic of that , the information is all coming from CARDINAL source , namely PERSON and the witness can not strengthen his own evidence essentially by repetition .", "So , ladies and gentlemen , at DATE how do you regard H. ? Was he or may he have been lying , or are you sure that he was telling the truth ? If you are sure , for example , in relation to things said on the tapes of DATE or other aspects of ORG 's evidence that his evidence is true , that [ the applicant ] did say a number of things , what do those things mean ? Do they point to his guilt , to his presence at ORG on DATE , or are they capable of meaning something else ? ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also directed the jury concerning the possible drawing of inferences from the applicant 's silence in police interview on CARDINAL and DATE and DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE . He reminded the jury that the defence had contended that the applicant 's silence had been adopted on legal advice because of the view that oppressive interrogation techniques were being used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the jury had deliberated for a total of CARDINAL and a half hours , the applicant was convicted of murder before ORG at GPE by a majority of CARDINAL and sentenced to life imprisonment . The applicant thereafter lodged a notice of appeal , asserting , inter alia , that the judge ought to have excluded evidence of the audio- and video - recordings of his conversations with PERSON and J.N.S. and the evidence put forward by PERSON also argued that the judge had erred in his directions as to the circumstances in which the jury could draw inferences from the applicant 's failure to respond to police questions in interviews of CARDINAL and DATE , when the police strategy was to \u201c spook \u201d the applicant into a state of garrulousness when he returned to prison , where he had a conversation with H.", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was refused leave to appeal against his conviction by a single judge . His renewed application was refused by ORG ) on DATE", "CARDINAL . Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations ( ORG of DATE ) provide that only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to give authority for the use of such devices . The Guidelines are available in the library of ORG and are disclosed by ORG on application . They provide , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In each case , the authorising officer should satisfy himself that the following criteria are met :", "the investigation concerns serious crime ;", "normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed , or must from the nature of things , be unlikely to succeed if tried ;", "there must be good reason to think that use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction , or where appropriate , to the prevention of acts of terrorism ;", "use of equipment must be operationally feasible .", "CARDINAL . In judging how far the seriousness of the crime under investigation justifies the use of a particular surveillance technique , authorising officers should satisfy themselves that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Guidelines also state that there may be circumstances in which material so obtained could appropriately be used in evidence at subsequent court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy . The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations , including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process , came into force on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE these controls have been augmented by Part II of ORG ( RIPA ) . In particular , covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of RIPA . ORG also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police .", "CARDINAL . Section DATE provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In any proceedings a confession made by an accused person may be given in evidence against him in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of this section .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a confession made by an accused person , it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained \u2013", "( a ) by oppression of the person who made it ; or", "( b ) in consequence of anything said or done which was likely , in the circumstances existing at the time , to render unreliable any confession that might be made by him in consequence thereof ,", "the court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidence against him except in so far as the prosecution proves to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the confession , notwithstanding that it might be true , was not obtained as aforesaid . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that , having regard to all the circumstances , including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained , the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties have referred to cases concerning the use of informers to obtain incriminating statements from persons in police custody .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , the accused had relied on his right to silence when questioned by the police . He had then been placed in a cell with an undercover police officer to whom he made statements implicating himself in a robbery . ORG held that the statements of the undercover officer should have been excluded at trial . PERSON said , inter alia :", "\u201c The common - law rules related to the right to silence suggest that the scope of the right in the pre - trial period must be based on the fundamental concept of the suspect 's right to choose whether to speak to the authorities or remain silent ...", "When the police use subterfuge to interrogate an accused after he had advised them that he does not wish to speak to them , they are improperly eliciting information that they were unable to obtain by respecting the suspect 's constitutional right to silence : the suspect 's rights are breached because he has been deprived of his choice . However , in the absence of eliciting behaviour on the part of the police , there is no violation of the accused 's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police . If the suspect speaks , it is by his or her own choice , and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , PERSON was arrested and held for questioning in respect of a suspicious death . He had spoken to a lawyer who had advised him to remain silent . The police arranged for a friend to visit B. in custody while carrying a body - pack recording device . The friend questioned PERSON about his involvement in the murder and in the words of ORG \u201c sought to exploit the [ accused 's ] trust in him as a friend to undermine the [ accused 's ] confidence in his lawyer 's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the [ accused ] was more likely to talk \u201d . ORG held that it was wrong to admit the evidence obtained by the friend that the accused knew the time of the deceased 's death . According to the headnote of the reported case :", "\u201c The right to silence is triggered when the accused is subjected to the coercive powers of the ORG through his or her detention . The right protects against the use of ORG power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities . Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a ORG agent , the analysis must focus on both the relationship between the informer and the ORG and the relationship between the informer and the accused . The right to silence will only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the ORG at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement . Accordingly CARDINAL distinct inquiries are required . First ... was the evidence obtained by an agent of the ORG ? Second , was the evidence elicited ? The right to silence ... will be violated only if both questions are answered in the affirmative .", "Applying the above principles to the facts of this case , it is clear that the informer was an agent of the ORG for the purposes of the right to silence in section CARDINAL [ of LAW ] . The conversation here would not have occurred or would have been materially different but for the authorities ' intervention . Furthermore , the impugned statement was elicited . Parts of the conversation were functionally the equivalent of an interrogation and the appellant 's trust in the informer as a friend was used to undermine the appellant 's confidence in his lawyer 's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the appellant was more likely to talk . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , the accused was arrested in connection with a cocaine deal and the police also pretended to arrest the undercover officer who negotiated the transaction . They were placed together in an interview room where the accused initiated a conversation referring to the arrest . The undercover officer asked the accused : \u201c What happened ? \u201d , and stated : \u201c Yeah . They got my fingerprints on the dope . \u201d The accused replied : \u201c PERSON and me too . \u201d ORG found nothing to suggest that the exchange was the functional equivalent of an interrogation . It was of no consequence that the police officer was engaged in a subterfuge , permitted himself to be misidentified or lied , so long as the responses were not actively elicited or the result of interrogation . In this case the conversation had been initiated by the accused and the police officer picked up the flow and content of the conversation without directing or redirecting it in a sensitive area . Nor was there any relationship of trust between the accused and the officer or any appearance that the accused was obligated or vulnerable to the officer .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG of Australia CARDINAL ) , the accused PERSON was CARDINAL of the targets of an undercover operation aimed at identifying drug suppliers and also suspected of arson . An undercover officer held a conversation with the accused pretending that his own brother - in - law was suspected of arson and the accused made admissions of his own involvement in a fire . ORG of GPE found that the admissions should not have been admitted at trial as they had been elicited by a police officer in clear breach of the accused 's right to choose whether or not to speak . The accused PERSON had been questioned by the police about a disappeared person and remained silent . After his release from custody , PERSON made incriminatory statements to a friend called PERSON , who had been fitted with a listening device by the police . ORG found that there was no impropriety involved and the admissions were reliable and should be admitted . C. had not been a police officer or a person in authority over PERSON . The fact that C. was regarded as trustworthy by PERSON was an indicator of the reliability of the admissions ; a serious crime had been committed and there was no public interest to be served by rejecting the admissions . PERSON stated :", "\u201c Subterfuge , ruses and tricks may be lawfully employed by the police , acting in the public interest . ... The critical question is not whether the accused has been tricked and secretly recorded . It is not even whether the trick has resulted in self - incrimination , electronically preserved to do great damage to the accused at trial . It is whether the trick may be thought to involve such unfairness to the accused or otherwise to be so contrary to public policy that a court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence notwithstanding its high probative value . In the case of covertly obtained confessions , the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police ( or by a person acting as an agent of the police ) in unfair derogation of the suspect 's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
