ORG The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . Her early life was marked by disruptive and aggressive behaviour , and she spent several periods in mental hospitals after drug overdoses and bouts of violence .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , whilst in hospital , she married X , a compulsorily detained patient . They had difficulty in managing their financial affairs and were \" manipulative \" of staff and patients . Both were discharged from hospital in DATE , but voluntarily remained as out - patients . In DATE , the applicant rejoined her family and had a pregnancy terminated , but following her return to X was again admitted to a mental hospital . On DATE , she gave birth to A.", "CARDINAL . ORG The local ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) , which had been involved in providing social - worker support to the applicant and X , considered that it was only a matter of time before A suffered if she remained with them . X was very frequently violent or abusive and the applicant was impulsive , unpredictable and liable to irrational outbursts ; the help received from the social services was apparently not sufficient to reverse these behavioural patterns . Even the separation of X and the applicant , who on the advice of a welfare worker had been admitted to hospital with A as a voluntary patient on DATE , was not expected radically to alter the position .", "CARDINAL . The ORG therefore applied to a juvenile court for a place of safety order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of A. Such an order was made on DATE . On DATE and DATE , the juvenile court made interim care orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of the child and , on DATE , following an application by the ORG to ORG , she became a ward of court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant left X and subsequently , in DATE , obtained a divorce from him .", "CARDINAL . ORG A was placed in a nursery where the applicant saw her for access CARDINAL times between DATE and DATE . During some of this period the applicant was in a home for battered wives , where she gave indications of violence on QUANTITY occasions .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant applied , unsuccessfully , to the ORG pursuant to the wardship jurisdiction for staying access . Following a further application of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , she was permitted CARDINAL ORG access once DATE , initially at the nursery and subsequently at her GPE home . Access visits occurred pursuant to this order until DATE and the applicant \u2019s overall handling of A was not open to serious criticism . She had in DATE met H , whom she was later to marry and who had a very significant stabilising effect on her ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant subsequently applied to the ORG pursuant to the wardship jurisdiction for care and control of A. During the DATE hearing , which ended on DATE , she altered her application to CARDINAL for increased access , including staying access . The ORG contended that the existing access arrangements should be retained but not increased . In a report dated DATE , ORG , representing A as guardian ad litem ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , expressed no firm view but hoped that the recent improvement in the applicant \u2019s behaviour would continue . Evidence was given by CARDINAL doctors , CARDINAL ( who had not met the applicant ) on behalf of the ORG and CARDINAL on behalf of the applicant .", "ORG refused the application , terminated the applicant \u2019s access to A and committed A to the care of the ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the course of his judgment the judge made a recommendation , which was formally recorded in his order of DATE and apparently reflected the evidence of CARDINAL of the doctors and the final submission of ORG , that A be adopted . This took the ORG and the applicant by surprise as neither of them had dealt with this possibility in their pleadings . However , the applicant did not exercise her right of appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG It appears that in the light of this recommendation the ORG decided within a short period to place A for adoption . On DATE , the adoption health forms were sent to the appropriate doctor for completion and , between then and DATE , the relevant forms were also sent to the applicant . She received , inter alia , the Explanatory Memorandum required by LAW , the first sentence of which reads : \" This Memorandum must be given to the parent ... of a child who is about to be adopted \" , and she was therefore informed from this moment of the ORG \u2019s decision . Indeed , it appears that on DATE a social worker visited the applicant to discuss adoption and her refusal to sign the certificate at the end of the said Memorandum . At this time , the ORG withdrew its social - worker support for the applicant , in the context of her relationship with A , since it was no longer envisaged that this relationship should be nurtured . The ORG subsequently proceeded to seek - and ultimately , on DATE , found - prospective adopters .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant married H. Thereafter , her mental and physical position stabilised and , by DATE , there were signs of a substantial improvement in her health . She and her husband persistently but unsuccessfully approached the ORG with a view to re - establishing contact between herself and A , who had remained in a residential nursery . Their interviews with the social services in DATE and DATE were marked by tension and a deterioration of relations with the social workers . In DATE , the ORG informed them that they would be told as soon as a placement for A was found , so that they could put their point of view in court .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the light of their stable relationship , the applicant and H considered that the ORG was unreasonable in refusing them access to A. They therefore instituted , on DATE , proceedings before the ORG pursuant to the wardship jurisdiction to re - establish access ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to ORG report ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they had , on their solicitors\u2019 advice , deferred making an approach to the courts so that they could show that the applicant \u2019s health had improved and that she had a stable home . The summons issued for access in favour of the applicant was due to be heard on DATE . On DATE , the court ordered H to file evidence in support of the application within DATE and the ORG to file evidence DATE thereafter . Leave was granted for A to be examined by a psychiatrist nominated by ORG if he saw fit and for all parties to file psychiatric evidence about other parties to the proceedings , including H and A. The summons was then adjourned , with liberty to the parties to restore it .", "In subsequent proceedings before ORG , it was agreed that at the hearing on DATE , the ORG , though apparently without mentioning that it had found prospective adopters in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had made its intention to place A for adoption quite clear . All the parties seem to have acquiesced in such placement , to be followed by a combined hearing on the adoption and the access questions , which hearing they clearly envisaged would be held in TIME , before the DATE long vacation . In particular , the applicant made no request that the placement be postponed and the ORG raised no objection to filing its evidence within the time - limit set .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , A was introduced to the prospective adopters for the first time . After a series of visits , the ORG placed her with them on DATE , a fact of which the applicant was not informed .", "CARDINAL . ORG Allegedly on account of DATE period and the need to seek legal aid , H was late in filing his evidence , which did not reach ORG until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Council thereupon failed to meet its deadline of DATE . The applicant \u2019s solicitor , who had written to ORG on the subject on DATE without receiving a reply , wrote again on DATE indicating that , unless its evidence was lodged within DATE , he would refer the question back to the court . When the ORG telephoned him on DATE to assure him that the filing would be effected within DATE , he replied that this would not be sufficient and that the matter was urgent . However , he did not at this point make any further approach to the court .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the solicitor had written to the ORG asking for a report on A \u2019s condition . Following a reminder dated DATE , the ORG replied on DATE that \" A has continued to make good progress and has maintained normal development in all spheres \" . No reference was made in that letter , or otherwise , to the fact that A had been placed with prospective adopters . The latter had , on DATE , notified the ORG of their intention to apply for her adoption .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the Official Solicitor informed the applicant \u2019s solicitor in correspondence that he was unable to arrange for his enquiries for the purpose of the access and adoption proceedings to be made until the ORG had filed its evidence ; he described the delay on the latter \u2019s part as \" quite unacceptable \" . The applicant \u2019s solicitor instructed GPE agents with a view to applying for an order directing the ORG to file , and he pressed the ORG again on the matter on DATE . On DATE , he informed the Official Solicitor that the agents were having \" extreme difficulty with obtaining dates in GPE [ for a hearing to order the ORG to file evidence ] due to the recent civil service dispute \" . The Government have indicated that there does not appear to have been any particular backlog or listing difficulty at that time .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG informed the solicitor that the relevant affidavits were substantially complete and would be signed in DATE . On DATE , he nevertheless served a summons , returnable on DATE , on the ORG to order it to comply with ORG direction of DATE . On DATE , the ORG acknowledged by telephone receipt of the summons and stated that the evidence would be available by DATE . However , it was not . The registrar directed the ORG to file within DATE and ordered costs against it .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL affidavits were filed by ORG and were received by the applicant \u2019s solicitor on DATE . On DATE , he and his client became aware for the first time that A had been placed for adoption during DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG filed a further affidavit on DATE . The Official Solicitor received copies of these affidavits on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Until DATE , ORG had also been unaware of ORG \u2019s placement for adoption . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor asked him if his report on the child was now prepared . On DATE , he replied that no arrangements had yet been made to visit the parties nor had a consultant psychiatrist been instructed ; he had , however , been informed by the ORG that the prospective adopters of A had instructed solicitors and proposed to apply to ORG for leave to commence adoption proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Official Solicitor stated : \" if this is the case it seems to me that it would be more sensible for your client \u2019s application for access and the application for adoption to be heard together , but as soon as I have heard from the foster GPE solicitors the exact position I shall write to you further . \" The applicant \u2019s solicitor replied on DATE , stressing that since the ORG had for so long taken no steps in relation to the proposed adoption proceedings , it should not further delay the hearing of his client \u2019s application for access . On DATE , the Official Solicitor confirmed that he would arrange \" in the near future \" for the visits and the instruction of the psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . ORG There followed correspondence between the applicant \u2019s solicitor and the solicitors acting for the prospective adopters of A as to whether it was necessary to seek leave to initiate adoption proceedings in the light of the adoption recommendation recorded in ORG order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The changed since then and that leave should therefore be sought anew , A still being a ward of court . The latter stated that they were ignorant of the proceedings taken thus far in wardship but considered that the adoption and access issues should be decided at the same time . By letter of DATE , the Official Solicitor confirmed that he agreed with the second approach since it would save costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor again pressed the Official Solicitor to proceed in the matter since no further steps had been taken with regard to the proposed adoption proceedings and this was delaying the hearing of his client \u2019s application for access . He was informed by ORG on DATE that the latter had received a draft of the evidence to be submitted in relation to the proposed adoption . According to the Government , ORG could not commence his enquiries for the combined purpose of the access and the adoption proceedings until he had received this evidence . It appears that the originating summons for the adoption was in fact issued on DATE and that the evidence of the prospective adopters was filed on CARDINAL DATE and received by ORG on DATE .", "The Official Solicitor appears to have commenced his formal enquiries on DATE and on DATE he confirmed to the applicant \u2019s solicitor that a psychiatrist \u2019s report was in the course of preparation , on receipt of which the wardship and adoption reports would be prepared and filed . By DATE , ORG had completed his enquiries and it was possible to fix a date for the hearing . The parties - without reference to ORG , who would have preferred an earlier date - chose DATE , the first available date in term - time ; they made no attempt to ask the court to certify the case as fit for vacation business , which could have enabled it to be heard in DATE or DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The hearing before ORG was actually held on DATE and DATE . On DATE , the judge made an adoption order in respect of A ( who was de - warded ) , dispensed with the applicant \u2019s consent to the adoption ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and refused her access to A.", "In a long and detailed review , the judge described the case as \" difficult and painful \" , in particular because the circumstances before him in no way arose from any fault or blameworthy conduct on the applicant \u2019s part . As regards the delays since the proceedings were issued on DATE , he noted that DATE both the applicant \u2019s solicitor and ORG had been \" trying their best to obtain the evidence from ORG \" and that on DATE , when that evidence was filed , the applicant and her advisers learned for the first time of A \u2019s placement for adoption . Whilst taking the view that ORG had \" acted with all reasonable promptness \" , he described the ORG \u2019s delay , though not deliberate , as \" quite deplorable \" , adding that the apology made by its legal department \" does not assist [ the applicant ] whose case was seriously prejudiced by this delay \" . He pointed out that \" [ in adoption proceedings ] delay is a potent weapon and courts and practitioners must be vigilant to ensure that the position of natural parents is not prejudiced thereby \" . Nevertheless , the result of the delay here was that when the case came before the court , A , who was aged DATE and DATE , had been with the prospective adopters for DATE and had not seen her mother since DATE , CARDINAL years previously .", "Having taken account of the marked improvement in the applicant \u2019s general circumstances , the judge summarised her case as follows : since everyone was agreed that she was now capable of coping with a child , there was no reason why she should not have A back or at least be allowed to attempt a re - introduction to her ; the procedures and delays in both the wardship and the adoption applications had been such as to deny justice to her and also to A ; in particular , since DATE the ORG had closed its mind to any possible rehabilitation and had ceased to provide her with any support , being intent on taking A from her and placing A for adoption .", "However , the judge held that in deciding whether the applicant \u2019s withholding of her consent to the adoption was unreasonable , he had to take account of the facts as they existed at the date of the hearing . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he noted that the welfare of the child was the first and paramount consideration outweighing all others , but recognised that , in accordance with the case - law of ORG , \" the claims of the natural parents must be given great weight \" and that consideration had to be given , albeit to a much lesser extent , to the interests of the prospective adopters .", "On the question of access , the judge recognised that , where the \" statutory guillotine \" of adoption was implemented , its purpose was to sever all connection with the natural parents and to establish a fresh legal relationship with the adoptive parents . He could find no reason to justify the applicant \u2019s re - introduction to A in the circumstances and therefore ordered that no access be granted .", "CARDINAL . ORG An appeal by the applicant from this decision was dismissed on DATE by ORG , which also refused leave to appeal to ORG . ORG recognised its very limited function in appeals in adoption cases and the limited extent to which it could override the opinion of the first - instance judge , who had heard the witnesses . Having stressed the painful nature of the case and the applicant \u2019s legitimate sense of grievance arising from the delay , ORG recalled that both the judge and it had to deal with the situation existing at the time of the hearing . It added : \" CARDINAL may make one \u2019s criticisms of the conduct of the ORG , but the fact remains that we are dealing here with the life of another human being and that is not to be decided in awarding pluses and minuses to parties on the conduct of litigation . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant sought leave from ORG to appeal to ORG but this was refused on DATE . A subsequent request by her for legal aid with a view to establishing whether she had a cause of action in damages against the ORG for its delay in filing evidence was also unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant referred the matter to ORG , who has the task of investigating complaints made by a member of the public claiming to have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration in connection with action taken by a local authority in the exercise of its administrative functions .", "The applicant alleged maladministration , in that from DATE the ORG had ceased to support her and had thereafter refused to take account of her improved condition and her increasing ability to look after A. She also complained that the ORG \u2019s conduct had been such as to ensure that she did not have the opportunity of looking after the child and that it had refused to examine fully a request by the applicant and H to be considered as foster or adoptive parents .", "In his report of CARDINAL DATE , ORG recognised that it was \" certainly not for [ him ] to question the merits of [ the ] court decisions in these proceedings \" . He concluded that the applicant \u2019s complaints revealed no maladministration except in respect of the ORG \u2019s delay in filing evidence . He stated :", "\" It is quite clear from this investigation that part of the delay in getting the matter before the ORG was caused by the ORG , and this has already been criticised by the Judge . This delay was unreasonable and amounts to maladministration , but I must consider what injustice flowed from it . In many cases it could be that the longer the delay , the more difficult it would be for a ORG to break a bond with prospective adoptive parents - the ORG after all have to consider what is best for the child at the time they come to their decision . Here , however , it is not so simple . [ The applicant ] felt she was getting better , so to some extent the longer the time for her to improve , the greater would be her chances of success before the ORG . I have read the decision of ORG very carefully , but it seems to me that it is very unlikely indeed that the decision would have been different even if the ORG had acted more quickly . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant and H discovered A \u2019s whereabouts and the identity of the adoptive parents and made various attempts to contact the child , either at home or at school . In consequence , the adopters instituted wardship proceedings with a view to obtaining an injunction preventing such contacts . The failure , on numerous occasions , of the applicant and H to abide by ORG orders in this respect has led to contempt of court proceedings against them . Requests by them to the local authority for permission to see A - who remains a ward of court - have been unsuccessful , as have applications to ORG for leave to issue a summons for access .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the law of GPE and GPE , there are a number of different and partially co - ordinated procedures for dealing with the welfare of children . Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of ORG , it has for DATE co - existed with , but not been ousted by , various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority .", "Although the terms are not wholly accurate , the legislation is commonly divided into CARDINAL categories : the first provides for \" compulsory care \" , by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care ; the second concerns \" voluntary care \" , the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts . At any given time , there are CARDINAL children in public care in GPE and GPE , of whom CARDINAL are not living with their parents or a relative .", "The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on DATE .

From the judge \u2019s order , an appeal lies to ORG and thence , with leave , to ORG .", "The child may be represented in wardship proceedings by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court ; this is usually the Official Solicitor , who is a full - time public employee entirely independent of the executive .", "Under the Rules of ORG , it is possible to seek an order expediting the proceedings , notably if a party thereto is dilatory .", "CARDINAL . ORG The functions of a local authority in child - care matters are exercised and decisions are taken either by its ORG or by a sub - committee or an officer to whom powers have been delegated . At the time relevant to the present case , the practice varied from authority to authority , there being no precise requirements or guidance even of a non - statutory kind , and much depended on the nature or gravity of the decision to be taken . Whether the child is in its care by virtue of the DATE [ DATE ] or LAW , the local authority must give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the child \u2019s welfare throughout his childhood , and must so far as practicable ascertain his wishes and feelings regarding the decision and give due consideration to them , having regard to his age and understanding ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE [ CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ] ) .", "Authorities\u2019 decisions in this area are , in fact , often based on the outcome of case reviews or case conferences . The authority is under a statutory duty to review the case of each child in its care at DATE intervals ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) and , as a matter of practice , the child \u2019s position will in addition be regularly examined at case conferences . Reviews and conferences will be attended notably by the social workers responsible and senior officials of the authority \u2019s ORG , as well as by such other persons as health visitors , doctors and police officers .", "CARDINAL . ORG A parent may on occasion be allowed or invited to attend a case review or case conference or part thereof , although he has no legal right to do so . His contacts with the social workers constitute the most usual channel for the communication of his views on matters to be decided by the authority .", "In the absence of legal proceedings , the parent can not compel the local authority to produce or permit inspection of TIME of its relevant meetings or reports produced thereat , although the authority has a discretion to allow such inspection . In proceedings for judicial review ( but not in juvenile court proceedings ) , the court may order the pre - trial disclosure of such documents , but only after leave to institute the proceedings has been obtained ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; however , this would be a rare occurrence , the general rule being that the documents are privileged and not open to inspection .", "CARDINAL . ORG A parent whose child is in the care of a local authority is not automatically deprived of access to him . The continuation of access is , however , a matter within the discretionary power of the authority ( per Lord PERSON in ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Thus , under LANGUAGE law , the question whether and to what extent a parent is to have access to his child who is in public care was , at the relevant time , within the competence of the local authority to decide , without any application to a court .", "Both the DATE [ CARDINAL ] Act and the DATE Act reflect the general idea that continuation of parental access to children in public care is in many cases normal and desirable : the former allows the local authority to contribute to the costs of parental visits and the latter makes special provision for certain cases where the parents have not visited the child during a certain period of time .", "CARDINAL . ORG The statutory remedies described in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above , whereby a parent may challenge or seek the discharge of a care order or a parental rights resolution , are directed to the order or resolution as such , there being , at the relevant time , no specific statutory remedy whereby he could contest the isolated issue of a decision to restrict or terminate his access to his child .", "A decision of a local authority concerning access can , however , be challenged by way of an application for judicial review . Anyone who wishes to make such an application must first seek , normally within DATE of the decision , the leave of the court . The circumstances where judicial review will lie may be briefly summarised as follows :", "( a ) the authority acted illegally , ultra vires or in bad faith ;", "( b ) the authority failed to take into account relevant considerations , took account of irrelevant considerations or came to a decision to which no reasonable authority could have come ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses , Ltd. v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) the authority failed to observe statutory procedural rules or to act fairly ( see notably R v. ORG , ex parte C and R v. GPE , ex parte B , ORG , DATE ) .", "The remedy of judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in question but rather the decision - making process itself , and the court will not act as a \" court of appeal \" from the body involved . Thus , where on a successful application for judicial review the court quashes an authority \u2019s decision , it will normally remit the matter to the authority for reconsideration ; it may , however , also direct the authority to reach a conclusion in accordance with the court \u2019s findings ( Rules of ORG , Order CARDINAL , rule ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In certain circumstances , the wardship jurisdiction may also be invoked to question the decisions of a local authority or a juvenile court relating to a child in the former \u2019s care . The general rule is that the prerogative power of the Crown is not for all purposes ousted or abrogated by the exercise of the duties and powers conferred on local authorities by legislation . In the leading case of ORG , ORG examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities\u2019 statutory powers . Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions , notably on such matters as access to the child : the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise ( except on judicial review principles ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute . Sometimes , however , the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court .", "The foregoing limits on ORG powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care . If he is not , ORG can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests .", "CARDINAL . ORG The inability of parents to approach the courts , save as explained above , where decisions are made by a local authority affecting access to their children led ORG , in ORG Social Security Adjudications Act CARDINAL , to modify the law on this point .", "Under the new provisions - which came into force on DATE , that is after the events giving rise to the present case - , a local authority may not refuse to make arrangements for access to a child in care and may not terminate such arrangements unless it has first given notice to the parent . The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order , requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify . Where an access order has been made , there is a right to apply for variation . An appeal against the juvenile court \u2019s decision lies to ORG . Any court dealing with the matter must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration .", "This new remedy applies only to decisions refusing or terminating access ; in all other cases , the nature and extent of access remain within the local authority \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the Government published a Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care . This document stresses the importance of involving the child \u2019s natural parents in the local authority \u2019s decision - making process in this area and of informing them fully and promptly as to the substance of decisions concerning access .", "CARDINAL . ORG A court can not make an adoption order in respect of a child unless , inter alia , it is satisfied that each parent freely and unconditionally agrees ( LAW DATE , section CARDINAL ) . However , such agreement may be dispensed with upon a number of grounds specified in that section , notably that the parent is withholding consent unreasonably or has persistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge his parental duties . In reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child , a court must have regard to all the circumstances , first consideration being given to the need to safeguard and promote his welfare throughout his childhood ( Children Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Adoption proceedings in respect of a child who is a ward of court may not be instituted without the leave of ORG .
