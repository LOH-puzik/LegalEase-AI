The company agreed to transfer them possession of the CARDINAL additional storeys and the QUANTITY buildings in return for the applicants not claiming from the company compensation in respect of the period during which it had continued to use the rest of the property even though it had already been restituted to the applicants by operation of law . The agreement also said that from the date of transfer of possession the applicants were to be regarded as owners of the property . The parties stipulated that the amount of that compensation , which they put at CARDINAL old NORP levs , was equal to the value of the CARDINAL additional storeys and the QUANTITY buildings . Lastly , the parties agreed to waive any claims that they might have against each other in connection with those matters .

DATE the proceedings in the case were suspended a number of times for various reasons .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE that court dismissed their claim . It started by holding that only the company and the Ministry were proper defendants to the claim and that , in as much as directed against the municipality , the claim was inadmissible . The court went on to find that the DATE agreement did not constitute a preliminary contract for the conveyance of property because the parties to it had spoken only of possession and had not stipulated such conveyance in terms . Moreover , CARDINAL essential elements of such a preliminary contract \u2013 a specific description of the property and a specific price DATE were missing from the agreement .

However , it went on to find that the applicants had not put forward sufficient proof that the company was indeed the owner of the property . Their claim had therefore been rightly dismissed in relation to the company . As for ORG , it was only a shareholder in the company , and as such could not incur liability for agreements to which the company was party . The claim against it was ill - founded as well .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sixth applicant appealed on points of law , arguing that it was evident that the company , which had received title to the CARDINAL additional storeys and the QUANTITY buildings from the ORG , was their owner .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to take the appeal for examination , holding that the point raised in it had not been decisive for the determination of the applicants\u2019 claim .", "CARDINAL . A DATE amendment to the DATE LAW added a new LAW , which envisaged the creation of an ORG attached to ORG . The ORG , which consists of a Chief Inspector and CARDINAL inspectors , is tasked with checking the work of the judiciary without infringing the independence of judges , prosecutors or investigators ( LAW ) .

In its judgments concerning the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time ORG ( \u2018 the ECtHR\u2019 ) emphasises the need for the introduction of an effective domestic remedy in respect of such breaches . With a view to securing the effective exercise of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time , in its case - law the ECtHR points to the need to introduce a remedy capable of providing compensation for damage resulting from delays in proceedings ( compensatory remedy ) .", "The systemic problem found by the ECtHR in relation to the excessive duration of criminal and civil cases in GPE calls for urgent legislative measures to introduce the remedies suggested by ORG .", "With a view to the effective use of the available resources , it is expedient to give the power to find a breach and set compensation to an existing authority with similar competences . In view of the constitutional function of the ORG attached to ORG to check the work of the judiciary ( LAW ) and more specifically its power under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW [ DATE ] to check the processing of court , ORG and investigation cases and their completion within the prescribed time - limits , the bill envisages the creation of a special unit attached to the ORG . That special unit will examine and decide complaints relating to breaches concerning the unreasonable length of completed civil , administrative and criminal cases , as well as discontinued pre - trial proceedings . An important premise for laying down the procedure in such a way is the ORG \u2019s constitutional obligation to carry out checks pursuant to reports by private individuals and legal persons ( LAW ) .", "The right to complain is open to all persons who may suffer damage as a result of delays in proceedings : parties to judicial proceedings ( civil , administrative and criminal ) or persons subjected to the pre - trial phase of criminal proceedings ( accused , victims and wronged legal persons ) .", "The envisaged procedure will be a light ( simple ) way of obtaining redress . The complainant will not have to produce evidence \u2013 it will be gathered by the checking panel of their own motion ; no fees will be due ; the proceedings will finish in DATE with a settlement , which will ensure fast payment of the compensation .", "Since the proposed procedure envisages a light and fast mode of redress , there is a cap on the maximum amount of compensation . This cap conforms with the DATE \u2019s case - law on the amount of compensation awarded in past cases .", "The transitional and concluding provisions allow the procedure to be applied in respect of complaints already lodged through the ECtHR .", "The compensatory remedy has to have retrospective effect , so as to be available to persons who have become victim of excessive length of proceedings even before the coming of the LAW into force , including those who have lodged applications with the ECtHR , if that court has not yet ruled on the admissibility of those applications .", "The creation of an effective domestic remedy will ensure a drastic reduction of the number of applications to the ECtHR and will thus lead to less judgments finding a breach of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Compensatory remedies elaborated in response to the pilot judgments", "NORP Presentation of the adopted administrative compensatory remedy", "CARDINAL . Positive aspects of the administrative compensatory remedy", "CARDINAL . The [ DATE ] Act provides that applications for compensation in respect of excessive length of proceedings are to be addressed to the Minister of ORG through ORG . When examining these claims , the Minister ( or a person authorised by him or her ) is assisted by a panel made up of an Inspector and CARDINAL experts working in a special unit of that ORG . The timelimit for the examination of applications is DATE . The procedure is free of charge for the claimants .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applications are to be directed \u2018 against acts , actions or omissions of judicial authorities\u2019 , breaching the right to have a case heard and decided within a reasonable time . The authorities have indicated that this wording would not preclude the examination of applications concerning delays that do not stem from omissions by individual judges or judicial officers but , for instance , from an overburdening of the judicial system as a whole .", "CARDINAL . The criteria which must be taken into account when examining applications are the overall length of the proceedings , the delays attributable to the authorities , as well as the delays attributable to the applicant and his representative ( [ s]ection CARDINALd(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ) . The merits of the application and the amount of compensation are to be determined in light of the ORG \u2019s caselaw .", "CARDINAL . The compensation is to be paid out of the budget of ORG . ORG must then restore to the budget of ORG the funds paid as compensation DATE .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . The law governing the administrative remedy imposes on the authority competent to examine applications for compensation the obligation to take into account the overall length of the proceedings and the conduct of the parties and of the competent authorities , in line with the ORG \u2019s caselaw . The legal or factual complexity of the case and the stakes involved in the dispute are not mentioned explicitly , but the general reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law should be enough to cause them to be taken into account as well . The new provisions also seem to take into account the caselaw of the ORG as to , inter alia , the promptness of the examination , the absence of charges for the introduction of a claim and the existence of specific budgetary provisions . In conclusion , this administrative remedy takes into account , to a very large extent , the criteria used by ORG for the assessment of the excessive length of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Questions raised by the administrative compensatory remedy", "CARDINAL . The administrative remedy put in place raises a number of questions , namely : ( a ) the fact that it does not apply to proceedings which are pending , ( b ) the wording of the provision governing the retrospective effect of the remedy and ( c ) the compliance of the remedy with the institutional requirements of LAW , ( d ) the compensation ceiling and ( e ) the payment of compensation . In this respect , it should be recalled that the ORG has constantly indicated in its caselaw that even if a particular remedy does not fully satisfy the requirements of LAW , the aggregate of remedies under domestic law may satisfy these requirements . Therefore , the questions raised by this remedy and its weaknesses may be examined also in the light of the judicial compensatory remedy adopted at first reading by ORG ( for a detailed presentation of the judicial remedy , see paragraphs PERSON below ) .", "( a ) ORG of the administrative remedy to proceedings which are still pending", "CARDINAL . NORP The administrative remedy provides that only parties to completed judicial and pre - trial proceedings are entitled to introduce applications for compensation within DATE of the end of the proceedings in question . If the proceedings are still pending , the parties have to wait for them to end in order to submit a claim to the Minister of ORG , whatever the delays already accumulated . In contrast , it appears from the information presented by the NORP authorities that the proposed judicial remedy for length of proceedings would also be applicable to proceedings which are still pending .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . It should be recalled that the ORG has already held that the impossibility to use a remedy against the excessive length of proceedings which are still pending may render such a remedy ineffective . It should also be recalled that the pilot judgments require the introduction , within the timelimit set in the operative part of the judgments , of a remedy that fully complies with the ORG \u2019s caselaw . It thus appears that the introduction of just an administrative remedy with limited scope is not sufficient to ensure the full execution of the pilot judgments . This lacuna could , however , be overcome by the introduction , without delay , of a judicial remedy which fully complies with the requirements of the ORG \u2019s caselaw , as the NORP authorities seem to have foreseen .", "( b ) Wording of the provision governing the retrospective effect of the remedy", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the transitional provisions of the [ DATE Act ] , which concerns the retrospective effect of the new remedy , is worded as follows ( emphasis added ) :", "\u2018 Within DATE of the entry into force of LAW or notification by ORG , persons who have lodged with ORG applications concerning breaches of their right to have their cases examined and decided within a reasonable time may submit applications under LAW , except in cases where the ORG has already given judgment on the merits of the application or has rejected the application as inadmissible.\u2019", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . The current wording of paragraph CARDINAL suggests that the new remedy will not be available to applicants whose applications are declared inadmissible by the ORG , and this without making the distinction between the different grounds of inadmissibility . This provision should therefore be amended in order to indicate clearly that it will be available to persons whose applications , introduced before its adoption , are declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies . Thus , if the ORG confirms the effectiveness of the new remedy or of the aggregate of new remedies , it will be able to declare inadmissible the applications pending before it for nonexhaustion of this remedy / these remedies and the applicants concerned will be able to introduce their applications for compensation at the domestic level . The authorities have indicated that this provision will be amended in the near future in order to ensure that applicants whose applications have been declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies will be able to use effectively this new remedy at the domestic level . Information is awaited on the timetable for the adoption of this amendment .", "( c ) Compliance of the remedy with the institutional requirements of LAW", "CARDINAL . The new provisions of the [ DATE ] Act describe in considerable detail the procedure for the examination of applications for compensation for excessive length of proceedings . The relevant facts for the examination of a complaint concerning excessive length of proceedings are to be established by a panel of CARDINAL Inspector from ORG and CARDINAL experts working in a special unit of this ORG . This panel communicates its findings to the Minister or to the person whom he or she has authorised to act on his or her behalf .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the Minister of Justice or the person designated by him or her finds that the reasonable - time requirement has not been breached , he or she has to reject the application . If the Minister or the person designated by him or her finds , on the contrary , that the reasonable - time requirement has been breached , he or she has to fix the amount of compensation in line with the ORG \u2019s case - law and propose a settlement to the claimant . Claimants who have accepted the settlement and have obtained compensation under that procedure can not claim compensation in judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The [ DATE ] Act does not contain specific provisions concerning a possible judicial review of the decisions rejecting applications or proposing a settlement .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . It should be recalled that the authority to which LAW refers does not need to be a judicial one for a remedy to be considered effective under the ORG \u2019s caselaw . However , the effectiveness of the remedy before that authority is assessed by reference to the guarantees that it affords ( see , among other authorities , GPE [ v. ] GPE , CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A No . CARDINAL ) . In particular , the decisionmaking body needs to have a \u2018 sufficiently independent standpoint\u2019 ( see , among other authorities , Silver and [ O]thers [ v. ] GPE , DATE , \u00a7 QUANTITY , Series A No . CARDINAL ) . It should also be noted that the ORG requires in principle that the authority in charge of the implementation of a domestic remedy be able to come up with a \u2018 legally binding GPE , some element of enforceability being generally required ( see , among other authorities , GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . As said above , the caselaw also indicates that even if a single remedy does not fully satisfy the requirements of LAW , the aggregate of remedies under domestic law may do so ( see , among other authorities , GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the information currently available , it is not clearly established whether the new administrative procedure under the [ DATE ] Act can be regarded as providing alone the required \u2018 element of enforceability\u2019 and sufficient \u2018 ORG . However , for the reasons set out below , if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay , the aggregate of remedies could in principle meet the institutional requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the authorities , the settlements proposed by the Minister of ORG should be considered as legally binding decisions , because under the [ CARDINAL]Act , as amended , the Minister of Finance has to guarantee to ORG funds up to the amounts paid in compensation to claimants . However , a question remains whether the decision of the Minister of ORG taken on applications for compensation , whether positive or negative , can be considered to have itself a legally binding effect in cases in which no settlement has been concluded . In any event , according to the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] ( aiming at the introduction of a judicial remedy ) , unsuccessful claimants in the procedure before the Minister of Justice and claimants who have refused to conclude a settlement , will have the right to request compensation in the context of judicial proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below).Thus , it seems that DATE if the foreseen judicial remedy is adopted DATE in the absence of a settlement the claim could be resolved by a final and legally binding decision in the context of judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As to the issue of independence of the decisionmaking body , it should be recalled that , in a case against GPE , the ORG accepted that an administrative remedy was effective because the persons who were not satisfied with the decision of ORG on their applications for compensation could seek compensation in the context of judicial proceedings ( see PERSON [ v. ] GPE DATE . ) , No . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . Thus , if only an administrative remedy is introduced , the availability of judicial review of the decisions of the Minister of ORG may prove crucial for the remedy to meet the institutional requirements of the ORG \u2019s caselaw . By contrast , if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay as foreseen by the NORP authorities , the aggregate of the CARDINAL remedies could in principle meet the institutional requirements of LAW , even in the absence of judicial review of the minister \u2019s decisions .", "( d ) Compensation ceiling", "CARDINAL . The [ DATE Act ] provides that compensation can not exceed MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . As concerns the abovementioned compensation ceiling , there may be situations in which that sum will fall short of the amounts awarded in compensation by the ORG . That said sums of up to ORG CARDINAL appear sufficient , in the light of the ORG \u2019s judgments against GPE concerning length of proceedings , to compensate adequately the nonpecuniary damage arising in the majority of cases concerning excessive length of proceedings in GPE . Moreover , if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay as foreseen by the NORP authorities , the aggregate of newly introduced remedies would normally be sufficient to provide an adequate level of compensation in all situations , as the draft law concerning the introduction of judicial remedy does not provide for a compensation ceiling .", "( e ) Timelimit and procedure for payment of compensation", "CARDINAL . The [ DATE ] Act makes provision for a specific funding mechanism for the payment of compensations for excessive length of procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It does not seem to contain any specific provisions concerning the procedure for payment of compensation . In their reply to the questions identified in the memorandum ORG ( see PERSON ) , the authorities indicated that budgetary funds and other measures have been foreseen in order to avoid delays in the payment of compensation .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s caselaw requires that payment should normally be made not DATE after a judgment or a decision in that respect has become enforceable . Given the importance attached by the ORG to this requirement , it seems useful to provide the ORG with detailed information on the payment procedure and on the timelimits in which the payments are made in practice .", "B. Presentation of the proposed judicial remedy", "CARDINAL . The following presentation is based on the translation of the draft bill for the amendment of LAW presented by the NORP authorities on DATE ( see DHDD(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) . The judicial remedy adopted at first reading by ORG seems to comply in principle with the main requirements of the ORG \u2019s case - law in the field of compensatory remedies for excessive length of proceedings . However , some clarifications still seem necessary .", "( a ) Scope of the remedy", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] provides that the ORG is responsible for damages caused to persons and legal entities through breaches , by the judicial authorities , of the right enshrined in LAW to have their cases examined and resolved within a reasonable time . The claims have to be examined under the rules of LAW . The court have to take into account the legal and factual complexity of the case , the conduct of the claimant , the conduct of the other parties and participants in the proceedings and the conduct of the competent authorities , the stakes involved in the dispute , as well as the overall length of the proceedings . The introduction of a claim for damages while the proceedings are still pending is not an obstacle to introducing a claim for damages after the end of these proceedings . The authorities have confirmed that the scope of the judicial remedy comprises the actions of the prosecutors and the investigating magistrates , as well as the actions of the police investigators ( to which makes reference paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] ) .", "CARDINAL . As concerns the question of the applicability of the judicial remedy to the procedures concerning execution of court decisions , it should be noted that the majority of the execution proceedings in GPE are conducted by private bailiffs whose civil responsibility can be engaged in a case of damage caused by their activity . As far as the public bailiffs are concerned , although their status is governed by the [ CARDINAL ] Act , they are not magistrates . Therefore , it is not clear whether their actions are covered or not by the scope of the proposed judicial remedy .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . The scope of the proposed judicial remedy seems to comply with the relevant requirements of the ORG \u2019s caselaw . The draft Section CARDINAL refers to breaches of the reasonable time requirement attributable to the judicial authorities . Although this provision does not mention explicitly the delays caused by the police investigators , the NORP authorities have indicated that the delays which have occurred at the stage of the preliminary investigation and are attributable to the police investigators will fall within the scope of the judicial remedy . It would be useful to clarify whether this is so also in respect of the actions of the public bailiffs responsible for the execution of a court decision .", "( b ) Procedure according to which a claim should be examined : length and applicable court fees", "CARDINAL . The draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] provides that claims will be examined under the rules of LAW [ DATE ] . Under NORP law , a civil dispute can be examined by CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Under the provisions of [ LAW ] , a flatrate court fee is due to file a claim under LAW which is either ORG for physical persons or ORG CARDINAL for legal persons ( EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL or EUR CARDINAL ) . The claimants must pay all the costs incurred in the proceedings only if their claim has been entirely rejected or if they withdraw or waive their claim entirely . If the court decides in favour of the claim , in whole or in part , the defendant should be ordered to pay the costs relating to the proceedings , as well as the claimant \u2019s court fees . If a claim is granted only in part , the claimant receives only partial reimbursement of the lawyer \u2019s fees . The authorities have specified that according to domestic caselaw , if a claim is partially rejected , the claimant should not be required to pay the part of the lawyer \u2019s fees incurred by the defendant .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . One of the principles set out in the pilot judgments is that a claim for compensation must be examined within a reasonable time . The ORG suggested in this respect that \u2018 consideration may be given to subjecting the examination of such claims to special rules that differ from those governing ordinary claims for damages , to avert the risk that , if examined under the general rules of civil procedure , the remedy may not be sufficiently ORG . However , the introduction of such special rules was not set out as a requirement for the effectiveness of the future remedy or aggregate of remedies . Therefore , the absence of such special rules does not per se put into question the efficiency of the proposed judicial remedy . Moreover , the adopted administrative remedy , if correctly implemented , could provide swift redress to many potential claimants .", "CARDINAL . As concerns the requirement set out in the pilot judgments that the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified , it seems that , even if a claim has been partly rejected , successful claimants could not be required to pay costs relating to the proceedings and the part of the lawyer \u2019s fees incurred by the defendant and that their court fees are to be reimbursed .", "( c ) Need to exhaust the administrative remedy in some situations", "CARDINAL . NORP Parties to completed judicial proceedings will need to exhaust the administrative remedy before introducing a judicial claim . According to [ LOC ) of the draft bill for the amendment of LAW , the judicial remedy is not available to claimants who have concluded a settlement in the administrative procedure .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . As said above , CARDINAL of the principles set out in the pilot judgments is that a claim for compensation must be examined within a reasonable time . It seems that the requirement for a certain category of claimants to exhaust the administrative remedy before introducing a judicial remedy will not have a considerable impact on the promptness of the compensation process as a whole , because it seems that the administrative phase could be very short ( cf . the sixmonth\u2019 timelimit for the examination of applications , paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "( d ) Retrospective effect", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] provides that persons whose applications have been rejected by ORG on the ground of nonexhaustion of the newly introduced domestic remedies and who have been parties in completed judicial proceedings will be able to introduce administrative applications for compensation within DATE of the entry into force of the amendments or within DATE of the notification by ORG . Under the same conditions , applicants to the ORG who have seen their application rejected for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies and who are parties in pending proceedings at the domestic level will be able to introduce judicial claims for compensation .", "CARDINAL . According to paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] , parties to proceedings which have been completed DATE before the entry into force of the draft bill will also have access to the judicial remedy .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . The provisions concerning the scope of the retrospective effect of the proposed judicial remedy seem to comply with the recommendations given by ORG under Article CARDINAL in the pilot judgments .", "( e ) Timelimit and procedure for payment of compensation", "CARDINAL . Unlike the [ DATE ] Act , the draft bill for the amendment of the [ CARDINAL Act ] does not seem to provide for specific budgetary provisions concerning the payment of compensations for excessive length of proceedings . In their response to the questions identified in the memorandum ORG ( see PERSON ) , the authorities indicated that it is foreseen that the amendments to the [ CARDINAL LAW ] will be accompanied by the provision of budgetary funds to the institutions concerned .", "CARDINAL . It seems that according to the relevant budgetary rules , the payment of compensation granted in the event of successful claim against a court / the prosecution should be made out of the budget of the court in question / of the prosecution . Likewise , LAW provides that persons who have financial claims against public institutions have to submit the writ of execution to the institution \u2019s financial department in order to receive payment . Payments are made out of the funds earmarked for that purpose in the institution \u2019s budget . If there are no funds available , a budgetary provision for this purpose should be made available DATE .", "Assessment :", "CARDINAL . As said above in paragraph DATE , the ORG \u2019s caselaw requires that payment should normally be made not DATE after a judgment or a decision in that respect has become enforceable . Given the importance attached by the ORG to this requirement , it seems useful to provide the ORG , in due time , with information on the exact content of the budgetary provisions taken by the authorities in order to ensure the funding of compensations for excessive length of proceedings and on any other measure aimed at avoiding late payment of compensation .", "...", "Conclusion", "CARDINAL . In the light of the information available , it seems that the administrative remedy which entered into force on [ DATE ] represents a very positive step forward towards the execution of the pilot judgments of the ORG . This remedy does not in itself comply with all the requirements of the LAW , but most of the outstanding questions could be addressed by the proposed judicial remedy in the field of excessive length of proceedings , if the latter is adopted without delay . Thus , it seems that the aggregate of these CARDINAL remedies could in principle comply with the main requirements of the ORG \u2019s caselaw . Therefore , it seems useful to invite the NORP authorities to adopt without delay the judicial remedy proposed and to encourage them to take the necessary measures in order to ensure for themselves that the new remedies will be applied in compliance with this case - law . Likewise , it seems useful to encourage the authorities to continue with their works regarding the introduction of a remedy which allows requesting the acceleration of the criminal proceedings . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
