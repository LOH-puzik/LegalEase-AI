At the relevant time the applicant was the head of ORG division responsible for the financial and logistical support for the judicial system . In this capacity , he sometimes attended the meetings of ORG \u2013 the body responsible for , inter alia , allocating the judicial budget . ORG consists of CARDINAL members , including the chairpersons of ORG and ORG , and ORG . Its meetings are presided over by the Minister of Justice .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a meeting on DATE , at which the issue of the endofyear bonus for judges , prosecutors , and investigators was discussed . The applicant attended the meeting , as he usually did in cases when budgetary matters were considered . The deputy ORG , PERSON , who was a member of the ORG , was also present .", "CARDINAL . At some point during the meeting , after commenting the provisions of LAW , the applicant said : \u201c You have decided to have financial matters dealt with by PERSON For me he is not a clean person ... \u201d . He then added : \u201c I can prove this \u201d . The Prosecutor - General reacted vehemently , asking the applicant to leave the room . The applicant tried to continue but was interrupted by PERSON who asked him to clarify what he meant by \u201c unclean person \u201d . The Minister of ORG intervened and requested the applicant to retract the words \u201c unclean person \u201d . The Prosecutor - General reacted immediately : \u201c There is no retraction , there are prosecution authorities . This is already a problem , this is already a crime \u201d . The Minister insisted on the applicant apologising for the words \u201c unclean person \u201d . Thereupon the applicant said : \u201c Alright , I apologise \u201d . Because of the tense situation all financial matters which were due to be discussed at the meeting were adjourned .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after the meeting the ORG requested a copy of TIME . He received it on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE sent it to ORG with instructions to carry out a preliminary inquiry with a view to opening criminal proceedings against the applicant . On DATE ORG transmitted the case file to GPE ORG with instructions to open criminal proceedings against the applicant for insult . The investigation was to be performed not by an investigator , as would usually be the case , but by a prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for \u201c having said publicly \u2018 for me he is not a clean person\u2019 in respect of [ Mr S. ] in his presence ... which was degrading for the latter \u2019s dignity \u201d , contrary to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was concluded on DATE and the applicant and his counsel were allowed to consult the case file . After having done so , counsel for the applicant requested that all members of ORG who had been present at the meeting be questioned and that an expert report be prepared to compare the audio tape of the meeting with the written TIME . The prosecutor in charge of the investigation refused , reasoning that the facts of the case had been elucidated by the evidence already gathered , which supported the accusation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was indicted . The trial against him took place on CARDINAL DATE at ORG . The court heard CARDINAL witnesses : the alleged victim of the insult , PERSON , and another member of ORG . PERSON stated that it was difficult for him to say whether the applicant \u2019s remark had changed ORG opinion of him . The other witness stated that sometimes the discussions in the ORG were quite heated but that no one had ever used such words or made such remarks . CARDINAL other witnesses called", "CARDINAL . After that the court heard the parties\u2019 closing argument . Counsel for the applicant pleaded for a verdict of not guilty , relying , inter alia , on LAW . She argued that the words \u201c for me he is not a clean person \u201d were only an expression of the applicant \u2019s personal opinion about Mr S. The applicant \u2019s words were objectively not rude , vulgar or insulting . He had simply exercised his right to voice what he thought about another person , in purely neutral terms . To equate this with an insult would mean that only those who had a favourable opinion of PERSON would be allowed to express it . In her view , the entire case had been sparked by the ORG \u2019s vindictiveness .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to a fine of CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) and to a public reprimand . The court held as follows :", "\u201c The actus reus consisted of uttering words which were humiliating and disparaging for [ Mr S. ] in his presence . It is not disputed ... that the accused ... said in respect of [ Mr S. ] \u2018 For me he is not a clean person\u2019 . The expression has an insulting character , because it dishonours [ Mr S. ] . It contains a disapproval of his ethical and moral qualities , which is irreconcilable with his being in charge of the budgetary funds of the judiciary . In this fashion the personality of [ Mr S. ] and his authority in front of the other members of the [ ORG ] were disparaged . \u2018 Not a clean person\u2019 has CARDINAL interpretation , that the person concerned has a tainted consciousness and lacks morality . Even if this is the [ applicant \u2019s ] personal opinion about the qualities of [ Mr S. ] , the remark was aimed at affecting the honour and the dignity of [ Mr S. ] . Criticism ... , especially when it comes to the public manifestations of persons who represent state institutions , has to be consistent with the rules of society , ethics and the common rules of decency and morality . These must not be trampled on under the pretence that the personal opinion about another is a matter of perception and [ represents the exercise ] of the constitutional right to freedom of expression ... It is unconstitutional and criminal to criticise in an insulting form , as in the case at hand ...", "The offence was intentional ... It was committed in public , in front of CARDINAL members of ORG and the deputyMinister of ORG . This increases the gravity of the offence , because the offensive words were heard not only by the victim , but also by a large group of persons ...", "The fact that the [ applicant ] apologised to the victim after being invited to do so by the [ Minister of ORG ] does not remove the criminal character of his act or its harmful consequences . By uttering words which were humiliating for the victim , [ the applicant ] completed the offence and the harmful consequences arose . The derogation of the victim \u2019s reputation was irreversible . The fact [ that the applicant apologised ] must , however , be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing the gravity of the offence ... and for the purpose of sentencing .", "The defence \u2019s argument that the [ applicant \u2019s ] act was not criminal because it was in fact the expression of a personal criticism by a person exercising his freedom of expression ... can not be sustained . The right to freedom of expression carries the duty , set out in LAW , not to exercise this right to the detriment of the reputation of another . The present case represents an abuse of this right , because the personal disproval of [ Mr S. ] which the [ applicant ] expressed publicly had a humiliating content . The negative opinion was expressed indecently , in an insulting and humiliating manner , which is contrary to the law . This implies that the [ statement ] was contrary to both LAW and LAW ... , which enshrine the right to freedom of expression , but in the bounds of decency , respect for the rights of every member of society , tolerance and respect for the reputation of the others ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . His counsel again argued that the applicant \u2019s remark had not been couched in offensive terms , that he had expressed his personal views in an entirely acceptable way and that a penalty imposed on him for having voiced an opinion ran counter to his freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution appealed as well , requesting an increase of the applicant \u2019s sentence .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court held a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s and the prosecution \u2019s appeals . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The [ court below ] correctly concluded that the [ applicant \u2019s ] words had an insulting content . The expression was examined by the district court in accordance with the meaning which was put in it \u2013 a disapproval of the ethical and moral qualities of [ Mr S. ] , which was incompatible with his being in charge of the budgetary funds of the judiciary ; a disapproval aiming to impinge on the victim \u2019s personal dignity . The [ words ] were analysed by the firstinstance court in view of their objective potential to impinge on the dignity of the victim , because they exceeded the bounds of ethical communication and the generally accepted rules of decency .", "The defence \u2019s arguments ... that the [ words ] in issue were in fact the [ applicant \u2019s ] personal opinion , the expression of which is protected by the rule of LAW , are unfounded . The district court was correct in concluding that the expression of a personal opinion about someone , even though a constitutionally protected right , should not exceed the bounds set out in paragraph CARDINAL of [ LAW ] . In other words , the right to freely express one \u2019s opinion may not be used to infringe the rights and reputation of another ...", "In its reasoning the district court examined all arguments of the defence , relying on the ORG constant caselaw under LAW and LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG , claiming that the lower courts\u2019 judgments were unfounded and in breach of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the petition for examination and listed the case for hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court held a hearing on DATE . It heard the parties\u2019 argument and reserved judgment . Prior to the hearing the applicant \u2019s defence presented written observations , in which it argued that the lower courts\u2019 judgments were unfounded and unlawful . In particular , the courts\u2019 holding that the applicant \u2019s words were offensive was arbitrary . On the opposite , they were not rude , vulgar or cynical , but completely neutral . The defence also reiterated its submissions in respect of the applicant \u2019s right to voice personal opinions .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE , dismissing the petition in the following terms :", "\u201c [ The words ] used by [ the applicant ] in the presence of [ Mr S. ] were humiliating and it can not be accepted that this was in line with the rule of LAW , which guarantees to all NORP citizens the possibility to express their personal opinion and criticise other persons . This possibility is subject to and dependent on the limitations of paragraph CARDINAL [ of this LAW ] , according to which this right should not be used for impinging on the reputation of another . In the case at hand there has been an abuse of the right under paragraph CARDINAL [ of this Article ] , because the personal opinion , expressed by [ the applicant ] in respect of [ Mr S. ] has a disparaging content . The negative opinion is expressed in an indecent , insulting and humiliating manner ... As such it falls under the prohibition of Articles CARDINAL [ and ] CARDINAL of LAW , because it not only goes against LAW , but also against LAW ... which enshrine the right to freedom of expression , but within the bounds of decency , respect for the rights of the person , tolerance , and protection of the reputation of the others . These rules are valid in all civilised and democratic societies .", "It is unconstitutional and criminally liable to \u2018 criticise\u2019 in an insulting manner , as has been done in the case at hand . The words which were used had an insulting content , because they debased the victim \u2019s dignity and his authority before the other members of the [ ORG . They contained a disapproval of his moral and ethical qualities which is incompatible with his function as a person disposing with budgetary funds . What was said could be interpreted in CARDINAL manner only : that the person in question has a tainted consciousness and lacks morality ; it was aimed at impinging the honour and dignity of [ Mr S. ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant paid the fine on DATE . He was not publicly reprimanded and on DATE a prosecutor of ORG ordered that his sentence was not to be enforced because the relevant limitation period had expired .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone is entitled to express an opinion or to publicise it through words , written or oral , sound , or image , or in any other way .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided :", "\u201c Whoever says or does something degrading for the honour or the dignity of another in his presence shall be punished for insult by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of MONEY . The court may also impose a public reprimand . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
