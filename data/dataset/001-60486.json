It said :", "\u201c This case is exceptional in that it is a recall CARDINAL and he has previously made a successful transition from prison to the community without violent reoffending ... It is felt that the risk of serious reoffending in the future is very low . Recent reports of progress in prison have been favourable and no untoward incidents have been reported ; positive links with his family have been maintained . In view of these facts , it is now felt that he could be released safely and appropriately into the community . The ORG took the view after lengthy consideration that nothing further would be gained by a period in open conditions , and the successful return to the community , bearing in mind all risk factors , would be best facilitated by returning to his family directly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE to the applicant , the Secretary of ORG rejected the ORG 's recommendation in the following terms :", "\u201c ... [ The Secretary of ORG ] notes with concern the circumstances surrounding your CARDINAL recalls to prison ... Both these occasions represent a serious and grave breach of the trust placed in you as a life licensee and demonstrate a lack of regard for the requirements of supervision . Against this background the Secretary of ORG is not yet satisfied that if released on licence for a third time , you would fully comply with the conditions of your life licence . He notes that you have spent DATE in closed prison conditions and therefore have not on this occasion followed the normal progression of life sentence prisoners . This involves a period in open conditions , giving you the opportunity to demonstrate sustained good behaviour and responsibility in a less secure environment ; and to experience the full range of resettlement activities in preparation for release .", "For these reasons , the Secretary of ORG considers that you should be transferred to an open prison for a final period of testing and preparation . Your next formal review by ORG will begin DATE after your arrival there . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted leave to seek judicial review of the Secretary of ORG 's decisions to reject the ORG 's recommendation for immediate release and to require him to spend DATE in open conditions before the next review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , but for the revocation of his life licence , the applicant would have been released from prison on the expiry of the sentence for fraud , pursuant to provisions whereby prisoners serving determinate sentences of DATE were released after serving CARDINAL of their sentence ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG acknowledged in the proceedings that there was not a significant risk that the applicant would commit further violent offences , but asserted that he could lawfully detain a post - tariff mandatory life prisoner solely because there was a risk that he might commit further non - violent imprisonable offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON quashed the Secretary of ORG 's decision of DATE , holding that it was beyond his power to detain a post - tariff life prisoner other than on the basis that there existed an unacceptable risk that he might commit a future offence involving a risk to the life or limb of the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the Secretary of ORG 's appeal , holding that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act conferred a broad discretion on the Secretary of ORG to direct the release of mandatory life prisoners and his decision not to release the applicant was in accordance with the previously stated policy whereby the risk of reoffending was taken into account , such risk not having been expressed as being limited to offences of a violent or sexual nature . Lord PERSON stated , however :", "\u201c The applicant is now serving the equivalent of a determinate sentence of DATE , albeit in open conditions . This term has not been imposed on him by way of punishment , because he has already served the punitive terms which his previous , very serious , offences have been thought to merit . The term has not been imposed because he is thought to present danger to the public , because that is not suggested . It is not submitted that the term imposed bears any relation to the gravity of any future imprisonable offence which the applicant might commit or that such term is needed to ensure future compliance with the terms of his life licence . While a powerful case can be made for testing in open conditions a mandatory life prisoner who has been institutionalised by DATE of incarceration in closed conditions , such a case loses much of its force in the case of a man who has , since serving the punitive term of his life sentence , demonstrated his capacity for living an independent and apparently lawful life by doing so for DATE . The imposition of what is in effect a substantial term of imprisonment by the exercise of executive discretion , without trial , lies uneasily with ordinary concepts of the rule of law . I hope that the Secretary of ORG may , even now , think it right to give further consideration to the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON , concurring with the latter remarks , added :", "\u201c The category of imprisonable offence is extremely wide , and can encompass many matters that are wholly unrelated , both in nature and seriousness , to the reasons for the life sentence prisoner being within the power of the ORG in the first place . I also find it uncomfortable that the criterion should be used as the justification for continued imprisonment . We were told in argument that the test of imprisonable offence , rather than of fault of a purely moral or social nature , was used because faults of the latter nature would be unconnected with the original reasons for the subject 's incarceration ; but in reality this lack of connection exists , or at least is strongly threatened , by the imprisonable offence criterion also . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was moved to open conditions .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG decided that the applicant should spend DATE in open conditions before his next review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision . In his speech , with which the rest of the judges agreed , Lord PERSON held that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act conferred a wide administrative discretion on the Secretary of ORG to decide upon the release on licence of mandatory life prisoners and that there was no fundamental common - law principle of retributive proportionality which restrained him from detaining a mandatory life prisoner by reference to a risk that he may in future commit a serious but non - violent offence . He expressly repeated Lord PERSON 's concern that the imposition of a substantial term of imprisonment by exercise of administrative discretion was hard to reconcile with ordinary concepts of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released on licence by the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder ( Abolition of Death Penalty ) Act DATE . A person convicted of other serious offences ( such as manslaughter or rape ) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside . Where an offender is DATE when the offence of murder is committed , he or she is sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .

This was first publicly announced in ORG by Mr PERSON GPE on DATE ( ORG ) cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In essence , the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts , namely retribution , deterrence and protection of the public . The \u201c tariff \u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . The Home Secretary will not refer the case to ORG until DATE the expiry of the tariff period , and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed ( per Lord PERSON , NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON and CARDINAL [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , at pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction . After the tariff has expired , the prisoner may require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG , which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public .", "CARDINAL . A different regime , however , applied under LAW to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment ( now replaced by ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) , sections CARDINAL ) . In relation to these prisoners , the Secretary of ORG decides the length of the tariff . The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial , as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice . The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of ORG , who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL ; and see the ORG Secretary , Mr PERSON , policy statement to ORG , DATE , ORG ) cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the judicial review proceedings in Ex parte V. and ORG ( cited above ) , ORG gave consideration , inter alia , to the nature of the tariff - fixing exercise .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON held :", "\u201c The starting - point must to be inquire into the nature of the power to fix a tariff which the Home Secretary exercises . Writing on behalf of the Home Secretary ORG explained that : ' The Home Secretary must ensure that , at all times , he acts with the same dispassionate fairness as a sentencing judge . ' The comparison between the position of the Home Secretary , when he fixes a tariff representing the punitive element of the sentence , and the position of the sentencing judge is correct . In fixing a tariff the Home Secretary is carrying out , contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary , a classic judicial function . ORG entrusted the underlying statutory power , which entailed a discretion to adopt a policy and fix a tariff , to the ORG Secretary . But the power to fix a tariff is nevertheless equivalent to a judge 's sentencing power . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope held :", "\u201c But the imposition of a tariff , which is intended to fix the minimum period in custody is , in itself , the imposition of a form of punishment . This has , as Lord PERSON observed in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody at p. CARDINAL - B , the characteristics of an orthodox judicial exercise , which is directed to the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender and to what , having regard to the requirements of retribution and deterrence , is the appropriate minimum period to be spent in custody . The judge , when advising the Secretary of ORG about the tariff , must and does confine his attention to these matters ...", "If the Secretary of ORG wishes to fix a tariff for the case DATE in order to replace the views of the judiciary with a view of his own about the length of DATE he must be careful to abide by the same rules ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In Ex parte Pierson [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , Lord PERSON stated , in a case concerning mandatory life prisoners :", "\u201c In public law the emphasis should be on substance rather than form . The case should not be decided on a semantic quibble about whether the Home Secretary 's function is strictly ' a sentencing exercise ' . The undeniable fact is that in fixing a tariff in the individual case the Home Secretary is making a decision about the punishment of the convicted man . In any event , a majority holding in Ex PERSON concludes the matter ... This point is therefore settled by the binding authority of a decision of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A whole life tariff may be set in appropriate cases . In NORP v. the Home Secretary , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases , where a provisional tariff of DATE had been replaced by a whole life tariff , Lord PERSON held that \u201c life - long incarceration for the purposes of punishment is competent where the crime or crimes are sufficiently heinous \u201d . The decision of the Secretary of ORG to apply a whole life tariff in her case was found in the circumstances to be lawful . He had been entitled to revise his view of the tariff , which had initially been based on incomplete knowledge of her role in the CARDINAL murders upon which she had faced trial and in ignorance of her involvement in CARDINAL other murders , matters which came to light later . According to information provided by the Government , there were CARDINAL mandatory life prisoners with whole life tariffs at DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , LAW DATE provided in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c If recommended to do so by the [ ORG , the Secretary of ORG may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . \u201d", "This is in contrast to the position for other life prisoners , where ORG now has the power of decision DATE pursuant to the provisions of the DATE Act for discretionary life prisoners and pursuant to LAW for detainees during Her Majesty 's pleasure . Where , however , a mandatory life prisoner was recalled to prison , ORG did have a power to direct the Secretary of ORG to release the prisoner immediately ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act , now section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG made a statement in ORG explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners . The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence , the Secretary of ORG", "\u201c will consider not only ( a ) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and ( b ) whether it is safe to release the prisoner , but also ( c ) the public acceptability of early release . This means that [ he ] will only exercise [ his ] discretion to release if [ he is ] satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences , the LANGUAGE courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is , like the discretionary sentence , composed of both a punitive period ( \u201c the tariff \u201d ) and a security period . As regards the latter , detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner 's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff ( see , for example , NORP v. ORG , ex parte Bradley ( ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL , and NORP v. ORG , ex parte ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG ) , ORG observed that , in contrast with the position as regards discretionary life sentences , the theory and practice in respect of mandatory life sentences were out of tune . In his speech , with which the other judges agreed , Lord PERSON explained that the policy whereby murder was treated as an offence so grave that the proper penal element of the sentence was detention for life was inconsistent with the practice adopted by successive Secretaries of State that a mandatory life sentence included a \u201c tariff \u201d period to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence . He added :", "\u201c The discretionary and mandatory life sentences , having in the past grown apart , may now be converging . Nevertheless , on the statutory framework , the underlying theory and current practice , there remains a substantial gap between them . It may be \u2013 I express no opinion \u2013 that the time is approaching when the effect of the CARDINAL types of sentence should be further assimilated . But this is a task of ORG , and I think it quite impossible for the courts to introduce a fundamental change in the relationship between the convicted murderer and the ORG , through the medium of judicial review . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG made the following parliamentary statement , inter alia :", "\u201c I take the opportunity to confirm that my approach on the release of adults convicted of murder once tariff has expired will reflect the policy set out in the answer given on DATE . In particular , the release of such a person will continue to depend not only on the expiry of tariff and on my being satisfied that the level of risk of his committing further imprisonable offences presented by his release is acceptably low , but also on the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice . The position of a prisoner subject to a mandatory life sentence continues to be distinct from that of a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence , a decision on whose final release is a matter for ORG alone . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was noted by ORG in NORP ( PERSON and PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports ( judgment of DATE ) that the criterion of public acceptability of release identified by the ORG Secretary ( point ( c ) in paragraph CARDINAL above ) had never been a determining factor , although the current Home Secretary followed the policy of his predecessors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW DATE came into force , permitting the provisions of the Convention to be relied on in domestic proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON and PERSON ( cited above ) , the CARDINAL applicants challenged the imposition on them for murder of a mandatory life sentence , arguing that this was disproportionate and arbitrary and contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . In dismissing their appeals , ORG found that the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was in reality an indeterminate sentence , rarely involving imprisonment for life , and as such could not be labelled inhuman and degrading . Nor was it arbitrary as in each case the sentence was individualised from the moment it was imposed . The purpose of the mandatory life sentence was , according to the ORG 's counsel ,", "\u201c to punish the offender by subjecting him to an indeterminate sentence under which he will only be released when he has served the tariff part of his sentence , and when it is considered safe to release him ... That is not merely the effect of the sentence , it is the sentence \u201d .", "Lord Justice PERSON also cited in his judgment the conclusions of ORG , chaired by PERSON , issued in DATE :", "CARDINAL . In NORP ( PERSON and PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , CARDINAL prisoners who had been convicted of murder complained that the ORG Secretary had fixed a tariff superior to that recommended by the judiciary DATE instead of DATE and DATE instead of DATE . They relied on LAW , alleging that it was incompatible for the executive to carry out what was in fact a sentencing exercise . ORG dismissed their claims . ORG rejected their appeals on DATE . In doing so , the appellate judges considered the nature of the tariff - fixing exercise for mandatory life prisoners and the significance of GPE case - law .", "Lord Justice PERSON held , inter alia :", "\u201c ... I accept of course that the mandatory life sentence is unique . But not all the offences for which it is imposed can be regarded as uniquely grave . Rather the spectrum is a wide CARDINAL with multiple sadistic murders at one end and mercy killings at the other . Lifelong punitive detention will be appropriate only exceptionally . As for ' broader considerations of a public character ' , it is difficult to understand quite what these are . Regard must not be had to ' public clamour ' \u2013 see [ V. ] . There is , of course , ' the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice ' ( see the ORG Secretary 's statement to ORG on DATE ) . To my mind , however , this can and should be catered for in the fixing of the tariff . The retributive element of the tariff should reflect the public 's moral outrage at an offence . Surely the maintenance of public confidence in the system can not require longer incarceration than that which properly reflects society 's entitlement to vengeance . Sometimes , I recognise that will require a whole life tariff . But why should not the judges determine that ? ... [ ORG to retrospectively increasing the tariff ... [ t]he same problem could presumably arise in a discretionary life sentence case . In truth , however , it begs rather than answers the question whether the initial fixing of the tariff is properly to be regarded as an exercise in sentencing .", "In short I find none of Mr PERSON 's arguments convincing . Neither singly nor cumulatively do they seem to me to provide a principled basis for treating tariff - fixing in mandatory life cases differently from the similar exercise required for discretionary life prisoners and Her Majesty 's pleasure detainees . In all CARDINAL cases the exercise is in substance the fixing of a sentence , determining the length of the first stage of an indeterminate sentence \u2013 that part of it which ( subject only to the need for continuing review in Her Majesty 's pleasure cases ) must be served in custody before any question of release can arise ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although he was of the view that the existing mandatory life sentence regime breached LAW and LAW , he , and the other CARDINAL judges , considered that the GPE case - law ( in particular , PERSON GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) had to be regarded as determinative of the Convention issues in the case . He noted that ORG was about to re - examine the position in GPE and , although considering that the final decision should be the ORG 's , stated that he would be surprised if the present regime for implementing mandatory life sentences survived that re - examination .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , LAW ) ( GPE ) Act DATE now provides that in the case of mandatory life sentences the trial judge fixes the \u201c punishment part \u201d of the sentence , on the expiry of which ORG decides on possible release on licence . The test applied to determine suitability for release is identical to that applied to discretionary life prisoners in GPE and GPE , namely , that ORG is satisfied that the prisoner does not present a substantial risk of reoffending in a manner which is dangerous to life or limb or of committing serious sexual offences .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the Life Sentences ( GPE ) Order SI no . CARDINAL provides that the trial judge decides on the tariff for a mandatory life prisoner and that release post - tariff is determined by ORG ( with a status and functions very similar to those of ORG operating in GPE and GPE ) . The test applied by the ORG is CARDINAL of protection of the public from \u201c serious harm \u201d , this term meaning the risk of harm from violent or sexual offences .", "CARDINAL . Justice , a human rights and law reform organisation founded in DATE , submitted written comments regarding domestic law and practice , following the leave granted to it by the President of the ORG to intervene as a third party ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Its submissions may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The mandatory life sentence imposed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) applied to all convictions for murder , covering a whole bundle of offences of vastly differing degrees of culpability , ranging from brutal serial killings to the mercy killing of a beloved partner . It could not be said that murder was a uniquely heinous offence . The mandatory application of life sentences therefore made the arrangements for release all the more critical in terms of fairness and just deserts . Access to regular judicial review once the tariff expired had been extended to discretionary life prisoners and child murderers and the Secretary of ORG could no longer set tariffs in these cases . Similar provisions were now being extended to mandatory life prisoners in both GPE and GPE under legislation to ensure compliance with human rights .", "CARDINAL . There had been substantial criticism of the current system . In DATE , a ORG of ORG , appointed to report on murder and life imprisonment , recommended the abolition of the mandatory life sentence . In DATE the Home Affairs Select Committee of ORG took evidence and deliberated on the same issues . Their report ( Murder : The Mandatory Life Sentence ) recommended that the tariff and release decisions be removed from the ORG Secretary and left with the trial judge and ORG . Lord Lane , formerly Lord Chief Justice , chaired a ORG on the Penalty for Homicide , which also produced a critical report in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The diversity of circumstances that could lead to a murder conviction meant that murderers as a class of offender did not pose special problems of dangerousness . They had a lower recidivism rate than discretionary life prisoners and the general prison population . The system of tariff - fixing was not easily understood by the prisoners concerned and was subject to delays and uncertainty , both of which factors impinged on the quality of work with life prisoners at the crucial early stages of their sentences .", "CARDINAL . GPE had more serving life prisoners than the rest of LOC together , which was attributable primarily to the mandatory life sentence for murder . While some countries , such as GPE , GPE and GPE , had mandatory life sentences , these were only applied where there were aggravating factors or for a particular type of murder . LAW provided that a life sentence could only be ordered \u201c when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual circumstances of the convicted person \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
