The applicant , born in DATE , is currently detained in FAC Full Sutton .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant was convicted of the murder of a woman whom he had violently assaulted . He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment . In DATE ( or DATE , according to the applicant 's submissions ) , he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation from ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant killed a DATE woman . His plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the court . In DATE a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by the judge having regard to the extreme danger to the public posed by the applicant . At the same time , the court revoked his life licence concerning his earlier sentence of mandatory life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of GPE prison . Since then , he has been transferred into ordinary prison locations as a \u201c Category A \u201d ( high security ) prisoner .", "CARDINAL . The applicant learned that his \u201c tariff \u201d period fixed by the trial judge on the manslaughter offence expired in DATE . He was informed by a ORG of DATE that his continued detention was based on the risk he represented .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant 's submissions , his only ORG review took place in DATE , when , without holding an oral hearing , the ORG declined to recommend release . According to the ORG 's submissions , ORG considered the applicant 's case in DATE and DATE . In DATE , it concluded that his behaviour was aggressive and intimidatory and that he represented a high risk to the public . On DATE , it concluded that he remained far too great a risk to warrant transfer to open conditions . Of the reports before ORG , none recommended early release or early transfer to open conditions .", "CARDINAL . Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under LAW DATE . A person convicted of other serious offences ( for example , . manslaughter or rape ) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE , the Secretary of ORG has adopted a \u201c tariff \u201d policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment . This was first publicly announced in ORG by Mr PERSON on DATE ( ORG ) cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In essence , the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts , namely retribution , deterrence and protection of the public . The \u201c tariff \u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . The Secretary of ORG will not refer the case to ORG until DATE the expiry of the tariff period , and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed ( per Lord PERSON , Ex parte V. and T. , [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , at pp . CARDINALG-CARDINALA ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction . After expiry of the tariff , the prisoner may require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG which has the power to release if satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public .", "CARDINAL . A different regime , however , applies under LAW to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment . In relation to these prisoners , the Secretary of ORG decides the length of the tariff . The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial , as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice . The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of ORG who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL ; and see the ORG Secretary , Mr PERSON , policy statement to ORG , DATE , ( ORG ) cols . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , LAW DATE provided in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c If recommended to do so by the [ ORG , the Secretary of ORG may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG made a statement in ORG explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners . The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence , the Secretary of ORG :", "\u201c ... will consider not only , ( a ) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and , ( b ) whether it is safe to release the prisoner , but also ( c ) the public acceptability of early release . This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences , the NORP courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is , like the discretionary sentence , composed of both a punitive period ( \u201c the tariff \u201d ) and a security period . As regards the latter , detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner 's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff ( see , for example , NORP v. ORG , ex parte Bradley ( ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ; NORP v. ORG ex parte ORG ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AER CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment in GPE v. GPE ( no .
