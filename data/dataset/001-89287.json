The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order was unsuccessful , as were his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and his applications for release .

In its decision given on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against further extension . It relied on the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed on the applicant as well as on the reasonable suspicion , justified by the evidence collected in the proceedings before the first - instance court , that the applicant and his co - accused would obstruct the proceedings . The court further found that the proceedings had been conducted without undue delays and that the applicant \u2019s detention had been necessary to secure the proper course of the proceedings , because the court had had to hear evidence from a certain PERSON , who had previously been accused in the same set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
