The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE of GPE ) . By his own account , he is a lorry driver .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a military doctor declared him unfit for military service as he was suffering from type CARDINAL diabetes ( diabetes mellitus ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was also exempted from the civil protection service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that exemption was lifted and in DATE the applicant was assigned to ORG in the GPE of GPE . According to the Government , it is unclear from the file whether the applicant was given any tasks to carry out in a civil protection capacity . The applicant alleges that he volunteered on several occasions , but because of staff cutbacks in the GPE of GPE he was never called to do any civil protection duty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE cantonal authorities responsible for the military - service exemption tax sent him an order to pay the tax for DATE , in the amount of MONEY ( CHF ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , based on his taxable income DATE ( CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL \u2013 approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the applicant challenged the tax demand , considering that he was being discriminated against . He pointed out that he had always stated his readiness to do military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the federal tax authorities informed the applicant that all NORP men who did not suffer from a \u201c major \u201d disability were required to pay a tax in order to be exempted from military service . They explained that a disability was considered \u201c major \u201d if the degree of physical or mental disability was PERCENT . They considered that further examinations were needed in order to determine whether the applicant \u2019s disability met that requirement .", "CARDINAL . When he examined the applicant on DATE , a doctor from ORG found that in most cases the type of diabetes the applicant suffered from did not make people unfit for work .", "CARDINAL . In another expert medical examination on CARDINAL DATE , a military doctor found the applicant \u2019s physical disability to be PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the GPE cantonal authorities responsible for the military - service exemption tax decided , based on the findings of the medical examination and the expert examination of DATE , that the applicant did not qualify for exemption from the tax as his degree of invalidity was PERCENT . The applicant challenged that decision and the authorities confirmed it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG for the GPE of GPE upheld that decision on DATE . It considered that in adopting the criteria set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) ORG \u2019s intention had not been to generally exempt all people with disabilities from the obligation to pay the tax in question . In the applicant \u2019s case the medical examination of CARDINAL DATE had shown that his disability was not a major one and that his condition was highly unlikely to be an obstacle in his future career . Thanks to medical progress , patients with the applicant \u2019s type of diabetes could live quite normal lives DATE and practise almost any line of work . That being so , the people concerned were not considered to have disabilities for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG . ORG further found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that his condition , and in particular the need to administer himself CARDINAL insulin injections DATE , prevented him from working . Lastly , ORG did not consider that the distinction between major disabilities and other types of disability amounted , as the applicant alleged , to discrimination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an administrative complaint with ORG . He claimed , in particular , that he was a victim of discriminatory treatment in so far as , on the one hand , he had been required to pay the exemption tax and , on the other , he had not been allowed to do his military service even though he had always stated his readiness to do it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when invited by ORG to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of the complaint , the federal tax authorities recommended its rejection .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the complaint . Based on the findings of the expert examination of DATE , it held that the applicant did not have a major physical or mental disability within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG . Accordingly , he did not qualify for exemption from the tax . ORG also pointed out that although the medical examination showed that the type of diabetes the applicant had was unlikely to prevent him from holding a normal job , the particular constraints of military service nevertheless obliged the authorities to declare him unfit .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that the aim of the law was to provide a system of compensation between those citizens who did their military service and those who were exempted from it for whatever reason . The tax in issue was meant to replace the effort and inconvenience of military service . As to the complaint of discrimination , the court explained that it was for reasons of equality that the law did not provide for a blanket exemption for all people with disabilities .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the cantonal authorities had merely correctly applied the law and that it was not the court \u2019s role to change the law .", "CARDINAL . It also held that the fact that the applicant had always declared his willingness to do military service and felt fit to do it as a professional driver did not make any difference , as the law provided for no alternative for someone in his situation but to pay the exemption tax .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides the foundation for compulsory military service in GPE .

This last provision indicates that the obligation to pay the tax lasts until DATE in which the person concerned reaches the age - limit at which ordinary servicemen and certain non - commissioned officers are freed from military obligations , that is to say from DATE birthday ( according to the applicant , under LAW of ORG he would be subject to the tax until DATE ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the legislation governing direct federal taxes , the military - service exemption tax is levied on the person \u2019s total net income . As a result , for a bachelor the income on which the exemption tax is based is the taxable income under the law governing direct federal taxes . The exemption tax is PERCENT of that income ( but MONEY CARDINAL ) . According to the Government that method of calculating the tax has the advantage of sparing the person concerned the trouble of filling in an additional tax declaration for the exemption tax .", "CARDINAL . In its earlier wording the criterion adopted in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the order of CARDINAL DATE on the military - service exemption tax to determine whether a disability should be considered \u201c major \u201d for the purposes of ORG was the degree of disability used for disability insurance . However , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) , ORG explained that the notion of \u201c major \u201d physical or mental of disability within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG should be understood in the medical sense , not the disability insurance sense . Ruling on the merits of the case , it held that the disability caused by amputation of the leg at the knee was a \u201c major \u201d disability , corresponding to PERCENT on the disability scale ( Appendix CARDINAL to the order of DATE on accident insurance ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG f\u00fcr PERSON CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG decided that in order to determine whether a disability was \u201c major \u201d for the purposes of exemption from the tax , what should be taken into consideration were the tables used by ORG in the event of an accident to calculate compensation for bodily harm in accordance with the federal law on accident insurance . The court also considered that the authorities could base their decision on the federal tax authorities\u2019 \u201c Instructions concerning exoneration from the tax because of a major physical , mental or psychological disability \u201d , which were based on those tables and could be considered to have the value of a presumption of law in so far as they were sufficiently relevant to the particular case .", "CARDINAL .

Civilian service is a substitute service for people eligible for military service who can not reconcile the obligation to do military service with their conscience . It is regulated by ORG of DATE . The formal condition for eligibility for civilian service is fitness for military service .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides separate regulations governing civil protection . The obligation to do civil protection service is unrelated to the obligation to serve in the army , so military service can not be replaced by time spent in the civil protection service . Nor is there any possibility of choosing between military service and civil protection . On the other hand , all the training and work done in civil protection can be taken into account in the calculation of the exemption tax .", "CARDINAL .
