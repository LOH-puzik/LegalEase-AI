He is represented before the ORG by Ms T. Spronken , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE , the GPE judicial police department ( ORG ) took statements from CARDINAL NORP women , namely PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who declared that they had been forced to prostitute themselves in the GPE and that together they had fled to GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of trafficking in persons in respect of CARDINAL NORP women . In the course of the subsequent preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) against the applicant and QUANTITY others , a GPE Commission PERSON travelled to GPE in order to take oral evidence from QUANTITY women . ORG PERSON consisted of the responsible investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , a registrar , the public prosecutor , CARDINAL NORP police officers and CARDINAL defence lawyers .", "On DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG PERSON took evidence in GPE from CARDINAL women ; PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , and PERSON The different defence lawyers attended these hearings and were allowed to put direct questions to the witnesses . Although the NORP authorities had summoned the witness PERSON , she had failed to appear . Consequently , no evidence could be taken from her .", "The applicant was summoned to appear on DATE before ORG of GPE on charges of , inter alia , trafficking in persons . It was specified in the summons that this charge related to CARDINAL women , including PERSON", "On DATE , ORG started its examination of the case of the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused . Although the criminal proceedings against each of the CARDINAL accused remained formally separated , ORG would hear the respective cases simultaneously .", "Upon request of the applicant 's lawyer , ORG ordered that evidence should be taken from PERSON and requested the prosecution to inform the court whether she would be willing to give evidence in the GPE . If this would be the case , the court would adjourn the proceedings against the applicant until this witness would appear either before ORG or before the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) . On DATE , ORG heard the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused .", "In the course of the hearing held on DATE , ORG considered a formal record ( proces - verbaal ) of CARDINAL DATE of the police officer P. According to this record , PERSON had informed PERSON , the Chief of ORG of the Police Presidium in GPE on DATE by telephone of the request of the public prosecutor to establish the whereabouts of PERSON He was told by PERSON that an investigation would be carried out . On DATE , PERSON informed PERSON by telephone that he had spoken with PERSON , who had recently spoken with PERSON by telephone . PERSON had told him that PERSON had told her that she wished to forget the suffering caused to her as soon as possible and that she did not wish to have any contacts with the police or department of justice in connection with what had happened to her in the GPE . From her conversation with PERSON , PERSON had gathered that she was now residing somewhere in the centre of GPE . PERSON further told PERSON that she did not have a telephone number where PERSON could be reached . Mr PERSON further informed P. that an attempt had been made to contact PERSON at her last known addresses , but without any results .", "Holding that , in these circumstances , it would be useless to call or summon PERSON , ORG decided not to order the prosecution to summon or call this witness . Further hearings before ORG were held on CARDINAL and DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG convicted the applicant of , inter alia , trafficking in persons and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It rejected the argument of the defence that the formal records containing statements taken by the police from PERSON could not be used in evidence , as the defence had not been able to question her . It held in this respect that the applicant 's conviction of trafficking in persons in relation to PERSON was based for a substantial part on statements of others who had been heard before a judicial authority or NORP criminal investigation official . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "On DATE , the Procurator - General to ORG of The Hague issued a summons ordering PERSON to appear on DATE before ORG in order to give evidence in the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "During the hearing held on DATE before ORG , it was noted that PERSON had not appeared . The public prosecutor informed the court that PERSON was residing in GPE and that she had stated , after having been contacted in person , that she was absolutely not willing to come to the GPE . Since it was not very likely that she would appear before ORG within a reasonable time , the prosecution submitted that a renewed summons appeared to be of little use . The defence maintained its request to hear PERSON , as the defence had so far not been able to question her .", "After having deliberated , ORG decided that a renewed summons for PERSON , who was residing abroad , was pointless . It considered that it was not to be expected that she would appear before the court within an acceptable delay , as it appeared from both the formal record of DATE by the police officer PERSON and the information submitted by the prosecution that she had no intention of coming to the GPE and that she was completely unwilling to be heard as a witness .", "A further hearing before ORG was held on DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of repeated commission of trafficking in persons committed by CARDINAL or more persons in unison and of having inflicted actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm on PERSON , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "ORG based the applicant 's conviction of trafficking in persons , including in relation to PERSON , on :", "- a statement made by the applicant before ORG in which he confirmed that he knew PERSON , who , together with other women and himself , had lived in a house in GPE ;", "- a statement made by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge in which she declared that she had been forced by the applicant , who had taken away her passport , to prostitute herself in the GPE and that , together with PERSON , she had run away ;", "- a statement made by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge and a statement given by her on DATE to the GPE judicial police department , in which she declared that she had been forced by the applicant , who had taken away her passport , to prostitute herself in the GPE and that , together with PERSON and PERSON , she had run away ;", "- a statement given by PERSON on DATE to the GPE judicial police department in which she declared that she had been forced by the applicant , who had taken away her passport , to prostitute herself , that she had worked in the NORP , PERSON and B. club , that PERSON had been mainly made to work in the PERSON club and that , together with PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , she had decided to flee to GPE ;", "- a statement given by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge and a statement given by her on DATE to the GPE judicial police department , in which she declared that she had been forced by the applicant , who had taken away her passport , to prostitute herself in the GPE , that she had worked together with PERSON in the PERSON club and that , together with PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , she had gone to GPE ;", "- a statement given by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge and statements given by her on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE to the NORP police , in which she declared that the applicant had forced her to prostitute herself , that she knew PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , that she had worked as a prostitute in the NORP and B. club , that the applicant had taken away the passports of PERSON and PERSON , that she , PERSON and PERSON had been brought in the applicant 's car to GPE in order to work there as prostitutes , and that in DATE a number of the applicant 's women - PERSON , PERSON , Dada and PERSON - had not come back to the house in GPE after their work ;", "- a statement given by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge and statements given by her on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE to the NORP police , in which she declared that the applicant had forced her to prostitute herself , that she knew PERSON , PERSON and PERSON with whom she had lived in a house in GPE , that together with PERSON she had worked in the NORP club , and that in DATE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had escaped ;", "- a statement given by PERSON on DATE to the investigating judge and a statement given by her on DATE to the NORP police , in which she declared that she had met PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON who had lived in a house in GPE , that none of the women had of their free will worked as a prostitute , that the applicant had taken away the passport from PERSON ; and", "- a set of photographs - including photographs of the applicant , the co - accused and the victims - that had been put to the applicant and the witnesses for identification purposes .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) in which he complained , inter alia , that ORG had used in evidence statements given by PERSON whereas the defence had not been provided with the opportunity to question her and whereas her statements were insufficiently supported by other evidence .", "In its judgment of DATE , referring to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal in cassation as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development .", ""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
