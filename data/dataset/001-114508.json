NORP The applicant arrived in GPE at DATE with his father and siblings . His mother appears to have been in GPE already . He had left GPE at DATE and spent DATE in GPE . His father claimed asylum with his family , including the applicant , as his dependants ; however , this claim was refused . The family were granted exceptional leave to remain and , in time , indefinite leave to remain .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted of arson and abusive or threatening behaviour on DATE and sentenced to DATE in a young offenders\u2019 institution . Throughout DATE and DATE , he was convicted of numerous counts of failure to surrender to custody and shoplifting , for which he was fined or sentenced to short periods of imprisonment or community service . On DATE , he was convicted of attempted robbery with an offensive weapon in a public place and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . He was notified of his liability to deportation as a result of this conviction on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant raised a fear of return to NORP on DATE , but on DATE he informed the authorities in writing that he did not wish to pursue an asylum claim . He applied to and was accepted onto the facilitated voluntary return scheme on DATE , but withdrew from the scheme on CARDINAL DATE on the basis that he wished to pursue an asylum claim . The basis of his claim was that he would be at risk in GPE due to his father \u2019s previous political involvement . The applicant \u2019s asylum claim was refused by the Secretary of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to revoke his deportation order was dismissed by the First - tier ORG ) on DATE . The ORG upheld the Secretary of ORG \u2019s certification that the applicant , as a danger to the community , was excluded from protection under LAW , but went on to consider his claim under LAW and CARDINAL . It was found to be wholly incredible that he should be at risk in GPE on the basis of his father \u2019s former political activities : not only had his father allegedly been involved in politics in central GPE and not NORP , but his father \u2019s asylum claim upon entry to GPE had failed . If the applicant \u2019s father was not considered to be at risk in DATE then , there was no reason that his son should be at risk now . The ORG noted that there was a functioning administration in GPE , unlike the rest of GPE , and that the general security situation was stable . The applicant had been born in GPE ; his father was from the area ; and his mother was a member of the PERSON , which was the majority clan in GPE . The applicant also had relatives in neighbouring GPE and possibly in central GPE . He had not established that his rights under LAW and CARDINAL would be breached by his return to NORP . In terms of Article CARDINAL it was not considered that the applicant had family life in GPE and his private life was limited given the amount of time he had spent incarcerated . The substantial public interest in his deportation , given his long history of offending , rendered his deportation proportionate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal to ORG ; however , this application was refused on DATE . The applicant sought facilitated voluntary return to NORP but again withdrew from the scheme on DATE . He was released on bail on DATE but was rearrested on CARDINAL DATE for racially or religiously aggravated assault . He was remanded on bail but rearrested on DATE pending his deportation , which was set for DATE to NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought an interim measure from this ORG to prevent his removal and on DATE , the Acting President of the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and indicated to the Government of GPE that the applicant should not be removed until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG considered information received from the Government regarding the safety of returns to NORP and all the facts of the applicant \u2019s case , and decided to lift the interim measure previously indicated under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds , inter alia , that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL . NORP The central issue arising in this case , heard by ORG on DATE , was a claim for damages for false imprisonment by a NORP national who had been held in immigration detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . The ORG had sought his deportation , as a foreign national criminal , to GPE , from where it was believed that the claimant originated . However , due to various factors , the applicant \u2019s deportation could not be arranged and he was eventually released on immigration bail . In finding that , from DATE , the applicant \u2019s detention had been unlawful , ORG referred inter alia to a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom and the NORP authorities concluded in DATE and renewed in DATE , which dealt with the question of returns .", "CARDINAL . The Memorandum of Understanding provided that the NORP authorities would accept the return of persons who had no right to remain in GPE and had a right of return to NORP . Such return might be voluntary or enforced as regards the individual , but required the prior consent of the authorities . Such consent would be granted only after the provision of adequate bio - data to satisfy the NORP authorities that the individual in question had a sufficient connection to GPE , which would generally entail that the person came from a clan with a sizeable representation in the region , and/or had been born ( or had parents who had been born ) in the region , and/or had family currently residing there . Such bio - data was , in practice , difficult to obtain without a significant level of cooperation from the proposed returnee . Furthermore , on a separate but related note , there had been no practical possibility of enforced returns DATE due to a refusal by all air carriers operating flights to NORP to carry passengers who had not consented to travel .", "CARDINAL . In the case of the claimant in question , his unwillingness and inability to provide sufficient bio - data to satisfy the NORP authorities\u2019 stringent requirements meant that , by DATE , it should have become evident that his deportation to GPE would not be achieved within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . The latest report published by the ORG , ORG for assessing the international protection needs of asylum - seekers from GPE , published on CARDINAL DATE , stated as follows :", "\u201c The self - declared Republic of NORP , which has not been recognized by the international community as an independent sovereign state , has been relatively peaceful and secure with the exception of the problematic presidential elections process ...", "ORG considers that a situation of generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order does not exist to the extent that an individual present in either GPE or PERSON would be at risk of serious harm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The most recent Operational Guidance Note on GPE , published on DATE , provided :", "\u201c NORP and GPE , are in general relatively safe . A long - standing dispute exists over the territories of PERSON , NORP and Sanag , with both PERSON and GPE claiming them and the Sool - Sanag - Cayn alliances fighting to remain part of the original state of GPE . General insecurity resulting from armed violence continues to be the main protection concern in the LOC regions of GPE and there has also been an increase in violence and assassinations in GPE , since DATE , mostly in GPE , PERSON and areas around GPE .", "There are major protection concerns around [ internally displaced person ] settlements both in GPE and GPE , which include overcrowding , severe levels of malnourishment , economic exploitation of children and a lack of physical security , rapes , gang rapes and other instances of sexual and gender - based violence .", "The authorities in GPE will only admit failed asylum seekers returning from NORP countries who originate from their territory or those who have close affiliations to the territory through clan membership . In the case of majority clan affiliates , this means those associated with the GPE in GPE . In NORP taxis and CARDINAL vehicles can easily travel from GPE , ORG and PERSON . The main transportation between GPE and LOC is by lorry . People travel by air between GPE and PERSON . The ORG in ORG and others ... also found that a person from GPE will not , in general , be able without real risk of serious harm to travel overland from FAC to a place where he or she might be able to obtain an unofficial travel document for the purposes of gaining entry to NORP , and then by land to GPE . This is particularly the case if the person is female . A proposed return by air to PERSON , GPE ( whether or not via FAC ) will in general involve no such risks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a report titled Human Rights Challenges : ORG and published on DATE , ORG found that :", "\u201c While overall human rights and humanitarian conditions have continued to worsen in southern and central GPE , as well as in GPE , a stable NORP has devoted attention to democratization , institutional capacity - building , stability and development in its CARDINAL-year pursuit of international recognition of self - declared independence . While ORG takes no position on GPE \u2019s claim to independence , the international community should provide the de facto authorities of the Government of NORP with necessary support to promote the rights of its people , and to ensure its capacity to firmly establish broad human rights protections . \u201d", "In their DATE Report on GPE , published on CARDINAL DATE , ORG observed :", "\u201c Presidential elections were held on DATE in GPE . PERSON , a former opposition politician , was declared the new President in DATE . According to independent observers , the elections were generally free , fair and peaceful . However , media freedom organizations reported some instances of restrictions on journalists in the lead - up to the elections .", "Tensions flared in the border areas of NORP and PERSON claimed by GPE .

CARDINAL of people were reportedly displaced by the clashes .", "Displaced people from southern and central GPE continued to live in difficult conditions .", "Minority groups continued to suffer discrimination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A Human Rights Watch report , Hostages to Peace : Threats to Human Rights and Democracy in NORP , was published on DATE and stated :", "\u201c What PERSON has accomplished over DATE is both improbable and deeply impressive . While much of south / central GPE remains mired in chaos and bloodshed , GPE has built a hard - won peace that it has now maintained for DATE . That peace has sheltered PERSON from the horrific abuses that have destroyed so many lives across GPE . At the same time , GPE has done much to build the foundations of democratic governance grounded in respect for fundamental human rights . In DATE and DATE it held competitive and credible national elections , including parliamentary polls that put the territory \u2019s ORG firmly in the hands of the political opposition . There is a vibrant print media and an active and independent civil society .
