The first and second applicants were born in DATE and DATE and live in GPE and GPE respectively . The applicant company is based in GPE . The first applicant is the editor - in - chief of the applicant company and the second applicant is a journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a student was allegedly raped at a party which was held to celebrate a local baseball team 's victory in the NORP championship . On DATE the applicant company published an article in the magazine ORG about this incident entitled \u201c A student raped at the baseball party \u201d . The content of the article was the following :", "\u201c A girl studying in PERSON [ name of the city ] was raped at the party to celebrate the victory of GPE [ name of the team ] DATE . Several players of the team participated in the rape .", "The folk high school of PERSON confirms that their student was a victim of rape at the party to celebrate the victory of GPE held on DATE .", "The girl had been invited by the gold - medal team to attend \u201c an after party \u201d in a hotel in PERSON According to the information received by ORG , the rapist was CARDINAL of the players of the team but there were also other players in the hotel room , some of them holding the victim , some of them watching . The rape was interrupted when CARDINAL of the players of the team entered the room and ordered the others to stop the rape .", "The student girl is an adult . She has given a written statement about the incident but does not wish , at least for the time being , to report the incident to the police .", "The folk high school has reported the incident to the city officials , to the leaders of the baseball team and to its main sponsor .", "GPE won the second consecutive gold medal in the NORP championship league DATE . The team defeated PERSON straight CARDINAL - CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article did not include any photographs . Moreover , the statement \u201c Baseball winning party ended in a rape \u201d was printed on the cover of the magazine .", "CARDINAL . The players had not been contacted for their comments before the article in question was published but the magazine published in its next issue a reply given by them in which they denied being guilty of any crime .", "CARDINAL . The content of the article was based on a statement given by the victim to the folk high school of PERSON on the following morning and which had been corroborated by CARDINAL witnesses . Several other persons had also made statements supporting the victim 's account of the facts .", "CARDINAL . The police started to investigate the alleged rape after the article had been published . According to a press release issued by the police on DATE , the victim of the alleged rape was not able to identify the offender or the offenders nor was she able to clarify the events in such detail that the offence could be attributed to a certain person or persons . Consequently , ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) interrupted the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges for aggravated defamation against the first applicant , the editor - in - chief of the applicant company , and the second applicant , the journalist . The baseball team pursued a compensation claim against all the applicants , which was joined to the criminal charges .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , after an oral hearing , sentenced the first and second applicants to pay DATE - fines , amounting to CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( ORG ) respectively , for aggravated defamation . Moreover , all the defendants in the domestic proceedings were jointly and severally ordered to pay the baseball team ORG CARDINAL plus interest for non - pecuniary damage as well as for costs and expenses . The court found that the statement made by the rape victim had not been reliable since she had not brought the issue to the police 's attention . The local public had not been aware of the incident until the article in question was published in the mass media . All members of the baseball team had suffered non - pecuniary damage due to the false accusations published in the article . The court concluded that the accusations were so serious that their accuracy should have been verified very carefully , which the applicants had failed to do . As to the compensation awarded , the court noted that the defamation was directed at all players of the team and that they could receive compassionate support from each other . The court took this into account when reducing the amount of compensation awarded for their suffering .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , claiming that they had had strong reasons to believe that the accusations were true . If the same evidence had been presented in criminal proceedings , it would have led to the conviction of the offender . The police had been aware of the incident but had not done anything even though rape was an offence that always required ex officio public prosecution . The applicants claimed under LAW that their right to freedom of expression had been violated .", "CARDINAL . ORG held an oral hearing from DATE . On DATE it upheld ORG judgment . ORG stated the following :", "\u201c Freedom of expression and protection of private life and honour are fundamental rights . According to LAW , everyone 's honour is guaranteed . Freedom of expression and protection of honour are also human rights protected by LAW . Therefore , when interpreting the extent of these fundamental rights , the case - law of ORG must also be taken into account .", "...", "According to LAW , the exercise of freedom of expression may be subject to such restrictions and penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a NORP society , for the protection of the reputation of others . ORG has , inter alia , in its judgment GPE and ORG v. GPE of DATE taken a position with respect to the freedom of expression of journalists , stating that the press must not overstep certain bounds in respect of the rights and the reputation of the others , although journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration , or even provocation . Similarly in the case PERSON and GPE v. GPE of DATE .", "According to LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law . ORG has found in the case PERSON and GPE v. GPE of DATE that the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation required that the journalists should have relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis which could be considered proportionate to the nature and degree of their allegation , given that the more serious the allegation , the more solid the factual basis had to be . In the case \u201c NORP - Trend \u201d ORG v. GPE of DATE the above - mentioned court stated that , as the case had only reached an early stage of the criminal proceedings , particular care had to be taken to protect a person against \u201c trial by the media \u201d and to give effect to the presumption of innocence .", "It must be decided on the one hand whether the honour of [ the players ] has been violated and on the other hand , whether there were sufficient reasons to restrict [ the applicants ' ] freedom of expression .", "The article in question mentions that some of the players of the GPE were guilty of rape . As it was mentioned in the article that the rape took place at the party to celebrate the victory of GPE , one can reasonably think that it was especially the players of the winning team that were involved . [ The second applicant ] has confirmed during the ORG proceedings that by players he had meant the players of the winning team .", "The article was written in such a manner that any one of the players could have been guilty of a serious crime . The maximum sanction for the alleged crime is DATE imprisonment . Before the publication of the article , not even the pre - trial investigation had started . Labelling someone guilty before a matter has been resolved by a court of law would mean rendering a premature public judgment , the consequences of which could be difficult to repair . Also and from the general point of view , taking into account ultimately the ability of the courts to function , the public must not have false expectations or misunderstandings ( for example ORG ) . The allegation has violated [ the players ' ] right to the presumption of innocence . Moreover , the allegation of having committed a serious crime is an act that is conducive to causing damage and suffering or contempt . On the above - mentioned grounds the ORG finds , like ORG , that [ the players ' ] honour has been violated .", "[ The applicants ] have alleged in ORG that the police of PERSON had known about the rape but had not taken any measures . Concealing a serious crime is an issue of social relevance about which the press must be able to write . However , the article does not mention that the police tried to conceal the matter or that the folk high school or anybody else had even informed the police . On the contrary , the article mentioned that the alleged victim did not want to report the incident to the police . Even though according to the article the folk high school had reported the incident to the city officials , to the management of the baseball team and to its main sponsor , this part of the article does not , bearing in mind the possibility of the said instances to act in the matter , show any intention to conceal the matter .", "On the above - mentioned grounds , ORG finds that the essential function of the press in the core area of freedom of expression and as a guardian against misuse of power in a NORP society is not at stake in the present case , even though the pre - trial investigation into the alleged rape was started only after the publication of the article .", "[ The first and second applicants ] have not demonstrated that they had sufficient reasons to believe that the allegations made in the article were true . They have stated that they did not even try to contact [ the victim ] , the players or their team . [ The first and second applicants ] have declined to reveal their sources . By not revealing their sources , they have taken the risk of possibly being convicted for defamation . As stated above , there is no indication that the alleged rape was commonly known in PERSON before the publication of the article . By relying solely on the statement made by the [ victim ] , in which the perpetrators were not identified in any other way than that the rape had taken place at the winners ' party , [ the first and second applicants ] could not have reasonably considered the statement as being true . The statement was made by private persons and in order that the folk high school could later demonstrate that it had given sufficient instructions in the matter . The statement had not been written on [ the victim 's ] initiative . One could not reach such a conclusion on the basis of the statement that only some of the players were guilty of rape . [ The first and second applicants ] have failed to verify sufficiently that the information about the players being guilty of rape was true , although they had had the possibility to clarify the issue . The nature and the seriousness of the crime required that the article was particularly accurate .", "There are no reasons to estimate that [ the players ' ] right to honour would be lesser than [ the first and second applicants ' ] right to freedom of expression . Restricting [ the first and second applicants ' ] right to freedom of expression was necessary in order to protect [ the players ' ] honour and their presumption of innocence . .... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
