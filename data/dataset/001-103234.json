The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son PERSON was born out of wedlock on CARDINAL DATE . The child was given the applicant \u2019s family name by decision of GPE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At that time PERSON \u2019s mother was living as a tenant in the applicant \u2019s house , in a separate apartment . The applicant was sharing an apartment with his long - term partner , PERSON , who later became his wife , and their son NORP aged CARDINAL at that time . During PERSON \u2019s first year the applicant took parental leave and took care of him together with U. Subsequently , ORG mother took parental leave .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON \u2019s mother moved out of the applicant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) to transfer sole custody of PERSON to him under LAW of LAW ( ORG ) . He submitted in particular that he and U. had mainly taken care of PERSON and that the child \u2019s mother was not capable of doing so . The latter opposed the transfer of custody . At that stage and at all subsequent stages of the proceedings the applicant was assisted by counsel .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Jugendamt ) , which had been following the case since DATE , expressed the view that both parents were capable of exercising custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother appeared before ORG and were heard by the judge .", "CARDINAL . According to the minutes , the applicant requested that the opinion of an expert in child psychology be taken . PERSON \u2019s mother agreed to that request . The court appointed PERSON , an expert in child psychology , and ordered him to submit an opinion on whether the interests of the child were better served by leaving sole custody with the mother or by awarding it to the applicant . The judge then proceeded to discuss the factual and legal issues with the parties . The parties then concluded an agreement to the effect that , pending a decision on custody , PERSON would spend DATE with his mother and DATE with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The expert , Dr PERSON , submitted his opinion to ORG on DATE . The opinion was based on interviews which the expert had conducted with PERSON \u2019s mother and the applicant and his partner . He had also paid a visit to the applicant \u2019s home during which he had observed how the applicant and the other members of his family interacted with PERSON The expert opinion was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the applicant , his counsel , PERSON \u2019s mother , PERSON and a representative of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the minutes , the contents of the file were read out . Subsequently , Dr PERSON opinion was discussed . In the course of the hearing Dr PERSON supplemented his opinion . He expressed the view that PERSON \u2019s mother was very immature and not yet capable of taking care of him and recommended the transfer of sole custody to the applicant . The representative of ORG opposed the view that PERSON \u2019s mother was not capable of raising the child . None of the parties made further submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , that is , on DATE , ORG ordered a second expert in child psychology , PERSON , to submit an opinion on whether or not PERSON \u2019s mother was capable of taking care of him . In her opinion of DATE , PERSON came to the conclusion that PERSON \u2019s mother was sufficiently mature , did not show any emotional instability and was capable of taking care of him . A copy of this expert opinion was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In addition ORG requested ORG to prepare a report . A representative of ORG visited PERSON and his mother at their home and as a result of that visit concluded that she was able to exercise custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested that a decisive expert opinion ( LAW ) be commissioned . The motion contained comprehensive submissions on PERSON \u2019s mother \u2019s alleged incapacity to raise him .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered a third expert , PERSON , to submit a decisive expert opinion on the question whether PERSON \u2019s mother was capable of exercising custody .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother made further written submissions . Each of them forwarded detailed arguments as to why the other parent was not an appropriate person to take care of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr B. submitted his expert opinion . Having interviewed the applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother , he found that both parents were in principle capable of taking care of PERSON The mother had some issues as regards her own personality development and a somewhat limited capacity to cope with everyday life . The applicant had a tendency to dominate and had given reason to fear that , if custody was awarded to him , he would try to curtail the mother \u2019s access rights . The applicant could provide a more stable environment and a more coherent style of upbringing . However , PERSON \u2019s best interests would not be manifestly endangered if custody remained with his mother . It was recommended that the applicant be given extensive access rights , in that PERSON should stay with him from DATE , spend DATE with him in DATE and DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . A copy of PERSON expert opinion was served on the applicant , and he was given DATE to submit comments . Within that time - limit , the applicant requested that the expert opinion be discussed at a hearing . He did not make any comments in writing .", "CARDINAL . Without holding a further hearing , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for sole custody of PERSON to be transferred to him by decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that under LAW the mother of a child born out of wedlock had sole custody . A transfer of custody was only to be ordered if the child \u2019s best interests were at risk . In the present case the applicant would have had to prove that PERSON \u2019s mother was unable to take care of him . While the first expert , Mr PERSON , had come to the conclusion that this was the case , the second expert , PERSON , had reached the opposite conclusion . Finally , the decisive expert opinion by PERSON had found it established that PERSON \u2019s mother was capable of taking care of him . Having regard to the second and third expert opinions and to the view expressed by ORG , it had been established that PERSON \u2019s mother was able to exercise custody and the applicant had failed to adduce proof to the contrary .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG noted that it had not considered it necessary to hold a hearing to discuss the decisive expert opinion , since it found that opinion coherent and convincing . The factual and legal issues of the case had therefore been sufficiently clarified and a hearing would only have delayed the proceedings . It followed that the applicant \u2019s further requests for the taking of evidence had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court ruled that its decision was immediately enforceable with the consequence that the agreement of CARDINAL DATE was no longer effective .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He complained about a number of procedural shortcomings . He alleged , inter alia , that ORG had failed to hold a hearing for the purpose of discussing PERSON expert opinion , and that it had not heard him in person .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant contended that the relevant provisions of LAW , namely , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , were discriminatory and suggested that the appellate court request ORG to rule on their constitutionality . Since PERSON had been born out of wedlock , his mother had sole custody of him and he , as the child \u2019s father , could only be awarded custody if the mother put the child \u2019s well - being at risk . In the case of a child born in wedlock the parents had joint custody and retained it upon divorce or separation unless the child \u2019s best interests required that sole custody be awarded to CARDINAL of them . The application of different criteria when the parents of a child born out of wedlock separated lacked reasonable justification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the proceedings before ORG had not suffered from any procedural defects . In non - contentious proceedings it was not always required to question the parties at a hearing . A hearing had been held on DATE in the presence of the applicant . Furthermore , the applicant had had the opportunity to file written submissions , of which he had made ample use . He had also been interviewed by the experts . A further hearing for the purpose of discussing the decisive expert opinion of PERSON would only have been required had there been substantial doubts as to its correctness .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG did not see any reason to request ORG to rule on the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of LAW . It noted that LAW allowed life - companions to request joint custody . The applicant had not claimed to have cohabited with PERSON \u2019s mother . On the contrary he had cohabited with another woman , PERSON , who had meanwhile become his wife .", "CARDINAL . A distinction between children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock was not discriminatory as long as it was objectively justified . The rule contained in LAW that in the case of a child born out of wedlock ( unless the parents had requested joint custody under LAW ) custody was only to be transferred if the mother put the child \u2019s well - being at risk , was based on the consideration that in the majority of cases of children born out of wedlock it was actually the mother who took care of the child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an extraordinary appeal on points of law . He repeated his complaints about the alleged procedural shortcomings . In particular , he submitted that the court had neither held a hearing to discuss the decisive expert opinion of PERSON nor given him an opportunity to comment in writing . The applicant also reiterated his request for the case to be submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law . It noted that the courts were not obliged to hold hearings in custody proceedings . The applicant had been given the opportunity to comment on the expert opinion at issue . Moreover , the courts had correctly applied LAW . It had not been shown that the mother put PERSON \u2019s well - being at risk .", "CARDINAL . To date , PERSON \u2019s mother continues to have sole custody of him while the applicant has a right of access under the terms recommended by the courts in the custody proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW in the version in force at the material time read as follows :", "\u201c The parents shall care for and raise the minor child , manage its assets and represent it in these , as well as in all other matters ; care , upbringing and asset management also include representing the child in these matters before the law [ in court ] . The parents shall proceed on a consensual basis when complying with these obligations and exercising these rights . \u201d", "\u201c The mother shall have sole custody of an illegitimate child . Moreover , unless the present provisions stipulate otherwise , the provisions on legitimate children regarding maintenance and custody shall also apply to illegitimate children . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Whenever the parents of a child live in a common household , they may agree that both parents will have custody in the future . The court shall uphold the agreement if it serves the interests of the child . If CARDINAL parent leaves the common household , other than on a temporary basis , \u00a7 CARDINAL and \u00a7 CARDINALa shall be applied accordingly .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Whenever the parents do not live in a common household , they can agree that the father shall also have full custodial powers or regarding specific matters in the future , if they present such an agreement to the court indicating the parent with which the child is to stay primarily . If the child stays primarily in the household of the father , the latter must also be assigned full custody . The court shall uphold the agreement if it serves the interests of the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This version of LAW was introduced by DATE LAW , which entered into force on DATE . Before that date parents of an illegitimate child could only agree on exercising custody jointly if they were living in a common household .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Whenever the parents put the well - being of a minor child at risk , on account of their conduct , the court will take the steps necessary to secure the interests of the child , irrespective of which party has applied to the court . In particular , the court may withdraw all or part of the custodial rights in respect of the child , ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the marriage of the parents of a minor legitimate child is dissolved or annulled , the custodial rights of both parents remain intact . However , they may present an agreement to the court DATE even modifying an existing agreement \u2013 regarding custodial responsibility . In this connection it may be agreed that CARDINAL parent alone or both parents shall have custody . Where both parents have custodial powers , those of CARDINAL parent may be limited to specific matters .", "( CARDINAL ) Where both parents have custody , they must submit an agreement to the court regarding the parent with whom the child is to stay primarily . This parent must always be put in charge of all custodial matters .", "( CARDINAL ) The court must approve the agreement of the parents , if it serves the interests of the child . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If an agreement in accordance with LAW on the main domicile of the child or on custodial powers is not reached within a reasonable period after a marriage is dissolved or annulled , or if it is incompatible with the interests of the child , the court must decide which parent shall henceforth have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If both parents have custody under LAW after their marriage has been dissolved or annulled , and if one parent applies for the withdrawal of that custody , the court must decide which parent shall have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail . \u201d", "\u201c The above provisions shall also be applied if the parents of a minor legitimate child live apart , other than on a temporary basis . However , in such a case the court shall decide on custody only upon application by a parent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A recent case concerning similar complaints ( ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) contains the following summary of comparative law :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A survey on comparative law taking into account the national laws of a selection of Member States of ORG shows that basically all Member GPE included in the survey provide for joint parental authority by unmarried parents over their children born out of wedlock . The main elements referred to as a basis for allowing joint parental authority for unmarried parents are the establishment of paternity and the GPE agreement to exercise joint authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the solutions in the Member GPE vary as regards the attribution of joint parental authority for children born out of wedlock in the event no agreement between the parents can be reached in this respect .", "CARDINAL . In only a limited number of countries do the statutory regulations explicitly address this issue . In a few countries , such as GPE , GPE and GPE , the national law stipulates that the exercise of joint parental authority of unmarried parents requires the consent of both parents and thus implies that the non - consenting parent has a right of veto . By contrast , the laws in GPE , GPE and GPE appear to provide for a joint exercise of parental authority even without the GPE consent .", "CARDINAL . In some Member GPE such as GPE and GPE , while the law itself is not clear on the subject , the domestic courts have interpreted the applicable provisions so as to allow joint parental authority only with the consent of the parents , whereas for example ORG has held that the national law has to be interpreted so as to enable the father of a child born out of wedlock to request joint parental authority with the mother even though the latter disagrees . A similar approach seems to be followed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of the few countries where a right of veto of CARDINAL parent is explicitly stipulated in national law , the most common solution put forward by national legislations is that a court decides on the outcome of a corresponding dispute between the parents at the request of CARDINAL of the parents bearing in mind the best interests of the child . All Member GPE emphasise the importance of the child \u2019s best interest in decisions regarding the attribution of custody . In determining the child \u2019s best interest in this connection domestic courts commonly take into consideration the positions of the parents and the child and the particularegards , inter alia , the demonstrable interest in and commitment to the child by the respective parent .", "CARDINAL . In summary , ... , the survey confirms that while different approaches exist in the Member GPE , the majority provide for paternal participation in custody if the parents were not married to each other , either irrespective of the mother \u2019s will or at least by court order following an evaluation of the child \u2019s interests . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
