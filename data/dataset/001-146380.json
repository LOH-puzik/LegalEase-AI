HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lived in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He had a joint title to a plot of land in the value of CARDINAL \u201c gold crowns \u201d ( aranykorona ) . The land was , from an unspecified date on , in the possession of , and used by , a ORG \u201c collective farm \u201d . Following the adoption of Act no . II of DATE on ORG , ORG adopted a plan on the division of such properties . That decision was subsequently upheld by GPE and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a plot of arable land of QUANTITY , situated in the village of GPE , was designated by ORG for the purpose of privatisation , under lot no . CARDINAL . This measure was approved by ORG . On DATE the applicant was granted ownership of the plot by ORG . His title to the land was registered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , he could not enter into possession , because the plot which he had been granted was apparently occupied and being used by the owners of the neighbouring plots .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought a trespass claim before LOC , asserting that his use had been unjustifiably interfered with . Following the dismissal of his request , he sought judicial review of the decision , bringing a civil action before the Budapest II / III ORG against the neighbours , seeking protection of his possession rights .", "CARDINAL . While this case was pending , the respondents initiated the correction of the land register maps . In the \u2018 remapping\u2019 proceedings , ORG observed that plot no . CARDINAL did not exist in reality . On appeal , ORG confirmed this finding , designating a new plot for the applicant , under no . CARDINAL , on DATE . This plot was nonetheless smaller than that originally allocated to the applicant , and was apparently not suitable for farming .", "Quite independently of the present dispute , on DATE a new , digitally compiled land register was put in place by the PERSON authorities , with the apparent intention of eliminating the existing inaccuracies .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s civil action was stayed for the duration of the remapping proceedings . After the adoption of ORG final decision , ORG dismissed the action on DATE , observing that the respondents had not used the applicant \u2019s land unlawfully , as the plot of land registered under plot no . CARDINAL did not exist in reality . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . The appeal proceedings appear to have been subsequently suspended since the applicant sought judicial review of the remapping decision . In the course of these administrative court proceedings , it was confirmed by an expert land surveyor that the applicant had originally been granted a plot which had been registered with topographic and editing errors , and that these had been duly corrected in the remapping proceedings . Therefore , the Pest County Regional Court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE . This was confirmed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since in the remapping proceedings the location of the land belonging to the applicant eventually became indisputable and it turned out that this plot was not possessed by any of the respondents , the applicant withdrew his appeal against the first - instance judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above proceedings , the applicant could finally obtain possession of the land in question DATE after having acquired it , that is , sometime in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an official liability action against the District and GPE . His action was dismissed by the Buda Surroundings High Court on DATE . The court found that the applicant \u2019s damage had been caused by his own conduct since he had initiated a number of futile proceedings before various authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed ; however , the appellate proceedings were suspended on account of his death on DATE , with a view to the successor \u2019s joining the case . It appears that the proceedings are still pending , that is , remain suspended ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
