The court stated that although it was not empowered to quash those steps taken in the investigation which might be null and void , it had to have regard to the irregularities complained of by PERSON and refrain from basing its decision on any irregular proceeding ;", "( c ) the fact that PERSON and PERSON had no access to the files until committed for trial as they were not in custody , and the investigating judge \u2019s absence from the hearings , which was difficult to justify ;", "( d ) the failure of the Prince and Mr Mossoux to appear before the court ; and", "( e ) the lack of credibility of each of the parties to the case .", "CARDINAL .

It did not expressly rule on the applicants\u2019 submissions that the refusal of the investigating judge and the chambre du conseil to arrange a confrontation with the Prince or to examine him at all had breached LAW .", "Nor , in ORG view , were the proceedings vitiated by the breaches of professional confidentiality alleged against the prosecution at first instance on account of the DATE press conference , among other things ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Admittedly , the investigating judge alone had authority to hold a press conference during a judicial investigation , but a breach of professional confidentiality could only entail nullity of proceedings in whole or in part if it had given rise to the judicial investigation or was the only thing which had made it possible to discover the guilty person or prove his guilt . On the other hand , a breach of professional confidentiality by a member of the judiciary or any other person bound by the confidentiality of the investigation in a broad sense could not flaw proceedings in which the evidence had been obtained lawfully ; to decide otherwise would compound the effects of a personal failing on the part of the representative of the ORG by wholly unjustifiable and possibly substantial damage either to law and order or to the victim or victims .", "PERSON and PERSON had relied on CARDINAL other grounds of nullity to impugn the committal order of DATE : the failure to deal with their pleadings and the conduct of the investigating judge , who , they said , had merely made a \" mini - report \" at the first hearing by the chambre du conseil . ORG ruled that on the facts the first complaint was unfounded . It also dismissed the second complaint , as it did not find that there had been any infringement of the rights of the defence or of the principle that judicial proceedings must be adversarial , in view of the fact that the presiding judge of the chambre du conseil had not felt it necessary to recall the investigating judge as he was leaving the room after making his report .", "The applicants had further claimed that ORG could not in law judge their case fairly owing to an incident which had occurred on DATE , following which they had been summoned to appear before the GPE tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance for contempt of court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . ORG held on this point that if this claim were well - founded in law , \" it would be sufficient for any person desirous of evading any judicial proceedings \" , whether civil or criminal , \" to ensure impunity by committing a contempt of court directed at the NORP judiciary in general \" .", "ORG did not explicitly reply to the PERSON application for discovery of the gouache \" Storm over GPE \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

When listing , on appeal , the irregularities noted in the judgment at first instance , the applicants had confined themselves to illustrating their complaint that the court below , having failed to draw all the inferences from the situation they had described , had infringed LAW because it was impossible for ORG to \" separate the investigative measures which could be accepted from those which [ had to ] be ruled inadmissible , as they [ were ] intertwined with one another to the point of forming an incoherent whole \" . In ORG view , ORG had , when closely scrutinising each of the charges , implicitly but definitely decided that the investigation was not incoherent as alleged .", "ORG went on to hold that in the impugned judgment - and it cited the reasons given - ORG had dealt with the argument relating to the confidentiality of the letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "As regards the argument concerning the publicity given to the case by ORG , ORG held that it could not infer any violation of the rights of the defence or of LAW ( article DATE ) of the LAW from the mere fact that the prosecution had allegedly breached professional confidentiality .", "Moreover , in order to assess whether a case had been heard fairly , the trial had to be looked at as a whole ; in view of the fact that PERSON and PERSON had had the opportunity during the proceedings before the trial courts to challenge freely the evidence adduced against them by the prosecution , they could not claim to be victims of an infringement of the rights of the defence or of their right to a fair trial within the meaning of the LAW .", "As to the pleas based on the failure to give reasons for the convictions on counts ACARDINAL , CARDINAL and CCARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG rejected them as lacking any legitimate interest : the sentence passed on PERSON was justified by the other charges which had been proved against him . Nor did the court find any infringement of PERSON defence rights in regard to count ACARDINAL .", "Lastly , ORG held that the appeal on points of law which ORG had also lodged as a civil party ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) was inadmissible , as Mr Bricmont had apparently not had notice of it served on the Prince as the party being directly cited .", "CARDINAL .
