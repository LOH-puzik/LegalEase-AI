On DATE the case was considered by ORG as lapsed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals concerning the value - added tax imposed in respect of DATE . It appears that no appeal was made against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant , inter alia , for aggravated dishonesty by a debtor ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 velallisen ep\u00e4rehellisyys , grovt oredlighet som g\u00e4lden\u00e4r ) , false accounting ( kirjanpitorikos , bokf\u00f6ringsbrott ) and aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) concerning DATE . According to the charges , the applicant was accused of aggravated dishonesty by a debtor as , DATE , he had transferred income to his wife to the detriment of his creditors . He was accused of false accounting DATE as he had failed to make entries into the accounts . He was accused of aggravated tax fraud DATE as he had failed to declare income and consequently , inter alia , the income tax and value - added tax imposed on him had been too low . The tax authorities joined the charges and presented a compensation claim totalling approximately the amount of avoided taxes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE - GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of aggravated dishonesty by a debtor , false accounting and of aggravated tax fraud , and imposed a prison sentence of DATE and DATE .

The court found that the mere fact that the same issues had been assessed in the administrative proceedings did not necessarily prevent the examination of the charges pressed . After having compared the charges of aggravated tax fraud to the facts on the basis of which the tax surcharges had been imposed , by the type of tax imposed and DATE concerned , the court found that the facts on which these charges were based were substantially different from those on which the tax surcharges had been based . There was thus no impediment to examining the charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .

On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal except in respect of the charges concerning aggravated tax fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the charge of aggravated tax fraud without examining the merits as far as the charge concerned income tax from DATE and value - added tax from DATE , and withheld the relevant taxes . The applicant was convicted for the remaining part of the charge of aggravated tax fraud and sentenced , together with the earlier convictions , to imprisonment for DATE and DATE . The court found that , when considering the ne bis in idem prohibition , the similarity of the facts should be examined by the type of tax imposed and separately for DATE . As concerned DATE , there was no impediment to examining the charge as the tax inspection did not concern DATE . However , concerning DATE , the charge could not be examined , except in respect of value - added tax , as the same matter had already been subject to an assessment by the tax authorities . In respect of DATE the charge could not be examined at all . The same applied for DATE and DATE . The taxation decisions had all become final before the charge of aggravated tax fraud , which concerned the same matter , was pressed . Therefore , the charge could only be examined in respect of DATE and in respect of the valueadded tax imposed during DATE . This judgment has been published under number PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

ORG has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its precedent case ORG which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud . In that case it found , inter alia , that even though a final judgment in a taxation case , in which tax surcharges had been imposed , prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter , such preventive effect could not be applied to pending cases ( lis pendens ) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa . However , in DATE ORG reversed its line of interpretation , finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter ( PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) entered into force on DATE . According to the LAW , the tax authorities can , when making a tax decision , assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police . The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge . If they have not reported the matter to the police , a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision . If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges , they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless , after imposing the tax surcharges , they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts . If the tax authorities have reported the matter to the police tax surcharges can , as a rule , no longer be imposed . The purpose of the LAW is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in CARDINAL set of proceedings . The LAW does not , however , contain any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
