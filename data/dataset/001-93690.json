The applicants were born in born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The parties do not fully agree about the facts of the case , which may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lived with a group of friends , including the first applicant , mostly students , in an old and decrepit house they had rented in ORG . They occasionally invited their friends to spend TIME or a couple of days in their house .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE there was a group of students sleeping in the house . At TIME they were awakened by QUANTITY police officers patrolling the area . The police enquired whether the inhabitants knew the owner of an unlocked car parked in front of the house .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and CARDINAL of their friends , PERSON , started a polite discussion with the police officers about the car . It was confirmed that CARDINAL of the residents of their apartment was the owner of the car . However , the police announced their intention of towing the car away to the police car park . The applicants argued that it was not forbidden or illegal to keep the car unlocked . At the police \u2019s request , they produced their identity cards and the registration card of the car , whose owner was asleep in the house .", "CARDINAL . The police were not satisfied with their explanation and the dispute became more intense . In reaction to the opinions expressed about the intervention , in particular by GPE , the policemen used truncheons . They hit GPE several times and handcuffed him . The applicants tried to argue with the policemen , to no avail . The police called other police officers and shortly afterwards CARDINAL other policemen arrived . They hit the first applicant with their truncheons several times and the second applicant once . Thereupon PERSON was taken to the police car where he was beaten . The applicants were ordered to stand against a fence . They were pushed and jostled and the policemen insulted them referring to them as \u201c scum \u201d , \u201c slobs \u201d , \u201c queers \u201d ( ho\u0142ota , brudasy , peda\u0142y ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , a group of policemen , armed with truncheons and guarded by police dogs , entered the house , woke up the other occupants and ordered them to stand against the wall . Then the police searched the house . No information was provided about the grounds , purpose or legal basis for the search . During this time the police showered abuse on the students . They pushed and shoved them . This lasted for TIME . Afterwards , the police left the house and warned the students that some of them were in an illegal situation as they were not registered as inhabitants of the house , and threatened that they would be in trouble if they submitted a complaint about the events .", "CARDINAL . The police left , taking PERSON with them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested to be examined by a forensic medicine specialist . It was established that the first applicant had CARDINAL long bruises on his left arm , and other bruises on the palm of his hand . The second applicant had a blue mark on her bottom ( CARDINAL by QUANTITY ) . It was stated that these bruises could have been caused by the use of police truncheons .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant and her friend PERSON lived in the house with the owner \u2019s permission . They often received young visitors from all over the country . On TIME in question the unlocked car parked in front of the house had seemed very suspicious to the policemen PERSON and PERSON , who thought it was stolen and considered that it should be towed away . They had knocked at the window and the second applicant informed them that the owner was in the house . She first objected to the police action at TIME , and then went to look for the owner of the car among the CARDINAL young people who were sleeping in the house . The applicants behaved aggressively , loudly expressing opinions about the purpose and nature of the intervention . PERSON raised his voice to the police and pushed PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP The police action was a result of the fact that the applicants did not comply with the police requests to provide necessary information . The applicants talked to the police with raised voices and took a very active part in the struggle with the policemen .", "CARDINAL . The police officer had misinterpreted the first applicant \u2019s intentions when he handed him his documents and had hit him to prevent his being attacked . The applicant was most probably hit once .", "CARDINAL . The atmosphere was tense . The owner of the car gave the police the keys and documents to the car . As PERSON was unruly and continued to express objections , the policemen decided to arrest him . While he was being taken into custody by the police , he hit CARDINAL of them in the face . Thereupon truncheons were used against him . Given the attitude of PERSON and of other persons present , the police called for assistance . CARDINAL other police patrols and an emergency team arrived . As the applicants were interfering with the arrest of PERSON , they were hit with truncheons .", "CARDINAL . Police officers PERSON and PERSON then entered the house to check the identity of the persons present . After that , the intervention was terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested ORG to institute criminal proceedings against the police for abuse of authority . On DATE the prosecutor refused to do so . He found that no criminal offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor considered that the police action had been justified . The police could have reasonably suspected that the unlocked car had been stolen , even though it had not been reported as such . The further developments had certainly come as a surprise to both the police and other persons involved in the incident . The second applicant had objected in a pretentious tone ( \u201c pretensjonalny ton g\u0142osu \u201d ) to having been woken up and to the check on the car taking place at TIME . She had been informed that the car would be towed away if the owner was not found . She could not locate the owner of the car , as there were many people in the house who did not know each other . The second applicant had woken all of them up in an attempt to find the owner .", "CARDINAL . D. S. had objected in a loud voice to the police intervention . He had insisted that the intention of the police was to harass the persons in the house . As he had not obeyed the police requests to calm down and the verbal exchange between him and the police officer PERSON had become increasingly heated , it had been decided that he should be taken to the police car . The prosecutor considered that this had been justified in the light of PERSON aggressive behaviour . Given that PERSON had been behaving aggressively , direct force had been used against him , including the use of truncheons and handcuffs . It was true that the applicants\u2019 versions of the facts diverged , and these divergences could not be clarified on the basis of evidence from other witnesses , but it was clear that , in the face of his resistance , it had been necessary to use such force in order to take GPE to the car .", "CARDINAL . Given the applicants\u2019 behaviour , the police had had to call assistance . They had also felt threatened by the presence of other persons at the scene of the incident . The applicants had been hit as they had ignored the order to let PERSON go so that he could be taken to the car . In the darkness , the police had not noticed that the first applicant had in fact had his documents in his hand in order to show them to the police , and they had thought that he intended to hit them .", "CARDINAL . It was finally noted that the accounts of the facts given by the persons present at the scene , other than the police , were highly divergent , making it impossible to establish the facts of the case . However , the testimony given by the policemen was coherent . Therefore , the submissions of the other persons could not be considered credible and had to be assessed critically .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor concluded that the measures taken by the police had been proportionate to the situation .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed . He argued that the police brutality and aggression had been totally unjustified . Nothing in the behaviour of the persons present had justified the use of force . The police had entered private property and effected a search of the house without any sound reasons , hitting and insulting the persons sleeping in the house . He argued that he was a law - abiding citizen , a student of CARDINAL university faculties and a member of ORG of his town . He had not given any reason to be beaten , verbally insulted and humiliated just at the whim of the police . The police should not intervene in private property at TIME and hit , insult and humiliate people just because they looked , or lived , differently . The facts as established by the prosecutor did not correspond to what had happened . All the facts had been established on the basis of the arguments of the police , who had apparently been instructed by police lawyers as to what they should say . During the questioning the prosecutor had made unpleasant remarks about the hairstyles , clothes and views of the young inhabitants of the house , which had influenced her decision to discontinue the proceedings . He submitted that the police had humiliated both himself and the others .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant submitted that the assessment of the evidence had been biased and that the police had clearly abused their authority , insulting and humiliating her and other participants in the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision . He considered that the intervention of the police had been justified in so far as they wanted to verify the identity of the owner of the car . PERSON had behaved aggressively , both verbally and physically . Regardless of whether he had intended to hit PERSON in the face or not , his behaviour could have been perceived as an intentional assault . It was for that reason that a decision to arrest him had been taken . The identity check of the persons present in the house had been necessary as they had insulted the policemen .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social status of the young people , namely the fact that they were students , imposed certain obligations on them , in particular an obligation to cooperate with the police in the interest of law and order .", "CARDINAL . The findings of the inquiry had not established that the students had been insulted verbally by the police , as the policemen consistently denied this . Nothing had been found to support the first applicant \u2019s submission that the testimony of the policemen had been suggested to them by the police lawyers .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor concluded that the contested decision had to be upheld .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provisions on the search of LOC by the police :", "CARDINAL .
