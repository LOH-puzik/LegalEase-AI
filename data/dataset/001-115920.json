NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were elected as members of ORG for a DATE period from DATE . The mayor prevented them from carrying out their functions and stopped paying remuneration to them for the period from DATE to DATE . The applicants and another individual sued the municipality for unpaid remuneration totalling the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As the municipality paid ORG CARDINAL to them , the claimants decided to withdraw their claim in respect of that sum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted in part the applicants\u2019 claims for remuneration , to which they considered themselves entitled as members of the municipal council . The sums awarded to the applicants ranged between ORG CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL , plus default interest amounting to PERCENT per year as from DATE in respect of CARDINAL of the sum awarded to each applicant , and PERCENT per year as from DATE in respect of the remainder . ORG discontinued the proceedings , at the PERSON request , in respect of the sum the municipality had already paid .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed . CARDINAL applicant claimed an additional ORG CARDINAL and QUANTITY other applicants the equivalent of FAC each . The applicants also challenged the first - instance court \u2019s decision on costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the first - instance judgment by dismissing the PERSON claims . It held that ORG had erred in interpreting the law . During the relevant period the applicants had not carried out their functions as members of the municipal council . They were not , therefore , entitled to remuneration for such activities , irrespective of why the situation had arisen . The judgment stated that the applicants were employed or retired . Their posts as municipal councillors related to public functions which could not be regarded as employment . Any remuneration would be due to the applicants only if they had carried out those functions . The decision to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the sum which the defendant had paid remained unaffected .", "CARDINAL . ORG further amended the first - instance court \u2019s judgment by ordering the defendant to pay the applicants\u2019 legal costs in respect of the ORG proceedings . It also ordered each of the claimants to pay the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL in respect of costs advanced by the ORG . ORG judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In their complaint the applicants mentioned that they had lodged an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint . The decision stated that the applicants had at their disposal a remedy before the ordinary courts , namely an appeal on points of law under LAW . The court dealing with such an appeal had jurisdiction to review all the factual and legal aspects of the case . In those circumstances , it was not for ORG to hear the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal on points of law as inadmissible . It established that the highest sums claimed by the individual applicants amounted to the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL . They were thus smaller than CARDINAL times the statutory minimum wage ( which , at the relevant time , was the equivalent of LAW ) . In such cases , an appeal on points of law was excluded pursuant to LAW . ORG decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a second constitutional complaint , directed against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . They alleged a breach of their right to a fair hearing in that ORG had committed errors of law . With reference to ORG decision , they argued that an appeal on points of law had been excluded in their case . The obstacle which resulted in ORG rejecting their first complaint had thus been overcome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the second complaint as having been lodged outside the statutory time - limit of DATE .

The decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL allows for an appeal on points of law against a judgment in which the appellate court has amended the first - instance court \u2019s judgment on its merits .

ORG , II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , and GPE . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that , where a claimant lodged an appeal on points of law and , at the same time , a constitutional complaint , the latter remedy was considered admissible only after the determination of the former . Similarly , in decisions no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG expressed the view that , in cases where ORG rejected an appeal on points of law as being inadmissible , the statutory time - limit for lodging a constitutional complaint would also be considered to have been complied with in respect of the preceding final decision of the regional court concerned .
