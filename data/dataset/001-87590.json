ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c The ORG did not adopt the opinion that all injustices would be redressed , but only some injustices , and to the extent and under the conditions stipulated by law .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] does not intend to provide redress for the consequences of all injustices , but to mitigate the consequences of only some injustices , not all of them . From that it follows that injustices other that those included in the LAW can not be rehabilitated , nor can they be rehabilitated in any way other than specified in the LAW ; ... From these statutory provisions [ section DATE ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) second sentence of Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] it can be deduced that if the legislator wanted to compensate also for the cases of confiscation for which compensation was to be provided , but had not been paid , it would have stipulated this explicitly in section DATE ) of the LAW , or within this LAW in another provision it would have extended the opportunity to mitigate the consequences of property and other injustices to include also the cases of confiscation for which compensation had not been provided , although it should have been . The legislator , however , did not do that . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held , in particular :", "\u201c When formulating particular reasons for restitution , the legislator 's will have to be respected . If in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) second line of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act , the restitution ground is formulated as following : ' When an entitled person was deprived of his or her property rights under nationalisation laws adopted DATE without appropriate compensation , the entitled person has a claim under this LAW , which he or she can raise under the particular legislation ' , regardless of the fact that the nationalisation took place ex lege [ ; ] the right to compensation must be applied and not eliminated . It is clear that in case of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) second line of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act , the restitution ground is based on an act infringing generally recognised human rights [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act ] , not because of the act of nationalisation , but due to the failure to provide compensation which is the element of irregularity which constitutes an infringement of generally recognised human rights as provided for in LAW .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) second line of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act provides for a specific restitution ground not only because it is exercisable under the particular law which is LAW , but also because of the fact that the legislator 's will to redress those injustices which occurred in consequence of the nationalisation without compensation as required by section CARDINAL et seq . of Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL has to be respected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In this judgment ORG expressed its opinion on the constitutionality of the specification of the decisive period in LAW .

PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , where it further held :", "\u201c [ I]t is the ORG 's sovereign decision whether it allows restitution and to what extent property injustices are to be redressed . In ORG opinion , specifying the decisive period , and particularly its start date , as DATE , is based on rational and objective reasons , since the legislator was compelled to specify clearly a time threshold beyond which it is fundamentally impossible to go without the danger of causing compensations to build up to the time of the pre - GPE republic or even further into the past . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further noted that in dealing with the issue of what method the NORP State would choose to redress property and other injustices that had occurred in the previous period in consequence of non - democratic acts of the previous regime , it chose a method based on the principle of at least a partial mitigation of injustices caused . The court held the following as regards the chosen concept :", "\u201c [ F]rom many concepts the legislator has chosen , in the restitution regulations , the one that does not explicitly repeal the legal regulations on the basis of which the ownership was lost , but that [ instead ] presumes , to the contrary , that in separate proceedings it should be ascertained whether all requirements stipulated by the legislator in special restitution regulation for redressing property injustice are met . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a constitutional appeal against ORG failure to act upon a request to proceed under LAW . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c At present , ORG is not authorised to act under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In ORG view that decree has already accomplished its purpose , since DATE it represents a closed group of problems and issues closely related to wartime events and the country 's economic recovery after the Second World War . For DATE it has not created any further legal relationships and it no longer has any constitutive character . Therefore , at present the respondent ORG is evidently not authorised to act pursuant to this Decree and thus it also can not decide on compensation for nationalised property under LAW seq . , regardless of the absence of an implementing regulation within the meaning of LAW , subsection CARDINAL of the Decree . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG expressed its opinion on the concept of the restitution laws and the time - limits for the restitution claims , stating in particular :", "\u201c The restitution laws enacted after DATE enshrine the legislator 's will to redress injustices that occurred DATE , that is . in the period defined in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL as the period of lack of freedom , in the period of a totalitarian system , and not any other injustices . The ORG 's will is clearly defined in the restitution laws themselves and redress is permissible only in the factual and time scope defined by these laws . ...", "Should the time - limits set for the restitution claims be challenged , there would be no certainty or limit , be it factual or , and above all , time - limit , that would prevent former owners of property or their descendants from claiming property they had lost at any time in the past , even a very long time ago . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its opinion of CARDINAL DATE ORG plenary session stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ( ... ) in its preamble LAW , which is the fundamental restitution law , explicitly excluded from restitution property which had passed to the ORG prior to the decisive date . Therefore , it is not true that the LAW does not deal with property other than property that passed to the ORG during the relevant period , but in fact it concerns all property that the ORG owned on DATE of the entry into force of the LAW ( DATE ) , and which it had acquired in the period prior to DATE . By excluding ... any redress for property injustices ' caused in periods even deeper in the past , including the injustices caused to citizens of NORP and NORP origin , the LAW provided that the ORG owned this property and that claims to it relying on the general laws could not be raised . ...", "Although ORG established a tendency towards redressing injustices to the widest extent possible , it was always within the regulations passed with a view to mitigating the injustices which occurred DATE , ... and not other injustices . The ORG 's will is clearly defined by the restitution laws themselves and redress is permissible only to the factual and time extent defined by these laws . ...", "To the question of whether it is possible to seek protection of an ownership right that ceased to exist prior to DATE applying the general civil law rather than by using the methods stipulated by the restitution regulations ... , ORG replies in the negative . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held , in particular :", "\u201c The restitution laws provided redress for nationalisation of property \u2013 in the relevant period \u2013 carried out in conformity with the then valid law but without compensation . It was section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act which , in regard of industrial enterprises , created a class of restitution beneficiaries whose claims were linked to privatisation settlement under LAW of LAW [ Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] . Undoubtedly , the aim of this legislation was to distinguish , from the massive group of the then owners of nationalised enterprises , natural persons who would be empowered for redress of property injustices suffered .", "However , no further extension of the claims of the owners of the nationalised enterprises was planned . [ T]he extensive interpretation used by the plaintiff also lacks constitutional conformity ( see the finding of the Plenary of ORG , no . PERSON . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Still less could approximately assessed compensation , as calculated of course without foundation , by the plaintiff , be accepted . In other words , [ granting ] such a claim for compensation would in general terms lead to a blanket compensation of natural persons for property nationalised under decrees adopted in DATE , those persons being entitled to calculate arbitrary amounts to be paid . Such a procedure can not be permitted , as it contravenes not only ordinary law but is also unconstitutional ( see finding of ORG DATE , ORG no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c It is necessary to proceed in compliance with the principle of a broader application of fundamental rights and freedoms and to adopt an interpretation which observes the sense and substance of fundamental rights ... Any application or interpretation to the contrary would constitute a breach of LAW , under which the substance and sense of fundamental rights and freedoms must be observed in the course of the application of the provision specifying the restrictions imposed on them . Such restrictions may not be misused to serve any other purpose but those for which they were specified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decided in this landmark ruling in favour of an action challenging inactivity on the part of ORG , which had failed to pursue administrative proceedings upon the introduction of a request for compensation under the Decree .
