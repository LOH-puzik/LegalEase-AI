NORP The applicant , PERSON , was an NORP national , born in DATE . The President granted the applicants\u2019 requests for his identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr H. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of sexual acts with persons under the age of DATE ( LAW ) and with persons under the age of QUANTITY not mature enough to understand the act , taking advantage of this immaturity ( Article CARDINALb of LAW ) , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . His criminal record , which at the time consisted of CARDINAL convictions , of which CARDINAL concerned sexual offences involving adolescents , was treated as an aggravating circumstance . These previous convictions were as follows :", "- In DATE the applicant was convicted in a NORP court of indecent acts with adolescents ( unz\u00fcchtige ORG ) , for which he was sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and fined .", "- On DATE the Innsbruck ORG convicted him of homosexual acts with consenting male persons DATE ( LAW , as in force at the time ) and sentenced him to QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG reduced the sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "- In DATE the applicant was convicted in ORG of attempted fornication with persons under the age of DATE ( LAW ) and fined .", "- In DATE the applicant was convicted in the same court of an offence under the same provision , namely fornication with persons under the age of CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG partly acquitted him and reduced the sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "- On DATE ORG convicted him of an offence under the same provision and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a plea of nullity lodged by the applicant and on DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by him against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant asked for early release from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It noted that under LAW a court may grant early release if a prisoner has served CARDINAL of his sentence , unless there were specific reasons to expect that this person would commit criminal offences while at liberty . ORG considered that the applicant had not shown that he had seen sense and was still playing down the offences committed by him . Moreover , his numerous previous convictions for sexual offences involving minors ( PERSON ) had not succeeded in getting him to conform to standards of law - abiding behaviour ( normangepasstes ORG ) . For that reason he had to serve his entire prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision refusing his early release . He submitted that ORG reliance on his previous convictions under LAW constituted a breach of LAW read in conjunction with LAW , because LAW had been quashed by ORG on DATE as being unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , holding that ORG had acted correctly in taking also the applicant \u2019s LAW convictions into account , even though the provision was constitutionally problematic . Having examined the files concerning the criminal proceedings against the applicant under that provision , it was apparent from the circumstances of the criminal acts , as well as the age and personality of the victims , that a conviction of the applicant would have also been justified under the legal provisions brought in to replace LAW , which were constitutionally compliant . In view of these considerations , and also taking into account the applicant \u2019s other convictions , ORG had been correct in concluding that the conditions for the applicant \u2019s release under LAW of LAW were not fulfilled because of the applicant \u2019s incorrigible personality , as he resisted all measures of social reintegration , played down his acts and showed no remorse .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant served the full sentence . He died on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
