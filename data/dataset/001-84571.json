The officer also wondered about the presence of PERSON in the applicant 's life , noting that they refused to regard themselves as a couple and that PERSON had not at any time been involved in the plan to adopt .

On DATE the psychologist from the children 's welfare service , who was a member of the adoption board , recommended that authorisation be refused on the ground that placing a child with the applicant would expose the child to a certain number of risks relating to the construction of his or her personality . He referred among other things to the fact that the applicant lived with a girlfriend but did not consider herself to be in a couple , which gave rise to an unclear or even an unspoken situation involving ambiguity and a risk that the child would have only a maternal role model . The psychologist went on to make the following comments:-", "\u201c ...", "It is as though the reasons for wanting a child derived from a complicated personal background that has not been resolved with regard to the role as child - parent that [ the applicant ] appears to have had to play ( vis - \u00e0 - vis one of her sisters , protection of her parents ) , and were based on emotional difficulties . Has this given rise to a feeling of worthlessness or uselessness that she is trying to overcome by becoming a mother ?", "Unusual attitude towards men in that men are rejected .", "In the extreme , how can rejection of the male figure not amount to rejection of the child 's own image ?

On DATE the ORG 's representative from ORG , present on behalf of the union of family associations for the d\u00e9partement ( ORG ) , referring to ORG , recommended that authorisation be refused on the ground of the lack of a paternal referent and added :", "\u201c ...

The psychologists ' and welfare reports show her clear lack of interest in Ms [ B. ] 's plan ...", "In the further alternative , the material conditions for providing a child with a suitable home are not met . It will be necessary to move house , solve the issue of how to divide expenses between both partners , whose plans differ at least in this respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant asked the president of the council for the d\u00e9partement to reconsider the decision refusing her authorisation to adopt .", "CARDINAL . The children 's welfare service asked a clinical psychologist to prepare a psychological assessment . In her report of DATE , drawn up after an interview with the applicant , the psychologist concluded that \u201c PERSON ha[d ] plenty to offer in providing a home for a child ( patience - values - creativity - time ) \u201d , but considered that adoption was premature having regard to a number of problematic points ( confusion between a non - directive and laissez - faire attitude , and ignorance of the effects of the introduction of a third person into the home set - up ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant applied to ORG seeking to have the administrative decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE set aside .

The reasons cited are not in themselves capable of justifying a refusal to grant authorisation to adopt . The documents in the case file show that PERSON , who has undisputed personal qualities and an aptitude for bringing up children , and who is a nursery school teacher by profession and well integrated into her social environment , does offer sufficient guarantees DATE from a family , child - rearing and psychological perspective \u2013 that she would provide an adopted child with a suitable home . ... PERSON is justified , in the circumstances of this case , in seeking to have the decisions refusing her authorisation set aside ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The d\u00e9partement of the LOC appealed .

It found , first , that \u201c B. maintain[ed ] that she ha[d ] not been sent a personality test , but [ did ] not allege that she [ had ] asked for the document and that her request [ had been ] refused \u201d and that the CARDINALth paragraph of LAW \u201c [ did ] not have the effect of precluding a report from being drawn up on the basis of a summary of the main points of other documents . Hence , the fact that a psychologist [ had drawn ] up a report just on the basis of information obtained by other people working on the case and without hearing submissions from the applicant [ did ] not invalidate the screening process carried out in respect of PERSON application for authorisation to adopt ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court went on to find that", "\u201c ... the reasons for the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , which were taken following an application for reconsideration of the decision of the president of the council for the d\u00e9partement of the LOC rejecting the application for authorisation to adopt submitted by PERSON , are the absence of \u201c identificational markers \u201d due to the lack of a paternal role model or referent and the ambivalence of the commitment of each member of the household to the adoptive child . It can be seen from the documents in the file , and particularly the evidence gathered during the examination of PERSON application , that having regard to the latter 's lifestyle and despite her undoubted personal qualities and aptitude for bringing up children , she did not provide the requisite safeguards DATE from a family , child - rearing and psychological perspective \u2013 for adopting a child ... ;", "... contrary to PERSON contentions , the president of the council for the d\u00e9partement did not refuse her authorisation on the basis of a position of principle regarding her choice of lifestyle . Accordingly , and in any event , the applicant is not justified in alleging a breach ... of the requirements of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . On DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed her appeal in a judgment giving the following reasons :", "\u201c ... Regarding the grounds for refusing PERSON authorisation :", "...", "Firstly , the fact that a request for authorisation to adopt a child is submitted by a single person , as is permitted by LAW , does not prevent the administrative authority from ascertaining , in terms of child - rearing and psychological factors that foster the development of the child 's personality , whether the prospective adoptive parent can offer \u2013 in her circle of family and friends \u2013 a paternal \u201c role model or referent \u201d where the application is submitted by a woman ... ; nor , where a single person seeking to adopt is in a stable relationship with another person , who will inevitably be required to contribute to providing the child with a suitable home for the purposes of the above - mentioned provisions , does this fact prevent the authority from determining \u2013 even if the relationship in question is not a legally binding DATE whether the conduct or personality of the third person , considered on the basis of objective considerations , is conducive to providing a suitable home . Accordingly , ORG did not err in law in considering that the CARDINAL grounds on which the application by Ms [ B. ] for authorisation as a single person was refused DATE namely , the \u201c absence of identificational markers due to the lack of a paternal role model or referent \u201d and \u201c the ambivalence of the commitment of each member of the household to the adoptive child \u201d \u2013 were capable of justifying , under the above - mentioned provisions of the decree of CARDINAL DATE , the refusal to grant authorisation ;", "Secondly , with regard to Ms [ B. ] 's assertion that , in referring to her \u201c lifestyle \u201d to justify the refusal to grant her authorisation to adopt , ORG had implicitly referred to her sexual orientation , it can be seen from the documents submitted to the tribunals of fact that Ms [ B. ] was , at the time of the examination of her application , in a stable homosexual relationship . As that relationship had to be taken into consideration in the needs and interests of an adopted child , the court neither based its decision on a position of principle in view of the applicant 's sexual orientation nor breached the combined requirements of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ; nor did it breach the provisions of LAW prohibiting sexual discrimination ;", "Thirdly , in considering that Ms [ B. ] , \u201c having regard to her lifestyle and despite her undoubted personal qualities and aptitude for bringing up children , did not provide the requisite safeguards \u2013 from a family , child - rearing and psychological perspective \u2013 for adopting a child \u201d , ORG , which did not disregard the elements favourable to the applicant in the file submitted to it , did not distort the contents of the file ;", "It follows from the foregoing that Ms [ B. ] is not justified in seeking to have set aside the above - mentioned judgment , which contains adequate reasons ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
