The turnout exceeded expectations , but there is no consensus as to the exact numbers . The official estimate was that there were CARDINAL participants , whereas the organisers considered that there had been CARDINAL . The media reported different numbers , some significantly exceeding the above estimates .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the march approached FAC . The leaders found that the layout of the meeting and the placement of the police cordon did not correspond to what they had anticipated . Unlike on DATE , the park at FAC was excluded from the meeting venue , which was limited to GPE embankment . The cordon of riot police in full protection gear barred access to the park and continued along the whole perimeter of the meeting area , channelling the demonstration to GPE embankment . Further down the embankment there was a row of metal detectors at the entrance to the meeting venue . By that time the stage had been erected at the far end of GPE embankment and a considerable number of people had already accumulated in front of it .", "CARDINAL . Faced with the police cordon and unable to access the park , the leaders of the march \u2013 Mr PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON DATE stopped and demanded that the police open access to the park . According to the protesters , they were taken aback by the alteration of the expected layout and were unwilling to turn towards GPE embankment ; they therefore demanded that the police officers at the cordon move the cordon back to allow sufficient space for the protesters to pass and to assemble for the meeting . According to the official version , the protesters were not interested in proceeding to the meeting venue ; they stopped because they had either intended to break the cordon in order to proceed towards PERSON bridge and then to the ORG , or to stir up the crowd to incite disorder . It is common ground that the cordon officers did not enter into any discussion with the protest leaders and no senior officer was delegated to negotiate . After TIME of attempting to engage with the cordon officers , at TIME the CARDINAL leaders announced that they were going on a \u201c sit - down strike \u201d and sat on the ground . The people behind them stopped , although some people continued to go past them towards the stage . The leaders of the sit - in called on other demonstrators to follow their example and sit down , but only a few of their entourage did so ( TIME and QUANTITY people in total ) .", "CARDINAL . Between TIME and TIME CARDINAL State Duma deputies , Mr PERSON and PERSON , contacted unidentified senior police officers to negotiate the enlargement of the restricted area by moving the police cordon behind the park along the lines expected by the organisers . At the same time PERSON , the Ombudsman of GPE , at the request of Police Colonel PERSON , attempted to convince the leaders of the sit - in to resume the procession and to head towards the meeting venue at GPE embankment , where the stage had been set up . During that time no senior police officers or municipal officials came to the site of the sit - down protest , and there was no direct communication between the authorities and the leaders of the sit - in .", "CARDINAL . At TIME of the meeting participants announced from the stage that the leaders were calling on the demonstrators to support their protest . Some people waiting in front of the stage headed back to PERSON bridge , either to support the sit - down protest or to leave the meeting .

At TIME the media reported that the police authorities were regarding the strike as a provocation of mass disorder and were considering prosecuting those responsible for it .", "CARDINAL . At the same time a commotion arose near the police cordon at the place vacated by the sit - down protest , and the police cordon was broken in several places . A crowd of CARDINAL people spilled over to the empty space beyond the cordon . Within TIME the police restored the cordon , which was reinforced by an additional riot police force . Those who found themselves outside the cordon wandered around , uncertain what to do next . Several people were apprehended , others were pushed back inside the cordon , and some continued to loiter outside or walked towards the park . The police cordon began to push the crowd into the restricted area and advanced by QUANTITY , pressing it inwards .", "CARDINAL . At TIME PERSON to make an announcement from the stage that the meeting was closed . She did so , but apparently her message was not heard by most of the demonstrators or the media reporters broadcasting from the spot . The live television footage provided by the parties contained no mention of her announcement .", "CARDINAL . At the same time a Molotov cocktail was launched from the crowd at the corner of ORG bridge over the restored police cordon . It landed outside the cordon and the trousers of a passer - by caught fire . The fire was promptly extinguished by the police .", "CARDINAL . At TIME at the same corner of PERSON bridge the riot police began breaking into the demonstration to split the crowd . Running in tight formations , they pushed the crowd apart , arrested some people , confronted others and formed new cordons to isolate sections of the crowd . Some protesters held up metal barriers and aligned them so as to resist the police , threw various objects at the police , shouted and chanted \u201c Shame ! \u201d and other slogans , and whenever the police apprehended anyone from among the protesters they attempted to pull them back . The police applied combat techniques and used truncheons .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr Udaltsov climbed onto the stage at the opposite end of the square to address the meeting . At that time many people were assembled in front of the stage , but , as it turned out , the sound equipment had been disconnected . Mr PERSON took a loudspeaker and shouted :", "\u201c Dear friends ! Unfortunately we have no proper sound , but we will carry on our action , we are not going away because our comrades have been arrested , because DATE is the coronation of an illegitimate president . We shall begin an indefinite protest action . You agree ? We shall not leave until our comrades are released , until the inauguration is cancelled and until we are given airtime on the central television channels . You agree ? We are power here !

At this point , at TIME , several police officers arrested PERSON ORG and took him away . Mr PERSON attempted to go up onto the stage , but he was also arrested at the stairs and taken away . As he was pushed out by the police officers he turned to the crowd shouting \u201c Nobody shall leave ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . At TIME the police arrested Mr PERSON , who had also attempted to address people from the stage .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , at ORG bridge the police continued dividing the crowd and began pushing some sections away from the venue .

The police finally allowed the truck with the stage equipment onto FAC at TIME , TIME before the march was due to begin . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the circumstances in which the assembly was dispersed , ORG report stated as follows :", "\u201c As the march approached FAC , [ the ] demonstrators found that a police cordon was blocking off most of the square , leaving only a narrow stretch along the waterfront for the rally . The police established a triple cordon of officers on PERSON bridge , which prevented any movement in the direction of the FAC . The first cordon was positioned close to the junction of ORG and the GPE waterfront . Students from ORG and officers of ORG ( without any protective equipment ) made up this line . Behind them were CARDINAL rows of PERSON [ riot police \u2013 OMO\u041d ] , a line of voluntary citizen patrol ( druzhinniki ) , and another cordon of the PERSON [ the riot police ] . A number of water cannons were visible between the second and third cordons .", "[ The report contained CARDINAL photographs comparing the police cordon on DATE , a thin line of police officers without protection gear , and the CARDINAL on CARDINAL DATE , multiple ranks of riot police with full protection gear backed up by heavy vehicles . ]", "The police cordons , which blocked off movement in the direction of the ORG , created a bottleneck that slowed the march \u2019s progress to such an extent that it came to a virtual stop as demonstrators attempted to cross the bridge . Moreover , just beyond GPE bridge , the marchers had to go through a second set of metal detectors , where progress was very slow since there were CARDINAL detectors .", "By TIME , the majority of the march was immobile . A number of leaders , including PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , encouraged demonstrators to sit down on the road in front of the \u2018 Udarnik\u2019 cinema facing the police cordon to protest [ against ] the inability of the march to continue and to demand that they be given access to the originally allocated space for the rally on FAC . An estimated CARDINAL people joined the sit - down protest . The leaders stressed the need to maintain a peaceful protest and appealed to demonstrators to remain calm . Participants chanted : \u2018 We will not go GPE and \u2018 Police together with the people\u2019 . The leaders attempted to address the crowds using loudspeakers , but those behind the sit - down protest could not hear or see events as they transpired . The sit - down protest did not completely block the road , but it did restrict the movement of those approaching the police lines and the bottleneck caused by the police cordon . As a result , the crowd grew denser as more demonstrators arrived from FAC .", "At TIME , the chief of the [ ORG of the Interior ] issued a statement : \u2018 The organizers of the rally and other participants refuse to proceed to the agreed place of the rally ( to FAC ) . They [ have ] stopped on the roadway near the \u2018 Udarnik\u2019 theatre . Some of them [ have ] sat on the ground and thus blocked the movement of the column . Despite repeated warnings on the part of the police to proceed to the place of the rally , they wo n\u2019t move thereby creating a real threat of a jam and trauma for the participants . An inquiry commission is working on the spot to document their actions related to appeals to commit mass public disorder with a view to further consider the issue of instituting criminal proceedings.\u2019", "Some demonstrators appeared to become frustrated with standing and waiting and began to walk away . Some tried to pass through the police cordon to leave the area , but the police refused to let them through . Instead , they were directed to go back through the crowd to ORG , even though this was practically impossible .", "The police used loud speakers to inform demonstrators of the rally location . They asked participants to pass directly to FAC and not stop at the bridge , despite the fact that the major part of the square was closed to demonstrators . They announced that all actions on the bridge could be considered illegal . However , given the poor quality of the sound equipment , only those nearest the police could hear this information ; the majority of protesters did not hear the police instructions .", "...", "From the moment difficulties first arose for demonstrators attempting to cross PERSON bridge , demonstrators made repeated attempts to negotiate with the police over moving their cordons to allow protesters onto FAC .", "PERSON , a member of ORG , and Member of Parliament PERSON tried to talk to the police authorities at around TIME , but there was no response . Shortly after participants broke through the police cordon at TIME , a group of human rights activists spoke to Colonel PERSON , head of the [ ORG of the Interior ] \u2019s press service .

This in turn generated a counter response from the crowd , and protesters began pushing back . In several places , the police cordon broke , and CARDINAL people found themselves in the empty space behind the first police line . It is impossible to determine whether the breaking of the cordon was the result of conscious action by sections of the crowd or if the police cordon simply broke due to the pressure from such a large number of people . Some of those who made it past the police lines were young men , but there were also many elderly citizens and others who did not resemble street fighters . Those who found themselves behind the police cordon did not act in an aggressive manner but appeared to move towards the entrance to the GPE [ park ] , the supposed rally point .", "Different demonstrators reacted very differently to the breaking of the police line .

By TIME the organizers began to disassemble the stage .", "...", "In TIME between TIME , the demonstration was marked by CARDINAL distinct types of activity . For much of the time , demonstrators and the police stood face to face without much happening . These moments were interspersed with periods when the police advanced and the crowd moved back . There does not appear to have been any clear reason for the police decision to advance other than to divide the crowd up into smaller sections . More than anything , the police advances served to raise tensions and provoke some members of the crowd to push back . There is little evidence that demonstrators initiated the violence . Rather , they appear to have become aggressive only in response to the authorities\u2019 advances .", "During these interchanges some protesters threw objects at the police , and the police used their batons freely . The crowd threw plastic bottles , shoes and umbrellas ...", "At around TIME the police announced that the rally was cancelled and asked protesters to disperse .

Please , leave here , and do not stop . Go to the metro.\u2019 Although the police used a loudspeaker , the announcement was not loud enough to reach the majority of the crowd .

The complaints and enquiries concerned the allegedly unlawful acts of the police in dispersing the rally on DATE , including excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests . ORG interviewed CARDINAL of the CARDINAL individuals who had lodged the complaints and QUANTITY police officers deployed in the cordon around FAC , including squadron and regiment commanders . They stated , in particular , that they had been acting under orders to maintain public safety and to identify and arrest the most active instigators of unrest ; only those resisting the demands of the police had been arrested and no force had been used unnecessarily . The police officers stated that when the police had had to intervene , they had used combat manoeuvres and truncheons but not tear gas or other exceptional means of restraint . ORG Commander PERSON explained that he had been deployed in the sector adjacent to the stage and that there had been no incidents or disorder in that sector ; no one had been arrested . The decision listed CARDINAL other internal inquiries carried out following individual complaints and medical reports ; in CARDINAL cases the allegations of abuse had been found to be unsubstantiated and in CARDINAL cases the police conduct had been found to be lawful . As regards the substance of the complaints at hand , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c ... having crossed PERSON bridge , the column leaders stopped . Many participants in the march bypassed the organisers and proceeded to FAC towards the stage ... When the march participants had filled nearly all of GPE embankment , limited by the police cordon on one side and by the stage on the other side , the organisers were still at the point between PERSON bridge , FAC , [ the park ] and the PERSON cinema ...", "At this time the organisers demanded that the police officers let them pass through to the ORG . The police told them that they would not let anyone pass through to the ORG because the event was authorised to take place at FAC , where the stage had been specially set up , and they were told to proceed . After that , the organisers decided to call a sit - down protest and called upon those present to disobey the lawful orders of the police . After that , the meeting participants congregated opposite the PERSON cinema , where after a while they attempted to break the cordon , which [ the police ] did not manage to prevent . Therefore the police began arresting those who had been most actively involved in breaking the cordon ; they were put in a police van and then taken to police stations in GPE . After the confrontation had been localised , the police officers slightly dispersed the crowd , having apprehended the most active perpetrators . From the very beginning of the sit - down protest the police requested the participants through loudspeakers to proceed to the stage , not to act on provocation and not to commit unlawful acts , but these requests had no effect and therefore [ it was clear that ] the breaking of the cordon had been organised . In suppressing it the police officers acted in coordination and concert . They did not apply force or special means of restraint . However , the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve the use of force and special means of restraint , in so far as necessary , against persons putting up resistance .", "Later on , in the area of ORG and at the [ park ] corner some localised confrontations took place ... force and special means of restraint were used . All those detained at FAC were taken to the police stations ...

FAC is a traditional place for holding various opposition events . We all had a clear understanding what the route would be , where the stage would be , what the layout would be . We came there at that time for a rather traditional , customary event , the scenario of which was well - known to everybody ... DATE beforehand the maps showing where people would assemble and the direction of the march were published on the official [ news ] website ORG ; they are still posted there . The map was published on the [ police ] website \u2018 Petrovka , PERSON and this map is still posted there . Not only the organisers , but the participants too , they knew where they were going ... When we approached the venue of the meeting ... we saw that the map showing where people would assemble on the square had been essentially altered . It was essentially different from the map of CARDINAL February [ DATE ] , and , above all , different from the document which had been agreed with the GPE mayor \u2019s office and had been published on the website[s ] ORG and \u2018 Petrovka , PERSON ... [ according to which ] people were to assemble on GPE embankment as well as in the park at FAC . However , when we came we saw that the park at FAC , taking up PERCENT of the square , was barred and cordoned off ... since [ the cordon ] did not correspond [ to the map ] the column stopped . The event organisers and the people who came just waited for this question to be resolved , for the police to remove the wrong cordon , for the police chiefs to reply as to what had changed , why the approved meeting was not being conducted according to the scenario that had been approved ... I had previously [ organised events ] ... Somebody had taken the map and changed the location of the meeting . This had practically never happened before ... to show visually that we were not moving anywhere , we sat on the ground ... the first line of [ the police ] cordon was composed of CARDINAL-year - old conscripts , and with CARDINAL people pressing on it the cordon broke . It could only break . This led to an uncontrollable situation , as several policemen were walking and trying to say something through megaphones \u2013 impossible to tell what they were saying . Some activists passing by were also speaking through megaphones \u2013 impossible to tell what they were saying . No authorities were present on the spot . And [ it was ] impossible to understand who was in command . So all of that caused the rupture of the police cordon . People started spreading across that spot ... Then I tried to walk over to the stage to try and explain to the gathering what was going on , using the amplifiers . I did not know then that the police had already cut off the amplifiers .", "[ Question to the witness ] Did anybody try to negotiate with the participants of the sit - down protest ?", "- Attempts had been made as much as possible in the circumstances ... everybody had stopped because we all wanted to understand where the representatives from the mayor \u2019s office were , where the appropriate representative of ORG was . All the [ high - ranking ] police officers were asked , but they only shrugged . Nobody could understand what was going on . ORG deputies present on the spot tried to act as negotiators , but ... they said that nobody wanted to come up to us . We could see some police officers resembling chiefs , at a distance ... but it was impossible to get to them ... it was impossible to reach the [ police ] command . Nobody would come to us . Nobody could negotiate despite everyone \u2019s wish to do so .", "... when I was in the detention facility I lodged a complaint about the hindrance of a peaceful public event . This complaint was with ORG of the ORG . I have set out the arguments [ as to why ] I considered that there had been ample evidence that the officials of ORG of the ORG had deliberately provoked the crowd to panic so that [ they ] could later make claims about mass disorder . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It was always possible to meet the deadline , to find a compromise , [ but not this time ] . ... It was [ only ] on CARDINAL [ DATE ] that we received the written agreement . On DATE the working meeting took place ... Usually , everything is decided DATE before the event . This time there was practically QUANTITY notice . We could not even bring the vehicles carrying the stage to the square before TIME [ on DATE ] . We were put under very harsh conditions ... we had to put up the stage within TIME ... At the [ working meeting ] technical issues were discussed , but for the previous events we held , as a matter of practice , [ there was ] an on - site reconnaissance : the representatives of the organisers [ together with ] the representatives of the police ... would visit the site , walk through the route and determine where the barriers would be put , the stage , the lavatories , so that there was no ambiguity in understanding the event . This time , because [ the working meeting ] was on CARDINAL [ DATE ] , and the event was on CARDINAL [ DATE ] , it was already clear at the working meeting that we would n\u2019t have time for an on - site reconnaissance ; therefore at Mr PERSON \u2019s suggestion it was stated that in organising the event we would follow the example of the assembly held on CARDINAL February [ DATE ] . Then , it was also a march from FAC and a meeting at FAC . The only thing that was noted was that this time the stage would be a bit closer to the park at FAC , at the corner of the square , because originally the event had been declared for CARDINAL participants . We had a feeling that people were disappointed , somehow low - spirited , and that not many would come . When we realised that there would be more people I told that to PERSON [ the First Deputy Director of ORG ] , but he told us that it was unacceptable . But it was clear that we could not do anything about it . We warned that there would be significantly more participants ... When we called Mr Deynichenko the following day he told [ us ] that he had had a map drawn up by ORG , and that PERSON could come during DATE to see it to clarify any issues .
