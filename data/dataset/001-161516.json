SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;George Nicolaou;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , CARDINAL lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE TVCARDINAL , a major commercial television channel , broadcast a television programme in which the applicant appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name . He was singled out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being guilty of several fraud offences and other economic offences . The programme was rebroadcast DATE as well as in DATE . At this time , no preliminary investigation had been initiated against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was indicted for aggravated fraud ( grovt bedr\u00e4geri ) , an aggravated tax offence ( grovt skattebrott ) , an aggravated bookkeeping offence ( bokf\u00f6ringsbrott , grovt brott ) , a bookkeeping offence ( bokf\u00f6ringsbrott ) , obstruction of tax control ( f\u00f6rsv\u00e5rande av skattekontroll ) and violations of LAW ( brott mot aktiebolagslagen ) . According to the indictment , the offences had been committed within CARDINAL named companies , for which the applicant allegedly had been the actual representative ( faktisk st\u00e4llf\u00f6retr\u00e4dare ) . The prosecutor relied on extensive written evidence and requested that over QUANTITY witnesses be heard and a recording of the abovementioned television programme be shown during the trial .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant protested his innocence and submitted that he had been neither the formal nor the actual representative of the relevant companies . Thus he had had no right to decide over the companies , nor had he been responsible for their bookkeeping or reporting their turnover to the tax authority . He had done some consultancy for the companies and assisted with some administrative tasks . However , he had not financed the companies and could not be considered as their principal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further requested ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE to dismiss the use of the television programme as evidence . He argued , inter alia , that it violated his rights under LAW as it was a strongly edited journalistic product aimed at creating sensational television and which amounted to defamation of him . Thus it would have a strong negative effect on the objectivity of the court . Moreover , since a number of persons in the programme were anonymous , they were unknown both to the defence and the court and the applicant would not be able to cross - examine them as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . This decision could only be appealed against together with the court \u2019s final judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated fraud and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was acquitted of the other offences . The court held an oral hearing where the above - mentioned television programme was presented by the prosecutor during the opening procedures and relied on as evidence . At the request of CARDINAL or both of the parties , CARDINAL witnesses were heard , and the applicant was also heard . Moreover , substantial written evidence was invoked by both parties . The court , in a judgment comprising CARDINAL pages , found it proved beyond reasonable doubt that the principal activity concerned by the indictment was fraudulent advertising sales in a number of companies , causing loss for the customers and gain for the companies . While it considered it a flaw that none of the customers had been heard in the case , it still found it established on the basis of other evidence that the customers had suffered the losses claimed by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The court further found it proved that the applicant had been the actual representative of the companies and thus responsible for the fraudulent activities . He had been active in all of the companies and the driving force behind them and large amounts of money had been transferred from the companies to his personal company . Moreover , the court noted that none of the formal representatives of the companies had any corporate experience or knowledge of organising and running an advertising sales company . Some of them had extensive criminal records . The court also had regard to the fact that several of the companies shared office space , employees moved between the companies and the applicant had kept detailed information relating to , inter alia , taxes , DATE results , bookkeeping , billing and contacts with banks and authorities for all of the companies in his personal computer .", "CARDINAL . The television programme was mentioned in ORG judgment under the heading \u201c Statement of facts \u201d ( PERSON ) where it was simply noted that the television programme had been broadcast for the first time during DATE and that the case against the applicant had been initiated by ORG ( Ekobrottsmyndigheten ) in DATE , DATE and DATE after the broadcast . The court did not mention the television programme in its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecutor appealed against the judgment . The applicant also appealed against the decision to allow the television programme as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in relation to the television programme as it found no reason to dismiss it as evidence . This decision could only be appealed against in connection with ORG final judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , upheld the lower court \u2019s conviction but also found the applicant guilty of an aggravated bookkeeping offence and an aggravated tax offence . The sentence was upheld . In addition to the witnesses heard before FAC , whose testimonies were played to the court , supplementary questions were put to the applicant and CARDINAL new witnesses were heard on the applicant \u2019s request . Substantial written evidence was also presented to the appellate court . As regards the television programme , it was stated in the judgment that it had been presented to the court . It was not mentioned by ORG in its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . ORG , like the lower court , found it proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been the actual representative of the companies . In addition to the findings of ORG , the appellate court noted in particular that the applicant had explained his involvement and the large amount of money received from the companies as fees for consulting , with focus on training the sellers in the various companies . However , the court observed that this was not supported by the witness statements and , moreover , the applicant had not been able to give a credible account of the training he alleged to have provided . His explanations had been vague and diffuse and he had no documented qualifications as a trainer . Moreover , before ORG , he had claimed not to have signed any contracts with the companies and when confronted by the prosecutor before the appellate court with such contracts , signed by him , he claimed not to have any memory of having signed them . That the applicant would have forgot such important acts were not plausible to the court and affected his credibility negatively . The contracts also revealed the applicant \u2019s ability to control the companies . ORG further noted that the companies had been inter - connected in various ways , even sharing offices and employees , which was remarkable considering that they were supposedly competitors in the same market . In view of this , ORG fully agreed with the lower court \u2019s reasoning and conclusion concerning the aggravated fraud and also found that he had committed an aggravated bookkeeping offence and an aggravated tax offence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) against the judgment as well as the decision not to dismiss the television programme as evidence . He claimed , inter alia , that it was in violation of his right to fair trial under the ORG to allow the television programme as evidence", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant initiated defamation proceedings against the anchor man of the television programme . These proceedings were terminated in DATE and an application regarding this matter , under Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , was lodged with the ORG on DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure ( R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , reads as follows :", "\u201c After conscientious assessment of everything that has occurred , the court shall determine what has been proved in the case .", "As to the effect of certain kinds of evidence , the specific provisions thereon shall govern . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision reflects the principle of free submission and evaluation of evidence ( principen om DATE bevisf\u00f6ring och bevisv\u00e4rdering ) which prevails in NORP procedural law . It means that , as a main rule , there are no restrictions in law on the submission and evaluation of evidence . Thus , anything that may be of value as evidence in a case may , in principle , be presented during the main hearing . However , the circumstances under which evidence has been collected or given will have an influence on the way in which it is evaluated . The \u201c principle of best evidence \u201d ( principen om b\u00e4sta bevismedlet ) is applied ; consequently , witnesses and injured parties should normally give evidence during a court hearing , rather than the court reading the statements made during the preliminary investigation , to enable the parties to pose questions and scrutinise the statements more closely .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , according to LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , a court may dismiss evidence , inter alia , if the circumstance that a party wants to prove is without importance in the case , if the evidence is unnecessary or if it evidently would be of no effect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
