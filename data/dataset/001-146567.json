Some of the CARDINAL employees , including the second , third , fourth and fifth applicants , who were heard during the inquiry on CARDINAL and DATE following the ORG complaints ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , stated that police officers had cut open the entrance door to the first of the company \u2019s offices in which they had been working on the afternoon of DATE . Following that the officers had hit them in the face , kicked them , stepped with a boot on their heads , applied electroshock discharges on them which had caused them very strong pain and a feeling of paralysis , insulted them and continuously shouted at them to keep silent . The officers had been wearing what some employees described as \u201c helmets \u201d and \u201c hoods \u201d on their heads . They had been dressed in black police uniforms and had been armed with machine guns . Once the masked officers had noticed that there were cameras on the LOC , they had signaled this to each other and stopped hitting the employees . Shortly afterwards civilian police officers had entered the office LOC ; none of the civilian officers had illtreated any of the employees .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted to the ORG statements of CARDINAL police officers who had taken part in the operation . The statements were given to the prosecution on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , as part of a preliminary inquiry carried out into the allegations of the company \u2019s employees that they had been ill - treated by the police at the time of the operation . The Government also submitted to the ORG the statements of CARDINAL employees of the company given to the prosecution during the same inquiry ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Officers from the ORG who had participated in the operation were heard during the inquiry in DATE in GPE following instructions of the FAC prosecutors . The ORG officers submitted that , prior to the operation they had received information from operative police sources and various media publications , that the company was connected to organised criminal groups . Given that the employees had refused to open the door to one of the offices which had been disguised as a family apartment , masked police officers had had to cut it open in order to prevent the destruction of evidence . The other office had been opened from inside by employees . ORG officers ( it was not specified who or how many ) had entered through the window into yet a third \u201c hidden \u201d office , thus \u201c taking by surprise an employee found there who was attempting to destroy evidence \u201d ; they had handcuffed that employee , and then an unspecified person had opened the door to that office with a key . During the operation the company \u2019s employees had refused to comply with the police orders and had actively disobeyed the officers , thus obstructing the operation . The officers had not used electroshock on any employee . They had used handcuffs on individual members of staff who had refused to open the entrance door or to move away from their computer stations and who had continued to erase data from the computers instead . The wife of the company \u2019s manager had behaved arrogantly towards the officers , insulting and threatening them with revenge , and had ordered the employees to continue with their work .", "CARDINAL . Officers of ORG ( \u201c \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430 FAC GPE FAC \u201d or \u201c ORG \u201d ) who were heard during the inquiry in DATE in GPE submitted that they had been called in to assist their colleagues from the ORG in an operation to find company servers containing unlicensed software , films and music . None of the ORG officers had been masked . They had not been involved in the opening of the entrance doors to the company \u2019s offices as that had been done by masked officers from the ORG . They had entered the office LOC after the doors had been opened . They had seen some masked officers on the company LOC but had not seen what they had done . Some of them had heard calls of \u201c Open ! Police ! \u201d during a period of TIME and after that the sound of an electric grinder . They had not witnessed any physical force being used against any employee . Some of the ORG officers had seen in the first office several women \u2013 none of whom bore any sign of injury \u2013 sitting on chairs guarded by CARDINAL masked officers ; in the entrance hall leading to the second office they had seen several company employees , some wearing handcuffs . While the ORG officers had been waiting for the entrance doors to the offices to be opened , they had thought it likely that the company employees would delete most if not all of the information sought to be collected during the operation . All the employees had been calm and , at times , the officers had let them smoke outside the building before asking them to return inside to wait until the conclusion of the search - and - seizure operation . After officers had brought in another woman called ORG , acting as the manager of the company , CARDINAL computer systems were seized in her presence and in the presence of several certifying witnesses . The ORG officers had left at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after the police operation , at their request , a forensic expert examined PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , respectively the second , third and fifth applicants .", "CARDINAL . According to the medical reports , PERSON had a swollen right upper eyelid and a swelling and a cut next to her right eyebrow , a bruise and an abrasion in her right armpit , CARDINAL reddish - brown burns on and below her right shoulder blade and bruises on her right thigh and arm . The conclusion of the medical expert was that the burns on her back were of first to second degree and it was plausible that they had been sustained from not CARDINAL strikes with an electroshock baton at the time and in the circumstances described by the applicant . PERSON had a jaw injury , injuries to both arms , an injury and an open wound in the abdominal area and CARDINAL reddish strips on his abdomen . Mr PERSON had CARDINAL long bruises around his left armpit which could have been the result of pressure applied with non - sharp , hard objects , possibly squeezing by hands . The medical expert concluded that the bruises and injuries could have been caused by blows with or against a blunt object , and that the injuries described above had caused the second , third and fifth applicant pain and suffering , and the second applicant also temporary non - life - threatening health disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , and CARDINAL other individuals , complained to the prosecutor , in particular , that masked men had broken into CARDINAL of the company \u2019s offices DATE and had used violence towards them , as well as shouting and insulting . Because the officers had been masked , they could not identify them . Civilian officers who had entered the office premises in order to search and seize computer equipment after the masked men had broken in had not mistreated the company employees . The prosecutor took the ORG statements which are summarised in CARDINAL above . They submitted the medical certificates drawn up on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A preliminary inquiry into the above complaints was opened DATE after the operation took place . During DATE , DATE and DATE , investigators took statements from CARDINAL officers who had participated in the operation and CARDINAL staff members of the company who had been present during the operation . The police statements are summarised in paragraphs CARDINAL above and the GPE statements are summarized in paragraph CARDINAL above . The Government did not submit , and the documents in the file do not show , that any other investigative steps , apart from the questioning of several police officers and the company \u2019s employees , were carried out .", "CARDINAL . The questions put to the officers during the inquiry were : CARDINAL ) NORP whether during the operation any employee had disobeyed or showed manifest lack of cooperation ; CARDINAL ) NORP whether any of the masked officers had used electroshock batons against any employee and , if yes , why ; CARDINAL ) who among the officers ( masked or not ) had used physical force and auxiliary means for restraint ( \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 ) , against whom of the employees , in which of the company \u2019s offices and why ; CARDINAL ) NORP officers from which police department ( specialised in breaking into LOC or in arresting individuals ) had taken part in the operation ; and CARDINAL ) NORP whether the entrance doors to the company \u2019s offices had been opened voluntarily or whether they had to be forced open .", "CARDINAL . All the officers heard during the inquiry stated that they had learned about the police operation of DATE and had been called to assist with it earlier on DATE ; none of them had used force against the applicants , apart from handcuffing individuals who had disobeyed the ORG orders ; no electroshock discharges had been applied to anyone . Not all police officers answered all questions asked as part of the inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The inquiry ended with a decision of ORG of DATE not to institute criminal proceedings , finding that the officers involved in the operation had not exceeded the prerogatives vested in them by law . Upon appeal by the applicants , on DATE ORG returned the case with instructions that further acts be carried out ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , third sentence ) . More specifically , he observed that the file did not contain any documents showing that criminal proceedings had been opened against the applicants . Likewise , there was no information in the file showing that a search - and - seizure operation had been carried out and that it had been authorised by a judge . No information on file showed either that evidence had actually been found on the LOC searched , or that there had been reasonable suspicion that evidence could have been found there . The prosecutor held that the scant assertions of several police officers who had been heard during the preliminary inquiry were not sufficient to establish the circumstances as recorded in the refusal to open criminal proceedings of DATE . Consequently , additional investigative acts had to be carried out . The higher prosecutor asked , in particular , that copies be collected of the orders for opening criminal proceedings on suspicion of violating intellectual property laws and for bringing charges on those grounds , as well as records of the search - and - seizure operation and \u201c other documents of importance for the inquiry \u201d . It is unclear whether any investigative steps were taken thereafter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , to whom the file was sent for competence reasons following a legislative amendment , refused to open criminal proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against the police officers . She found that a special police operation aimed at gaining access to the offices of the company and seizing unlicensed software had been carried out on DATE . The initial information available had been that the company had connections with organised criminal groups and that its main activity was the collecting and disseminating of unlicensed software . Officers from ORG had been in charge of the operation ; masked officers from ORG \u201c Operational Intervention \u201d ( \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u201c \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u201d ) and officers from different units of ORG , had taken part in the operation . Following a preparatory briefing session , at around CARDINAL.CARDINAL in the afternoon the officers had tried to enter the office premises of the company . Someone on the inside had locked the front door ; following this , the company \u2019s employees had gone to their computers and started deleting data sought by the police . The employees had not complied with several orders by the police officers to open the doors . Acting upon the instructions to enter the company \u2019s LOC rapidly and to establish full control over all individuals there without giving them the opportunity to erase data or to obstruct the seizure of computers , the ORG officers had cut the entrance door lock to the building , thus breaking into the LOC . They had then ordered all the individuals found there to lie on the floor and refrain from touching the computer equipment . However , the company \u2019s employees had disobeyed the orders and , using different pretexts , had remained instead in front of their work stations , acting so as to delete information from the company \u2019s computers . The officers had used physical force , electroshock batons and handcuffs in respect of some of the employees to overcome their resistance and prevent them from touching the computers located on the LOC . During the operation , some employees had been knocked over . Those findings had been corroborated by the statements of all persons , civilians and police officers , collected during the inquiry , as well as by documents submitted by ORG . The prosecutor further found , on the basis of medical reports , that some complainants ( without naming them ) had sustained injuries during the operation and that they could not identify the officers who had caused the injuries as the latter had been wearing masks . The prosecutor concluded that it had been established unequivocally during the inquiry that the injuries sustained by the civilians during the police operation of DATE had been the result of the use of force and auxiliary means for restraint by police officers in order to overcome the ORG resistance and to prevent them from destroying crucial evidence for the ongoing criminal proceedings . The officers had not exceeded their statutory right under section CARDINAL of ORG to use force , as they had been faced with refusals to obey their orders . The material collected during the inquiry had shown that the searchandseizure operation had been carried out in accordance with the instructions of the supervising prosecutor and had been approved by a judge . The prosecutor concluded that the police officers involved had not committed a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicants and CARDINAL of the other complainants , on DATE ORG ( \u201c PERSON ORG \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u201d ) upheld the lower prosecutor \u2019s decision . He held , in particular , that the officers had used force for the purposes of gathering physical evidence and in compliance with the applicable legislation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
