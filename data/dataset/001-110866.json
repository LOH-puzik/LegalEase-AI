The ORG began by pointing out that the LAW itself provided that \u201c the ORG shall grant political parties sufficient and equitable funding \u201d and that \u201c the law shall define the principles applicable to party funding , ORG subscriptions and donations \u201d . The applicant party observed in particular that the criteria laid down by the PERSON on political parties excluded parties which were not represented in ORG from entitlement to ORG subsidies . Pointing to the difficulty of carrying out political activities and campaigning without the necessary financial resources , it contended that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of a democratic ORG , to the ORG \u2019s duty to promote democratic rights and freedoms , and to the principle of nondiscrimination .

NORP Under additional section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on political parties , the ORG provides financial assistance ( the overall amount of which represents DATE of its budget ) to the political parties represented in ORG , in proportion to the number of votes they obtained in the preceding parliamentary elections .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed by a majority a plea of unconstitutionality raised by ORG , which alleged that the statutory PERCENT threshold imposed on political parties in order to obtain ORG funding was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional . In making its ruling , ORG considered that CARDINAL of the aims of political parties was to obtain electoral support with a view to participating in government and hence contributing to the expression of the opinion of the people . It concluded from this that parties which had not obtained a sufficient level of electoral support did not contribute to the expression of the opinion of the people to the same extent as political parties with broader popular support . It dismissed the argument that using the extent of parties\u2019 contribution to democratic political life as the criterion for allocating ORG funding was not objective , equitable or proportionate .", "CARDINAL .

Public funding", "( a ) Importance of public funding", "CARDINAL . Public funding and its requisite regulations ( including spending limits , disclosure , and impartial enforcement ) has been designed and adopted throughout the globe as a potential means of preventing corruption , to support the important role played by political parties and to remove undue reliance on private donors . Such systems of funding are aimed at ensuring that all parties are able to compete for elections in accordance with the principle of equal opportunity , thus strengthening political pluralism and helping to ensure the proper functioning of democratic institutions . Generally , legislation should attempt to create a balance between public and private contributions as the source for political party funding . In no case should the allocation of public funding limit or interfere with the independence of a political party .", "CARDINAL . NORP The amount of public funding awarded to parties must be carefully designed to ensure the utility of such funding while not eradicating the need for private contributions or nullifying the impact of individual donations . While the nature of elections and campaigning in different States makes it impossible to identify a universally applicable amount of funding , legislation should put in place review mechanisms aimed at periodically determining the impact of public - finance systems and the need ( as such exists ) to alter financial - allocation amounts . Generally , subsidies should be set at a meaningful level to fulfil the objective of support , but should not be the only source of income and should not create conditions for over - dependency on State support .", "( b ) ORG support", "CARDINAL . Legislation should explicitly allow that ORG support for political parties may be financial . The allocation of public money to political parties is often considered integral to respect the principle of equal opportunity for all candidates , in particular where the ORG \u2019s funding mechanism includes special provisions for women and minorities . Where financial support is awarded to parties , relevant legislation should develop clear guidelines to determine the amount of such funding , which should be allocated to recipients in an objective and unbiased manner .", "( c ) Other forms of public support", "CARDINAL . In addition to direct funding , the ORG may offer support to parties in a variety of other ways , including tax exemptions for party activities , the allocation of free media time , or the free use of public meeting halls for the purposes of campaign activities . In all such cases , both financial and in - kind support must be given on the basis of equality of opportunity to all parties and candidates ( including women and minorities ) . While \u2018 equality\u2019 may not be absolute in nature , a system for determining the proportional ( or equitable ) distribution of ORG support ( whether financial or in - kind ) must be objective , fair and reasonable .", "...", "( d ) Allocation of funding", "CARDINAL . The system for allocating public support to political parties should be determined by relevant legislation . Some systems allocate money prior to an election based on the results of the previous election or proof of minimum levels of support . [ Other ] systems provide payment after an election based on the final results . Generally , a pre - election disbursement of funds , or a percentage of funding , best ensures the ability of parties to compete on the basis of equal opportunity .", "...", "CARDINAL . The allocation of funding may either be fully equal ( \u2018 absolute equality\u2019 ) or proportionate in nature based on a party \u2019s election results or proven level of support ( \u2018 equitable\u2019 ) . There is no universally prescribed system for determining the distribution of public funding . Some have argued that legislation for public funding is generally most effective at achieving political pluralism and equal opportunity by providing a combination of both absolute and equitable equality . Where minimum thresholds of support are required for funding , it should be considered that an unreasonably high threshold may be detrimental to political pluralism and small political parties . Further , it is in the interest of political pluralism to have a lower threshold for public funding than the electoral threshold for the allocation of a mandate in ORG .", "...", "CARDINAL . Legislation should ensure that the formula for the allocation of funding does not provide a monopoly or disproportionate amount of funding to CARDINAL political party . Nor should the formula for allocation of funding allow the CARDINAL largest political parties to monopolise the receipt of public funding .", "( e ) Requirements to receive public funding", "CARDINAL . At a minimum , some degree of public funding should be available to all parties represented in ORG . However , to promote political pluralism , some funding should ideally be extended beyond parties represented in ORG to all parties representative of a minimum level of the citizenry \u2019s support and presenting candidates in an election . This is particularly important in the case of new parties , which must be given a fair opportunity to compete with existing parties .", "...", "CARDINAL . Public funding , by providing increased resources to political parties , can increase political pluralism . As such , it is reasonable for legislation to require a party to be representative of a minimum level of the electorate prior to receipt of funding . However , as the denial of public funding can lead to a decrease in pluralism and political alternatives , it is ... accepted good practice to enact clear guidelines for how new parties may become eligible for funding and to extend public funding beyond parties represented in ORG . A generous system for the determination of eligibility should be considered to ensure that voters are given the political alternatives necessary for a real choice . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
