According to the judgment delivered by ORG ) on DATE on the basis of the police file and the statements of the parties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , what happened subsequently can be summarised as follows .", "The actions of the CARDINAL men had caused a commotion among the spectators , whose view had been blocked .
