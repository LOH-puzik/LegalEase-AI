On DATE the court rejected his claim , finding that it had been withdrawn due to his failure to attend CARDINAL hearings . On DATE this decision became final .", "On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings for damages against the company claiming that his apartment was of inadequate quality and smaller than was specified in the contract .", "On DATE ORG GPE ( GPE \u0441\u0443\u0434 ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that on DATE the applicant had entered into agreement with the company for construction of the apartment . On DATE the company had transferred the apartment into the applicant \u2019s possession . Minutes had been drawn up in which the defects had been noted and accepted by the applicant and the company .", "The court referred to the PERSON on obligations ( \u0417a\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438 ) according to which in case of defects , the buyer / acquirer \u2019s rights expired DATE after notifying the vendor i.e. the CARDINAL responsible for the construction . It held that the applicant \u2019s claim for damages was time barred as it was lodged before the court DATE after he had first notified the company about the defects ( DATE ) . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that the absolute time bar of DATE for damage claims had not expired . It found it irrelevant that the claim was submitted within the absolute time bar as he failed to comply with the relative time bar of DATE which ran from the moment when he became aware of the damage and that the company was responsible . The court also dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that the civil proceedings instituted in DATE suspended the time bar as his claim had been rejected as being withdrawn .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant appealed this decision indicating the reasons in general terms . He stated :", "\u201c Being dissatisfied with the ORG decision ... I lodge this appeal in time on account of : substantive infringement of the civil procedure ; erroneous and incomplete establishment of the facts and wrong application of the substantive law . I will submit the explanation of the grounds with a subsequent submission . \u201d", "In a submission lodged on DATE , the applicant inter alia contested the court \u2019s findings that the agreement concluded with the company was of a commercial nature ( contract for construction ) and that consequently , the court had wrongly applied the national law concerning the time bar . He also referred to the minutes drawn on DATE in which the company acknowledged the defects and committed itself to remedying them by DATE , as allegedly newly discovered evidence that could influence the time bar . He argued that the lower court had wrongly interpreted the law in respect of the relevance to the time bar of the civil proceedings terminated in DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It inter alia found that :", "\u201c the plaintiff [ the applicant ] filed his appeal in time , but he submitted the reasons and the rationale of his appeal after expiration of the time limit of DATE ... as the appeal does not provide any reasoning , the court considered the judgment on the basis contained in the appeal and within its ex officio capacity to determine substantial infringements of the procedure and the correct application of the law ... \u201d", "It went further on to conclude that", "\u201c ... the first instance court had properly established that the claim was time barred as the term of DATE had expired ... \u201d", "It also held that the trial court had correctly applied the substantive law as the facts had been properly and fully established . It also , inter alia , repeated the parts of the lower court \u2019s decision concerning the agreement between the applicant and the company ; the time when the apartment was transferred into the applicant \u2019s possession and the dates when the applicant had notified the company about the shortcomings and asked for rectification or compensation .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that there were no statutory grounds for submitting a request for the protection of legality ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) before ORG .", "According to section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 ) , if a party concerned fails to attend a hearing or to take another action in the proceedings and consequently loses the right to do so , the court shall uphold that party \u2019s request to perform that action subsequently ( restoration to previous state of affairs ) if it finds a reasonable explanation for the failure .", "When the restoration in the previous state of affairs is granted , the proceedings are restored to the state before the failure had occurred and all other decisions in that respect are considered void .", "Section CARDINAL provides that , inter alia , parties can appeal the first instance decision within DATE from the date of service of the trial court decision , if not otherwise regulated by law .", "According to section CARDINAL , the trial court shall by decision summon the appellant to correct or supplement the appeal if on the basis of the information provided , it can not be determined which judgment is complained of or if the appeal was not signed .
