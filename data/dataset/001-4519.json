He claimed that , if returned to GPE , he would be put in prison or sent to the front - line .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation to GPE . Finding that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship , the ORG referred to a decision concerning asylum seekers with such double nationality taken by ORG on DATE . According to the decision , the prevailing situation in GPE rendered deportations to that country impossible . Consequently , in assessing applications from these asylum seekers , the crucial question was whether they could be afforded protection in GPE . ORG noted that , according to available information , persons in the applicant \u2019s situation did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE against their will . Moreover , no acts of warfare had taken place on NORP territory for some time and a cease - fire had been agreed upon by the contending parties . Thus , there was no apparent risk that NORP citizens in general would be forced to take part in armed conflict . Further , the applicant had failed to show that he personally faced such a risk .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) .

Consequently , if returned to that country , he would be forced to go back to PERSON where he would be punished for having evaded military service . Further , as the most extreme NORP lived in his home district in GPE , he would be at risk due to the evasion and the fact that he had applied for asylum in a foreign country . He submitted a document showing that he was wanted for draft evasion by the military authorities of ORG . The applicant referred also to the time he had spent in GPE and claimed that he had adjusted himself to NORP society .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG had regard to guiding decisions taken by ORG and found that the applicant should not be sent back to PERSON . With regard to the possible deportation to GPE , the ORG noted that no new circumstances had been invoked by the applicant .
