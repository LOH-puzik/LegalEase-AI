NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr C. J. Barnett , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s son , aged DATE and DATE at that time , underwent a tonsillectomy DATE an operation to remove his tonsils DATE performed by PERSON in a private clinic . After the surgery the child \u2019s condition was stable and the first medical check - up was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the medical check - up , which took place on the scheduled date , Dr O.L.T. assured the parents that the post - surgical recovery was going well and recommended that they continue caring for their child in the same way .", "CARDINAL . In TIME CARDINAL DATE the child suffered a haemorrhage , causing blood to flood his mouth and nose . The applicant \u2019s mother - in - law called an ambulance and his wife went outside to wait for it . Before the ambulance arrived , she and PERSON , a neighbour she had met on her way out , took a taxi and rushed the child to the emergency unit of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at the emergency unit of ORG his wife and son encountered a member of the medical staff who , without examining his son , advised his wife to take the child to the paediatric unit of the same hospital for medical care .", "CARDINAL . The child did not receive any medical treatment at the emergency unit of ORG because the applicant \u2019s wife had immediately taken the child to the paediatric unit of the hospital .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrival at the paediatric unit , the doctors tried to resuscitate the child and clear his respiratory channels , but without any success . The child had died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG initiated of its own motion a criminal investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s son . On DATE , it carried out an investigation on the premises of ORG ( cercetare la fa\u021ba locului ) and at the applicant \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to produce an autopsy report in respect of the applicant \u2019s son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a death certificate which concluded that the applicant \u2019s son had died of acute respiratory failure as a result of the blood that had blocked his airways .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE as well as DATE and DATE ORG heard the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with ORG for aggravated involuntary manslaughter against PERSON and the unidentified staff member who had been working at FAC emergency unit on TIME CARDINAL May CARDINAL . He alleged that the faulty surgical and post - surgical treatment received by his son from Dr O.L.T. , as well as the refusal of the unidentified staff member of ORG emergency unit to urgently treat his son , had resulted in his death . In addition , he asked the investigating authorities to identify all the medical personnel working at the emergency unit of ORG on TIME DATE because their identities were unknown to him . Furthermore , he informed the investigating authorities that he reserved his right to join the criminal proceedings as a civil party and his right to request that the private clinic where the surgery had taken place and ORG be held jointly liable with their staff for their negligence while on duty under the relevant provisions of the criminal procedure law and civil law . Lastly , he asked the domestic authorities to order ORG to carry out a forensic expert report that would answer his questions about the cause and circumstances of his son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG produced the autopsy report requested by ORG on DATE . The report , signed by CARDINAL forensic experts , relied amongst other things on a histological examination of tissue collected from the applicant \u2019s son after his death . It noted the opening of a very small blood vessel in the cavity of the upper left tonsil . It concluded that the child \u2019s death had been violent and had been caused by severe respiratory failure resulting from the aspiration of blood into his airways . The bleeding had originated from a small damaged arterial blood vessel located in the cavity of the left tonsil and had lasted for TIME . Blood had accumulated in the stomach cavity , which had resulted in vomiting and subsequently in the blocking of the child \u2019s airways . The blood vessel had been damaged by local acute inflammation \u2013 also confirmed by the histological examination \u2013 which had happened on DATE after the surgery . The report noted that although those circumstances were rare , they occurred in PERCENT of cases . It excluded the possibility that the bleeding had been caused by the severing of a larger blood vessel or an artery during surgery . Had that been the case , the bleeding would have happened faster and more abundantly . Lastly , it recommended that the report be submitted for approval by the forensic review board of ORG , which could also assess , among other things , the medical conduct in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , further to the applicant \u2019s request , ORG provided him with a copy of the autopsy report produced by ORG and of the surgery report produced by the private clinic where his son \u2019s surgery had been performed .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the autopsy report was sent for approval to the review board of ORG and the higher forensic review board of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG heard the medical personnel of the private clinic where the applicant \u2019s son had undergone surgery and who had been involved in his pre- and post - surgical care , as well as Dr O.L.T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a request with ORG for a new forensic expert report to be produced in his son \u2019s case . He requested that a forensic expert chosen by him and an otolaryngologist be allowed to take part in the process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG review board approved the autopsy report of DATE . The board included an otolaryngologist . It concluded , among other things , that the surgical operation and the postsurgical examinations had been appropriate and that the applicant \u2019s son had not been treated negligently . The delayed haemorrhage had not been caused by the surgery , but by a secondary inflammation . The last medical examination of the applicant \u2019s son could not have identified a microscopic infection . However , the medical personnel of ORG emergency unit had to explain their conduct given that their statements had not been attached to the examined file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the higher forensic review board of ORG examined and approved the findings of the autopsy report and of ORG review board . The board , which also included an otolaryngologist , concluded that PERSON had not committed any medical errors and that the cause of death established by the autopsy report was correct . The death of the applicant \u2019s son was not a consequence of the surgery . No one could be blamed for his haemorrhage , because it had been caused by a necrosis of the wall of the carotid artery which had subsequently spontaneously broken . The choices made by the medical personnel of ORG emergency unit had been based on the equipment available in the emergency unit and the seriousness of the condition of the applicant \u2019s son . Although it was clear that the applicant \u2019s son had died by the time he had reached the paediatric unit , there were no medical records to show whether he had still been alive when he had arrived at the emergency unit of the hospital . Given the circumstances and the seriousness of his condition , there was little hope that he could have been saved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG authorised a new forensic expert report , deemed necessary by the applicant . However , the report was never produced because on DATE the higher forensic review board of ORG communicated its report of DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE ORG and the prosecutor \u2019s office repeatedly questioned the medical personnel of ORG emergency unit who had been on duty when the applicant \u2019s son had arrived at the hospital , namely doctors GPE , ORG and GPE ; the orderly , GPE ; nurse PERSON and head nurse ORG The investigators also questioned R.D.M. , the taxi driver who had transported the applicant \u2019s wife and son to the hospital , and PERSON , the applicant \u2019s neighbour who had accompanied them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of ORG , ORG notified the police that their internal inquiry had been unable to identify the individual who had directed the applicant \u2019s wife and her son to a different unit of the hospital , because all those questioned had stated that they did not know who had done so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted before ORG an opinion drafted by a forensic medical expert chosen by him . It criticised the conclusions of the medical forensic documents produced in the case and recommended that a new forensic expert report be produced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that in accordance with LAW and their professional duties , the medical personnel of ORG emergency unit had been under an obligation to provide medical assistance in cases similar to that of the applicant \u2019s son . However , only a doctor had had the power to decide on the situation and the medical procedure that needed to be followed in respect of the applicant \u2019s son after a medical examination . The applicant \u2019s son had not been provided with the required medical assistance because the child \u2019s mother had rushed him out of the emergency unit once she had been directed by an unidentified individual , without having entered a doctor \u2019s office . Therefore the child had never been examined by CARDINAL of the doctors on duty that day . Although the medical personnel who had been on duty in the hospital reception area DATE had been questioned , the inquiry carried out by the disciplinary board of ORG had been unable to identify the person who had redirected the applicant \u2019s wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that in their opinion , given the serious condition of the applicant \u2019s son , had he been seen by CARDINAL of the on - duty doctors , they could have treated him in the emergency unit . Moreover , the child \u2019s condition did not warrant a decision to direct him elsewhere for treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant reiterated his request for a new forensic expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the higher forensic review board of ORG notified ORG that under the relevant domestic legislation , a new forensic expert report could not be ordered unless there were new medical and factual elements , given that the review board had already issued its opinion on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE ORG instituted criminal proceedings ( a \u020bnceput urm\u0103rirea penal\u0103 ) against the head nurse , ORG , for negligence while on duty because he had failed to notify the head doctor and had not taken measures to stabilise the condition of the applicant \u2019s child , who had been brought to the hospital in a critical condition . At the same time , the prosecutor \u2019s office continued to investigate PERSON for aggravated involuntary manslaughter and PERSON and nurse PERSON for negligence while on duty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG that under the relevant domestic legislation it was competent to organise and control the nursing profession . However , the applicant had failed to lodge a formal complaint about the events of CARDINAL DATE . Although , following press reports , the organisation had carried out a preliminary inquiry into the death of the applicant \u2019s son , it appeared from the available evidence and the inquiry already launched by the organisation into the case that the accusations had been targeted at doctors . ORG was not competent to institute disciplinary proceedings against doctors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the applicant again reiterated his request for a new forensic expert report . He also requested that PERSON and the nurses who had assisted him during the surgery be subjected to a polygraph test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the authorities investigating the case confronted head nurse ORG with witnesses GPE , PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a new forensic expert report on the grounds that the autopsy report prepared by ORG had been approved by ORG review board and the higher forensic review board of ORG . The latter board had confirmed the accuracy of both the methodology used and the conclusions of the autopsy report . The inconsistencies claimed by the applicant between the autopsy report and the board \u2019s report had been irrelevant in determining the cause of death and whether the doctor who had performed the surgery had committed any medical errors . The prosecutor \u2019s order of CARDINAL November CARDINAL for a new forensic expert report had not been carried out and was no longer required in the case for the reasons outlined above . Polygraph testing as a means of establishing evidence was not regulated by LAW and therefore was not required for the case .", "CARDINAL . By order of DATE , ORG , relying on LAW , decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings ( scoaterea de sub urm\u0103rire penal\u0103 ) against head nurse ORG for negligence while on duty and not to institute criminal proceedings ( ne\u00eenceperea urm\u0103ririi penale ) against PERSON , for aggravated involuntary manslaughter , and against PERSON and nurse GPE for negligence while on duty , on the grounds that their actions lacked the elements of an offence . The prosecutor \u2019s office held that the clinical and medical investigation , as well as the tonsillectomy performed by PERSON , had been adequate and that no omissions or negligence could be established in his conduct towards the victim . In addition , none of the medical personnel of ORG emergency unit had spoken with the applicant \u2019s wife in order to direct her to the paediatric unit , and the professional duties of head nurse ORG did not include the required power of decision . The applicant challenged the order before the superior prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of DATE , the superior prosecutor rejected the applicant \u2019s challenge , holding that the available evidence proved that the accused could not be held liable for directly causing the death of the applicant \u2019s son . PERSON had observed all the lawful procedures when he had performed the surgery , and the medical community accepted that the severe inflammation which had led to the child \u2019s death had been a rare case . As regards the medical staff of ORG emergency unit , it could not be established without any doubt whether the child had been alive on his arrival at the hospital . The applicant challenged the order before the domestic courts , arguing that the investigating authorities had failed to produce all the necessary evidence , in particular a new expert report .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as lodged outside the statutory timelimit . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge on the basis of the available testimonial , documentary and forensic evidence by relying on LAW . It held that none of the defendants who had been on duty at FAC emergency unit when the applicant \u2019s wife had arrived with her son had had a direct conversation with her or directed her to the paediatric unit . The job description of the head nurse , ORG , did not give him the power to make such a decision . In addition , a new forensic expert report was not necessary for the case . The higher forensic review board of ORG appealed on points of law against the judgment . He argued that a new forensic expert report had been needed in order to clarify the causes and circumstances of his son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It held that in spite of the efforts made by the criminal investigators and the court itself , it could not be established beyond any doubt that the person who had directed the applicant \u2019s wife to the paediatric unit was a staff member of the emergency unit of ORG on duty at the time of the death of the applicant \u2019s son . There had been no evidence in the file that the applicant \u2019s wife had spoken to a doctor and that the doctor had decided to direct her to the paediatric unit . As for the medical papers , which the court considered to be the actual object of the applicant\u2019", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted disciplinary proceedings against Dr PERSON before the disciplinary board of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the medical council concluded that there were no elements of medical fault .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision before the higher disciplinary board of ORG ( \u201c the Higher Board \u201d ) , arguing that not only had PERSON been exonerated , but none of the medical personnel on duty at FAC emergency unit had been held accountable .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge . It held that , on the basis of the available forensic evidence , otolaryngologists\u2019 opinions and the medical doctrine , the death of the applicant \u2019s son had been caused by a slow haemorrhage located in the cavity of the tonsils . This had been triggered by a local acute inflammatory lesion , which had resulted in the rupture of a small blood vessel , probably after the child had swallowed hard food without chewing it sufficiently . The vascular necrosis which caused the haemorrhage was the result of local inflammation and could not have been diagnosed prior to the time at which it had occurred . It could not have been foreseen by a post - surgical examination of the area operated on . Consequently , the doctor had not breached the rules of good medical conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG also upheld the outcome of the internal inquiry carried out by ORG . It noted that the inquiry had been unable to identify the person who had directed the applicant \u2019s wife to the paediatric unit and therefore no administrative sanction could be applied . The applicant did not appeal against the decision of ORG before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic legal provisions concerning the delivery of expert forensic medical reports and the authorities competent for issuing them , as well as the relevant domestic law and practice concerning the civil liability of doctors and hospitals for medical errors , are described in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
