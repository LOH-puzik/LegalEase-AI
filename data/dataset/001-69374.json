The applicant was born on DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The case concerns the applicant \u2019s repeated placement in a psychiatric institution , her stay in a hospital , her medical treatment and her various compensation claims .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is currently PERCENT disabled and receives an invalidity pension . She claims to be constantly suffering from significant pain , especially in her arms and legs and her vertebral column . She has spent DATE of her life in different psychiatric institutions and other hospitals .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE ( at which time the applicant was DATE ) , and from DATE to DATE ( when she was DATE ) , the applicant was placed in the children and young people \u2019s psychiatric department at GPE am ORG for DATE at her father \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . From DATE ( when she was DATE ) to DATE , she was placed in a locked ward ( geschlossene Station ) at a private psychiatric institution , the clinic of PERSON in GPE , at her father \u2019s request . There had been serious conflicts between the applicant and her parents , following which her father believed her to be suffering from a psychosis . The applicant \u2019s mother had suffered from a paranoid - hallucinatory psychosis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2013 who by that time had attained the age of majority \u2013 had not been placed under guardianship , had never signed a declaration that she had consented to her placement in the institution , and there had been no judicial decision authorising her detention in a psychiatric hospital . The private clinic of PERSON was not entitled to detain patients who were to be kept in accordance with LAW on the detention of mentally insane persons , mentally deficient persons and drug addicts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the police brought the applicant back to the clinic by force after she had attempted to escape .", "CARDINAL . During her forced stay at that clinic , the applicant was unable to maintain regular social contact with persons outside the clinic . When she was DATE , she had fallen ill with poliomyelitis , and following her medical treatment at the clinic she developed post - poliomyelitis syndrome .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was placed in a psychiatric hospital in PERSON . She claimed that she had by chance been saved from having to stay there any longer by a patient in the hospital who had given her accommodation .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE , she again received medical treatment at PERSON clinic , having at that time lost her ability to speak and , according to the doctors , showing signs of autism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received medical treatment at Dr PERSON PERSON \u2019s clinic for neurology and psychiatry .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the applicant received medical treatment ( station\u00e4re PERSON ) at ORG , a public - law institution , where she regained her ability to speak .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE , the applicant was treated in the orthopaedic department of a clinic in GPE am GPE and , from DATE , she was treated in the orthopaedic department of a clinic in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a professor of paedopsychiatry at ORG and a member of the federal government \u2019s investigating committee , prepared an expert report at the applicant \u2019s request . He indicated that the applicant had \u201c at no point in time suffered from a schizophrenia - type psychosis \u201d ( \u201c zu keinem GPE lag eine PERSON dem schizophrenen GPE \u201d ) and that her intemperate behaviour had resulted from conflicts with her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr K\u00f6ttgen , a psychiatrist , submitted a second expert opinion , again at the applicant \u2019s request . Confirming the findings of Dr Lempp , she considered that the applicant had never suffered from an early onset of schizophrenia , but that she had been in the midst of a puberty - related identity crisis ( PERSON ) at the relevant time . Because of the wrong diagnosis given at that time , she had for DATE received medication already known to have adverse side effects . As the applicant had had poliomyelitis , she would have had to be treated with the utmost caution . In that connection , the situation at PERSON clinic seemed to have been particularly serious : deprivation of liberty without a judicial decision , absence of a legal basis for the detention , excessive dosage of medication in order to question the applicant , and methods belonging to \u201c black pedagogy \u201d ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , on the basis of the expert report by PERSON , lodged an application for legal aid and an action for damages against PERSON clinic in ORG . She claimed , firstly , that her detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and from DATE to DATE had been illegal under NORP law . Furthermore , the medical treatment she had received had been contraindicated because of her poliomyelitis . She argued that her forcible detention and the medical treatment she had received had ruined both her physical and mental health .", "CARDINAL . It was only at that time , on DATE , that the applicant was given access to her medical file from PERSON clinic , despite her previous and repeated requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after a hearing , allowed the applicant \u2019s action for damages , as her detention had been illegal under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant , who had attained the age of majority , had not been placed under guardianship , and her detention had not been ordered by a district court as provided by LAW of DATE of ORG on the detention of mentally insane persons , mentally deficient persons and drug addicts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , such a detention would only have been legal if the applicant had given her consent , which had not been the case . Firstly , she had not signed the admission form filled in on DATE of her initial admission to the clinic . Secondly , she had not given her implicit consent ( konkludente PERSON ) to her placement and treatment at the clinic . The mere fact that on DATE of her initial admission she had come to the clinic , accompanied by her father , did not suffice to establish valid consent ( wirksame ORG ) . According to the private clinic \u2019s submissions , it could not be ruled out that , at that time , the applicant had not been in a position to realise the importance and the consequences of her detention ( \u201c es ist ... vielmehr nicht auszuschlie\u00dfen , da\u00df die Kl\u00e4gerin zum damaligen GPE die FAC GPE der Unterbringung nicht erkennen konnte \u201d ) . This was due , in particular , to the fact that the applicant had been given very strong medication from the time of her arrival .", "CARDINAL . On that point , ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c Even assuming the claimant \u2019s initial consent , it would have lapsed as a result of her undisputed attempts to escape and the need to shackle her . From these times at the latest , which have not been specified any further by the defendant , it would have been necessary to obtain a court order . \u201d", "( \u201c selbst wenn man doch PERSON anf\u00e4nglichen ORG der Kl\u00e4gerin ausgehen wollte , w\u00e4re PERSON unstreitig erfolgten Ausbruchsversuche der Kl\u00e4gerin und die erforderlich gewordenen Fesselungen hinf\u00e4llig geworden . PERSON , PERSON , w\u00e4re die PERSON . \u201d )", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , for the second period in which the applicant was placed in the psychiatric hospital ( from DATE to DATE ) , she had likewise not consented to her confinement , as she had shown signs of autism and had suffered from temporary loss of speech . Therefore , a court order would also have been necessary for this period .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was therefore entitled to damages in any event , ORG did not examine the question whether her medical treatment had been adequate or not .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the applicant \u2019s compensation claim was not time - barred . Under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the limitation period of DATE for tort claims ( unerlaubte GPE ) started running only when the victim had knowledge of the damage and of the person responsible for it . The court observed that a victim could only be perceived to have that knowledge when he was in a position to bring an action for damages that had sufficient prospects of success . Only from then on could he reasonably be expected to bring that action ( \u201c da\u00df ihm die Klage zuzumuten ist \u201d ) , regard being had in addition to his state of health . The court referred to the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) on the subject .", "CARDINAL . Even if the applicant might already have been conscious of the fact that she had been placed in the clinic against her will , it was established that during her long stays in the psychiatric hospital she had been forced to take very strong medication . When she had been released from the clinic , she had still received medical treatment , and she had always been regarded as mentally ill . The applicant had also suffered from serious physical disorders ( schwere k\u00f6rperliche Ausfallerscheinungen ) and had , in particular , subsequently lost the ability to speak for DATE ( from DATE to DATE ) . It was not until the end of this medical treatment and after the submission of PERSON expert report on DATE in which it had been concluded for the first time that she had never suffered from schizophrenia DATE that she had become sufficiently aware of her situation , of her possible right to damages , and of the possibility of bringing an action in court . Her application for legal aid , lodged on DATE , had interrupted the DATE limitation period . Her claim was therefore not time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an appeal by the clinic , quashed the judgment of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal disagreed with ORG finding that the applicant had illegally been deprived of her liberty during her stay and treatment at the clinic . It noted that ORG had not taken evidence on the issue in dispute . It found that the applicant had conceded in the appeal proceedings that she had to a certain extent voluntarily ( \u201c bedingt freiwillig \u201d ) consented to her stay in the clinic in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG left open the question whether the applicant had a compensation claim in tort ( Schadensersatzanspruch aus unerlaubter GPE ) on account of her unlawful deprivation of liberty or the damage caused to her body by her medical treatment . In any event , such a claim would be time - barred under LAW , which provided for a DATE time - limit . ORG considered that the applicant had always been conscious of the fact that she had purportedly been detained against her will , independently of the expert opinion submitted by PERSON . She had also been aware that she had allegedly been forced to take antipsychotic medication . Therefore , she had also been in a position to bring an action in court , despite her physical problems . According to the case - law of ORG , it sufficed to be aware of having suffered damage , without knowledge of the entirety of the damage being necessary .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that the applicant was likewise not entitled to bring a compensation claim on a contractual basis ( FAC aus PERSON ) following her medical treatment . According to ORG , the applicant had not sufficiently proved that she had expressly objected to her stay in the psychiatric hospital . Moreover , a contract between the applicant and the clinic concerning the applicant \u2019s medical treatment could also have been concluded implicitly ( konkludenter PERSON ) . It could not be assumed that this contract had been terminated by each of the applicant \u2019s attempts to escape , which were attributable to her illness ( \u201c LOC kann nicht angenommen werden , da\u00df dieser konkludent geschlossene QUANTITY krankheitsbedingten LOC worden ist \u201d ) . In fact , when the clinic prevented the applicant from escaping , it had complied with its duty of care ( PERSON ) . According to the expert opinion of PERSON , a psychiatrist appointed by ORG , the applicant had been seriously ill at that time and in need of medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . Irrespective of this , ORG pointed out that the clinic had disputed the applicant \u2019s assertion that she had been detained against her will , so that it remained uncertain whether this assertion was true ( \u201c so da\u00df offenbleibt , ob dieser Vortrag \u00fcberhaupt zutrifft \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Even if a contract concluded between the clinic and the applicant , who had at that time attained the age of majority , could not be presumed , there was in any event a contract between the clinic and the applicant \u2019s father , concluded implicitly for the applicant \u2019s benefit . This contract had run at least from DATE to DATE , when attempts had been made to place her in a different psychiatric institution .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG did not consider that the applicant \u2019s treatment had been erroneous , or that the dosage of her medication had been too high . It relied in this connection on the conclusive expert report by PERSON . In assessing the opinion expressed by the expert , who had submitted his report both in writing and orally during the hearing , the court thoroughly considered the partly different conclusions reached in the expert reports by PERSON and PERSON , which had been prepared at the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also brought an action for damages in the Mainz Regional Court against the doctors who had treated her at ORG and against the clinic itself . She claimed that she had been treated for psychosomatic symptoms , although she had in fact been suffering from post - poliomyelitis syndrome . As the applicant \u2019s medical file concerning her treatment at the clinic had temporarily disappeared , the clinic compiled a substitute file ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL pages , to which the applicant \u2019s lawyer was subsequently granted access .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that , according to the expert report by PERSON , chief physician of the neurology clinic at ORG , there had not been sufficient evidence that her post - poliomyelitis syndrome and her contemporaneous mental ailments had not been treated correctly .", "CARDINAL . During the appeal proceedings subsequently brought by the applicant in ORG , the original of the applicant \u2019s medical file was found , and the applicant \u2019s lawyer was granted access to it .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG confirmed its own judgment by default of DATE , given on account of the applicant \u2019s failure to attend the hearing ( FAC ) . It upheld the judgment of ORG . Relying on the expert report by PERSON and another two reports submitted by orthopaedic experts , the court found in particular that the applicant had neither intentionally nor negligently been given the wrong medical treatment . It stated that the fact that one of the expert reports had been drawn up with the aid of doctors assisting the court - appointed expert did not preclude its use in court . The court - appointed expert had taken full responsibility for the report and had been examined in person in court . Moreover , even assuming that there had been an error in treatment , the applicant , on whom the burden of proof fell in the matter , had not shown that there was a causal link between the error in treatment and the damage to her health . In particular , as there had not in any event been a serious error in treatment , it was not necessary , in accordance with the settled case - law of ORG , to apply a less strict rule on the burden of proof ( Beweiserleichterungen ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG against ORG judgment of DATE and against the judgments delivered by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL judges of ORG with jurisdiction to adjudicate on the applicant \u2019s case refused to grant her legal aid for her appeal on points of law against the judgments of the GPE and GPE courts . They argued that her appeal did not have sufficient prospects of success . On DATE the same CARDINAL judges of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgments of the GPE and GPE courts as inadmissible , the applicant not having submitted grounds for her appeal within the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgments delivered by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE . Quoting the relevant provisions of LAW , she claimed that her rights to liberty and human dignity and to a fair trial had been violated . She argued that her physical integrity had been infringed . She set out in detail the conditions of her stay in the various psychiatric institutions , the hearings in and the judgments delivered by the GPE courts and explained why she considered that her rights had not been respected .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgments delivered by ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE , and against ORG decision of DATE not to grant her legal aid . She claimed that her right to a fair trial had been violated and argued that she had been given the wrong medical treatment . She set out in detail how she had been treated at ORG , how the proceedings in the GPE and GPE courts had progressed and why she considered that her constitutional rights had thereby been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to allow the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaints . The court argued that the complaints were not of fundamental importance ( \u201c keine grunds\u00e4tzliche GPE ) , as the questions raised by them had already been resolved in its case - law . Furthermore , it was not the function of ORG to deal with errors of law allegedly committed by the competent civil courts . The applicant \u2019s complaints did not disclose a violation of her constitutional rights .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the applicant \u2019s first placement in the clinic in GPE , the rules governing the detention of individuals in a psychiatric hospital were notably laid down in GPE of DATE on the detention of mentally insane persons , mentally deficient persons and drug addicts ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act provided that it covered cases where confinement took place against the will or without the consent of the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . By LAW , a detention was legal if the person concerned , by his conduct towards himself or others , posed a serious threat to public safety or order that could not be otherwise averted .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of section CARDINAL of the LAW , the detention had to be ordered by the district court ( ORG ) on a written application by the competent administrative authority .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act provided that an application for the detention of an individual had to be accompanied by an expert report on the mental illness of the person concerned , submitted by the competent public health officer ( ORG ) or a specialist in mental illnesses . This report had to set out whether and to what extent the individual , by his conduct towards himself or others , posed a serious threat to public safety or order .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL of the LAW , the district court was obliged to assign counsel to the person concerned if this was necessary for the protection of his interests .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the court , in principle , had to question the person concerned before reaching its decision . A hearing in person was exceptionally considered unnecessary if it was likely to have negative effects on the state of health of the person concerned or if communication with him was not possible . In such cases , the court had to assign him a guardian ad litem ( Verfahrenspfleger ) , if he had not already been placed under guardianship .", "CARDINAL . An appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) lay against the district court \u2019s decision ordering the detention ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) . After a period of in principle DATE , the district court had to decide whether the detention was to be continued . The continuation of the detention could only be ordered on the basis of a new medical expert report ( sections CARDINAL and QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW on measures of aid and protection in cases of mental disorders ( PERSON \u00fcber PERSON bei psychischen GPE ) came into force . It replaced the provisions of LAW on the detention of mentally insane persons , mentally deficient persons and drug addicts of DATE with a view to securing ORG rights .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act , among other things , established a ORG . Without prior notice and at least once DATE , it visits psychiatric hospitals in which persons are detained following a court order in accordance with LAW . The task of ORG is , in particular , to check whether the rights of the persons so detained are respected , and to give patients the opportunity to raise complaints . DATE after the LAW came into force , ORG extended its visits to all psychiatric hospitals , whether or not the hospitals detained patients pursuant to a court order . These visits , which went beyond the strict wording of section CARDINAL of the said Act , were carried out with the consent of the institutions concerned .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of CARDINAL of ORG ) , in its version in force since DATE , private hospitals and private psychiatric institutions needed a licence issued by the competent ORG authority . The licence could notably be refused if there were facts raising doubts as to the reliability of the institution \u2019s management .", "CARDINAL . By LAW , a person who deprives another person of his liberty is to be punished by up to MONEY imprisonment or a fine . Paragraph CARDINAL of the same LAW provides that a person who deprives another person of his liberty for DATE or causes serious damage to the health of the victim by the detention itself or by an act committed during that detention is to be punished with a prison sentence of DATE . Under Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW , assault is punishable by up to DATE imprisonment or a fine . A person who unlawfully compels another through force to commit , acquiesce in or omit to carry out an act is punishable by up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment or a fine ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Compensation claims in tort are governed by LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of which provides that a person who intentionally or negligently causes bodily injury to , or damage to the health of , another person or deprives that person of his liberty , is liable to compensate the victim for the damage so caused . By Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the same obligation to compensate the victim rests with a person who intentionally or negligently violates a legal provision designed for the protection of others , such as ORG to CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .

According to LAW , in the version in force at the relevant time , compensation claims in tort are time - barred DATE after the date on which the victim learned of the damage and of the person liable to compensate him .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , there were no explicit provisions on contractual compensation claims in LAW in cases involving the defective performance of a contract ( positive Vertragsverletzung ) concluded by a doctor and his patient .
