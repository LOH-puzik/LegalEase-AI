In an order issued on DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office refused the application and sent it for review by the President of ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) .", "On DATE the investigating judge ( Haftrichter ) at that court declared that the application had become devoid of purpose as Mr R.M.D. had that day been transferred to the GPE of GPE and that there was accordingly no need to rule on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indeed transferred to PERSON . On DATE , the GPE district authority ordered that the applicant be detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG to be interviewed by the investigating judge . His counsel was informed of this in writing by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s counsel sought to challenge the decision to keep his client in detention at ORG . However , the ORG investigating judge informed him by telephone that he himself had not made any order for PERSON R.M.D. \u2019s continued detention pending trial as the order issued by the PERSON district authority on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was still valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the town of GPE , in order to be interviewed by an investigating judge in connection with a burglary committed in the canton of GPE .

On DATE ORG of Appeal struck out the appeal on the ground that it had become devoid of purpose because , as the applicant had been transferred on DATE to ORG and on DATE to ORG , the detention order made on DATE had lapsed ( dahingefallen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr R.M.D. \u2019s counsel lodged a public - law appeal with ORG against the judgment of ORG .", "He asked ORG to quash the judgment of ORG and to direct that court to rule on the merits and order his client \u2019s immediate release . In his submission , ORG refusal to consider the merits of the case had infringed the provisions of the GPE of Lucerne Code of Criminal Procedure , LAW and the LAW guaranteeing the applicant \u2019s right to be given a fair trial , to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed by a court and to be assisted by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s public - law appeal .", "It said , firstly , that the fact that ORG had not considered the merits of the case had not entailed an infringement of the provisions of the GPE of Lucerne Code of Criminal Procedure :", "\u201c The view can reasonably be maintained that ORG no longer needs to consider the merits of an appeal against a detention order if the detention in the GPE of GPE ends during the appeal proceedings , either because the accused has been released or because he is detained in another canton and the detention in the GPE of GPE accordingly lapses . ORG has proceeded in a similar manner : leaving aside exceptional cases , it will regard an appeal against detention as having become devoid of purpose and strike it out of its list if the applicant has been released during the ORG proceedings ... The justification it gives for this case - law is that in such a case there is no longer a live practical interest in securing a decision on the appeal against detention , even in respect of any claims for compensation and satisfaction ... These considerations are applicable also in relation to cantonal appeal proceedings . The applicant can still maintain in any subsequent compensation proceedings that he was unlawfully arrested in the GPE of GPE . \u201d", "With regard to the procedure for \u201c amalgamation \u201d ( ORG ) of the judicial investigations in respect of PERSON R.M.D. that had been launched in various cantons , ORG held that , in order to avoid any uncertainty about who had jurisdiction to order a person \u2019s detention at the beginning of an investigation , it was important to establish clearly whether and when detention in a given canton came to an end so as to enable the person detained to apply to the relevant cantonal court . For that reason it would have been preferable for ORG to have indicated in writing that the applicant \u2019s detention in the GPE of GPE had come to an end and that PERSON R.M.D. was thereafter subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities in GPE . However , that did not alter the fact that ORG had not in its judgment infringed either the provisions of the LAW relating to personal freedom or LAW , seeing that when the applicant had lodged his appeal he was no longer in detention in the GPE of GPE .", "Lastly , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW ( c ) of the LAW inadmissible because the question whether a lawyer had officially been assigned to represent him had not been raised in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first and second sub - paragraphs of LAW bis of LAW of ORG provide :", "\u201c The ORG shall have the right to legislate on criminal law .", "The organisation of the judiciary , court procedure and the administration of justice shall be matters for the cantons ... \u201d", "", "CARDINAL . Each canton consequently applies its own code of criminal procedure .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where an accused is prosecuted for several offences committed in different places , the authority of the place where the offence carrying the heaviest penalty has been committed shall also have jurisdiction to prosecute and try the other offences .", "If the different offences carry the same penalty , jurisdiction shall vest in the authority of the place where the first investigation was begun .", "CARDINAL . Where an accused , contrary to the rules governing multiple offences ( Article DATE ) , has been sentenced by several courts to several terms of imprisonment , the court which has sentenced him to the heaviest penalty shall , on an application by the convicted person , fix a consolidated sentence . \u201d", "\u201c If there is a dispute over jurisdiction between the authorities of several cantons , the ORG shall determine which GPE has the right and obligation to prosecute and try the accused . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
