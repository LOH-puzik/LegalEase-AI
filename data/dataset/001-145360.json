The applicant was born in DATE and lived in Split .", "CARDINAL . He was the owner of a flat in ORG with a surface area of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a certain PERSON was , on the basis of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , awarded the right to live in the flat and moved in together with her mother and her cousin NORP ( born in DATE ) whom her parents had entrusted to ORG care in DATE . This right was by the entry into force of LAW of DATE transformed into the specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo , see paragraphs DATE below about the specially protected tenancy in the former GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . P.A. and NORP lived together in the applicant \u2019s flat until GPE moved out in DATE . GPE continued to live there with her husband and her son , Ig . T. ( born in DATE ) . ORG husband died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG entered into force . It abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the holders of such tenancies in respect of , inter alia , privately owned flats were to become \u201c protected lessees \u201d ( za\u0161ti\u0107eni najmoprimci , see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . Under the Act such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures , such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration , payment of protected rent ( za\u0161ti\u0107ena najamnina ) , the amount of which is set by the Government and significantly lower than the market rent ; and better protection against termination of the lease .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant refused to conclude a lease contract with GPE stipulating the protected rent pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see CARDINAL below ) . On DATE I.T. brought a civil action against him in ORG ( PERSON ) , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , with a view to obtaining a judgment in lieu of such a contract .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards in DATE the applicant brought a civil action in the same court seeking to obtain a judgment ordering GPE and her son to vacate the flat in question . He argued that she had not been \u201c a child without parents \u201d and thus could not have been considered a member of DATE \u2019s household within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW or section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see respectively paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Consequently , she could not have taken over the specially protected tenancy after P.A. had moved out of the flat in DATE , and thus had not had any title to use it .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL proceedings were subsequently joined .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG found in favour of GPE and her son in part . It ordered the applicant to conclude with ORG a lease contract stipulating protected rent in the amount of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) \u2013 approximately DATE ( ORG ) at the time DATE within DATE ; otherwise the judgment would substitute such a contract . Since the existence of a specially protected tenancy was a necessary precondition for acquiring the status of a protected lessee under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the court had first to determine , as a preliminary issue , whether ORG had become the holder of the specially protected tenancy after P.A. had moved out of the flat in DATE . The court held that , unlike the subsequent legislation relied on by the applicant , the legislation in force at the material time , namely LAW of DATE , had not defined who could have been considered a member of the household of a holder of a specially protected tenancy ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Thus , given that GPE had been in foster care by DATE and lived with her in the flat in question , she could have been considered as a member of her household and therefore could , after P.A. had moved out of the flat in DATE , taken over the specially protected tenancy from her and become the holder thereof . Consequently , when in DATE FAC entered into force , GPE had , as the holder of the specially protected tenancy , become a protected lessee by the operation of law and was entitled to conclude a lease contract stipulating protected rent with the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . While the court ruled that GPE \u2019s son could be listed in the lease contract as a member of her household , it also held that her daughter - in - law and her grandson could not because they had not moved into the flat until after the entry into force of ORG , when specially protected tenancies could no longer be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG PERSON u GPE ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first - instance judgment , which thereby became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) alleging violations of his right to equality before the law , his right to a fair hearing and his right of ownership under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and served its decision on his representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the information submitted by the parties , the DATE protected rent for the applicant \u2019s flat changed as follows , in line with the increase in the construction price index ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) :", "CARDINAL . It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that the applicant refused to receive the protected rent for the flat and that NORP therefore had to deposit it with a court .", "CARDINAL . According to the parties the condominium fee paid into the common reserve fund ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by the owner of the flat \u2013 the applicant and later his heir \u2013 for maintenance etc . , was set at HRK CARDINAL on DATE and has not been changed since .", "CARDINAL . The Government also submitted information from the tax authorities according to which the applicant had never declared any income from renting out the flat .
