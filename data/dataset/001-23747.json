SPAIN [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON y NORP , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL in the Audiencia Nacional brought criminal proceedings against the applicant for endangering public health contrary to LAW as in force at the material time ( trafficking in MDMA , an amphetamine - type substance known as \u201c ecstasy \u201d , as distinct from ORG , known as the \u201c love drug \u201d ) . In a decision given on DATE , after he had completed the investigation , the judge committed the applicant and others for trial before the First Section of the Criminal Division of the Audiencia Nacional , which , in an order of DATE , set the case down for trial . After all the requests to adduce evidence submitted by the parties to the proceedings had been granted , the trial took place on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . The public prosecutor classified the offence with which the applicant was charged as repeatedly endangering public health , by means of a substance that was seriously damaging to health , acting as part of a gang ( ORG and CARDINAL bis of LAW ) . He sought an DATE custodial sentence and a fine of MONEY . The applicant submitted that the correct classification of the offence was that of endangering public health by means of a substance that was not seriously damaging to health ( LAW ) , which carried CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY . In the alternative , should the court accept the public prosecutor \u2019s submission that the substance was seriously damaging to health , the applicant argued that the applicable sentence would , in any event , be the same since it had to be acknowledged that there had been a reasonable mistake within the meaning of Article CARDINAL bis ( a ) of the Criminal Code regarding the harmfulness of the substance .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE , after a public hearing in the presence of both parties , the Audiencia Nacional declared it established that the applicant had been involved in trafficking in PERSON , an amphetamine - type substance listed in Table I of LAW in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances . The applicant was convicted of repeatedly trafficking in psychotropic substances not seriously damaging to health and sentenced to DATE imprisonment and a criminal fine of MONEY . He was also temporarily stripped of his civil and political rights . His conviction was based , inter alia , on witness statements , statements by his co - defendants , reports filed by experts instructed during the investigation into the narcotic substance that had been seized and on the fact that the authorities had seized large sums of money in proceeds from the trafficking . In its judgment the Audiencia Nacional stated that the fact that the drug had not been considered as seriously damaging to health made it unnecessary to examine whether there had been a reasonable mistake within the meaning of LAW a ) of LAW .", "The public prosecutor appealed to ORG on points of law against the judgment of ORG . He submitted that the substance in which the applicant had been trafficking was seriously damaging to health . The applicant lodged submissions under LAW to the effect that the appeal on points of law was inadmissible ( escrito de impugnaci\u00f3n ) . He set out detailed arguments disputing the public prosecutor \u2019s submissions and requested , in conclusion , that FAC judgment be upheld . He did not , however , repeat the ground of defence based on LAW that he had raised before FAC .", "ORG held a public hearing in the case on DATE .", "The applicant asserted that at that hearing he had reiterated his defence of reasonable mistake within the meaning of LAW a ) of LAW .", "According to the Government , there was nothing in the file to indicate that the applicant had made that submission at the hearing in question .", "The record of the hearing contains the following passage :", "\u201c The public prosecutor submitted his observations in support of his appeal and requested the court to give judgment allowing the appeal .", "... Defence counsel for PERSON [ the applicant ] disputed the appeal by the public prosecutor . ... \u201d", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal and quashed the judgment of FAC . It gave the following reasons for its judgment :", "\u201c ... Toxic doses of MDMA vary CARDINAL . The drug produces a number of concomitant effects : euphoria , heightened mood , self - confidence , empathy , and can provoke visual hallucinations . Doses of between CARDINAL and QUANTITY milligrams can have acutely toxic effects ... Similarly , doses of QUANTITY can provoke psychotic symptoms , and particularly panic attacks . Other complications can also occur in the event of a severe overdose : delirium , convulsions , secondary cerebral haemorrhaging on account of a rapid increase in blood pressure , muscle cramp , etc .", "Although the toxic capacity of ORG is less than that of ORG , deaths associated with the intake of this substance have been recorded , even if current thinking seriously questions whether ORG is directly responsible for the deaths . ...", "We can not accept the respondents\u2019 submission that this appeal goes against the facts declared to have been established . The question whether a toxic or narcotic drug or a psychotropic substance is seriously damaging to health is not a matter of fact , but requires an assessment and a reasoned judgment , which therefore lends itself , under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , to an appeal on points of law as a possible error of law regarding an essential element of the offence .", "Having regard to the foregoing , it has to be confirmed that ORG is a drug that is seriously damaging to health if consumed in doses of QUANTITY . Consequently , trafficking in this substance falls within the category of aggravating circumstances provided for in LAW . ... \u201d", "In a second judgment of DATE ORG , after endorsing the legal reasoning of the judgment of the Audiencia Nacional \u2013 except for the finding that the substance in question was not seriously damaging to health \u2013 found the applicant guilty of repeatedly endangering public health by means of substances seriously damaging to health ( ORG and CARDINAL bis ( a ) of LAW ) and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of DATE and DATE and to a fine of MONEY .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an amparo appeal against that judgment with ORG . He complained , firstly , of ORG failure to address the ground of defence based on LAW that he had raised before FAC and submitted to ORG at the public hearing . In his submission , when ORG upheld the appeal by the public prosecutor , finding that the aggravating circumstance of trafficking in a substance seriously damaging to health had been made out , it should have examined the ground of defence based on LAW . In the applicant \u2019s view , the lack of any reference by ORG to that ground of defence amounted to a failure to give reasons , in breach of LAW . The applicant also alleged that ORG retroactive application of its case - law classifying the drug as a substance seriously damaging to health had violated the principle enshrined in LAW that only a statute can define offences and lay down penalties . The applicant alleged further that there had been a violation of LAW ( principle of equality ) of LAW .", "On DATE ORG declared the amparo appeal admissible . DATE and DATE it carried out a number of procedural steps , with no interruptions .", "In the meantime , on DATE , it dismissed an application for a stay of execution of ORG judgment .", "Ruling on the merits in a judgment of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , it dismissed the amparo appeal as ill - founded . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had not addressed the ground based on LAW , ORG , after reiterating its case - law regarding lack of reasons , ruled as follows :", "\u201c ... In accordance with previous case - law , the admissibility of a complaint of lack of reasons is determined in accordance with CARDINAL main criteria : firstly , the issue must have actually been submitted , and secondly the court must have failed to give reasons for not addressing the submission . An examination of the procedure followed in the instant case shows that the appellant did submit ... to ORG of the Audiencia Nacional that the tribunal of fact should take into consideration his submission that he had lacked the mens rea for the offence if it agreed with the public prosecutor \u2019s classification of the offence and imposed the sentence corresponding to the aggravating circumstance under LAW . Clearly , once FAC had decided that \u2018 PERSON was not a substance deemed to be seriously damaging to health it did not need to address the issue of whether a mistake regarding one of the essential elements of the offence ( error de tipo ) had been made out , whether or not that submission had been made by the appellant . The appellant did not make that submission before ORG , however , despite his emphatic assertions to the contrary in his amparo appeal . His insistence might have misled the public prosecutor , who , in his observations on the amparo appeal , arrived at the mistaken conclusion that the appellant had made that submission before ORG and that the court had not dealt with it .", "It is sufficient to read the pleadings filed by the applicant with ORG , in which he submitted that the appeal on points of law was inadmissible , to see , beyond all possible doubt , that his counsel made no submissions concerning a possible mistake regarding one of the essential elements of the offence and that he did not request ORG ( of ORG ) to apply , if appropriate , Article CARDINAL bis ( a ) \u00a7 QUANTITY of LAW . The observations filed on behalf of the applicant were aimed exclusively at supporting the reasoning of the tribunal of fact \u2019s judgment and the experts\u2019 reports taken into account in assessing the nature and characteristics of the substance that had been seized , the tribunal of fact having found that it was the amphetamine MDMA and not ORG , whose effects are very different . Moreover , the record of the public hearing does not show that this ground of defence was even reiterated before ORG at that hearing .", "The issue of the importance that should be attached to the lack of explicit reasons by a court can not be resolved on the basis of a univocal criterion leading in every case to the conclusion that silence amounts to a violation of a fundamental right . It is always necessary to examine the circumstances surrounding the case in question . However , where the submission has not even been made in ORG despite the fact that it could have been , as was the case here ... , any misgivings as to a possible infringement by the judgment appealed against \u2013 on account of failure to give reasons \u2013 of the appellant \u2019s right to effective legal protection are completely dispelled . From a constitutional point of view , a court can not be criticised for having remained silent . There is no scope for examination by a Constitutional Court of a complaint of failure to address a question that has not been asked . \u201d", "Addressing the complaint of an alleged breach of the principle that only a statute can define offences and lay down penalties , ORG observed that a breach of that type occurred when a court \u2019s application of the law was so unreasonable as to be unforeseeable for persons subject to the jurisdiction of the courts , which had not been the case here . It was not difficult to see that the drug known to the man in the street as \u201c ecstasy \u201d was \u201c seriously damaging to health \u201d . The fact that at the material time ORG had not yet ruled on the appropriate classification did not mean that there had been a breach of the principle that only a statute can define offences and lay down penalties . In order to establish case - law authority on the subject , ORG had to be able to give a first ruling on the point .", "...", "\u201c Likewise , everyone has the right ... to a public trial without undue delays ... \u201d", "\u201c Losses incurred as a result of judicial errors or a malfunctioning of the administration of justice shall be compensated by the ORG , in accordance with the law . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Anyone who incurs loss as a result of a judicial error or a malfunctioning in the judicial system shall be compensated by the ORG , other than in cases of force majeure , in accordance with the provisions of this Part .", "CARDINAL .
