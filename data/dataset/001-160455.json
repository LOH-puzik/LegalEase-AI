THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Armen Harutyunyan;Kristina Pardalos;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and is currently detained at FAC in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG , a firm of lawyers based in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On TIME applicant attacked PERSON , stabbing him several times . He was charged with attempted murder and his trial took place in DATE in ORG before a jury . Before the trial commenced , the jury were shown a video about their role as jurors , setting out what they should and should not do . At the start of the trial , the judge reiterated the instructions given in the video and expressly instructed the jury members that they should not look up information relevant to the case on the Internet .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s defence at trial was that although he had intended to cause serious bodily injury to PERSON he had not intended to kill him . Whether he had intent to kill was therefore the only contested issue .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge \u2019s summing - up and directions to the jury set out in detail the factors that the jury was required to take into account when deciding whether the prosecution had proved that the wounding was done with intent to kill . The jury then retired to consider its verdict . No verdict was reached DATE and the jury was sent home for TIME .", "CARDINAL . The next morning the jury members sent the judge a note which read :", "\u201c Can the judge give the jury any guidance on the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether the defendant intended to murder PERSON with particular onus on the definition of intent ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . With the agreement of counsel for the prosecution and the defence , the judge gave the jury a written extract from the relevant section of her summing - up where she had discussed intent . The judge also read the passage out to the jury members . She gave additional details at some length as to the circumstances that needed to be considered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of attempted murder by a majority verdict of the jury ( CARDINAL jurors to CARDINAL ) . On DATE he was sentenced to indefinite imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , less time spent on remand .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG , who had been a juror at the trial , sent an email to ORG alleging a number of shortcomings in the conduct of his fellow jurors . In particular , he alleged that information had been obtained from the Internet by CARDINAL jurors and had been disclosed to fellow jurors . The trial judge informed counsel for the prosecution and the defence that allegations of jury irregularities had been made by a juror .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently sought leave to appeal his conviction and sentence , alleging that his trial was unfair on account of significant jury irregularities . On DATE ORG directed that ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) be asked to investigate the allegations .", "CARDINAL . The ORG interviewed the jurors in the case . ORG claimed that ORG , the foreman and a solicitor , had researched sentencing tariffs in similar cases and had shared the information he had discovered with his fellow jurors . In its report of CARDINAL DATE the ORG summarised statements from CARDINAL other jurors alleging that the jury foreman had looked up the definition of \u201c attempted murder \u201d , had looked at information concerning the question of intent and had looked up the sentencing guidelines for attempted murder . CARDINAL of the jurors had no recollection of the alleged improper conduct having taken place . None of the jurors supported the claim that CARDINAL further jurors had undertaken Internet research .", "CARDINAL . The ORG subsequently interviewed the jury foreman under caution . After receiving legal advice , the jury foreman gave a prepared statement and refused to answer questions . In his statement he confirmed that there had been some uncertainty as to the law on intent , for which further direction had been required from and provided by the trial judge ; and that the issue of possible sentences had arisen . The statement neither confirmed nor denied that the foreman had conducted Internet searches relating to the case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report noted that ORG \u2019s allegations in interview appeared to be not \u201c quite so stark \u201d as those made in his initial email . It further noted that there was no support for the majority of his allegations . However , it accepted that there was some corroboration for the more general allegations that the jury foreman had conducted case - related research on either the question of the differing elements of intent as between the offences under consideration , or the different sentences which might arise , and had provided information to his fellow jurors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal against conviction and refused leave to appeal against sentence .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment on the merits of the appeal against conviction , the court noted that the summing - up by the trial judge had been \u201c impeccable \u201d and had not been criticised by the applicant . The court referred to the jury \u2019s question during deliberations regarding the law on intent and noted that the trial judge \u2019s response was very thorough and that the jury could not have had any doubt as to the correct directions in law and the factors to which they were required to have regard .", "CARDINAL . The court agreed with the parties that it should proceed on the basis that an irregularity had occurred at trial . It considered that CARDINAL matters had to be examined : first , the information introduced to the jury in relation to the requirements to establish the intent to kill ; and second , the information introduced concerning applicable sentences .", "CARDINAL . As to the former , ORG considered it inconceivable that the jury members would have paid any attention whatsoever to what had been said by the foreman after the judge had handed them the answers to the questions they posed . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that it could not be presumed in his case that the jurors would follow directions . Had the judge not handed a direction to the jury , there might have been some doubt but considering the timing , the probabilities and the care with which the judge provided a written document to the jury , the court had no doubt whatever that the jury followed the direction of the judge and ignored what the foreman of the jury had said .", "CARDINAL . On the question of what was said regarding sentencing guidelines , ORG accepted that it should bear in mind the potential effect that a jury knowing the range of sentences could have on their attitude towards conviction . However , it continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . But we must look at the reality of this case . As we have explained , there was CARDINAL narrow issue before the jury , namely whether the ORG had proved , in addition to the intent to cause really serious bodily injury ... an intent to kill . It must have been obvious to the jury that the reason why the ORG was proceeding with the trial was that they did not consider that a plea to wounding with intent was sufficient to enable the judge to pass a severe enough sentence . It must have been obvious to the jury that by proceeding to seek a verdict on the count of attempted murder , the ORG were interested in establishing the more serious offence , so that the punishment could be the more serious . Thus , the fact that the foreman explained to the jury that sentences for attempted murder were more serious than for wounding with intent can not have any effect ...", "CARDINAL . It seems to us that it must have been obvious to the jury that they were tasked with deciding whether the ORG had proved the intent to kill , that if they did so the sentence would be more severe and therefore the introduction by the foreman of that further material can have had no material effect upon their decision to convict ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , the court dismissed the appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not ask ORG to certify a question of general public importance to enable him to apply for leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant provided a copy of counsel \u2019s advice dated DATE . The advice explained :", "\u201c At the hearing of the appeal it was accepted ... that extraneous material had been introduced into the jury \u2019s deliberations , and that the material related at least in part to the ingredients of the offence of attempted murder . There was no dispute as to the relevant law . It was accepted that the introduction of such material prima facie constituted a material irregularity in the trial process . The issue to be determined on appeal was whether that irregularity affected the safety of the appellant \u2019s conviction .", "Following full argument , [ ORG ] expressed the opinion that the appeal concerned the fact - specific issue of considering whether , in the light of the admitted irregularities , the appellant \u2019s conviction was safe ...", "The issue at appeal ... was wholly fact - specific ... As there was no dispute between the parties on any point of law it was not possible to request a certification of a point of law of general public importance , and I regret to inform PERSON that there are no further domestic avenues of appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Upon responding to a summons , jury members are sent a leaflet called \u201c Your Guide to Jury Service \u201d . The leaflet explains that ORG discussions are private and that jurors should not discuss any aspects of the trial with anyone other than fellow jurors . It sets out that the verdict must be that of the jurors alone and reminds jurors that their role is to reach a verdict on the evidence presented in the court room at trial . The leaflet also notes that it is an offence for anyone outside the jury to try and influence them .", "CARDINAL . Once selected for jury duty , jurors must swear an oath or affirmation that they will :", "\u201c faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the outset of the trial , the jury are conventionally given a direction to the effect that they must try the case on the evidence alone , which is what they hear in court . They are instructed that they must not discuss the case with family , friends or anyone else or conduct their own research into the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is set out in the Contempt of Court Act DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW states that it is a contempt of court to obtain , disclose or solicit any particulars of any statements made , opinions expressed , arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALA of LAW DATE enables ORG to direct the ORG , in the context of an appeal against conviction , to investigate and report to the court on any matter deemed relevant to the resolution of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v PERSON and others [ DATE ] PERSON CARDINAL , ORG , addressing the matter of jury irregularities , explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Much more difficult problems arise when after the verdict has been returned , attention is drawn to alleged irregularities . This may take the form of a complaint from a defendant , or his solicitors , or in a very few cases it may emerge from CARDINAL or more jurors , or indeed from information revealed by the jury bailiff . It is then beyond the jurisdiction of the trial judge to intervene . Responsibility for investigating any irregularity must be assumed by this court . In performing its responsibilities , it is bound to apply the principle that the deliberations of the jury are confidential . Except with the authority of the trial judge during the trial , or this court after the verdict , inquiries into jury deliberations are \u201c forbidden territory \u201d ... If any complaint about jury deliberations is received by the trial court after verdict it is immediately referred to this court and whether the complaint has been received from the court of trial or by this court directly , the practice is to examine each case to see whether or not , exceptionally , further inquiries ought to be made , and if so , to invite the assistance of ORG to conduct the necessary inquiry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court confirmed that the rule that jury deliberations were confidential was subject to CARDINAL narrow exceptions . The first arose if it emerged that there might have been a complete repudiation of the oath taken by the jurors to try the case according to the evidence ( for example , a decision arrived at by the toss of a coin ) . The second exception arose in cases where extraneous material had been introduced into the jury deliberations . Where the complaint was made that the jury had considered non - evidential material , the court was entitled to examine the evidence ( possibly after investigation by the ORG ) to ascertain the facts .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( as amended ) provides that a person convicted of an offence on indictment may appeal to ORG against his conviction . An appeal can only proceed with the leave of ORG or if the judge of the court of trial grants a certificate that the case is fit for appeal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW provides that ORG :", "\u201c ( a ) shall allow an appeal against conviction if they think that the conviction is unsafe ; and", "( b ) shall dismiss such an appeal in any other case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a defendant has the right to appeal to ORG against a decision of ORG ) . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) clarifies that the leave of ORG or ORG is required and that leave will not be granted unless it is certified by ORG that a point of law of general public importance is involved in the decision and it appears to ORG or ORG ( as the case may be ) that the point is one which ought to be considered by the latter court .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) incorporates the LAW into GPE law . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with Convention rights may rely on the LAW right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
