Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of an armed robbery in the province of GPE , CARDINAL masked criminals killed CARDINAL person and seriously injured another ; they then fled in a car driven by an accomplice .", "Among the suspects , who were swiftly identified , was the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Mr F.C.B. was arrested in GPE on DATE and extradited to GPE on DATE . He was charged with armed robbery , murder and attempted murder , these crimes being aggravated by the fact that he had committed them while wilfully evading arrest under other warrants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found him and his CARDINAL co - defendants guilty and sentenced him inter alia to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and CARDINAL others who had been found guilty appealed , and on DATE ORG of Appeal acquitted them for lack of evidence . PERSON was released on DATE ; in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he indicated his address .", "CARDINAL . ORG and CARDINAL other parties , including the applicant , appealed on points of law . The prosecution \u2019s notice of appeal was served on Mr F.C.B. personally on DATE at the address he had given , which was also that of his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , allowed the prosecution \u2019s appeal , and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr F.C.B. had in the meantime entered GPE on DATE . He settled at PERSON and was granted a residence permit there on CARDINAL DATE . He claims that he informed ORG in GPE of his new address , in order for it to be notified to the NORP authorities for \" entry in the civil status register \" . He did not , however , send the authorities an amended version of his declaration of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested in GPE on DATE under a warrant issued in the GPE in connection with proceedings relating to the abduction of a GPE woman .", "According to PERSON , after he had been extradited to the GPE the NORP authorities obtained a copy of his criminal record ; furthermore , the judge in charge of the case arranged for his NORP colleagues in GPE and GPE to co - operate in investigations in GPE and asked ORG to have searches of the dwellings of the applicant , his sister and his sister - in - law carried out . The Government did not contest this point , merely stating that they had no detailed information about it .", "Mr F.C.B. maintained that he was held in solitary confinement from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when his conviction by the \u2018 s - ORG became final , and was thus subject to certain restrictions - which were , however , eventually relaxed - on correspondence , visits and contacts with other detainees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG attempted to serve a summons to appear before that court on the applicant at the address given by him on his release , but neither the applicant nor his mother lived there any more .", "On DATE the summons was delivered to PERSON mother , whose new address had been found out in the meantime . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had also been informed on DATE of the hearing date .", "CARDINAL . The trial opened on DATE in Mr F.C.B. \u2019s absence . His counsel informed the court that , according to close relatives of his client , the latter was in custody in GPE ; he added , however , that he was unable to produce documentary evidence to this effect . The prosecution submitted that there was no objective evidence to show that Mr F.C.B. was in custody and invited the court to try him in absentia as unlawfully absent ( contumace ) . The court decided to do this , but counsel for CARDINAL of the co - defendants asked it to verify the information that Mr F.C.B. was unable to attend the trial , as the applicant \u2019s presence could prove to be of importance for his client . That client and another co - defendant confirmed that Mr F.C.B. was in prison in the GPE ; the one had learnt of it from the newspapers and the other had received a letter from the applicant sent from GPE prison .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution for their part repeated their submissions . After deliberating in private , ORG confirmed its declaration that PERSON was unlawfully absent , as he had not provided proof that he was unable to attend , despite having been notified in good time of the start of the trial .", "On DATE the court sentenced him to PERCENT four years\u2019 imprisonment and issued a warrant for his arrest .", "CARDINAL .

Translations were given to the court on DATE", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed on points of law to ORG ; his grounds of appeal were filed in DATE . He submitted that ORG had been wrong in declaring PERSON unlawfully absent and questioned the correctness in law of the judgment . On the first point he argued that the decision itself and the subsequent proceedings were null and void , as it had been impossible for his client to attend the hearing . He said that it was only out of excessive regard for formal propriety that ORG had declined to rule that the applicant was unable to appear , notwithstanding several concurring statements testifying to the fact .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "It found , firstly , that the appeal court had been right to try Mr F.C.B. as unlawfully absent , as there was no proof that he was unable to attend . The documents produced on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been offered in evidence only after judgment had been given and therefore had no probative value . With greater diligence the defence could have produced them before the hearing . It could be seen from the statement of appeal that the applicant would have had time to do this , as he had been in custody in the GPE well before the summons to appear was served . ORG held that it was for ORG to assess the alleged inability to attend , and that that court had given proper reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities had requested PERSON extradition for the purposes of the judicial investigation concerning him . On DATE , however , ORG dismissed the request as inadmissible , on the grounds that ORG had already given a judgment on the merits on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court added that it would consider the matter again in the event of the judicial investigation being reopened as a result of a retrial being ordered by ORG or for some other reason .", "CARDINAL . The GPE agreed to extradite PERSON to GPE and he is currently in custody there .", "According to the information given to the ORG by counsel for the applicant , the applicant will have to return to the GPE to serve DATE imprisonment there , and if the NORP authorities succeed in obtaining his extradition , he will then serve in GPE DATE and DATE of the prison sentence imposed by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
