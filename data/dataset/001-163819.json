From the documents submitted it follows that DATE the investigation was suspended and resumed on several occasions . The last resumption of the investigation took place on DATE . The proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that ORG agents were responsible for PERSON PERSON disappearance . They stressed that the authorities had suspected him of membership of illegal armed groups and , therefore , had motives for his abduction . The abductors had used Priora cars with heavily tinted windows ; only law - enforcement agencies could use such vehicles . Moreover , after the abduction the perperators had passed through a permanent road traffic police checkpoint . The applicants referred to statements of local residents who had not witnessed the abduction but had seen vehicles similar to those of the abductors driving to that police station . Lastly , the applicants referred to a number of cases of abduction perpetrated in ORG in which some of the abducted persons had been later found in ORG custody .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 relative Mr PERSON had been abducted by unidentified men or could have staged his own abduction . The only witness to the events was Mr PERSON son GPE , who was a minor , and the other persons , including the applicants , learnt of the events from him . In such circumstances the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning involvement of ORG agents in the incident were groundless .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction the Government produced the relevant documents from the file ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has already found the NORP authorities responsible for disappearances of civilians perpetrated in PERSON ( see , for example , GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . In doing so , it has taken into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of security or law - enforcement personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time . It has relied on witness accounts and other information on security operations .", "CARDINAL . However , in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred can not warrant an unequivocal conclusion that ORG agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative for the following reasons . As regards the general background , the events complained of took place in DATE and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving in civilian vehicles . Furthermore , from the documents submitted it appears that the applicants\u2019 version of the events was based on the statements of the only witness , Mr PERSON son , who according to his own statement had been scared during the incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and of persons who had not witnessed the actual abduction and whose statements were not included in the investigation file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In addition , the ORG notes that the first applicant stated to the investigation that Mr PERSON had received threats but did not specify whom she had suspected or the nature of the threats received ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In such a situation the ORG has little evidence on which to draw such conclusions as the factual circumstances of the incident as presented by the applicants do not include any evidence corroborating their account to a decisive extent .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the information in the ORG \u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation was carried out in respect of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , it has not been established to the required standard of proof that ORG agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr PERSON ; nor does the ORG consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the ORG , having regard , in particular , to the fact that they submitted a copy of the relevant documents from the investigation file as requested by the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
