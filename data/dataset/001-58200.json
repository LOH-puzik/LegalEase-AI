The applicant , PERSON , a NORP citizen of NORP origin , was born in DATE and lives at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The application was brought on behalf of the applicant himself , his deceased sister , PERSON , and her young daughter . It concerns complaints relating to an incident on DATE in which PERSON was killed .", "The village in which the events took place has CARDINAL names : an old NORP name of Gisgis and an official NORP name of PERSON . The latter name has been used below .", "CARDINAL . The facts in this case are disputed .", "CARDINAL . DATE before the incident on DATE in the applicant \u2019s village of PERSON , PERSON , CARDINAL of CARDINAL \u201c collaborators \u201d in the village had been killed by the ORG ( ORG of GPE ) . DATE before the incident , PERSON , the other \u201c collaborator \u201d had moved , under the protection of Ziyaret village guards and apparently with the assistance of gendarmes , from the applicant \u2019s village to Ziyaret , a village QUANTITY away . A \u201c collaborator \u201d is described by the applicant as someone spying for the ORG as distinct from members of the village guards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the security forces set up an ambush in the vicinity of the village purportedly to capture members of the ORG . They consisted , inter alia , of a commando unit and village guards from Ziyaret . Security forces were located in or near a cemetery QUANTITY northwest and south of the village near the asphalt road . The security forces opened fire . The shooting lasted for TIME and consisted of indiscriminate bombardment of civilian houses . It led to the death of the applicant \u2019s sister , PERSON . No members of the NORP were killed or captured .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s house was in the middle of the village . At the time of the incident , his father and his sister PERSON were sleeping on the balcony , on the upper part of the house . As soon as the firing started , PERSON and his father took shelter inside the house , but PERSON went out on the veranda to collect something . She was hit in the head by a bullet when she was on the threshold and died immediately .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , the applicant \u2019s uncle PERSON informed the PERSON gendarmerie commander , possibly by telephone , that the applicant \u2019s sister had been killed . The commander was surprised to learn that CARDINAL person had died and stated that he expected CARDINAL people to have died . The applicant \u2019s uncle told the commander that he would apply to the public prosecutor . However , the commander told him to go home and said that he would himself inform the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Towards TIME , the public prosecutor , a doctor and some soldiers came to the applicant \u2019s house and an autopsy was carried out . While the autopsy was being undertaken inside the applicant \u2019s house , the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON , asked the soldiers why his family were being persecuted in this way . A non - commissioned officer replied that , if the villagers accepted to become village guards , the persecution would stop and the reason why they shot at the village was that they saw terrorists at its entrance and that the indiscriminate firing at the entire village was to be explained by the clumsiness of the troops . The doctor , after completing the autopsy , said nothing except to present his condolences . He also issued a burial certificate . The applicant and his family were not asked by the public prosecutor about their version of the circumstances of the shooting . The gendarmerie officer PERSON , drew up the incident report without interviewing or seeking any statements from the villagers or members of the commando unit involved . No cartridges were found by the gendarmes in the area in which the ORG were said to be located during the incident . There is no evidence that the ORG were in fact present in the vicinity during the incident .", "CARDINAL . The bullet which killed the applicant \u2019s sister was described in the ballistics report as a standard NATO CARDINAL.CARDINAL which was used by the NORP security forces as well as by many other forces . The shot could not have been fired from the east since it would have been blocked by the walls of the houses . It could only have been fired from the south or south - east from higher ground , which was where the security forces were stationed on a hillside .", "CARDINAL . There had been no communication between the public prosecutor and the family since DATE of the autopsy . He and his family remained in the dark as to the official view of the incident and did not know whether there had been any investigation or prosecution in respect of the shooting . He stated that the village of CARDINAL households had now been reduced to CARDINAL families , the rest having abandoned their homes as a result of military incidents such as the CARDINAL which led to his sister \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . The security forces carried out an ambush operation in the vicinity of the village to catch the ORG members who were active in the area . Units were concealed in the north - west and engaged in an armed clash with the ORG at a point to the south - east of the village , near the cemetery . Their position was QUANTITY above the ORG . There were no units positioned to the south and there would have been no point in having men there since the ORG would not come from the south . The security forces could not therefore have fired the shot from the south which killed the applicant \u2019s sister .", "CARDINAL . During the clash , only a few houses were slightly damaged , which does not support the allegations of prolonged , indiscriminate firing by the security forces .", "CARDINAL . A preliminary investigation into the incident was opened by the public prosecutor of the NORP district . An autopsy was carried out on the applicant \u2019s sister on DATE in his father \u2019s house . According to the medical examiner \u2019s report of that date , an external examination disclosed a bullet wound to the head , probably an entry wound . The skull was opened and a QUANTITY bullet found in the right parietal lobe and removed . Time of death was estimated at TIME prior to the examination .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE addressed to the NORP public prosecutor , gendarmerie major PERSON reported that the security forces had carried out an ambush at the entrance of PERSON village . The security forces opened fire on terrorists , who fled towards the northerly part of the village and a search party was sent in that direction without making PERSON any contact . He stated that it was reported that a telephone call had been made to the district gendarmerie headquarters at Ergani at TIME on DATE , informing the latter that PERSON had been killed in the clash . An investigation took place at TIME DATE in the presence of the public prosecutor . Copies of the incident report and a sketch of the location were enclosed with the letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the NORP public prosecutor , PERSON , considering that the matter lay outside his jurisdiction , transferred the file to the relevant public prosecutor attached to ORG where the matter is still pending . The decision of lack of jurisdiction named the defendants as \u201c members of the illegal ORG organisation \u201d and the offence as engaging in armed combat with the security forces and homicide . It indicated that PERSON had died as a result of gunfire occurring in the course of an armed clash which broke out between members of the security forces who were carrying out an ambush operation on the outskirts of PERSON village and members of the ORG who were approaching the village .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the regional criminal police laboratory issued its expert ballistics report . It found that the bullet was CARDINAL PERSON calibre and fired by a weapon with a barrel containing CARDINAL ridges which rotated clockwise .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE from ORG at ORG to ORG , it was reported that during the ambush operation clashes spread to the village and as a result a bullet hit the doorframe of a house , ricocheted and hit PERSON who was standing near the door . The investigations into her death were still under way . A ballistics examination revealed that the bullet was misshapen and no material information could be obtained which could lead to a conclusion as to the weapon used . No empty cartridges were found at the scene . Thus , there was no information in the file on the weapon which had caused the death . Since the fighting started at TIME and continued into TIME , there was no eyewitness evidence as to what was seen or heard . Proceedings were continuing with a view to apprehending the members of the ORG involved in the armed clash but since they did not return to the scenes of clashes for a long time it would take time to identify and arrest them . As regards the allegations made in the applicant \u2019s statement of CARDINAL DATE taken by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the claim that the security forces opened harassing fire on the village was false and was intended to denigrate the security forces involved in the fight against terrorism . It was the duty of security forces to maintain order and protect the population so there could be no question of them opening harassing fire on the village . The incident in PERSON resulted from the type of ambush operation commonly carried out by the security forces on roads leading into and out of villages .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE , ORG informed ORG that on DATE the security forces had come to the village with the purpose of apprehending terrorists whom they had heard were coming to the village . The security forces were attacked by the ORG . Village guards from Ziyaret were not involved in the operation . No raid was carried out on the village which was due to have village guards of its own . Although villagers had applied for posts as village guards they had not in fact been recruited since no suitable posts were available . At the time of the incident there were CARDINAL households , not CARDINAL as alleged by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and currently there were CARDINAL households living there , not CARDINAL , as alleged by the applicant ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the facts of the case are disputed , particularly concerning the events in or around DATE , the ORG conducted an investigation , with the assistance of the parties , and accepted documentary evidence , including written statements , and oral evidence taken from CARDINAL witnesses by CARDINAL delegates at a hearing in GPE on CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards written evidence , the ORG had particular regard to a statement by the applicant dated DATE taken by the ORG in ORG , and an incident report of DATE , drawn up by ORG , commander of the NORP central gendarmerie , and signed by other gendarmes . The report concluded that PERSON must have been killed accidentally as a result of shots fired by members of the ORG in the course of clashes with members of the security forces . Furthermore , the Commission had regard to a sketch map of the incident location dated DATE , drawn up and signed by ORG . It indicated , inter alia by numbers , the location of the deceased \u2019s body , the ORG firing position ( no . CARDINAL ) , the security forces\u2019 firing position ( no . CARDINAL ) , the road and the village slopes .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the Commission had regard to CARDINAL statements dated respectively CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "The first statement , signed by the applicant and by officers of the anti - terrorism department , was set out in the form of questions and answers . The applicant was referred to his declaration of means and confirmed his signature . He was asked whether he had made an application to the NORP human rights association or in GPE and if so , to provide further explanations . He stated that he had applied to the ORG regarding his sister , that he had not applied to ORG and that he had applied to ORG indirectly through the ORG . He gave details of his finacial position .", "The second , signed by the applicant and by a public prosecutor , indicated that the applicant had been shown his declaration of means and that he confirmed that it looked like his . He had explained that he had made an application in DATE to the ORG and to ORG . His application had not concerned anything else and he had not wished to add anything .", "CARDINAL . The oral evidence included statements by the applicant himself , PERSON ( gendarmerie commander in the district of Ergani ) , ORG and PERSON ( NORP public prosecutor ) . The following witnesses had also been summoned but they did not appear : PERSON ( ORG at ORG , ORG ) , PERSON PERSON ( muhtar ) , PERSON ( father of PERSON ) , PERSON ORG ( brother of PERSON ) , PERSON ( uncle of PERSON ) and PERSON ( mother of PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The verbatim record of the hearing held on CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE contained the following passages of relevance to the ORG \u2019s preliminary objection as to the validity of the application ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) :", "\u201c Mr G\u00dcND\u00dcZ : We have your petition before us . It bears your signature . Muharrem Ergi , is n\u2019t it :", "Mr Muharrem PERSON : Yes .", "Mr G\u00dcND\u00dcZ : PERSON , do you know about the application that was written later on your behalf ? Did you see the application that was submitted to ORG ?", "Mr Muharrem PERSON : Yes .", "Mr G\u00dcND\u00dcZ : Certainly you do n\u2019t speak LANGUAGE , do you ?", "Mr Muharrem PERSON : No , not much .", "Mr G\u00dcND\u00dcZ : Again there is a mistake . You are referred to as a woman . Of course , the name ORG is not so usual and that is why . This is your signature . You said , \u2018 We went together with my father and mother\u2019 , did n\u2019t you ?", "Mr Muharrem PERSON : Yes . \u201d", "PERSON had stated to the delegates that he had been convinced that the incident report had been accurate in concluding that the ORG had been responsible and that no other allegation to the contrary had been made . There had been no reason to think that the record drawn up by the security forces had not been accurate . If an allegation had been made that PERSON PERSON had been killed by gunfire from the security forces , he would have been obliged to go to the village . He believed that he would have received a complaint if the security forces had been responsible .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the oral evidence , the ORG had been aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters . It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before its delegates .", "In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events , the Commission particularly regretted the absence of a thorough domestic judicial examination or other independent investigation of the events in question . It was aware of its own limitations as a first - instance tribunal of fact . In addition to the problems of language adverted to above there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region . Moreover , the Commission had no power to compel witnesses to appear and testify . In the present case , while CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned to appear , CARDINAL in fact had given evidence before the ORG \u2019s delegates . Significantly , CARDINAL of CARDINAL public prosecutors who were summoned had appeared and , despite repeated requests by ORG , the Government had not identified any officers who had participated in the operation for the purpose of giving evidence before its delegates . The Government also had not provided complete documentary materials relating to the operation . ORG had therefore been faced with the difficult task of determining events in the absence of potentially significant testimony and evidence .", "The Commission \u2019s findings can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Kesenta\u015f village was located on a slope , the northern part higher than the southern , with steep mountains behind to the north . There were LOC around the village ; a road running east - west through the village which continues north - east between the mountains ; a wider main road to the south of the village running roughly east - west and to the south of this road the ground slopes upwards again . The village accordingly lay in a depression . The terrain to the north was rough and steep , with a river bed running down to the village from a north / north - eastern direction .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found from the evidence of the witnesses that ORG activity in the area around the village in or DATE had been significant . There had been CARDINAL incidents involving the village shortly before the operation on DATE . In CARDINAL incident , a villager , PERSON , had been shot dead and in the other , another villager , PERSON , and his father had left the village under gendarmerie protection after his house had been shot at and moved to Ziyaret where they joined the village guards . PERSON had been in the mountains with the ORG and had returned of his own free will . The timing of the latter incident had not been established . The applicant \u2019s written statement to the ORG referred to the move from the village taking place DATE before the incident , whereas it had appeared from the applicant \u2019s oral testimony that he had been absent from the village and he had had no real recollection of what he might have been told by others . Major PERSON , who had remembered helping the family move , did not specify the date .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had tended to arrive from the north of the village under cover of the terrain , requiring the villagers to provide food and medicine . There had been no village guards in the village and no permanent security presence in the vicinity . The main road to the south of the village had been patrolled from time to time .", "CARDINAL . At PERSON , QUANTITY to the east , there was a central gendarmerie headquarters under the command of ORG , a non - commissioned officer ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . There was also a district gendarmerie headquarters , under the command of Major PERSON , and a separate commando unit . Major PERSON was in overall command of the district and central gendarmerie and had frequently been absent in his additional capacity as commander of a commando unit which had often been in the field .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that there had been no detailed investigation or judicial finding of facts on the domestic level as regards the events which occurred in the village of PERSON on DATE . ORG had accordingly based its findings on the evidence given orally before its delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings ; in this assessment the co - existence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact and in addition the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account ( see , mutatis mutandis , the GPE v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the CARDINAL gendarmes had stated in evidence that they had not in fact been at the village when the clash had occurred . Major PERSON had stated that he was in an operation elsewhere", "with commandos . ORG had arrived after the firing had stopped and , although he followed in the direction of the allegedly fleeing ORG , he had seen no sign of them . ORG had requested the Government on CARDINAL occasions prior to the hearing in GPE to identify , for the purpose of taking evidence , gendarmerie officers who had been present during the operation . The Government had not responded . The Commission recalled that the applicant had not been in the village either and his testimony concerning the events of that night had been based on what he had remembered being told by members of his family or villagers . Members of the applicant \u2019s family present during the clash had not appeared as witnesses although summoned by the delegates . There had therefore been no direct eyewitness evidence before the Commission as to what had occurred , which was regrettable .", "CARDINAL . Further , the documentary evidence had also been of second - hand quality . The incident report and sketch had been drawn up by PERSON , not by any gendarmerie officer involved in the operation and , from ORG testimony before the delegates , it is not apparent that he questioned the security forces on the spot in any detail . Indeed his contact with them appeared to have been limited to radio contact , by way of coded transmissions . The Government had failed to comply with the ORG \u2019s request to be informed of the name and of the unit of the commanding officer of the unit involved in the operation and to be provided with the copy of the logbook entry , register or field report which recorded the operation .", "CARDINAL . The Commission accordingly had little direct evidence as to what had occurred on TIME . As to whether a clash had in fact taken place , the Commission noted that it had been alleged by the applicant that an indiscriminate bombardment of the village had been carried out in retaliation for the incidents in the village in which \u201c collaborators \u201d were , in CARDINAL case , shot and , in the other , forced to leave . The Commission recalled that Major PERSON had been directly involved in the move of the threatened villager and that he did not consider that the ORG had shot at the villager , but that it had been the other villagers who would have killed him as they wanted to know why he had left the organisation . ORG commented that a great many people in the village had joined the organisation . The applicant \u2019s allegation that the bombardment of the village could have been motivated by a desire to teach the village a lesson was not totally without substance .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted several puzzling features . Major PERSON had been the district gendarmerie commander but had had no apparent knowledge of , or role in , an operation within his jurisdiction , though he had felt able to give firm opinions as to what must have occurred . TIME the", "incident occurred , PERSON of the central gendarmerie had had to borrow an armoured personnel carrier from the police because those belonging to the gendarmerie were being used in a mission . ORG had stated that the firing at the village had only lasted TIME whereas the letter from the public prosecutor at ORG dated DATE referred to fighting that had started at TIME and continued into TIME , which appeared to corroborate the applicant \u2019s version of events , derived from his family , that the firing had continued for TIME . The applicant had stated that , as might be expected from sustained shooting , there was widespread damage to the village . He had gone round the village , noting damage to CARDINAL houses and had taken a few photographs which indeed revealed bullet marks on CARDINAL houses . PERSON who had also been in the village DATE had stated that there was damage CARDINAL or three houses and to a car , from at most CARDINAL bullets . This is another area which could have been elucidated by further information provided by the Government . PERSON stated that photographs of the village had been taken by the public prosecutor . These had not been provided by the ORG , which had stated that no photographs had been taken .", "CARDINAL . As regards the details of the clash which had been given , the ORG was again hampered by a lack of direct information . It had initially been provided with a blurred copy of the sketch map by ORG with the bottom section omitted . This copy showed a key indicating the positions of the terrorists ( no . CARDINAL ) and the security forces ( no . CARDINAL ) . A no . CARDINAL had clearly appeared to the east of the village . A no . CARDINAL had appeared to the north - west . There had also been a squiggle in the south not dissimilar to that portraying the security forces\u2019 position to the north - west and which contained a blurred figure . This figure had seemed to be a CARDINAL . ORG when questioned stated that the terrorists were to the south and indicated on the sketch that they would have been close to the position marked with the blurred figure . If the blurred figure had been a CARDINAL , this had been a mistake . Major PERSON had also been adamant that there would be no security forces in the south . In brief , there would be no point : the terrain had not been favourable and they had known the ORG would come from the north and would flee in that direction . Since Major PERSON had not been present during the clash , on his own testimony , the ORG felt unable to give his evidence much weight . ORG had based his sketch on what he had heard from the units involved DATE apparently a brief radio contact . It was strange that at the time he appeared to have marked the security forces as having been present in the south yet was now certain that this must have been a mistake . DATE after the hearing of the witnesses , ORG was provided with a clearer copy of the sketch map in which the blurred figure to the south of the village had , identifiably , been a CARDINAL , which represented the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The Commission agreed with the submissions of the applicant that , given the south - facing position of the balcony and the position of the neighbouring houses , in particular a high wall to the east , it was probable that the bullet which killed PERSON was fired from the south or south - east . The Government had not contested this .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the failure of the Government to provide the documents and information referred to above , the ORG found that strong inferences could be drawn supporting the applicant \u2019s allegations that the security forces had opened fire around the village for some time and that units of the security forces had been present towards the south . There was nonetheless insufficient material before the ORG to support a finding that the operation of DATE had not been an ambush which led to a clash as alleged but a mission of retaliatory punishment . The Commission was unable to find it established that the bullet which had killed PERSON had been fired by the security forces . It did find however that there was significant evidence indicating that it may have been .", "CARDINAL . The death of the applicant \u2019s sister had been reported to the authorities at TIME on DATE . The public prosecutor accompanied by PERSON and a number of gendarmes arrived at the village . An autopsy had been carried out in the PERSON house and a bullet removed which had later been sent for forensic examination . The public prosecutor had talked to a number of persons . However , while PERSON had referred to the prosecutor conducting interviews , he had confirmed that he had not incorporated any such information in his own incident report and it had not been apparent that he had in fact witnessed any statements being taken . On the instructions of the prosecutor , ORG had looked for cartridges in a number of locations , particularly to the south . None had been recorded as having been found .", "CARDINAL . Another public prosecutor , PERSON , had taken over the investigation on his return from leave . On DATE , he had issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction indicating that the ORG were the suspects for the killing . He had based his decision on the incident report and sketch by PERSON . He had not conducted any interviews of family members , villagers or military personnel . No statements had been taken from such persons by any other public prosecutor .", "It had not been apparent from the incident report in question that it was the ORG who had fired the bullet which killed the applicant \u2019s sister . Furthermore , the sketch map accompanying the report appeared to place security forces to the south and north - west and terrorists to the east but there had been no plan of the PERSON house and neighbouring houses which clarified from which direction the bullet was likely to have been fired . Nor had there been any explanation in the text of the report as to the location of the security forces .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of lack of jurisdiction , the file had been transferred to the public prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG . Except for the ballistics report issued on DATE , no documents had been provided relating to any investigatory measures since that date .", "CARDINAL . Major PERSON had stated to the delegates that there was a fundamental principle in the planning of military operations that these be not moved into civilian areas . In this incident , the plan had been to restrict the activity in the north of the village but the ORG had not approached them from the expected side . No military inquiry or investigation had been carried out as to the conduct of the operation . Major PERSON , having seen the incident report and sketch by PERSON , forwarded them to the public prosecutor and took no further action .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The second paragraph of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose responsibility is of an absolute , objective nature , based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Code contains provisions dealing with unintentional homicide ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , intentional homicide ( Article CARDINAL ) and murder ( Article CARDINAL ) . In respect of these offences , complaints may be lodged , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities . The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them ( LAW ) , the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated , pursuant to LAW . A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel , they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage , endangering human lives or damaging property , if they have not followed orders in conformity with LAW of LAW . Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned ( nonmilitary ) before the relevant authority under LAW , or before the suspected ORG hierarchical superior ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no .
