Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE , while Mr ORG , PERSON and PERSON ( \u201c the second , third and fourth applicants \u201d ) were born in DATE . The first and second applicants live in GPE , while the third and fourth applicants live in GPE and GPE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are CARDINAL GPE \u2019s Witnesses who were found to be fit for military service .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicants were called up for military service . They failed to appear , and instead addressed letters to the local military commissariat ( \u0566\u056b\u0576\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u056f\u0578\u0574\u056b\u057d\u0561\u0580\u056b\u0561\u057f ) and the regional prosecutor \u2019s office , refusing to perform either military or alternative service . They stated that they were GPE \u2019s Witnesses and that , having studied LAW , they had come to the conclusion that , by NORP standards , the service proposed was not of a genuinely civilian nature since it was supervised by the military authorities . Their conscience did not allow them to work directly or indirectly for the military system . The alternative labour service was known to be organised and supervised by the military authorities because the alternative labour serviceman \u2019s record booklet was marked \u201c ORG \u201d , and alternative servicemen were subject to military discipline and penalties and had to register with the military subdivisions of ORG . Furthermore , the law required that they remain at their place of service around the clock , DATE a week , which was akin to house arrest and was unacceptable to the applicants . The requirement to perform military service or the available alternative service violated their rights guaranteed by , inter alia , LAW . For the reasons stated above , their conscience did not allow them to perform the alternative service available in GPE . The applicants added that they were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not in any way connected with the military authorities and did not violate their religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE charges were brought against the second applicant under LAW ( evasion of regular conscription for military or alternative service ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and fourth applicants were arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same charges were brought against the first and fourth applicants . Finding the investigator \u2019s applications for their detention substantiated , ORG decided to detain them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed appeals lodged by the first and fourth applicants against the detention orders , finding , inter alia , that as the alleged offence carried a sentence of DATE imprisonment , that increased the probability that the first and fourth applicants would commit a new offence or evade punishment if they remained at large .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same charges were brought against the third applicant and the ORG decided to detain him at the investigator \u2019s request , finding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he was charged .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date his criminal case was sent to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to set the case down for trial , finding that the \u201c detention was to remain unchanged \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined an appeal lodged by the third applicant against the detention order of DATE and decided to dismiss it , finding , inter alia , that the offence with which he was charged carried a sentence of DATE imprisonment , which increased the probability that he would commit a new offence or evade punishment if he remained at large .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before their respective trial courts , the applicants submitted that their opposition to military and alternative service was based on their religious beliefs . The alternative service provided for under domestic law was not of a genuinely civilian nature , as it was supervised by the military authorities . The right to conscientious objection was protected by , inter alia , LAW . The applicants were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not supervised by the military and was of a genuinely civilian nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the second applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE and DATE in prison . He was taken into custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG imposed similar sentences on the first and fourth applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG imposed a similar sentence on the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged appeals against their convictions , arguing that they violated the requirements of LAW . Their opposition to the alternative service available in GPE was based on their religious beliefs , as that service was not of a genuinely civilian nature and failed to comply with NORP standards . It was organised and supervised by the military authorities ( section QUANTITY of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ) and was equivalent to non - armed military service , whereas their conscience did not allow them to perform any service supervised by the military authorities . Furthermore , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW authorised a military authority to order the transfer of an alternative labour serviceman to another institution , while certain aspects of the service were organised in accordance with military rules ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) . Alternative labour servicemen were also required to wear a uniform that resembled a military uniform and to follow orders , and were not allowed to leave their place of service without authorisation . The cover of the alternative labour serviceman \u2019s record booklet ( \u0561\u0575\u056c\u0568\u0576\u057f\u0580\u0561\u0576\u0584\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0584\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u056e\u0561\u057c\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0572\u056b \u0563\u0580\u0584\u0578\u0582\u0575\u056f ) bore the coat of arms and the words \u201c ORG \u201d , and the DATE allowance paid was the same as that of military servicemen . Moreover , alternative service was punitive in nature as it lasted DATE and alternative servicemen were required to stay at their place of service around the clock . They reiterated their readiness to perform a genuinely civilian alternative service and argued that , in the absence of alternative service that complied with NORP standards and was of a truly civilian nature , their sentences did not pursue a pressing social need and were not necessary in a democratic society .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgments of ORG in the cases of the first and second applicants .", "In the first applicant \u2019s case , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the arguments of the defence that the alternative labour service in GPE does not comply with NORP standards , is of a military nature and is supervised by the military , ORG finds that [ the ORG ] ... is taking appropriate measures in respect of the obligations assumed before ORG as regards , in particular , the enactment and continuous improvement of the legislation concerning alternative service .", "ORG finds it necessary to point out that LAW , the [ relevant ] Government decrees and [ other executive orders ] are based on LAW and must therefore be applied in the present case with the following considerations .", "[ Citation of sections DATE ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ]", "It follows from the above - mentioned provisions that [ the ORG ] has made a clear distinction between alternative military service and alternative labour service , and has guaranteed by law the civilian nature of the latter .", "[ Citation of sections DATE and CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ]", "Based on an analysis of the above - mentioned provisions , ORG finds it necessary to point out that the fact that the head of the institution [ where alternative service is performed ] notifies [ the local military commissariat ] regarding the alternative labour service to be performed by the serviceman , the fact that the serviceman can be transferred to another institution or place and the fact that alternative labour servicemen are discharged from service to the reserve and are registered in the reserve in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law , are not sufficient to conclude that the alternative labour service in GPE is of a military nature , since ... the type , procedures and conditions of such labour are determined by the heads of the relevant institutions without any interference by the military authorities or their representatives .", "Furthermore , it is the head of [ the relevant ] institution who is responsible for the organisation and implementation of the alternative labour service and not the subdivisions of ORG .", "The argument put forward by the defence that the alternative labour service is supervised by a public authority in the field of defence authorised by the Government of GPE similarly does not suggest that there is no alternative labour service in GPE . It must be noted that in reality , servicemen perform the labour service outside ORG and it does not contain elements of military service .", "ORG also finds it necessary to note that an analysis of LAW shows that the specifics of the legal status of alternative labour servicemen are set out in the said LAW and the labour legislation of GPE and they are subjects ... of labour rather than military relations .", "The preceding conclusion is evidenced also by a number of other provisions of the LAW , in particular , the fact that alternative labour servicemen are subordinate only to the heads of the relevant civilian institutions , are obliged to follow only their orders and instructions , and must abide by the internal disciplinary rules of such institutions , while questions relating to the social security of servicemen and their family members are regulated by the legislation on ORG pensions rather than military laws ( sections DATE ) .", "It must be noted that Government Decree no . CARDINAL-N of DATE established the list of institutions where alternative service is performed and the form and the manner of wearing the alternative serviceman \u2019s uniform .", "Paragraph CARDINAL(b ) of the Decree stipulates that \u2018 alternative labour servicemen perform their service in the institutions under ORG and ORG .", "Pursuant to [ Annex CARDINAL ] to the Decree , \u2018 the tasks performed by alternative labour servicemen in the said bodies are those of an orderly\u2019 .", "The Government have entrusted the ministers of the bodies in question , as well as the Minister of Defence , with certain responsibilities , such as the provision of clothing , food and financial means to servicemen and other organisational work ( paragraph CARDINAL of the Decree ) .", "The fact that the Minister of Defence is also involved in the organisation of the alternative service does not suggest that the labour service transforms into military service , since , firstly , the Minister of Defence and certain subdivisions of ORG are called upon to participate in the organisation of the alternative military service .", "As regards the fact that the military authorities carry out supervision of labour servicemen together with the heads of the relevant institutions , ORG considers that this still does not change the nature of the service performed . Moreover , as already noted above , the type , procedures and conditions of the civilian labour are determined and may be changed only by the head of the relevant institution .", "...", "It must be noted that performing the tasks of an orderly at the relevant medical institutions of GPE is not only not demeaning , but on the contrary is humanitarian , serves the interests of society and is aimed at preservation of human health and life .", "The argument put forward by the defence that the alternative labour service is punitive in nature is also unsubstantiated .", "...", "In the light of the above , ORG , based on the concrete facts of the case , namely that [ the first applicant ] has categorically refused to be conscripted to perform alternative labour service , concludes that he has been found criminally liable and sentenced in a justified and fair manner for such actions , and this fact does not contradict ... the case - law of ORG regarding LAW . \u201d", "In the second applicant \u2019s case , ORG found that his conviction had been lawful , well - founded and reasoned .", "CARDINAL .
