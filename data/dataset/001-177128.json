The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE FAC ( hereinafter , \u201c the prison \u201d ) published a recruitment notice for a psychologist . The applicant applied for the position .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison \u2019s human resources division sent the applicant for a medical examination at ORG of ORG ( hereinafter , \u201c the Commission \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went for the examination , but after her height was measured the process was terminated and the applicant was told that she was unfit for the position because she was too short . The Commission noted that the applicant \u2019s height was QUANTITY and she was informed that she was diagnosed as being physically underdeveloped due to lack of proteins and minerals ( sul\u0117t\u0117jusi raida d\u0117l baltym\u0173 ir energetini\u0173 med\u017eiag\u0173 tr\u016bkumo ) . The Commission also stated that domestic regulations provided that women smaller than QUANTITY were unfit for work within the security and lawenforcement services ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant wrote to the Minister of ORG and ORG and complained about the fact that she had been found unfit for service by ORG . ORG replied that the ORG \u2019s decisions could be appealed against in accordance with the rules of administrative procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to the Parliamentary Ombudsperson , who in DATE established that ORG had performed the medical examination in accordance with the provisions of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The PERSON held , however , that ORG and ORG had not replied to a question about the specific reason for setting the height requirements and decided that the applicant \u2019s requests had not been fully examined . The PERSON thus suggested that ORG and ORG should in the future oblige employees to follow the requirement to provide comprehensive information .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to the Equal Opportunities PERSON , who in DATE held that the domestic regulation in question was more favourable to men than women . According to medical experts , men were considered small if their height was CARDINAL and CARDINAL cm while women were considered small if their height was CARDINAL and QUANTITY . The contested regulation provided that men were unfit for service in the security and law - enforcement bodies if they were smaller than QUANTITY while women were considered unfit for such service if they were smaller than QUANTITY . The Equal Opportunities PERSON also stated that there was no explanation why officers who did not carry out operational duties were considered unfit for service if they were short .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . She asked the court to annul the ORG \u2019s decision that she was unfit for the position and the diagnosis that she was physically underdeveloped . On DATE ORG decided that there had been no medical examination of the applicant , except for measuring her height . The court also raised doubts as to whether a domestic regulation which referred merely to height for acceptance into government service , without any additional examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was in accordance with the LAW and LAW and decided to refer the matter to ORG . The examination of the applicant \u2019s case was suspended awaiting the decision of the latter court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that ORG provided that a person aiming to be employed by the domestic security and safety services had to be healthy enough to perform such functions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , there was no evidence that a person \u2019s height , if not related to other health issues , was a reasonable ground to diagnose such a person as being physically underdeveloped . The court did not question the possibility of setting various requirements ( including height ) to hold certain positions , but held that the contested provision was contrary to ORG as it did not differentiate the height requirements according to profession and was not based on any inability to perform certain functions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings before ORG resumed . On DATE the applicant was asked to set out her complaint in a more specific way ( patikslinti skundo reikalavim\u0105 ) and to ask the court to annul the prison \u2019s decision on terminating the employment procedure . On DATE , the prison was asked to provide the court with a document , stating who , when and by what decision terminated the employment procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , following ORG proposal , stated her complaint in more specific terms and asked the court to also annul the prison \u2019s decision to terminate the procedure to employ her . On DATE ORG set a time - limit for the applicant to remedy shortcomings in her complaint . The court stated that the applicant had complained about the decision to terminate the procedure to employ her ; however , the prison administration had indicated that there had been no separate decision on that issue . The court held that in such cases only a final decision by the director of the institution in question could be complained of and that a decision by the ORG was only an intermediate document . The court thus suggested that the applicant again state her complaint more specifically and asked the prison to take a decision on terminating the employment procedure . There is no information that the prison had taken that decision in writing ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant set out her complaint again on DATE . She asked the court to oblige the prison to take a decision on terminating her employment procedure ; to annul that decision ; to annul the ORG \u2019s decision that she was unfit for service ; and to annul the ORG \u2019s diagnosis that she was physically underdeveloped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to terminate the part of the case in which the applicant sought to annul the ORG \u2019s decision and decided to annul instead the prison \u2019s decision on terminating the employment procedure . The court observed that the ORG had taken its decision without any medical advice and thus it had been unlawful and unfounded . The court further referred to ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) and held that the regulation that had been found to be contrary to ORG was not applicable from the date of issuance of the court \u2019s decision , DATE . The court also referred to a ORG case where the rules for appealing against decisions by the ORG had been explained ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a result , ORG held that in the applicant \u2019s case the decision which had affected her the most was that of the prison and not the Commission \u2019s and thus the latter could not be the subject of examination by the court . The court also noted that the prison \u2019s decision to terminate the procedure for the applicant \u2019s employment had not been set down in writing , but decided that the date it had been taken was when the prison had received the ORG \u2019s decision , which was DATE . The court referred the matter back to the prison so it could examine the applicant \u2019s employment application afresh and send her for a special medical examination .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , the prison and the Commission lodged appeals with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought to annul both the ORG \u2019s decision and that of the prison to terminate the employment procedure . The applicant disagreed with ORG conclusion that the ORG \u2019s decision had not affected her situation . She argued that the ORG \u2019s decision had been the ground for the prison to terminate the employment procedure . She also noted that the prison had not issued a written decision on terminating the employment process and that the procedure to complain about such a decision was unclear . She also stated that she had not asked the court of first instance to refer the matter of her employment back to the prison because by that time the judicial proceedings had taken DATE and the position at the prison had probably already been taken .", "CARDINAL . The prison argued that the ORG \u2019s decision had been an independent act with legal consequences for the applicant , namely it had prevented her from being a candidate for the position of psychologist . It did not agree that the negative consequences had been caused by its own decision , which had not even been set down in writing . The ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s complaint should have been dismissed as unfounded because it was not clear how an employing institution should act if there was a decision by the ORG that a person was unfit for service and that person thought otherwise . In accordance with the case - law of ORG , a person in such a situation would lose the possibility to question the lawfulness of the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended ORG decision and held that the ORG \u2019s decision could not be regarded as an independent document because it had not been an individual administrative act and the ORG was not a public authority . The court also stated that the ORG \u2019s decision had only been an intermediate step in the employment procedure and could not be contested before the domestic courts . Even if it had been held that the ORG \u2019s decision could be a matter for an administrative case , the applicant \u2019s right to continue the employment procedure would not in fact have been protected because the court could not impose an obligation on the institution where the applicant had aimed to be employed on the grounds of the ORG \u2019s allegedly unlawful decision . The court also held that examination of a case by a court was pointless if a person \u2019s rights could not be defended . The decision which the applicant could have challenged was the one by the prison . The court stated , however , that the applicant had submitted contradictory claims ( rei\u0161k\u0117 prie\u0161taringus reikalavimus ) , that is , on the one hand she had asked that the prison be obliged to take a decision on terminating the employment procedure and , on the other hand , that the prison annul its decision on terminating the procedure . The court also noted that the applicant had not indicated any remedy in defence of her rights before the court of first instance ; however , that court had not held that circumstance to be a shortcoming in the claim . In order to defend the applicant \u2019s rights to the maximum , it had applied the provisions of administrative law and had chosen the remedy that had best met the applicant \u2019s requirements . That was why the employment matter had been referred back to the prison . The court held that a decision stating that the applicant \u2019s rights had been breached had no consequences and was not the right way to protect her rights . The court also underlined that the applicant had not wanted to continue the employment procedure and that she had lodged her complaint with the domestic courts without any indication of possible measures of redress . As a decision by a domestic court that merely indicated that someone \u2019s rights had been breached did not lead to any material or legal consequences for that person , such complaints were not subject to examination by the administrative courts . The court therefore decided to terminate the case .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that everyone is equal before the law , courts , and other state institutions and officials . Human rights may not be restricted ; no one may be granted any privileges on the grounds of gender , race , nationality , language , origin , social status , belief , convictions or views .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG provides that when implementing equal treatment provisions , an employer , regardless of the person \u2019s age , sexual orientation , disability , racial or ethnic origin , religion or beliefs , must apply the same recruitment criteria and employment conditions when employing or recruiting someone to public service , except in cases provided for by law .
