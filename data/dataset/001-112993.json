He thus considered that ORG had to be regarded as CARDINAL of the prenatal monitoring techniques for ascertaining an embryo \u2019s state of health . Accordingly , prohibiting access to the technique , in the PERSON case , engaged the medical liability of the Health Director of ORG , who was the defendant in the proceedings , for failure to provide a health service .", "CARDINAL . The judge also found that since the mother had the right to abort an unhealthy f\u0153tus , it would be unreasonable not to guarantee her the right to know the state of health of the embryo by means of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

NORP This report shows that FAC patients from countries where the practice is prohibited go abroad for the diagnosis . NORP patients generally go to GPE , GPE , GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . The study also points to the inconsistency of legislative provisions which prohibit access to ORG yet authorise access to prenatal diagnosis and medical termination of pregnancy in order to avoid serious genetic diseases in children .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the press release on this report read as follows :", "\u201c Concerted action at ORG and national level is needed to tackle this problem , according to a report adopted by ORG DATE . The current ORG legislative framework is poorly suited to rare diseases and not well defined . Although rare diseases contribute greatly to morbidity and mortality , they are mostly invisible in health care information systems due to the lack of appropriate coding and classification systems . ...
