The applicant and his wife are gypsies by birth . They were born and bred in GPE . They have a nomadic lifestyle and have travelled extensively around the south of GPE in pursuit of work and to attend traditional gypsy social gatherings .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE , the applicant was prosecuted frequently for illegal encampment . Over DATE period he claimed to have been evicted from CARDINAL sites . To rectify this situation , in DATE he bought a plot of land which measures QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s land was situated on a hillside of LOC to the east of the village of GPE . The surrounding land was mostly open agricultural land but in the valley bottom there was mineral working and industrial development . The land contained CARDINAL caravans , which were occupied by the applicant , his wife , CARDINAL children and grandchildren . It also had an area for grazing horses and contained a stable . The site was in an area designated within the relevant development plan as a Special Landscape Area where special planning policies applied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s grandchildren attended school regularly receiving an education that in the past they frequently had not had the opportunity to receive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his family have mainly been employed in agricultural work all their lives . He bought the site with the intention that it would provide a settled home and also a living from market garden produce and horticulture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an enforcement notice was issued by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , requiring the applicant to cease the use of the land for the stationing of residential caravans . He was given DATE within which to remove the caravans .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against the enforcement notice . An Inspector was appointed by the Secretary of ORG for the Environment to determine the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Inspector , in a decision letter , denied planning permission and dismissed the appeal . He stated inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . From my inspection of the site and the surrounding area and from the written representations I consider that the main issues are whether the impact of the residential caravans on the surrounding area is acceptable having regard to relevant planning policies , and also , if the impact is not acceptable whether the stationing of residential caravans is nevertheless justified by the agricultural needs of the proposed enterprise or by the needs of the CARDINAL gypsy families involved .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL approved development plans for the area : the DATE Kent Structure Plan ; the DATE Kent Countryside Local Plan ; and the DATE Stour Valley Countryside Plan . Policy SCARDINAL of the Structure Plan imposes a general presumption against development of fresh land in the countryside although policy RSCARDINAL recognises that the needs of agriculture may constitute an exception . However even so policy RSCARDINAL requires that all development shall be appropriate in location and appearance while policies in all the plans provide that in such Special Landscape Areas as this conserving the landscape will normally have priority over other planning considerations .", "CARDINAL . The site is in a corner of an open field on the southern hillside of LOC and surrounded by agricultural land . In this position it is highly visible at various points along FAC below and from the FAC in the valley bottom . It is also visible from footpaths in the vicinity and particularly from CARDINAL that runs along the back of the site . The group of CARDINAL caravans within the fenced site is a most conspicuous and alien form of development in this exposed rural location and is in conflict with the character and appearance of its surroundings . An attempt has been made to screen the caravans on the hillside by planting evergreens but many have died . However neither screening nor painting the caravans , as offered , is likely to make the development less obtrusive in such an isolated and open situation , and there is no doubt in my mind that it seriously conflicts with the policies designed to conserve and enhance the countryside . ...", "CARDINAL . ... In my opinion , and on the evidence submitted the proposed enterprise < market gardening and horticulture > even taking into account the further land available is not likely to support the CARDINAL families who would be engaged in it so as to justify their living on the site .", "CARDINAL . As regards the agricultural need for living on the site , I am not satisfied that the type of horticulture outlined demands living on the site ... I do not doubt that the families wish to continue earning their living from agricultural pursuits but the offer to tie their occupation to agriculture ... does not overcome the lack of agricultural need to live on the site which might justify setting aside the strong amenity objection . ...", "CARDINAL . In support of allowing the development as a gypsy caravan site it is stated that < the applicant > has been evicted from CARDINAL sites over DATE period and was exasperated by the ORG \u2019s inability to provide suitable sites . He took the opportunity to acquire the present site to provide a permanent home and an income . This < he claims > is in line with the guidance in DOE Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL which recognises that even in sensitive locations it may be necessary to accept the establishment of caravan sites or to refrain from enforcement actions until sites are available .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recognise that , despite being a \u2018 designated NORP under LAW , there is a shortfall of CARDINAL pitches and further provision needs to be made . A number of sites are being evaluated and in addition the draft local plan contains a policy for permitting gypsies to establish sites on their own land providing it is suitable . The ORG do not consider that the ORG \u2019s guidance implies that private sites should be allowed without regard to the consequences .", "CARDINAL . Having considered the evidence , I accept that there is a shortfall of pitches in the GPE area but I recognise too < the applicant \u2019s > willingness , if not a preference , for providing a small site for the family group and I do not consider it unlikely that a less inappropriate place can be found . While therefore I accept that the loss of the present site would create a need for an alternative , in the circumstances of this case I find that the complete unsuitability of the present site outweighs that need . I have considered whether a temporary permission might be granted for this small group until the ORG \u2019s provision of other sites comes to fruition and I have taken account of < the applicant \u2019s > willingness to accept a planning condition restricting the number of caravans on the site so as not to create a precedent for the use of adjoining land . However I can see no way of preventing it from being a precedent if other gypsy families sought to acquire plots of land nearby . ... I am satisfied that even a temporary planning permission could be a signal for the establishment of other sites which would have a very harmful effect on the landscape of this attractive valley . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then applied for permission to use the land for DATE stationing of CARDINAL caravans for residential purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having requested the applicant to explain what change in material considerations had taken place , the ORG declined to determine the above application in accordance with LAW DATE . ORG did not consider that there were material differences between the planning application for DATE stationing of caravans and the applicant \u2019s earlier application .", "CARDINAL . The applicant now lives under the threat of criminal prosecution and forcible eviction .", "CARDINAL . While the applicant had been on a number of occasions offered places on official sites , he refused primarily because the sites in question were in a very poor state . CARDINAL site , at GPE was next to a rubbish tip and the other , at FAC , was built on an old sewage bed and adjacent to an operational sewage works and with a steel works adjoining the southern boundary of the site , which operated TIME per day . The applicant stated that they were unfit for human habitation ( photographs were attached to his application in support of his contention ) and that the noise of the steelworks deprived inhabitants of the site of sleep . While the Government disputed before the Commission that the GPE site was unfit for habitation , referring to repairs being carried out when required due to the vandalism of occupants , the Government confirmed at the hearing before the ORG that this site had now closed . The ORG also provided the information that planning permission had been granted for the upgrading and extension of the site at FAC and that a grant was made by the Secretary of ORG for this purpose . The original CARDINAL pitches had now been refurbished , and CARDINAL further pitches added , at a cost of GBP CARDINAL . The ORG had served LAW on the steelworks with a view to improving the residential environment for the gypsy site and discussions were ongoing regarding the creation of a boundary between the CARDINAL sites .", "CARDINAL . The Government also stated that in DATE in the GPE area there were CARDINAL official sites comprising CARDINAL pitches ( with CARDINAL currently vacant ) and in addition CARDINAL caravans on authorised private sites and CARDINAL caravans on unauthorised private sites . The DATE ORG figures showed however that the number of authorised private sites had dropped from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , the number of public sites fell from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , while the number of unauthorised encampments almost tripled from CARDINAL to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that planning permission had been given to a non - gypsy to station a caravan on the site adjacent to the applicant \u2019s . Outline planning permission had also been given for a development of CARDINAL residential units QUANTITY from his site . The Government have provided information and documents concerning both developments .", "Temporary planning permission was granted for DATE in DATE for a caravan on a site called ORG . The purpose of this was to enable the owner to establish the viability of his pig unit and the permission limited to occupation by an agricultural worker . Permission was granted recently for a permanent dwelling of the site given the established agricultural need and the owner \u2019s establishment of the viability of his pig farm . In the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , he found that this site did not have as unfortunate effect on the landscape as the applicant \u2019s , though it did detract from the openness of the countryside and the natural appearance of the landscape .", "The Government have also explained that in the DATE \u2019s a hospital ( PERSON ) , which was a large complex of buildings , closed down and it has been considered by the ORG as suitable for residential development . The outline planning permission was granted to accommodate CARDINAL houses and took into account the need to landscape the site . The applicant provided photographs of his own site and ORG site and the Government provided an aerial photograph identifying the locations of these developments relative to the applicant \u2019s land .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( as amended by LAW DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "CARDINAL . Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector \u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "CARDINAL . Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Part II of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in DATE , in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . LAW of LAW defined \u201c gypsies \u201d as :", "\u201c persons of nomadic habit of life , whatever their race or origin , but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen , or of persons engaged in travelling circuses , travelling together as such \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the Secretary of ORG was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of GPE , or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision , he could \u201c designate \u201d that district or county ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , LAW gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was inadequate , and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems . In DATE , therefore , the Government asked Sir PERSON to carry out a study into the operation of LAW . He reported in DATE ( Accommodation for Gypsies : A report on the working of GPE DATE , \u201c the Cripps Report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Sir PERSON estimated that there were CARDINAL NORP living in GPE and GPE .

DATE of them are still without the possibility of finding a legal abode ... Only when they are travelling on the road can they remain within the law : when they stop for TIME they have no alternative but to break the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued by ORG . Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on \u201c statutory procedures , alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management \u201d . It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Among other advice , it encouraged local authorities to enable self - help by gypsies through the adoption of a \u201c sympathetic and flexible approach to [ Gypsies\u2019 ] applications for planning permission and site licences \u201d . Making express reference to cases where gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming , it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was issued on DATE , stated , inter alia , that \u201c it would be to everyone \u2019s advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation \u201d , and thus advised local authorities that \u201c the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In addition , MONEY was spent under a scheme by which MONEY grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Justice and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE , repealed sections CARDINAL of the DATE Act and the grant scheme referred to above .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move . An unauthorised camper is defined as", "\u201c a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway , any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner \u2019s consent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable , or re - entry upon the land within DATE , is a criminal offence . Local authorities are able to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson ( DATE ) , PERSON referred to the DATE Act as \u201c Draconic \u201d legislation . He commented that :", "\u201c For DATE the commons of GPE provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic . Enough common land had survived DATE of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable , but by s.CARDINAL of ORG and ORG DATE local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers . This they proceeded to do with great energy , but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.CARDINAL of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons . By DATE , therefore ORG legislated to make the s.CARDINAL power a duty , resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils ... For DATE there followed a history of non - compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of DATE , marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty , to apparently little practical effect . The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer , were rarely , if ever used .", "The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non - compliance was the enactment of ... the Act of DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . New guidance on gypsy sites and planning , in the light of the DATE Act , was issued to local authorities by ORG in Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) , which cancelled ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see above ) .", "Councils were told that :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves , to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control . \u201d ( para . CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies ... \u201d ( para . CARDINAL ) .", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty , Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( LOC above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating PERSON presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water .", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in GPE that Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications . The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up . ORG research ( see below ) had showed that PERCENT of local authorities ( CARDINAL ) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision . It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided . Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the ORG \u2019s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation , applying for planning permission like everyone else . It was necessary , therefore , that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process .", "CARDINAL . ORG for ORG and Other Travellers ( ACERT ) which carried out research sponsored by ORG , noted in its DATE report that since DATE private site provision had increased by CARDINAL caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by CARDINAL caravans , disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision . Noting the increase of gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under the CARDINAL Act , it questioned , if these trends continued , the extent to which the ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity of ORG people would be protected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The research looked , inter alia , at CARDINAL refused private site applications , which showed that PERCENT related to land within the countryside and that PERCENT were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value ( e.g. Green Belt , conservation area locations ) . Of the CARDINAL gypsy site applicants interviewed , for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life , gaining independence and providing security . For many , the education of their children was another important reason for private site application . All save CARDINAL had applied for permission retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . The report stated that the figures for success rates in CARDINAL planning appeals showed that before DATE the success rate had averaged PERCENT but had decreased since . Having regard however to the way in which data was recorded , the actual success rate was probably PERCENT as given as the figures in DATE and DATE by the gypsy groups and ORG respectively . Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies , most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land - use criteria in the particular case . It was therefore not surprising that most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development . Granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG figures for caravans in GPE disclosed that of CARDINAL caravans counted , CARDINAL were accommodated on local authority pitches , CARDINAL on privately owned sites and CARDINAL on unauthorised sites . Of the latter , CARDINAL gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non - gypsies ( mainly local authority land ) and CARDINAL gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves . On these figures , CARDINAL caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over PERCENT of caravans were stationed on authorised sites .", "CARDINAL . Local authority duties to the homeless were contained in Part VII of LAW , which came fully into force on DATE . Where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless , eligible for assistance , had a priority need ( e.g. the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age , physical disability etc ) , and did not become homeless intentionally , the authority was required , if it did not refer the application to another housing authority , to secure that accommodation was available for occupation by the applicant for a minimum period of DATE . Where an applicant was homeless , eligible for assistance and not homeless intentionally , but was not a priority case , the local housing authority was required to provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as it considered appropriate in the circumstances in any attempt he might make to secure that accommodation became available for his occupation .", "CARDINAL .
