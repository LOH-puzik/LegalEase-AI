THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "DATE the applicant lived in GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , where he carried out academic research for a dissertation . During his stay in the GPE , he also worked as a freelance journalist for NORP DATE and DATE papers . Like most aliens from capitalist countries living in the GPE , the applicant was kept under surveillance by the GPE intelligence authorities .", "After his return to the GPE in DATE , the applicant suspected that he had attracted the attention of the then ORG ( Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) as he had the impression that his telephone conversations were being intercepted . After obtaining a magna cum laude doctorate degree in DATE , the applicant was unable to find suitable employment in the GPE .", "According to the applicant , this situation was linked to the often critical positions he had adopted in his academic and journalistic work , which , he claimed , had considerably irritated his fellow historians and politicians in the GPE . He submitted that GPE academics had repeatedly insinuated that he was a \u201c fellow traveller \u201d of communism . The applicant suspected that his publications and stays in the GPE and the mistrust displayed by his peers were having a negative effect on his career prospects in the GPE . He therefore decided to move abroad , and worked as a researcher and journalist in GPE , GPE and GPE in that order . The applicant returned to GPE in DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested the Minister of the Interior and ORG ( Minister PERSON en GPE \u2013 \u201c the Minister \u201d ) , to inform him as to what data were contained in possible files held on him by the ORG .", "In his decision of DATE , with further additions in a subsequent decision of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister stated \u2013 referring to LAW b ) of ORG ( PERSON van Bestuur \u2013 \u201c the WOB \u201d ) and the relevant case - law under this provision of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , and LAW ( Wet op de Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdiensten ) DATE that no information would be provided on whether or not the ORG held current data about the applicant , since such a move could give an insight into ORG sources , working methods and current level of knowledge . The Minister had , therefore , treated the applicant \u2019s request as a request for access to outdated information possibly held on him by the ORG . Apart from outdated material from a \u201c sister organisation abroad \u201d , no outdated information about the applicant had been found . After the \u201c sister organisation \u201d had granted permission for disclosure , the applicant was granted access to the outdated information in so far as the contents would not lead to disclosure of ORG sources or working methods , or of personal data relating to third parties .", "The outdated information disclosed to the applicant consisted of ( parts of ) CARDINAL documents , including ( parts of ) CARDINAL letters in NORP concerning the applicant and a copy of a letter the applicant had written on DATE to ORG at the West Berlin Regional Court . In the letter , the applicant criticised in virulent terms recent searches carried out by the NORP investigating authorities of the homes of persons referred to by the applicant as \u201c enemies of the LAW and other enemies \u201d ( PERSON sonstigen GPE ) . The applicant ended the letter with the phrase \u201c Death to the \u2018 NORP rule - of - law State\u2019 \u201d ( PERSON an den \u201c deutschen PERSON \u201d ) .", "Dissatisfied with the limited information disclosed , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) , which was dismissed by the Minister on DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , arguing , inter alia , that , as the ORG information about him had apparently been gathered during an investigation conducted in DATE in a Cold War context , the information could no longer be considered \u201c current \u201d but should instead be classified as \u201c outdated \u201d .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed on all points but CARDINAL by ORG in a judgment of DATE . With the applicant \u2019s permission , as required by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON Bestuursrecht \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , ORG had been given access to undisclosed ORG information , without that information being disclosed to the applicant . ORG held that CARDINAL particular document that had not been disclosed DATE it being unclear whether or not it did in fact concern the applicant although it did have a link with him \u2013 should not have been withheld from the applicant under LAW of LAW , as it had not been established that the document contained personal data relating to a third party . ORG quashed the Minister \u2019s decision in respect of the document , finding that no adequate reasons had been given . It did , however , add that \u2013 except on that CARDINAL point \u2013 it saw no reason to find the Minister \u2019s decision incorrect .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of ORG .", "On DATE the Minister took a further decision granting the applicant access to the document referred to in ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE and confirming the remainder of his initial decision . The applicant lodged an appeal against the new decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG \u2013 which , with the applicant \u2019s permission , had also been given access to undisclosed ORG information without that information being disclosed to the applicant \u2013 dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , upheld that judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . That decision , in its relevant parts , reads :", "\u201c DATE . Under LAW of the PERSON , anyone can address a request to a public body ... for information set out in documents concerning a public administrative matter . Pursuant to [ LAW of the PERSON ] a request for information will be granted , subject to the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of the PERSON ] . Pursuant to LAW ( b ) of the PERSON , no information shall be provided which could undermine the security of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the [ impugned ] decision the Minister informed the appellant that , after a thorough search of the archives , some outdated information had been found which was disclosed DATE in paraphrased form \u2013 to the applicant , and that no other outdated information on him had been found . In so far as the appellant \u2019s request concerned current information , the Minister gave a reasoned explanation for not disclosing information that could give an insight into the current level of ORG knowledge , leaving open whether or not current information about the appellant was being held .", "CARDINAL . ORG has concluded that , ... [ apart from CARDINAL document ] ... , it saw no reason to find the decision [ of DATE ] incorrect .", "CARDINAL . The appellant disagrees with this conclusion of ORG . According to the appellant , the ORG holds much more outdated information about him than it pretends . In this connection the appellant refers to the remark in the letter of CARDINAL March CARDINAL \u2013 one of the classified documents disclosed to the appellant \u2013 that an investigation of the applicant was still running . As the Minister qualified the letter of CARDINAL DATE as \u201c outdated \u201d , the investigation mentioned in it should also be regarded as outdated , in his view , with the result that the documents relating to the investigation should be disclosed to him . The appellant fails to see why [ access to ] this information , which was gathered in the context of the Cold War , should be refused on the ground that it could give an insight into current sources and working methods of the ORG . The appellant can not agree with ORG reasoning on this point .", "CARDINAL . This argument fails . Having followed the procedure set out in LAW ORG , ORG is , like ORG , of the opinion that , apart from the [ one document ] disclosed to the appellant in the meantime , there is no reason to find that the [ impugned ] decision is incorrect . There is no evidence that outdated information concerning an investigation of the appellant has remained undisclosed . The question whether the ORG , now ORG [ Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ] , holds information on the appellant which , in view of the tasks performed by the service , remains of a current nature , does not have to be answered . In this connection , ORG has correctly referred to the settled case - law of ORG , as it emerges from , inter alia , the rulings of DATE concerning no . HCARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , ( ORG ( LOC ) ORG , CARDINAL ) and DATE concerning no . HCARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , ( Administrative Case - law Reports ( ORG ) JB CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which held that the Minister could refrain from disclosing information that could give an insight into the current level of knowledge held by the ORG , now the ORG , on the basis that disclosure of such information could undermine the functioning of the service and hence the security of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the above that the appeal is unfounded . The impugned decision must be upheld . The appeal directed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE is equally unfounded . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "Until DATE the GPE intelligence and security services were governed by LAW of DATE regulating the duties , organisation , working methods and cooperation of the intelligence and security services ( PERSON DATE , GPE . CARDINAL , houdende regeling van de taak , ORG , de werkwijze en de samenwerking van de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten ) .", "In its report of DATE under former LAW in the case of ORG and Others v. the GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , GPE , GPE , DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON and GPE ) ORG found that the provisions of LAW of DATE were incompatible with the requirements of LAW , in that they lacked precision and adequate safeguards .", "LAW of DATE was subsequently replaced by the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act ( FAC inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which entered into force on DATE . It provided for CARDINAL branches of the intelligence and security services , namely ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG ( ORG DATE MID \u201d ) .", "Under LAW ( a ) of LAW , the ORG was entrusted , inter alia , with the task of collecting information about organisations or persons who , by virtue of the aims they pursued or their activities , gave rise to serious suspicions that they constituted a danger to the continued existence of the democratic legal order or to the security or other vital interests of the ORG . It was also given responsibility for carrying out security screening of public officials ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) and promoting measures aimed at securing information which needed to be kept secret in the interests of the ORG and information concerning those parts of the public service and industry which , in the view of the minister responsible , were of vital importance to society ( LAW ( c ) of LAW ) .", "LAW provided :", "\u201c The coordinator and the heads of the [ intelligence or security ] services are to ensure :", "( a ) the secrecy of information to be treated as classified and of the sources of that information .", "( b ) the safety of persons with whose cooperation the information is being gathered . \u201d", "LAW read , in its relevant part :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The Minister concerned shall , in agreement with the Minister of ORG , determine rules concerning the management of the collections of personal data that are being held by the [ security ] service concerned .", "CARDINAL . The rules referred to in the previous paragraph shall at least contain regulations concerning :", "( a ) the purpose of the collections ;", "( b ) the secrecy of the data recorded therein ;", "( c ) the monitoring of the accuracy of those data ;", "( d ) the length of time for which data may be stored ;", "( e ) other grounds for the removal of data from the collections ;", "( f ) the destruction of removed data .", "CARDINAL . ... \u201d", "The Minister of the ORG , in agreement with the Minister of ORG , issued ORG ( PERSON ORG ) , which contained further rules within the meaning of LAW .

According to LAW , persons about whom data had been recorded did not have a right of access to their personal data , nor did they have the right to learn whether or not personal data had in fact been recorded about them .", "In CARDINAL rulings given on DATE ( CARDINAL of which was published \u2013 see ORG , CARDINAL ) , ORG found that the provisions of the DATE Act fell short of the requirements of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It found that the provisions of LAW did not comply with the requirement of foreseeability under the Convention with regard to the categories of persons about whom information could be collected , the circumstances in which information could be collected and the means that could be used for obtaining information . It further considered that a person who had been refused access to information should be given reasons for such refusal instead of a general statement referring to national security . It also found that the CARDINAL existing control mechanisms could not be regarded as effective in that ORG did not have the power to give any binding decisions and ORG of ORG ( PERSON voor de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten ORG ) did not have a statutory basis .", "Consequently , the Minister of the ORG could no longer determine requests for access to information under ORG , but had to apply the criteria of ORG ( \u201c the WOB \u201d ) in dealing with such requests . This meant that each request for access to information had to be examined on an individual basis and that reasons had be given in the event of a refusal .", "LAW of the PERSON reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
