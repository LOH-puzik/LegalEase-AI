The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE in GPE . At the time of lodging his application , he was detained in GPE . He is currently living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant in respect of the applicant on the ground that he was strongly suspected of having murdered PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a further arrest warrant in respect of the applicant and CARDINAL other suspects , born in GPE , GPE or GPE . The court accused the applicant of having prepared , with others , a bomb attack at the \u201c FAC \u201d discotheque in GPE on DATE in order to kill as many members of the NORP armed forces as possible . During this terrorist attack , CARDINAL people had been killed and ORG seriously injured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police in GPE and was subsequently taken into detention with a view to extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP court acquitted the applicant of PERSON \u2019s murder but convicted him of forgery and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE and subsequently held in detention on remand on account of the arrest warrant issued in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand . It held that the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged resulted , among other things , from the confession of one of the other suspects . The danger of his absconding still persisted because the applicant had been extradited to GPE only in DATE and had neither a fixed dwelling nor social ties in GPE which would prevent him from absconding if released . The court moreover referred to the lifelong prison sentence the applicant faced and underlined that more lenient preventive measures would not be suitable . Lastly , there had been no breach of the obligation to proceed speedily ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor filed the bill of indictment . On DATE ORG opened the main proceedings against the applicant and CARDINAL other accused . DATE ORG repeatedly ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicant for release . It held that there was still a danger of his absconding . Furthermore , the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged persisted . The applicant \u2019s continued detention was also proportionate having regard to the serious nature of those offences , the prospective sentence , the importance of the case and the particular public interest in the prosecution of these offences . Furthermore , there had been no breach of the obligation to proceed speedily .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . Concerning the suspicions as regards the applicant , the court pointed out that it was bound by the assessment of ORG . Furthermore , the danger of the applicant \u2019s absconding persisted in view of the lifelong prison sentence he faced . The objective of his detention on remand could accordingly not be accomplished by alternative , less radical , preventive measures . Although the applicant had been detained since as far back as DATE , his further detention remained proportionate having regard to the importance of the case , the character and seriousness of the offences and the particular public interest in the prosecution of these offences . Referring to the principle of proportionality , the court underlined that a detainee \u2019s right to liberty could outweigh the public interest in the prosecution as time passed , if there was , for instance , an imminent risk of irreparable damage to his health . In the present case , however , nothing suggested that the applicant \u2019s life or health were at risk . Moreover , given that ORG had continuously held CARDINAL hearings per week since DATE , the length of the proceedings could not be considered disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit a complaint by the applicant , without giving any reasons . Its decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of aiding and abetting murder , on ORG counts of aiding and abetting attempted murder , and of aiding and abetting causing an explosion ( PERSON ) . The court alluded to the historical background of the case , in particular to the tensions between GPE and GPE which had arisen following terrorist attacks in DATE . In DATE the GPE government had imposed a trade embargo on GPE and had ordered the freezing of all NORP State assets in GPE banks . These measures had led to military intervention and to the planning by NORP nationals of terrorist attacks on GPE facilities in GPE . The court further pointed out that the applicant \u2019s crimes were punishable by imprisonment for DATE and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . When determining the sentence , the court took into account , among other things , the fact that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand and the proceedings had lasted an unusually long time . It further determined that since DATE the applicant had been detained in GPE with a view to extradition in connection with the present case . This period of detention was to be deducted from his prison sentence at a ratio of CARDINAL until DATE and at a ratio of CARDINAL from DATE . The court moreover ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention . The judgment , which ran to CARDINAL pages , was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Berlin Regional Court delivered its judgment after holding CARDINAL hearings with an average of CARDINAL hearings per week and having heard CARDINAL witnesses . The hearings , which lasted on average TIME each , were regularly attended by the CARDINAL accused , their CARDINAL lawyers , CARDINAL joint plaintiffs , their CARDINAL lawyers and CARDINAL interpreters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed appeals on points of law by the applicant and the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides , inter alia :", "\u201c As long as the accused is in detention on remand , he may at any time apply for a court hearing to determine whether the arrest warrant is to be revoked or whether its execution is to be suspended in accordance with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
