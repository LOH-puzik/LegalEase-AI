On an unspecified date the applicant , on behalf of his client Mr ORG , filed an action with ORG seeking the annulment and suspension of execution of a competition to fill CARDINAL posts announced in the PERSON newspaper on DATE by the office of the mayor of the LOC district in GPE . In his petition , the applicant stated , inter alia , that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL workers who had been dismissed on CARDINAL DATE had won their cases before ORG but despite this fact they had not been reinstated . In this regard , the applicant submitted that the municipality had refused to reinstate CARDINAL of the workers on the ground that there were no available posts . As to the other CARDINAL , they had been reinstated for DATE before being dismissed again . The applicant complained that pending another set of administrative proceedings against the GPE regarding a competition announced in the same newspaper on DATE for CARDINAL posts , the Municipality had announced this new competition , through which it was aiming to fill the available posts , rendering impossible the enforcement of the court judgments in favour of the dismissed employees , including his client . He further claimed that the vacancy notice had been published only in the editions of PERSON which were distributed to various associations affiliated with ORG and not in the normal edition of PERSON as distributed in GPE that DATE .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL paragraph of his petition , the applicant made the following remark :", "\u201c As stated by political historians , the most dangerous cruel [ person ] ( zalim ) in the world is the one who considers himself and his acts as fair or who presents himself as such . The elected head of the accused administration , who has placed my clients in their current situation , is such a cruel [ person](zalim ) and a bigot ( yobaz ) with no regard for the rule of law ( hukuk tan\u0131maz ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Bing\u00f6l , mayor of PERSON and member of ORG , brought an action against the applicant claiming compensation for the damage he had incurred as a result of the applicant \u2019s serious attack on his honour and integrity .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before ORG ( hereafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the applicant unsuccessfully asked the court to appoint expert witnesses to analyse the impugned words and to hear a number of witnesses . In his written observations , the applicant maintained , inter alia , that his statements had not been an attack against Mr ORG but mere observations , since there were documents proving to what degree the latter had acted in accordance with the laws , the LAW and ethics over DATE . He made a number of accusations regarding Mr PERSON \u2019s actions as mayor and referred to the fact that the latter and his administration had been the subject of media attention many times . The applicant stated that he had used the impugned words in the course of his defence duties ; it had not been his aim to insult PERSON . He had referred to the plaintiff as \u201c cruel \u201d because the dismissals had had serious adverse effects on the lives of his CARDINAL clients . He had used the word \u201c bigot \u201d as a reference to an intolerant person . In this connection , the applicant also referred to the reasons voiced by ORG when it decided to ban the Refah party . The applicant also accused the plaintiff of misleading and lying to the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . In his written observations PERSON claimed , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s accusations were false and unfounded , that he had repeated his insulting remarks before ORG and that this attack on his personality had transgressed the standards and boundaries of objective debate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay compensation to Mr PERSON in the amount of MONEY ( TRL - approximately MONEY [ ORG ] ) plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court \u2019s decision . ORG considered that the word yobaz used by the applicant meant a person \u201c whose religious beliefs were so extreme as to cause discomfort to other persons \u201d and a person who was \u201c provocative , vulgar and unsophisticated \u201d . The word was used in DATE life to describe an \u201c unlikeable , ignorant and vulgar \u201d person . In any event , the applicant \u2019s written submission , when read as a whole , had employed \u201c sharp and harsh \u201d language . According to ORG , whether or not the applicant had had the intention to insult the mayor was irrelevant ; what was important was how the public would interpret those words . After all , PERSON was the elected mayor of a district where CARDINAL people lived . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINALth ORG held a hearing and , by a majority , quashed ORG decision of DATE on the ground , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s witnesses had not been heard . The president of the ORG dissented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , considering that hearing the applicant \u2019s witnesses and examining the administrative court \u2019s case file would not have changed the outcome , insisted on its decision of DATE . The applicant appealed again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Grand Chamber of ORG rejected the appeal and upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court noted that there was no dispute that , inter alia , the municipality headed by PERSON had failed to execute certain court judgments . However , it remained to be determined whether the words used by the applicant in the course of the administrative proceedings had a valid basis and whether these words constituted an attack against Mr ORG \u2019s personal rights . In this connection , it considered that the applicant had overstepped the standards and boundaries of objective debate by using the terms \u201c bigot \u201d , \u201c cruel \u201d and \u201c no regard for the rule of law \u201d . The applicant had attacked Mr PERSON \u2019s personal rights . It also considered that the sanctions for the non - execution of a court decision \u2013 of which the mayor had been accused DATE were provided for by statute and that this could not be considered to be a valid reason for the applicant to cross the legally permissible boundaries and use the words he had . Finally , it held that listening to witnesses or examining the case file before the administrative courts would not have changed the outcome . ORG of ORG also decided to remit the case to ORG for an examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints concerning the excessive amount of compensation . A request by the applicant for the review of that decision was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal concerning the amount of compensation , which he considered excessive when account was taken of his resources , and upheld the decision of ORG .
