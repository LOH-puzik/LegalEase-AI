The first applicant , PERSON , and the second applicant , PERSON PERSON , are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE , who live in GPE . The third applicant , PERSON , is their daughter , an NORP national , born in GPE in DATE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the former Third Section decided , in the interest of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings , to indicate to the Government of GPE , under LAW that the first applicant should not be deported to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The application was transferred to LAW , following the re - composition of the ORG \u2019s sections on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At some unknown time the first applicant entered GPE and requested asylum . In support of her request she explained that she had been a member of the political party ORG ) since DATE . Following the election in DATE , a conflict arose between ORG party and the CUD . She was summoned by the police in DATE but did not appear , as she knew that CARDINAL other members of the ORG had disappeared after being summoned by the police . She was summoned a second time and went into hiding with her sister . In DATE she fled the country . She travelled by plane from GPE to GPE on a false passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) refused the first applicant \u2019s request and ordered her deportation to GPE . It noted that she had not proved her identity , but in assessing her request for asylum it assumed that she was from GPE as she maintained . It found that the general situation in GPE alone could not justify granting asylum . As to the applicant \u2019s personal situation , it questioned her credibility , notably because during the interviews she had shown little knowledge of the PERSON and had given divergent information about where and with whom she had been hiding from DATE . Moreover , noting that the applicant had not played a leading role within the party , the ORG found it unlikely that she would be of interest to the police , especially DATE after the election , and that , if she had been of such interest , the police had not come to find her at her sister \u2019s home . ORG also noted that , according to international sources , many members of the CUD had in fact been arrested in connection with the election , but that almost all had been released in DATE . Those remaining were convicted in DATE and granted amnesty in DATE . In these circumstances , ORG did not find that the applicant had substantiated fulfilling the criteria for being granted asylum .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) and added that for DATE and DATE she had had a relationship with the second applicant , an NORP national , who had been granted a permanent residence permit in GPE on DATE in order to join his mother . On DATE the first and the second applicants had a daughter , the third applicant , of whom the parents have joint custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision as to the request for asylum .", "CARDINAL . As to the first applicant \u2019s relationship with her partner and child , ORG pointed out that by virtue of LAW , LAW of LAW , an alien who wants a residence permit in GPE must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country . An application for a residence permit may not be granted after entry into GPE except , among other grounds , if the alien has a very strong connection to a person residing in GPE and it can not reasonably be demanded that the alien travel to another country to hand in an application there . According to the preparatory work , a request to be exempted from the main rule should be refused if the alien \u2019s identity can not be established and the alien does not have a right to protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the present case ORG noted that the third applicant did not have a residence permit in GPE at the relevant time , thus the first applicant could not invoke the strong connection to her child to obtain a residence permit there . As regards the first applicant \u2019s relationship with the second applicant , ORG found on the one hand that it spoke in the first applicant \u2019s favour that the couple had a child together . On the other hand , it spoke against her that she had not pointed to any reasons why it could not reasonably be demanded that she return to her home country and hand in her application for a residence permit there . In conclusion ORG did not find the conditions fulfilled to apply the said exception set out in LAW , LAW , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) was refused on DATE . The deportation order thus became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the third applicant a permanent residence permit in GPE on account of her ties to her father .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , invoking LAW , LAW of LAW the applicant maintained that there were impediments to her deportation because of her strong ties to her partner and her daughter .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to suspend the deportation order of the first applicant . It noted that LAW , LAW of LAW was an extraordinary remedy and that the invoked new circumstances could not constitute an impediment within the said provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new Act entered into force in GPE amending LAW , LAW and LAW , LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) .", "CARDINAL . Invoking the amended LAW , LAW of LAW , again the first applicant maintained that there were new circumstances which amounted to an impediment to enforce the deportation order . In particular she submitted that the second applicant objected to her taking their daughter with her to GPE to apply for family reunification . Moreover , the second applicant worked as a truck driver , which meant that he was away for long periods and therefore could not take care of their daughter in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the application since the applicant had not presented her original passport and therefore had not fulfilled the conditions set out in LAW , LAW , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Submitting a valid passport , the first applicant re - maintained that there were impediments to her deportation by virtue of LAW , Section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG disagreed . It commenced by examining whether it could be considered clear that a residence permit would have been granted the first applicant , if her application had been examined before her entry into GPE .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , at the relevant time the first and the second applicants did not fulfil the conditions set out in LAW , LAW , of LAW according to which a residence permit could be granted to an alien who is the spouse of , or cohabiting partner , with someone who is residing in GPE . It was recalled in this respect that the applicants were not married and they had not lived together before the first applicant entered GPE .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , at the relevant time the first and the second applicant did not fulfil the conditions set out in LAW , LAW a ) of LAW , which stipulated that a residence permit could be granted to an alien who intended to marry or cohabit with someone who was legally residing in GPE , if their relationship was serious and no special reasons spoke against granting such a residence permit . It was recalled in this respect that the applicants\u2019 relationship had only commenced in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , it could not be concluded that \u201c it was clear that a residence permit would have been granted to the first applicant if the application had been examined before her entry into GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , ORG found that there were no new circumstances or impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order under LAW , LAW of LAW . It pointed out though that the implementation thereof had been suspended while the case was pending before the ORG in accordance with the Rule CARDINAL indication .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . It defines the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . LAW , of LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , a permit may nevertheless be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s state of health . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for granting a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances presented by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been presented previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a reexamination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The provisions on family reunification relating to a spouse , registered partner or cohabiting partner etc . of a person who is resident in GPE are set out in LAW , LAW , of LAW and were given their present wording on DATE in connection with the implementation of the ORG Directive on the right to family reunification ( Directive CARDINAL of DATE , hereinafter \" LAW below ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , LAW , first paragraph of the LAW , unless otherwise provided in LAW ( about special grounds against granting a residence permit ) , a residence permit shall be granted to an alien who is a spouse or cohabiting partner ( sambo ) of someone who is resident in GPE or who has been granted a residence permit to settle in GPE , and under certain conditions to the alien \u2019s minor children .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , LAW a ) first paragraph of the LAW a residence permit may be granted to an alien who intends to marry or become a cohabiting partner with someone who is legally residing in GPE , if their relationship is serious and no special reasons speak against granting such a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW , LAW , of the LAW , an alien who wants a residence permit in GPE on account of family ties or serious relationships must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country . An application for a residence permit may not , as a general rule , be approved after entry . However , exemptions from this rule can be made for example if the alien has strong ties to a person who is resident in GPE and it can not reasonably be required that he or she travel to another country to submit an application there ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) . An exemption may also be made if there are some other exceptional grounds ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) . The requirement that , in principle , residence permits for family members have to be granted before entry into GPE was introduced as CARDINAL of a number of measures aimed at reducing the possibilities of obtaining a residence permit by means of marriages or relationships of convenience . Subsequently , ORG and ORG have underlined on several occasions that the requirement that residence permits be obtained before entry into GPE is an important part of measures to maintain regulated immigration . Moreover , the preparatory works to LAW state that it is important that aliens staying in GPE illegally do not enjoy a better position than those who comply with decisions by the authorities to return to their country of origin in order to apply for a permit from there ( Government PERSON ) . The same requirement is found in LAW , LAW ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the exemptions that can be made according to LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL of LAW , the preparatory works to the provision ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) state that the main emphasis should be placed on the question of whether it is reasonable to require that the alien return to another country in order to submit an application there . Relevant elements , which may be favourable for the alien , may be whether he or she can be expected , after returning home , to encounter difficulties in obtaining a passport or exit permit and this is due to some form of harassment on the part of the authorities in the country of origin . It may also be whether the alien will be required to complete a long period of national service or service under unusually severe conditions . It may also be relevant whether the alien has to return to a country where there is no NORP foreign representation and where major practical difficulties and considerable costs are associated with travelling to a neighbouring country to submit the application there . Relevant elements , which may count against the alien , may be that he or she is staying in the country illegally , that their identity is unclear or if there are strong ties to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL .

An additional requirement is that it would cause the employer inconvenience if the alien had to travel to another country to submit an application there or that there are some other special grounds .
