It stated that new parliamentary elections had been held in DATE , which was why the ORG complaint had effectively become moot . It noted that their complaint could not have been treated as a constitutional appeal , as envisaged under LAW adopted in DATE , since the parliamentary decisions at issue had been made DATE before LAW had been adopted ( see B.CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

LAW entered into force in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst reviewing the constitutionality of election legislation in abstracto , ORG held that the mandate of an elected MP belonged to the MP personally , and not to the political party on whose list he or she was elected . In its reasoning , the court emphasised that once elected , MPs should be accountable primarily to the voters who elected them , not to their political party . This flows from the fact that they hold a mandate from the people , not from their party . The fact that an MP has resigned from the party or been expelled should not therefore lead to their expulsion from parliament . There is no constitutional obligation on MPs to resign if they have political disagreements with their party , even if they are expelled from it ( decision IU no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

Obligation of Members of the parliament to resign if they change their political affiliation \u2013 the case of GPE .", "...", "CARDINAL . At present , imperative mandate stricto sensu and recall are unknown in practice in LOC . Moreover , there are very few countries among ORG member GPE which have legislation giving the power to political parties to make members of the elected bodies resign if they change their political affiliation . The mechanisms of control of individual representatives proposed in the NORP or NORP cases can not be equalled to \u2018 imperative mandate\u2019 which is a practice forbidden in virtually all NORP countries . These mechanisms come closer to the model of \u2018 party administered mandate\u2019 which is or has been characteristic in countries such as GPE or GPE with the objective of preventing massive turn round of voters\u2019 decision by means of party switching . Whilst in these countries these practices have [ been ] considered consistent with their own constitutions , ORG has consistently argued that losing the condition of representative because of crossing the floor or switching party is contrary to the principle of a free and independent mandate . Even though the aim pursued by this kind of measures ( i.e. preventing the \u2018 sale\u2019 of mandates to the top payer ) can be sympathetically contemplated , the basic constitutional principle which prohibits imperative mandate or any other form of politically depriving representatives of their mandates must prevail as a cornerstone of NORP democratic constitutionalism . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
