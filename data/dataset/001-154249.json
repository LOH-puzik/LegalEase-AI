NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is ethnically a NORP originating from GPE in GPE , close to Urmia ( Orumieh ) . The applicant had difficulties as a NORP to enter university in GPE and he was disappointed by the position of NORP in GPE in general . For that reason he joined ORG of Kurdistan ( PJAK ) late in DATE , soon after it was founded . He described himself as a regular but active member of the party . His activism included distributing material and information about the party , recruiting new members and accommodating visiting party members at his house , but not taking part in any armed activities . His family members have also been supporters of the NORP cause .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s neighbour apparently pretended to want to join the PJAK and managed to obtain important information about the party \u2019s recruitment . Subsequently , he informed the ORG about the applicant \u2019s activities . Since then ORG has allegedly been looking for the applicant and CARDINAL other party members . CARDINAL of the other party activists were caught and arrested and the other CARDINAL fled to the mountains to join the PJAK armed group . The applicant managed to escape , with a smuggler \u2019s help , to GPE and from there through GPE and GPE to GPE , where his sister is residing permanently .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that if he returns to GPE , he will never be free again since it is possible that the authorities arrest him and he might be killed . He also stated that the NORP police have taken his father twice for questioning since he left the country but his father has never told him why . The applicant was arrested once during the religious feast of the Shiite Muslims DATE , but has never been formally punished or ill - treated by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has submitted CARDINAL documents which were translated from NORP or NORP to NORP in DATE by an official translator . The first is entitled \u201c Warning Announcement \u201d in which the applicant is apparently called to appear before the Iranian Islamic Republic \u2019s Court for reasons of his cooperation with the PJAK , causing insecurity in the area and encouraging youngsters in the area to join the NORP political parties .", "CARDINAL . The second document is a certificate from the PJAK representative in LOC , PERSON , who confirms that the applicant joined the party in DATE and that he has been politically active , which puts his health and life at risk . Persecution caused the applicant \u2019s flight from GPE and , if he is returned there , his life will be in danger .", "CARDINAL . The third document is entitled \u201c Local Certificate \u201d , and it is signed by CARDINAL persons who certify that the applicant has been politically active in GPE by encouraging people to join the party and by distributing PJAK leaflets and material to people . The signatories wish to confirm that the activism of the applicant is known to everyone in the area and also that the security police are after him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was married to a NORP citizen residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant first sought asylum in GPE on DATE and claimed to have arrived in the country on DATE . He had also previously sought in GPE a visa to GPE for the period from DATE to attend his nephew \u2019s wedding but he had received a negative decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NORP - muuttovirasto , PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application and decided to expel him to GPE . It noted in its decision that the applicant \u2019s story about his journey from GPE to GPE was unclear and contradictory and that this weakened the credibility of his asylum story as a whole . For example , the applicant had stated in the asylum interview that he had left for GPE directly after having heard about the arrests of QUANTITY members of his group , while in a subsequent hearing he had claimed to have been in GPE already when he had heard about the arrests . Also the applicant \u2019s report about the whereabouts of his passport was contradictory and vague . He had stated that he had joined the party in DATE and had immediately started to work actively in it but at the same time he had said that he was in the army from DATE . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s account of his alleged party activities was unclear and contradictory as he had spoken about the PJAK \u2019s activities only in a very general way , giving information which could be found on the PJAK \u2019s website , before its closure . ORG therefore concluded that there were no reasoned grounds to believe that the NORP authorities would be interested in the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , also requesting an oral hearing to be held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as well as the request for an oral hearing . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s activism had not been very significant but rather low - level . Nor had the applicant ever been arrested in relation to his activities in the ORG or ill - treated by the NORP authorities . Furthermore , the court considered that the applicant merely suspected that an arrest warrant for him had been issued but that there was no certainty about it . The court did not find it likely that the NORP authorities would be interested in the applicant in particular and therefore it considered that the applicant had failed to demonstrate a real risk of ill - treatment if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new asylum application , submitting the above - mentioned documents , CARDINAL of which he claimed to have received from his family members in GPE , as written evidence supporting his application . As his appeal was already pending before ORG , the new application was sent directly there as an addendum to his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Apparently the order to deport the applicant to GPE was never executed and thus on DATE the applicant lodged his third asylum application , citing the same grounds as before . He argued that his relatives in GPE had informed him that there was a court order against him for causing insecurity in the area and for being a member of the PJAK . He claimed that he would receive a death sentence if returned to GPE . He also relied on his marriage as grounds for a residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his application . It considered that the application was substantially the same as before , containing the same information as had already been submitted to ORG in the context of the applicant \u2019s previous asylum applications . The ORG therefore dealt with the application in the fast - track procedure . No residence permit could be given to the applicant on the basis of his marriage either , as neither spouse had a job or had provided information about having sufficient means for living . The ORG therefore ordered the applicant to be expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , requesting that an oral hearing be held . He also requested that an interim order be imposed to stay the expulsion , which was not granted . He argued , in particular , that ORG had not taken into account the written evidence provided by him as no reasoning to that effect had been given in the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and his request for an oral hearing . It considered that ORG had examined the documents submitted by the applicant and that the documents were mentioned in its decision . ORG considered that the new evidence did not provide grounds to accept the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the right of foreigners to enter GPE and to remain in the country is regulated by an LAW . A foreigner shall not be deported , extradited or returned to another country , if in consequence he or she is in danger of a death sentence , torture or other treatment violating human dignity .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , aliens residing in the country are granted asylum if they reside outside their home country or country of permanent residence owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ethnic origin , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion and if they , because of this fear , are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on grounds of subsidiary protection if the requirements for granting asylum under LAW are not met , but substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person , if returned to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence , would face a real risk of being subjected to serious harm , and he or she is unable , or owing to such risk , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . Serious harm means : CARDINAL ) the death penalty or execution ; CARDINAL ) torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ; or CARDINAL ) serious and individual threat as a result of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINALa of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , an alien residing in GPE is issued with a residence permit on the basis of humanitarian protection , if there are no grounds under LAW or CARDINAL for granting asylum or providing subsidiary protection , but he or she can not return to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence as a result of an environmental catastrophe or a bad security situation which may be due to an international or internal armed conflict or a poor human rights situation .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINALb of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the well - founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section CARDINALb or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section CARDINAL may be based on incidents after the applicant \u2019s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in since his or her departure .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the LAW ( as amended by Act no . ORG ) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant \u2019s statements on his or her circumstances in the ORG in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that ORG obtained from various sources . After obtaining the statement , the authorities shall decide on the matter in favour of the applicant on the basis of his or her statement if the applicant has contributed to the investigation of the matter as far as possible , and if the authorities are convinced of the veracity of the application with regard to the applicant \u2019s need for international protection .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Act , no one may be refused entry and sent back or deported to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty , torture , persecution or other treatment violating human dignity or from where he or she could be sent to such an area .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALb of LAW ( as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) incorporates into the NORP legal system the ORG CARDINAL of DATE on the organisation of joint flights for removals from the territory of CARDINAL or more member GPE , of third - country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders . The annex to the ORG contains common guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air including , inter alia , an obligation for the member GPE to ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health , which allows legally and factually for safe removal by air .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG Operational Guidance Note on GPE , of DATE :", "\u201c There is no evidence to suggest that an applicant of NORP ethnic origin , in the absence of any other risk factor , would on return face a real risk of ill - treatment or persecution to LAW level purely on account of his or her ethnic origin . However the government disproportionately targeted minority groups , including NORP , for arbitrary arrest , prolonged detention and physical abuse .", "Applicants who are able to demonstrate that they are known , or suspected , by the government to be members or supporters of the PERSON , GPE , or PJAK , will be at real risk of persecution and a grant of asylum will generally be appropriate . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
