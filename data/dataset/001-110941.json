De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Gda\u0144sk . He was represented before ORG by PERSON - GPE and PERSON , lawyers practising in PERSON and GPE respectively . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ( stwardnienie rozsiane ) . He is in a wheelchair ; both of his legs and his left arm are paralysed . The applicant also suffers from urinary incontinence and wears incontinence pads . He is slowly losing his eyesight , is affected with palsy and also experiences cramps .", "CARDINAL . NORP On unspecified dates in DATE the applicant was convicted of fraud in CARDINAL separate sets of criminal proceedings . He was sentenced to CARDINAL prison terms of DATE each . His actual detention , however , was postponed because of his poor health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police . On DATE he was transported to FAC where he started serving his combined fouryear prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . He was committed to ORG , where he alternated between the neurology ward of the remand centre \u2019s hospital wing and a general prison wing . From DATE until DATE and from DATE until DATE the applicant was detained in the hospital wing . In the remaining time he was imprisoned in the remand centre \u2019s general wing . He shared his cell with CARDINAL healthy inmates . The cell in question was adapted to special needs detainees in that it had a wider door and a special handle had been installed on the wall next to the toilet . The representatives of the ORG inspected the applicant \u2019s cell and confirmed that it was adapted to the needs of disabled persons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was usually scheduled to see the remand centre \u2019s inhouse general practitioner once every fortnight . In his opinion , the medical check - ups should have been more frequent and run by a neurologist .", "CARDINAL . The remand centre \u2019s nurse administered the applicant \u2019s medicine once or twice a day . The applicant claimed that the pharmacological treatment prescribed was insufficient to stop his health from deteriorating . In his opinion , the only way to slow down the development of his disease and to avoid complete body paralysis was to have regular and specialised physiotherapy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant received a DATE supply of incontinence pads from the prison nurse . He changed them with the assistance of his fellow inmates . He had to pay for this help with cigarettes and other goods . The applicant submitted that he was in an inferior position vis - \u00e0 - vis his cellmates because he depended on their assistance for his hygiene and DATE routines . He also felt humiliated in front of them because he had no privacy when having his incontinence pads changed and he often smelt of urine . The latter led to his being mocked , and caused increased tension and disputes among his cellmates .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted that , in order to attend his physiotherapy sessions , he had had to be carried in his wheelchair across the external yard by fellow prisoners . On those occasions he had only worn his pyjamas and had often been cold . In addition , on several occasions , he had been dropped and his wheelchair had been badly damaged . For those reasons the applicant decided not to continue his physiotherapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was conditionally released from detention .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant filed an application for adjournment of the execution of his prison sentence with ORG . On DATE the court dismissed his application . It found that the applicant could serve his sentence and be treated in prison hospital . The court relied on the supplementary expert opinion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the information submitted by the Chief Medical Officer of ORG of ORG . According to the latter , the neurological ward of ORG ensured constant medical care to prisoners suffering from chronic neurological conditions . It disposed of well - equipped physiotherapy room and each disabled prisoner was provided with specialised assistance in his DATE routine .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had had regular neurological consultations ( on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) . The applicant had been signed up for regular physiotherapy sessions which he had frequently refused to attend , and for that reason his allegations that he had his fingers and toes massaged only on a few occasions were groundless . The applicant \u2019s fellow inmates , who had been carefully chosen , assisted him voluntarily in his DATE routine . This was not the result of the lack of personnel but of the applicant \u2019s refusal to cooperate with the nurses . The applicant was of the opinion that they were able to satisfy his needs . In FAC there was also a prisoner whose job was to help the disabled inmates in the presence of the medical staff . However , the applicant rejected the assistance of this person . The ORG maintained that the applicant had never complained about his inmates . On the contrary , on CARDINAL DATE he said that \u201c the inmates help willingly \u201d . Further , on DATE the applicant refused to be transferred to the neurological ward where he was to be provided with constant medical care and nursing . The applicant stated that the conditions in his cell were good and that he had cooperative inmates .", "CARDINAL . In spite of the applicant \u2019s allegations that he needed constant assistance , he managed to keep his cell tidy and was twice rewarded for that . His incontinence pads , sheets and underwear were changed adequately according to his needs .", "CARDINAL . The medical wards of the remand centres in GPE were well equipped for treating patients with multiple sclerosis . They offered the same level of treatment as received by patients in public hospitals . As indicated by the Chief Medical Officer of ORG of ORG , patients treated outside the prison system did not receive the same high level of constant medical care as patients with GPE in NORP prisons . For this reason , the applicant \u2019s claim that the pharmacological treatment had been insufficient to stop his health from deteriorating was groundless .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated CARDINAL DATE court - appointed experts in neurology and forensic medicine at the ORG categorically stated that the applicant was not , at the time of the report , or in the future , fit to be held in detention .", "CARDINAL . In a report of DATE the same medical experts submitted that the applicant \u2019s advanced multiple sclerosis posed an absolute obstacle to his detention . The experts noted that it was inevitable that the applicant \u2019s health would get worse , although they would expect him to experience short periods in which his illness could be expected to be more stable . The experts concluded that the applicant \u2019s detention in a prison hospital could be taken into consideration but only under the condition that the prison authorities would provide him with specialist neurological care , regular physiotherapy and nursing adequate to the degree of his illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same medical experts drafted a supplementary report in which they stressed that the applicant \u2019s detention should be considered only if he were assigned to the hospital wing , received specialised neurological care , constant physiotherapeutic care , nursing and almost permanent assistance by a person who would be able to help him with his daily routine ( prior to his imprisonment , the applicant was assisted by his wife ) . The above - mentioned conditions had to be strictly complied with to avoid a risk to the applicant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that in DATE a criminal case against the applicant was filed with ORG . The victims in this case informed the authorities that in DATE the applicant had arrived alone in a car at their plot of land .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the medical experts who had prepared the reports in DATE and DATE had not been provided with the ORG accounts who had seen the applicant walking in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same medical experts concluded in their supplementary report that the applicant could serve his sentence in FAC . The conditions ensured by the neurological ward of that remand centre were compatible with the applicant \u2019s needs . The supplementary report was drafted to clarify the DATE opinion . The experts stated that the applicant \u2019s condition was characterised by periods of deterioration ( lasting DATE ) and of remissions ( lasting DATE ) . If the applicant were to be detained in FAC , he needed to be provided with some help in his DATE routine ( bath ) , neurological consultations , hospitalisation in the neurological ward of FAC if necessary and TIME physiotherapy CARDINAL times a week . It was no longer required that the applicant be provided with permanent assistance in all basic DATE routines . The experts also stated that there was a risk that the applicant had exaggerated the seriousness of his condition which could not be excluded by means of medical examination . They noticed the improvement in his condition , which probably enabled the applicant to move in and out of his wheelchair independently and observed that the degree of paralysis of his legs and left arm was less pronounced than claimed by the applicant previously . The experts took into consideration the facts established in the proceedings before ORG that the applicant could move on his own and drive a car .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the applicant and his wife applied for temporary release ( przerwa w karze ) . Those requests were dismissed because the relevant penitentiary court considered , on the basis of the medical reports , that the medical care which was being provided to the applicant in the Gda\u0144sk Remand Centre was adequate and sufficient .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant and his wife submitted numerous complaints to the ORG , ORG , ORG of ORG ( ORG PERSON ) and other domestic authorities . In his letter of DATE and numerous subsequent communications the ORG informed the applicant \u2019s wife that her allegations concerning inadequate medical care provided to her husband had been ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Head of ORG of ORG informed the applicant \u2019s wife that her numerous complaints that her husband was receiving inadequate medical care in prison had been considered ill - founded . It was noted that the applicant had twice been detained in the remand centre \u2019s hospital where he had received adequate medical care . The applicant was signed up for regular physiotherapy sessions , which he had frequently refused to attend . It was acknowledged that the applicant required another person \u2019s assistance with his DATE routine . It was noted , however , that such assistance was being provided voluntarily by the applicant \u2019s fellow inmates . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s incontinence pads , sheets and underwear were changed adequately according to his needs .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the same authority once more informed the applicant \u2019s wife that her complaints had been considered illfounded . It was noted that the applicant \u2019s health had been stable for DATE and that he was being detained in the hospital wing where he was receiving adequate medical care . It was submitted that , following the recommendations of the physiotherapy specialist , the applicant was exercising CARDINAL times per week .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Head of ORG of ORG dismissed the complaints of the applicant \u2019s wife . It was noted that the applicant was being detained in a cell adapted to his special needs and that he had refused to attend his physiotherapy sessions , which had been taking place away from his cell . Further , he was assisted in his DATE routine by his inmates and prison nurses .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the same authority informed the applicant that he was being regularly assisted by a nurse .", "CARDINAL .
