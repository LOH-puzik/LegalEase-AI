ORG The applicant was a NORP citizen . Formerly a Minister , then Deputy Prime Minister and , in DATE , Prime Minister of GPE , he was a member of ORG at the time of the events giving rise to the present case . On DATE he was shot dead outside his home .", "CARDINAL . ORG On leaving GPE for GPE on DATE , the applicant was informed by the border police at FAC that an order had been made to withdraw his diplomatic passport . As the order was not shown to him , he refused to hand over his passport . Following a similar incident on DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , which rejected the appeal on the ground that no administrative decision had been taken which could form the subject of an appeal . Subsequently , the applicant brought proceedings to obtain compensation for non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the unlawful order to withdraw his passport ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Prosecutor - General requested ORG to authorise the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of having contravened Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . The suspicion related in particular to his participation as a Deputy Prime Minister DATE in a number of decisions granting sums , totalling MONEY ( ORG ) and CARDINAL convertible NORP leva , in assistance and loans to certain developing countries , including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The request stated :", "\" The decisions ... have dramatically affected the country \u2019s economic potential , its economic resources and export capacity , and have objectively speaking made it unable to repay its foreign debt . It should be emphasised that , due to decisions of this nature causing prejudice to the country and other illegal measures taken by party and government leaders during this period , our foreign debt rose from ORG in DATE to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE ...", "The situation described is covered by the definition of the offence of ` taking advantage of one \u2019s position\u2019 in respect of very large amounts of money , which constitutes a particularly serious matter falling within the provisions in LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW .", "The offences mentioned are ` ORG within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the LAW . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG waived the applicant \u2019s parliamentary immunity under LAW and authorised criminal proceedings against him and his arrest and detention on remand .", "CARDINAL .

In breach of his official duties , he had facilitated the misappropriation in order to obtain an advantage for a third party , thereby causing considerable economic damage . In view of the very large amounts of money involved , the case was a particularly serious one .", "The prosecutor in addition ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand , citing as grounds the need to show to the public the danger that the offences in question represented to society , the applicant \u2019s identity and the need to secure his appearance before the trial court . The decision referred , inter alia , to ORG and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody at the premises of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal with ORG , requesting his release . She maintained that , contrary to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , the arrest warrant had failed to specify the grounds for his arrest . The fact that he risked a sentence of DATE imprisonment could not in itself justify his detention since , under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , it was also a condition that there should be a risk of his absconding or of his committing a further crime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In addition , the measures had been taken on the basis of the applicant \u2019s identity , notably the fact that he was a member of ORG , a consideration which was not covered by any of the grounds that were exhaustively listed in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG At a court session held on DATE , at which the public prosecutor but not the applicant or his lawyer was present , ORG dismissed the appeal . Its decision included the following reasoning :", "\" Under LAW para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure a suspect is to be detained on remand if the offence is punishable by DATE imprisonment or more or by the death penalty . Offences under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , of LAW carry such sentences .", "[ The above provision ] lays down CARDINAL cumulative conditions - the misappropriation must have occurred on a large scale and must have been particularly serious .", "[ Whether the misappropriation has occurred ] on a particularly large scale depends on the value of the public property involved . The seriousness of the case is determined on the basis of whether the misappropriation was carried out with the complicity of others , the level of the threat to society involved in the [ measures ] and the subject matter ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , of LAW ) . The argument that the eventuality envisaged in LAW para . CARDINAL ... applies in the instant case is unfounded .", "When the accusation was made the applicant was a member of ORG . By virtue of LAW he holds this status until such circumstances occur as may warrant the suspension from his functions as a member of ORG . In his capacity as member of ORG the [ applicant ] represents the people as a whole . It is precisely in this capacity that the [ risk ] mentioned in LAW para . CARDINAL ... will materialise , and the likelihood of this is greater than in the case of an appellant who is not a member of ORG .", "Furthermore , the applicant has lodged a judicial appeal against the administrative measure resulting in the withdrawal of his diplomatic passport ... The fact that he has taken such a step gives good grounds for fearing that he will not refrain from committing acts of the type mentioned in LAW para . CARDINAL ...", "According to LAW ... , except in cases of serious crimes and where permission has been given by ORG , its members may not be detained and no charges may be brought against them ... \u2019 . A logical and systematic interpretation of the aforesaid provision suggests that [ what is decisive for ] the measure of restraint , ` detention\u2019 , [ to be applied ] in the context of LAW is whether the act entails a great danger to society and the particular status of the person who has committed it - a member of ORG .", "For this reason the legislature envisaged ... detention in [ such ] cases . The prosecutor \u2019s office has power to impose such a measure . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant was hospitalised at ORG , where he received treatment .", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s lawyer made a request for his release to the public prosecutor .", "At a meeting on DATE between the public prosecutor and the applicant and his lawyer at ORG in GPE , the lawyer invited the prosecutor to take a decision on the request for release . The applicant himself maintained that it was unreasonable to base his detention on the fact that he had complained about the withdrawal of his passport . He did not have any other passport . Nor was there any danger of his repeating the offence , as he was no longer in a position to do so .", "On DATE the public prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release . He gave as reasons that ORG had already dealt with it and had been of the view that , notwithstanding the medical reports concerning the applicant , there were no new circumstances warranting his release .

The decisions of ORG had been taken collectively in accordance with the LAW and the budget voted by ORG . The decisions in question had been taken simply with a view to implementing policies of the government in power at the time and it was the government , not the applicant as a Deputy Prime Minister , which had administered the relevant funds . In any event , it had not been established that the applicant had committed the offences in issue for his own benefit or for that of a third party .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL of the Convention ( article CARDINAL ) and that , contrary to LAW CARDINAL ( c ) ( article QUANTITY ) , no grounds had been given for his detention . The argument that the applicant had appealed against the order to withdraw his passport was unfounded as he had only exercised his rights under NORP law . The lawyer refused to comment on the allegation that the applicant constituted a particular danger to society on account of his position as member of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
