The father was ORG , a NORP national . In DATE the couple split up .", "CARDINAL . The child lived with her parents in GPE until DATE , when she was sent to her paternal grandparents in GPE . She remained there until DATE . From DATE until DATE the couple again lived together with their daughter in GPE ; then , with the father \u2019s consent , the applicant returned with her daughter to GPE for what was meant to be a short stay with the child \u2019s maternal grandmother . The applicant remained with her daughter in GPE until DATE and subsequently returned to GPE to work , leaving the child in GPE with her maternal grandmother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child \u2019s paternal grandparents visited the child in GPE . With the maternal grandmother \u2019s consent , they took the child to town for ice - cream , accompanied by her aunt ( the wife of the applicant \u2019s brother ) . They stopped the car on the side of the road , expelled the aunt from the car and then returned to GPE , taking the child with them without the knowledge or consent of the applicant or her family . The child has been living in GPE with her paternal grandparents ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a request for full custody of the child with the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . She initially indicated that ORG was living in GPE with her family . However , during the proceedings the applicant told the court that ORG no longer lived in GPE and that she did not know his whereabouts . As a summons could therefore not be served on him , it was posted at the court \u2019s LOC and published in a newspaper . Later on the applicant provided an address in GPE , which turned out to be incomplete .", "CARDINAL . The court postponed CARDINAL times the examination of the case , mainly on account of attempts made by the applicant and her lawyer to establish ORG \u2019s whereabouts and to secure his presence in court . On DATE the ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses for the applicant . On DATE , the applicant informed the court that her daughter had been kidnapped by the paternal grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG awarded custody of the child to the applicant , on the basis of the evidence in the case file , including the witness evidence and a report made by ORG following a visit in the applicant \u2019s home . The parties had DATE to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG sought leave to appeal outside the time limit ( cerere de repunere PERSON termenul de apel ) , submitting that he had been living in GPE with his parents throughout the period of the proceedings and that the applicant had known of that fact . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the ground that ORG had not been legally summoned to appear . It sent the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case file was again registered with ORG . CARDINAL hearings were held and the applicant and/or her counsel were present at all of them . The court heard evidence from the CARDINAL parents and from CARDINAL witnesses ( CARDINAL for each party \u2013 ORG summoned his neighbours from GPE ) and ordered the child protection agencies in GPE and GPE to investigate the living conditions both in the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s home and in the paternal PERSON home in GPE . The latter investigation was ordered by the court on DATE ; the court order arrived at ORG \u2019s counsel \u2019s office on CARDINAL DATE and the latter added to the case file the final report of that investigation in both NORP and NORP on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG again awarded custody to the applicant . The court also noted that on DATE ORG had instituted similar proceedings in GPE . Given that he had lodged his application for full custody of the child with the NORP courts only after the applicant had lodged her request with the NORP courts , ORG considered that it had jurisdiction to deal with the matter . On the merits , the court considered that while the living conditions offered by the father and paternal grandparents were superior to the ones available in the applicant \u2019s home , the father and the paternal grandparents did not set the child a satisfactory moral example . Regarding this point , the court referred to ORG \u2019s criminal past and to the manner in which the paternal grandparents had kidnapped the child .", "CARDINAL . The father lodged an appeal and the case was heard by ORG . CARDINAL hearings took place before ORG and both the applicant and her counsel were present at all of them . He ( that is to say the father ) asked the court to interview the child , who was aged DATE at that time . On DATE the court granted that request . On DATE the applicant gave notarised consent for her daughter to obtain travel documents and to cross the border into GPE . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the said notarised consent was not sufficient for the NORP authorities . The applicant offered to travel to GPE to assist in the formalities necessary to obtain a passport . On DATE ORG acknowledged the situation and ordered the applicant to travel to GPE . It also ordered ORG to allow contact between the mother and the child for the purposes of making travel arrangements . After the applicant \u2019s visit to GPE , the child was brought before the court on DATE . The child told the court in a private hearing , with the help of a NORP translator , that she would prefer to stay with her father and paternal grandparents in GPE ; that she spoke on the phone with her mother occasionally ; that she could not remember her maternal grandmother ; and that she did not like being in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted custody of the child to the father on the grounds that the child was already integrated into her environment in GPE , where she had lived for DATE , and that she did not speak NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . ORG held CARDINAL hearing , at which the parties and their respective counsel were present . ORG re - examined the facts and concluded that ORG had interpreted the situation erroneously and had disregarded the child \u2019s \u201c best interests \u201d . It therefore quashed ORG decision and upheld the decision rendered by ORG . ORG delivered its final ruling in the case on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , seeking temporary custody of her daughter pending the outcome of the custody proceedings , lodged a request for interim measures . On DATE her application was rejected by ORG on the ground that as at that time the child had already been living with her paternal grandparents in GPE for over DATE , it would not be in her interests to temporarily remove her from her usual environment and place her with her mother until the end of the custody proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed ; on DATE ORG dismissed her appeal , upholding ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought recognition in GPE of DATE judgment of the first - instance NORP court that had given custody of the child to her ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG granted her request on CARDINAL DATE , finding that the NORP judgment had become final in the absence of an appeal within the statutory time - limit ( as indicated in paragraph CARDINAL , the judgment was appealed later , outside the statutory limits ) . On DATE ORG upheld this decision , which \u2013 as it was not appealed against \u2013 became final on an unspecified date . The applicant was issued with a writ of enforcement on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to a NORP enforcement officer , who brought enforcement proceedings immediately . The authorities unsuccessfully attempted on several occasions to personally serve an invitation for voluntary compliance on ORG Having noted that he was working abroad for an indefinite period , the summons was posted twice \u2013 on CARDINAL and DATE on the entrance gate at ORG \u2019s address . On DATE the enforcement officer appointed a lawyer to represent ORG as he had not been located .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement officer scheduled the handover of the child to the applicant for CARDINAL DATE and asked the police and the social services to assist him on DATE . Notice of the handover was personally served on ORG on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE lawyers acting on behalf of ORG brought judicial review proceedings in respect of the enforcement officer \u2019s actions ; those proceedings were dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the unsuccessful attempt on CARDINAL DATE to locate the child at the address of her paternal grandparents with whom she lived , the enforcement officer fined ORG MONEY ( ORG ) for failure to cooperate and scheduled DATE as the new date for the child \u2019s transfer to the applicant . The enforcement officer also directed the social services to help to ensure for the child a smooth transition to life with the applicant by , inter alia , arranging a meeting with a psychologist . On DATE the social services drew up a report on the child , which concluded that abruptly removing the child from her usual environment \u2013 and thus separating her from the adults who provided her with emotional and physical security \u2013 would be detrimental to her development . The report noted that the child needed to be assisted in the process of re - establishing a relationship with her mother .", "CARDINAL . Upon a request of ORG , on DATE ORG suspended the enforcement proceedings brought by the applicant . It did so following ORG \u2019s request for the reopening of the proceedings for the recognition of the NORP judgment on custody .", "CARDINAL . Following the suspension of the enforcement proceedings brought by the applicant in GPE ( see the preceding paragraph ) , on DATE , within the context of the reopening of the proceedings for recognition of the NORP judgment , ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG found that ORG had not been summoned in accordance with the applicable procedural rules and as a result had been unable to take part in the proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment which had determined custody of his daughter . More specifically , he had only learned of those proceedings on DATE , when he had received notice to hand the child over . In the same decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG remitted the case to ORG for a new examination and decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the applicant \u2019s request for the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment of CARDINAL DATE granting custody to her ( see paragraph DATE above ) , which had become final and enforceable on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG recognised that judgment and authorised its execution in GPE . Upon an appeal by ORG , ORG upheld that decision on DATE . On DATE ORG rejected ORG \u2019s cassation appeal ; the decision therefore became final on that date .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , on an unspecified date , the applicant brought new enforcement proceedings in GPE seeking implementation of the final NORP judgment granting custody to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon ORG \u2019s request ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG suspended the enforcement . The court observed that ORG had in the meantime brought proceedings in GPE for a change of custody in respect of the child . It then noted that the child had settled well in GPE , both in terms of emotional and material comfort , having been living there uninterruptedly since DATE . The child only spoke NORP , had adapted to and quite enjoyed her schooling environment , and showed interest in the extra - curricular activities she attended . Also , she enjoyed a particularly close and warm relationship with her paternal grandparents , who were caring remarkably well for her . The court found that , in view of the above and the fact that proceedings for a change of custody were pending before the NORP courts , a sudden change in the child \u2019s environment would not be in her interests . The court then granted ORG \u2019s request and suspended the enforcement .", "CARDINAL . Following a telephone conversation between the applicant and an employee of ORG , the applicant was invited to lodge a request for the return of her daughter under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant lodged a request for the return of the child with ORG , ORG for the purpose of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested further clarification from the applicant , in particular asking her to explain why she had waited for such a long time before lodging her request . They informed her that any application lodged DATE after the abduction could be rejected . On DATE the Ministry of Justice further informed the applicant that she could request the return of her child either under the terms of LAW or under the terms of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They advised her to lodge her request either directly with the competent NORP authority or through ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s initial request was transmitted by ORG to ORG , ORG for the purpose of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the request had been refused as LAW had not entered into force between GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also informed the applicant and her counsel about the outcome of the proceedings before ORG . They advised the applicant to apply directly to the NORP courts ( under LAW ) or to ORG ( either directly or through ORG , under the provisions of LAW and on Restoration of Custody of Children \u2013 \u201c FAC \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted to ORG a request lodged by the applicant under LAW , which in its view took precedence over LAW . In the absence of any response to that request , on DATE ORG repeated the request to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed its NORP counterpart that it had refused the request . In its view LAW did not apply , as the child had entered NORP territory before the entry into force of that LAW and GPE . Consequently , the Brussels II bis Regulation did not apply either , as it was not meant to be applicable outside the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG unsuccessfully brought proceedings in GPE seeking custody of the child . Those proceedings were terminated on DATE by ORG ; the decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE ORG brought a second set of proceedings in GPE before ORG in which he sought custody of the child . His request for interim measures , namely for the child to live with his parents in GPE and for him to have custody of her , as well as for the suspension of the enforcement proceedings brought in DATE in GPE by the applicant , was refused by the same court in DATE . The court suspended the proceedings on DATE as it had determined that another set of proceedings \u2013 between the same parties concerning the same issue \u2013 was pending in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the CARDINAL DATE final judgment of the NORP courts granting custody of the child to the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG brought a third set of proceedings before ORG , seeking a change of custody due to a change in circumstances . ORG terminated these proceedings on CARDINAL DATE as it found that the second set of proceedings ORG had brought before it ( see the preceding paragraph ) concerning the same issue and involving the same parties was still pending , as those proceedings had only been suspended on DATE and not terminated .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently ORG asked the court to terminate the second set of proceedings he had brought , and the court did so on DATE . On DATE ORG appealed against the termination of the third set of proceedings he had brought . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG granted his request , quashed the termination of those proceedings and remitted the case to the first - instance court for examination . Within the context of those proceedings , in DATE ORG sought as a protective measure ( \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u044f\u0440\u043a\u0430 ) the suspension of the enforcement proceedings of the NORP judgment granting custody to the applicant . His request was granted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . No information is available regarding developments in those proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
