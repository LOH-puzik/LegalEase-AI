AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Eyyub Zakir oglu PERSON ( Eyyub PERSON o\u011flu PERSON ) , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government was represented by Mr C. Asgarov , Agent of GPE before the ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE an article called \u201c LOC Deputy Prosecutor \u2013 A ORG \u201d was published in a local newspaper DATE , of which the applicant was the chief editor . The article depicted the prosecutor , ORG , as an incompetent and unprofessional prosecutor who was able to hold high - ranking posts in the prosecution authorities only due to his good personal contacts with top - level officials . The article stated , inter alia , that ORG \u201c had no idea of the working methods of the prosecutor \u2019s office , and his work was limited to wandering around corridors \u201d .", "On DATE ORG filed a lawsuit against the newspaper , claiming that the article was defamatory and damaging his reputation . He asked the court to close the newspaper , order it to pay compensation and institute criminal proceedings against the persons responsible for the article \u2019s publication .", "The newspaper , represented by the applicant , filed a counterclaim , contending that ORG , by filing an allegedly abusive and frivolous lawsuit against the newspaper , damaged the newspaper \u2019s professional reputation .", "On DATE the ORG partially upheld ORG \u2019s claim and dismissed the newspaper \u2019s counterclaim . The court held that the article contained defamatory material and that the newspaper had been unable to prove its truthfulness . It ordered the newspaper to pay compensation to ORG and to \u201c terminate the publication and distribution \u201d of the newspaper in accordance with ORG .", "The applicant , on behalf of the newspaper , filed an appeal . He claimed that the termination of the newspaper \u2019s publication in fact amounted to a liquidation of the newspaper as a legal entity . He further claimed that such closure of the newspaper was unlawful , because the court could not order a liquidation of a legal entity based on a defamation complaint made by an individual . Instead , in accordance with LAW , the court could order such liquidation only upon an application by the relevant government or local authority .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment as lawful . At this point , in accordance with the domestic civil procedure law , the judgment entered into legal force and the enforcement proceedings were instituted . On DATE the Head of ORG ( PERSON v\u0259 ORG ) sent a letter to the applicant , requesting the newspaper to comply with the judgment voluntarily within a DATE period . It appears that the newspaper \u2019s management complied with this request in a timely manner . Accordingly , the production and distribution of the newspaper was terminated and the moral compensation was paid to ORG by DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , on behalf of the newspaper \u2019s editorial board , filed a cassation appeal with ORG . He claimed that ORG had committed the same errors of fact and law as the district court . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG judgment .", "According to the Government , although the production and distribution of the NORP newspaper had been terminated , the newspaper \u2019s editorial staff continued their activities through GPE \u2019s legal successor , a newspaper called NORP CARDINAL . The applicant noted that Femida CARDINAL was simply an addendum to the newspaper and not its legal successor .", "\u201c CARDINAL . A [ first - instance ] judgment enters into legal force after DATE from the date of its delivery , unless an appeal has been filed against it [ with the appellate court ] .", "CARDINAL . A judgment , which [ has been appealed but ] has not been quashed on appeal , enters into legal force upon the delivery of the appellate court \u2019s judgment [ upholding the first - instance judgment ] . ...", "\u201c A judgment is subject to execution after its entry into legal force ... \u201d", "\u201c A judgment of the appellate - instance court enters into legal force from the moment of its delivery . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Upon a petition by a party to the case , the cassation - instance court may suspend , until the end of the cassation proceedings , the execution of the appellate court \u2019s judgment and the related judgment of the first - instance court ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
