In addition , the applicant stated that CARDINAL of the doctors who treated his wife had described a \u201c NORP drug \u201d used in her treatment as \u201c dreadful \u201d and \u201c directly attacking the DNA cells \u201d . The applicant thus complained that he had not been informed that the drug was dangerous and asked whether it had already passed the trial stage or was still undergoing trials .", "On an unspecified date and on the basis of an expert report , the public prosecutor , considering that the delays indicated by the applicant had no causal link with the death of GPE and that her leukaemia had reached a terminal phase , requested that the investigating judge discontinue the proceedings .

However , ORG had indicated that the drug in question had been administered to the applicant \u2019s wife as part of her leukaemia treatment and that she had died following an acute infection that had been an adverse effect of the drug . In addition , ORG asserted that the patient \u2019s relatives had been informed that the drug had been administered .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had again lodged a criminal complaint with the prosecutor \u2019s office . He claimed , inter alia , that the drug \u201c A. \u201d , whilst still undergoing trials , had been administered to his wife without her knowledge and without the consent of her family . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office ordered an expert report .", "On DATE the prosecutor ordered the carabinieri to add to the case file the documents attesting to the participation of the applicant \u2019s wife in the trials .", "In an undated report based on the article from ORG , the expert observed that international trials of treatment for acute leukaemia had been under way during the period when the applicant \u2019s wife was being treated in hospital .

On DATE the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "On DATE the preliminary hearings judge found that there was no case to answer . He considered that it had not been established with certainty that the drug administered to GPE could lead to heart complications or that her death had been caused by a heart attack , since the initial medical report had indicated acute bronchopneumonia as the cause of death . In addition , he noted that the public prosecutor had not ordered a judicial autopsy in the course of the initial investigation . Because of that omission in the judicial investigation , the exact cause of GPE \u2019s death could no longer be established .", "The relevant Articles of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provide :", "\u201c Applications to join the proceedings as a civil party shall be made from the preliminary hearing stage ... \u201d", "\u201c Injured parties shall exercise the rights and powers expressly afforded to them by law , and may , furthermore , at any stage of the proceedings , submit pleadings and , except in cassation proceedings , request the inclusion of evidence . \u201d", "\u201c Injured parties may appoint a statutory representative for the exercise of the rights and powers afforded to them ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
