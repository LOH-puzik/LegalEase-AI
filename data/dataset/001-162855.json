The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Barking .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE . He claimed asylum on DATE but his claim was refused by the Secretary of ORG for ORG on DATE and his appeal against that decision was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of indecent assault in relation to an incident involving CARDINAL DATE girls and was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . He was released on licence on DATE but his licence was revoked on DATE that year because he failed to comply with the terms of the licence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was re - arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with the decision to make a deportation order . On DATE he was detained pursuant to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s powers under paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to ORG , etc . ) Act DATE . The deportation order was signed on CARDINAL DATE and served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant indicated that he wished to return to GPE . DATE an application was submitted to the NORP authorities for an emergency travel document to enable him to travel there . However , the application was rejected by the NORP authorities on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently interviewed at ORG on DATE . However , DATE the ORG informed his solicitors that they could not issue a travel document as no formal identification of the applicant had been provided . On DATE ORG was informed that ORG required a birth certificate before any travel documents could be issued . It appears that ORG thereafter proposed to submit copy documents . ORG initially agreed to this proposal , but later refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings challenging his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG agreed to issue a travel document provided that the applicant was prepared to sign a \u201c disclaimer \u201d consenting to his return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention subject to a number of conditions , including that he be subject to a curfew ; that he remain at a fixed address ; that he report on a DATE basis to the nearest ORG office ; and that he take the steps necessary to obtain travel documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant refused to sign a \u201c disclaimer \u201d on DATE . Although he was released on DATE , DATE the matter was brought back to ORG and a different judge discharged the previous order on account of his failure to comply with the conditions for release ( namely , that he take the steps necessary to obtain travel documents ) . As a consequence , the applicant was once again liable to detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reported that they had on CARDINAL occasions attempted to visit the applicant at his nominated address to install the equipment required for electronic tagging . Both visits took place during TIME of curfew . Very shortly afterwards the applicant reported a different address to the immigration authorities so that they could continue to communicate with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an authority was issued for the applicant \u2019s detention and on DATE he was detained while reporting to the immigration authorities .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the authorities had been alerted to the fact that the applicant was showing some signs of psychological disturbance , had been diagnosed with \u201c reactive depression \u201d and was receiving medication for his psychological symptoms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claim for judicial review launched on CARDINAL DATE was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attended at ORG on DATE but no travel document was issued . On DATE he again refused to sign a disclaimer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was alleged to have displayed \u201c inappropriate behaviour \u201d to a female member of immigration staff at a detention centre . His behaviour was also alleged to have been disruptive .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or around DATE the immigration authorities discussed the possibility of prosecuting the applicant under LAW of ORG , etc ) Act DATE for failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the Secretary of ORG \u2019s requirement to take specified action to enable a travel document to be obtained . However , no prosecution was ever mounted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG , indicating that he would be willing to return to GPE if he were to be compensated for the periods of detention which he had undergone . However , ORG refused to agree to any such request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE the authorities made further attempts to engage the applicant in a voluntary return . However , on each occasion he indicated that he was not willing to co - operate or sign a disclaimer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE the applicant made CARDINAL applications for bail to ORG . On each occasion the application was dismissed . The reasons given for the dismissal of the applications included the fact that the applicant could end his own detention by signing the disclaimer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote a letter before action on DATE and proceedings were issued on DATE . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant permission to apply for judicial review and ORG was ordered to release him on bail within TIME .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing counsel for the applicant argued that both periods of the applicant \u2019s detention could properly be looked at as being unlawful , although he focused his attention on the second period . Counsel for the Secretary of ORG for ORG argued DATE and the court appears to have accepted \u2013 that the first period could not be in question legally , since the applicant had been released for DATE pursuant to a court order and the order enforcing release had been discharged . However , he conceded that when considering the lawfulness of the second period of detention , the first period of detention would have to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . In considering the lawfulness of the second period of detention , ORG judge recalled that the authorities should be free to make strenuous efforts to obtain the assent of a person they proposed to deport . If they were unsuccessful , they could and should seek any way around his consent , for example by persuading the country of origin to issue a travel document without a disclaimer . However , the judge noted that the law did not permit the indefinite detention of someone who was never going to consent to deportation .", "CARDINAL . Bearing that in mind , the judge considered the history of the applicant \u2019s second period of detention . He observed that during this period there had been no change in approach to the applicant , no prosecution had been brought under LAW , and there had been no further approach to the NORP authorities to see if they would change their position .", "CARDINAL . The judge then had regard to the relevant principles of domestic law set out in R v. The Governor of ORG , ex parte ORG PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL and in the guidance given by ORG in both R ( A ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL and ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Applying those principles and the relevant guidance , the judge noted that the most important factor justifying detention was the applicant \u2019s refusal to sign the relevant disclaimer . He further noted that lengthy detention could be justified by the applicant \u2019s offending , by the realistic fear that he would further offend and by the genuine and reasonable concern that he might abscond . However , even given those factors , the judge found that there had to come a time when such a sterile tactic as merely sitting and waiting while repeatedly urging the applicant to change his mind , in full expectation that he would not , ceased to be detention genuinely for the purpose of deportation . The judge therefore concluded that \u201c the woeful lack of energy and impetus \u201d applied to this case from at least DATE meant that it could not possibly be said that the Secretary of ORG on this occasion had complied with the obligation in PERSON to act with \u201c reasonable diligence and expedition \u201d . He therefore held that the applicant \u2019s detention had been unlawful from DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the question of whether there should be guidance on how long it might be appropriate to detain an individual , the judge made the following observations :", "\u201c It can not be right for the Secretary of ORG to be led to believe , by looking at a digest of the range of decisions that have been taken , that it is safe to detain for X DATE or X years .", "Equally , it can not be right for those who are in the positon of being detained for considerable periods , stubbornly refusing to comply with the authority \u2019s requests to facilitate voluntary repatriation , to be put in a position of saying , \u2018 If I hold on DATE , or DATE , or DATE , then I am all right\u2019 . A tariff is repugnant and wrong , and it seems to me that it would be wise for those preparing legally for such cases to abandon the attempt to ask the courts to set such a tariff by a review of the different periods established in different cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant was awarded GBP CARDINAL in damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal . On DATE permission to appeal was refused . However , on DATE the applicant renewed his application for permission to appeal and on DATE he was granted permission to appeal only in respect of the quantum of damages awarded . The outcome of that appeal is unknown ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
