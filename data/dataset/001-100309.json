The first applicant , Mr PERSON , born in DATE , settled in GPE in DATE . Soon after that he met the second applicant , born in DATE . Their first daughter , the third applicant , was born on DATE . The first and second applicants married on DATE . Their second daughter , the fourth applicant , was born on DATE . On an unspecified date Mr PERSON was granted a permanent residence permit in GPE . He learned NORP and started his own business . He owns a hotel and a restaurant in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG ordered the expulsion of Mr PERSON . He also deprived him of the right to reside in GPE and excluded him from NORP territory for a period of DATE . The order , which was based on sections DATE and CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , relied on", "\u201c the reasons set out in proposal no . M-CARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and the fact that [ Mr PERSON 's ] presence in the country represent[ed ] a serious threat to national security \u201d .", "No factual grounds were given . It was indicated in the order that it was immediately enforceable , as provided for in section LANGUAGE of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was detained . On DATE he was deported to GPE . Subsequently he settled in GPE , GPE , where his wife and daughters visit him .", "CARDINAL . Once abroad , Mr PERSON retained a lawyer who lodged with ORG an application for judicial review of the expulsion order of CARDINAL DATE . He argued that no reasons had been given for the order and that the relevant factual circumstances had not been duly established . Furthermore , he pointed out that he had a family in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the ensuing proceedings the ORG accepted in evidence the classified proposal referred to in the impugned order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The proposal apparently stated that PERSON PERSON was suspected of affiliation to extremist groups and trafficking in human beings . It is unclear whether Mr PERSON 's representative was also given an opportunity to familiarise himself with the document .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court gave judgment on DATE . Relying on the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , it found that the bar to judicial review set out in section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was contrary to LAW and was thus to be disregarded .", "CARDINAL . Examining Mr PERSON 's application on the merits , ORG found that the order of CARDINAL DATE was lawful as it had been issued by a competent authority and in accordance with the law . Referring to different legal provisions relating to national security , it continued as follows :", "\u201c As can be seen from the text of proposal no . M-CARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , the measures imposed [ on Mr PERSON ] by virtue of the disputed order are aimed at the prevention of unlawful activity , as described in [ the provisions on national security ] , namely affiliation of PERSON to extremist groups and participation in organised trafficking in human beings into countries of ORG . The data related to these activities have been collected lawfully , by operational means within the competence of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the Sofia City Court found that it was not necessary to examine Mr PERSON 's arguments relating to his family life in GPE . It held :", "\u201c In view of the issues raised in the present case , the arguments set out in [ Mr PERSON 's ] application referring to his lawful residence in the country and his being married to a NORP citizen are irrelevant . The administrative measures [ at issue ] are not of a punitive character , but aim at the prevention of the alien 's unlawful activity described above . Collecting objective data related to unlawful activity suffices to justify the [ impugned ] order . The administrative body was competent to assess in each specific case the extent to which the country 's security was threatened and the effectiveness of the measures to be applied \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr PERSON appealed against ORG judgment . He argued that he had been unable to understand which actions on his part had been deemed to threaten national security and that the conclusions about his alleged unlawful activity set out in the proposal of CARDINAL DATE had no evidentiary value as they needed themselves to be proven . Once again , he pointed out that he had a family in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG judgment . It found that the data relating to the first applicant 's alleged unlawful activity had been collected in accordance with the law and that the impugned expulsion order had been \u201c reasonably related to the facts set out in the proposal \u201d . It held that", "\u201c the burden to disprove these facts rested on [ Mr PERSON ] who has not presented evidence in support of his arguments \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that PERSON PERSON had been able effectively to challenge the impugned order as he had been represented by counsel in the judicial proceedings . The measures against him had been based on grounds of national security , which necessitated \u201c certain restrictions of the possibilities to defend oneself \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the first applicant 's arguments about his right to family life and dismissed them . It noted that the right to family life was protected under LAW ; however , under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL it was acceptable to interfere with a person 's right to family life in the interests of national security . Furthermore , it held :", "\u201c The right to respect for one 's family life is not an absolute right , which always has to prevail ... The interference with the alien 's family life is the result of the coercive administrative measure [ which Mr PERSON ] has to endure in case the family does not settle in the country he has chosen to reside in after his expulsion from GPE . The coercive administrative measure prevents the person from exercising the unlawful activity which justified its imposition , and the separation itself , if it poses a problem for the family , can be resolved by the spouses \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice have been summarised in the ORG 's judgments in the cases of GPE and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no .
