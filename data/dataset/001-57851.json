Mr PERSON is a NORP national . He is an economist and resides at ORG in GPE . At the material time , he was employed by ORG ( Sveriges Industrif\u00f6rbund ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant formed together with others a foundation named ORG . According to him its aim was to scrutinise governments of communist regimes in LOC and ORG ( ORG socialdemokratiska arbetareparti - the \" SAP \" ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a publishing house , GPE f\u00f6rlag ORG , published a book entitled \" Till h\u00f6ger om neutraliteten \" ( To the right of neutrality ) . It contained a survey of right - wing organisations and individuals , including a CARDINAL-page chapter on the applicant and his involvement in ORG . The author of the book , Mr PERSON , was then employed by the publisher and had previously served as an ideological adviser to the ORG .", "PERSON f\u00f6rlag ORG was , from its foundation in DATE until DATE , owned by the ORG directly . As of the latter date , PERCENT of its shares were held by a company owned by the ORG , namely ORG . PERCENT were held by GPE Centralorganisation which , the applicant states , was controlled by the ORG . GPE f\u00f6rlag GPE is known for publishing books and articles portraying social democratic views .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a private prosecution for aggravated libel ( grovt f\u00f6rtal ) , and in the alternative for libel ( f\u00f6rtal ) , against Mr Hansson in ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , under LAW , section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL Freedom of the Press Act ( tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen , an instrument forming part of LAW ) and LAW , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ( brottsbalken ) . In the same proceedings he sued both the author and the publisher for damages , claiming MONEY . He contended that the book contained allegations implying that he belonged to certain nazi and fascist groups , calculated to cast doubt on his honour and to expose him to contempt ; in view of the wide distribution of the book and the applicant \u2019s central position in GPE , the libel was aggravated .", "The impugned passages of the book included allegations which can be summarised as follows :", "( a ) in DATE the applicant had chaired the youth section of the World Anti - Communist League \u2019s Conference in GPE , an organisation whose membership was said to consist largely of neo - nazis and former ORG - members , for example the then chairman of the NORP - oriented ORG ;", "( b ) the applicant had , by reason of his right - wing extremism , been expelled in DATE from ORG and ORG ; it was therefore regrettable that he still held important positions within ORG and the NORP Employers\u2019 Federation ;", "( c ) he had been reported to the police for embezzlement of ORG funds ; an audit had shown that he had transferred MONEY from the association \u2019s account to his own account ;", "( d ) he had failed to dissociate himself immediately from a co - member of a splinter group of ORG , who had provided grenades to CARDINAL ORG activists and who had urged the latter to place one of the grenades in an office of ORG and advised them on how to enter the office ; the activists had been convicted of having placed the grenades and the applicant \u2019s associate of having aided and abetted causing bodily harm ;", "( e ) ORG had been collaborating with the above - mentioned ORG in GPE and GPE and the applicant had negotiated with the latter about the setting up of a local ORG group ;", "( f ) organisations like ORG were infiltrated to the highest echelons by neo - nazi groups , which selected the most militant members of such organisations and incited them to engage in illegal activities .", "CARDINAL . At a sitting held by ORG on DATE , the defendants , but not the applicant , asked for the case to be considered with a jury . As a result of the GPE request , the question whether a criminal offence had been committed was to be examined , according to the provisions of the Freedom of the Press Act , by a jury , composed on the basis of a list of CARDINAL groups of names ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) . The list , which had been published by ORG ( Stockholms l\u00e4ns landsting ) , indicated the ORG political affiliations . The first group comprised CARDINAL persons , CARDINAL of whom were members of the ORG , CARDINAL of ORG , CARDINAL of ORG , CARDINAL of ORG and CARDINAL of ORG . The second group included CARDINAL names , of whom CARDINAL were members of the ORG , CARDINAL of ORG and CARDINAL of ORG .", "The applicant , referring to paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , filed a complaint with ORG under LAW , section CARDINAL , of DATE , asking it to exclude as being disqualified those jurors who were members of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In support of his request , he pointed to the position as regards ownership of GPE f\u00f6rlag GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and argued that the publisher was the \" mouthpiece \" of the social democratic movement . However , ORG rejected his request on DATE , finding that , regardless of whether the publisher could be seen as a \" mouthpiece \" as described by the applicant , the reasons invoked by him did not constitute grounds for disqualifying the jurors concerned .", "In an appeal against this decision to ORG ( PERSON ) , the applicant submitted , in addition to the above arguments , that the contents of the book were of a political nature and that the case had political undertones . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE , without stating any reasons . It was not open to the applicant to appeal further against this decision ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Freedom of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , at the above - mentioned sitting on DATE , ORG proceeded with the constitution of the jury in accordance with LAW of the Freedom of LAW . Exercising their right under section CARDINAL , the applicant and the defence each rejected CARDINAL jurors from the first group and CARDINAL from the second group . Those eliminated by the applicant were all ORG members and those by the defendants were members of ORG . Lots were drawn in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph CARDINAL below , and a jury of CARDINAL members was constituted . Of these , CARDINAL were members of the ORG - one of the them was subsequently replaced by another ORG member - , CARDINAL of ORG , one of ORG and CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As appears from information submitted by the applicant , which was not contested by the Government , the ORG jurors were active members of the ORG , holding or having held various offices in it and on its behalf at local level ( for further details , see paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges and a jury of CARDINAL , examined the merits of the case . In its judgment of DATE the court noted that the jury had replied in the negative to the questions put to it concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the impugned passages of the book . Accordingly , ORG dismissed the charges made by the applicant and his claims for damages . In view of the conclusions reached on the merits , it ordered him to pay MONEY in costs .", "It was not possible under NORP law for the applicant to appeal against the jury \u2019s verdict ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In GPE freedom of expression as regards the printed word is regulated by the DATE Freedom of the Press Act , which has constitutional status . The first such LAW dates back to DATE . The jury system was introduced when a revised version of the LAW entered into force in DATE . The merits of the system underwent a thorough examination in the course of the revision which led to the DATE version of the LAW . However , the predominant view was that the jury system constituted an important safeguard of press freedom in GPE and that it should be maintained . For similar reasons , more recent proposals to abolish the jury system have also been resisted .", "CARDINAL . LAW of the LAW contains special provisions governing judicial proceedings instituted to establish civil or criminal liability for prohibited statements in print ( section CARDINAL ) . These cases are heard by ORG within whose jurisdiction the county administration has its seat ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . It sits with CARDINAL judges and , in proceedings brought under the LAW , also with a jury of CARDINAL members to examine whether a criminal offence has been committed or whether civil liability has been incurred , unless the parties on both sides declare their willingness to have the issue determined by the court without a jury ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In any event , matters such as evidence , sentencing , damages and legal costs are dealt with by the judges alone .", "In a jury trial ORG is presided over by a judge . If a jury has given a negative answer to the question whether an offence has been committed or whether civil liability has been incurred , the defendant must be acquitted or the case must be dismissed . If the reply is in the affirmative - and this requires a majority of CARDINAL members - the issue is to be examined also by the judges . Should they disagree with the jury , they may acquit the defendant or apply a penal provision imposing a less severe penalty than that applied by the jury or , in civil proceedings , dismiss the case ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A judgment by ORG may be appealed against to ORG , whose jurisdiction , like that of ORG , is limited by the terms of the jury \u2019s verdict ( LAW , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL , provides that any person entrusted with the task of passing judgment on alleged abuses of the freedom of the press must constantly bear in mind the fundamental character of this freedom in a free society ; he should attach more attention to whether an expression is illegal by reason of its substance rather than its form and also to its purpose rather than to the manner in which it has been represented ; where there is doubt , he should acquit rather than convict .", "CARDINAL . In each county the county council , alone or in some cases together with the municipal council , elects jurors for a term of DATE ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . They are divided into CARDINAL groups , CARDINAL of CARDINAL jurors and the other of CARDINAL , the latter being composed of persons who hold or have held positions as lay members of the ordinary or administrative courts ( section CARDINAL ) . The names of jurors are entered on a list in which each of the CARDINAL groups are listed separately ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Only NORP citizens residing in GPE are eligible for election as jurors . A further condition is that they be known to be independent and fair - minded and to have sound judgment . Different social groups and currents of opinion as well as geographical areas should be represented among the jurors ( section CARDINAL ) . In practice , jurors are normally elected from among people who have been politically active .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings involving a jury , ORG presents the above - mentioned list of jurors to the parties and queries whether there exist grounds for the disqualification of any of the jurors ( LAW , section CARDINAL ; see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Thereafter , each party is given the opportunity to exclude CARDINAL jurors in the first group and CARDINAL from the second . Subsequently , ORG , by drawing lots , selects the substitute members until there remain CARDINAL jurors in the first group and CARDINAL jurors in the second group ; these CARDINAL jurors become full members of the jury ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW , LAW , of ORG ( regeringsformen ) , which forms part of LAW , provides that neither a public authority nor ORG may determine how a court should adjudicate or apply the law in a particular case . Moreover , all public power must be exercised subject to the law ; courts and public authorities shall , in the performance of their functions , ensure the equality of all persons before the law and remain objective and impartial ( LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . These fundamental principles apply also to a jury sitting in a trial under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The statutory rules on disqualification of judges extend to jurors ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Freedom of LAW ) . LAW , LAW , of LAW enumerates a series of specific grounds on which a judge may be disqualified : for instance , where he is a party in the case or otherwise has an interest in its subject - matter or can expect special advantage or damage from its outcome ; or where he is related through family or marriage to someone in such a position ; or has been involved in the case as judge , or as lawyer or adviser to CARDINAL of the parties or as witness or expert . Pursuant to the last provision of this LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , which was the one relied on by the applicant in the domestic proceedings , a judge must be disqualified if some other particular circumstance exists which is likely to undermine confidence in his impartiality in the case .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act containing certain provisions on Proceedings relating to LAW med vissa best\u00e4mmelser om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i tryckfrihetsm\u00e5l ) jurors must take the following oath before participating in a trial :", "\" I , ORG , solemnly swear and declare on my faith and honour that , as a member of this jury , I shall to the best of my ability answer the questions put by the court and maintain total secrecy in respect of what has been uttered during the jury \u2019s deliberations and how the jurors have voted . This I will and shall faithfully observe as an honest and upright judge . \"", "CARDINAL . Clause CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s articles of association provides that a member may be excluded if he is disloyal to the ORG , disseminates propaganda which is evidently in conflict with its general object and purpose or is otherwise detrimental to its interests . ORG candidates for public office are required to contribute through their office to the implementation of the ORG \u2019s programme . Other political parties have similar rules .", "On the other hand , none of the various party rules produced to the Convention institutions contain specific provisions imposing obligations as to the manner in which a member ought to carry out his tasks as a juror . It appears from the legislation summarised in paragraphs CARDINAL above and the preparatory works to the DATE Freedom of the Press Act that he is expected to perform this role with the same independence and impartiality as a judge ( see ORG offentliga utredningar - \" ORG \" CARDINAL , p.
