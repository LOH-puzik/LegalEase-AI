Delivering judgment , the Immigration Judge indicated that the various factors to which this ORG \u2019s case - law refers had been taken into account . He noted that the applicant was DATE and had spent DATE , including his youth and DATE , in GPE . He further observed that the applicant had resided for DATE in GPE , a period which included DATE and DATE spent on remand or serving his sentence . He also considered the strength of the applicant \u2019s connections to GPE , observing that he was close to his mother ( now a NORP citizen ) , sisters and uncle , all of whom resided in GPE , that he attended a church and that he was studying at university . The judge further had regard to the applicant \u2019s personal history , including his rape conviction and the grant of Indefinite Leave to Remain in DATE . He took account of the applicant \u2019s domestic circumstances and his permanent residence with his mother and previous good character . He examined the nature of the offence for which the applicant was convicted , including the sentencing judge \u2019s remarks ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the absence of any reference to deportation , and accepted that the applicant was at low risk of re - offending .

In respect of the latter , the judge noted that the presumption was in favour of deportation , that the applicant was DATE and in good health , that he had a grandfather with a home in GPE and probably had more relatives in GPE than he had admitted and that family visits would be possible . He concluded ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Having considered all the evidence before us and the representations made on behalf of the [ applicant ] , we find that :", "a ) the [ applicant \u2019s ] offence was one of the categories of offences regarded by the [ Secretary of ORG ] as particularly serious ;", "b ) the circumstances in this case are not particularly exceptional , and they do not outweigh the presumption in favour of deportation in accordance with the current version of Rule CARDINAL [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] ;", "c ) in any event , even if , contrary to our finding , the provisions of the previous Rule CARDINAL had applied to his case , we would have found that the public interest would have outweighed the other factors in this case ;", "d ) we accordingly dismiss the [ applicant \u2019s ] appeal against the [ Secretary of ORG \u2019s ] decision to deport him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , the judge was not persuaded that the applicant currently had family life in GPE , given that he was DATE , lived with friends during term - time , and had no elements of dependence in respect of his mother , sisters or uncle going beyond normal emotional ties . However , he did accept that the applicant had established a private life in the GPE given the length of his residence , the presence of family members in GPE , and his attendance at a church and university . He added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We also find that the [ Secretary of ORG \u2019s ] decision interferes with respect for that private life , in that he would be separated from his family and church , and his degree course ... would be cut short .", "CARDINAL . However , we also find that the interference pursues the lawful aim of immigration control , that it is in accordance with the law , and that it is proportionate , and in making the finding about proportionality we have balanced the following factors :", "a ) all the same factors , including the [ applicant \u2019s ] domestic circumstances , as we have already taken into account when considering the balancing exercise in relation to the deportation of the [ applicant ] ;", "b ) the fact that the public interest in maintaining an effective immigration control normally outweighs respect for an individual appellant \u2019s private life ;", "c ) the fact , as we find , that the public interest in the prevention of crime in this case also outweighs the [ applicant \u2019s ] right to respect for private life ;", "d ) and we find that none of the factors mentioned on behalf of the [ applicant ] , individually or cumulatively , prejudices the private life of the [ applicant ] in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by LAW", "CARDINAL .
