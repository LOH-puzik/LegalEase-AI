The ORG - owned company ORG was created in DATE as the successor of a previously existing ORG - owned enterprise . In DATE it was registered as a joint - stock company with its registered place of business in GPE . At that time it was wholly owned by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG passed LAW and LAW ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) .

On DATE ORG and the applicant company concluded a preliminary contract for the sale of the properties . The final contract was signed on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE contract \u201d ) .

NORP In DATE the applicant company took possession of the properties and started using them . The buildings appear to have been in a bad state of repair and it made substantial improvements to them . According to an expert assessment submitted by PERSON and PERSON heirs , in DATE the value of the properties was ORG CARDINAL .

The action was allowed on DATE by GPE . It noted at the outset that the sale would only have been valid if it had been duly authorised by ORG , as required by law .

In addition , the Sofia ORG noted that the DATE contract was null and void because it had not been concluded before a notary . There was no reason to conclude that the general requirement of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not apply to it , as it did not fall within any of the exceptions provided for by law . In particular , the contract at issue was not a privatisation contract because it did not fall within the scope of LAW , as defined under its section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and because its subject matter did not concern ORG - owned properties , the properties at issue having already come into the private ownership of the company ORG on the strength of section CARDINALa of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Nor could section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which the applicant company had relied on , provide a legal basis for concluding that the requirement laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW was inapplicable . Thus , the DATE contract , which had not been concluded before a notary , was null and void ab initio .", "CARDINAL . The contract \u2019s nullity meant that the applicant company had been a possessor in bad faith of the properties after DATE and could only acquire those properties through adverse possession after the expiry of a period of DATE . Since the claimant had brought an action in DATE , that period had not expired . Accordingly , the applicant company was not the owner of the properties and had to surrender possession to the claimant .", "CARDINAL .

In separate proceedings , in DATE ORG requested that the applicant company be declared insolvent .
