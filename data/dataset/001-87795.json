SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP citizen who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr C .- PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "ORG made a tax audit of a restaurant business , owned by a holding company owned , in its turn , by the applicant and CARDINAL other persons . Following the audit ORG , by decisions of DATE , raised the company \u2019s turnover by MONEY ( SEK ) and considered that MONEY of that amount had been paid to the company owners during the tax assessment DATE and DATE . Consequently , by the same decisions , the applicant \u2019s taxable income for DATE was raised by SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Moreover , as the revised taxation involved a discretionary assessment due to allegedly undisclosed salary payments in the applicant \u2019s tax returns , tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) were imposed on him , amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and CARDINAL , respectively , for DATE ( in total MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE through his legal counsel . On DATE ORG reconsidered its decisions but did not change them .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for legal aid . Referring to LAW ( c ) of the LAW , he maintained that he had no financial means to pay for legal representation as he had not been granted a respite to pay the tax amounts , that the legal issues were not uncomplicated as statistical information concerning the NORP restaurant business had been used in determining the revised taxes and that the tax surcharges imposed on him were considerable . He further stated that , being of foreign origin , he did not fully master the NORP language .", "On DATE the court refused the applicant legal aid . It noted that , under the terms of LAW ( R\u00e4ttshj\u00e4lpslagen , DATE ) , the scope for granting legal aid to a businessman in a taxation case was very limited . According to a leading decision by ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , the application of LAW ( c ) in a case concerning tax surcharges would depend on the size of the surcharges and the nature of the case ; only if the penalties were particularly heavy and the legal issues complicated could legal aid be granted by virtue of the LAW ( R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) . The instant case concerned mainly the question whether the documentation obtained by ORG constituted a sufficient ground for increasing the first applicant \u2019s liability to income tax . The court found that , although the documentation was relatively extensive , the legal issues , including those related to the subordinate questions concerning the tax surcharges , were not of such a character that the applicant had a right to legal aid under NORP law or the Convention .", "On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , subscribing to the reasons given by ORG . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG reduced the company \u2019s unrecorded revenues and salary payments . Accordingly , in a further judgment of DATE the court lowered the applicant \u2019s taxable income to SEK CARDINAL for each of the assessment years . In consequence of this finding , the tax surcharges were also reduced , to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and CARDINAL , respectively , for DATE ( in total approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court also decided that the applicant be compensated for litigation costs under LAW for Costs and Expenses in Cases Concerning Taxes , etc . ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning f\u00f6r kostnader i \u00e4renden och m\u00e5l om skatt , m.m . , CARDINAL ) . The applicant was awarded SEK CARDINAL concerning the court proceedings and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL concerning the proceedings before ORG ( in total about EUR CARDINAL ) . He had claimed SEK CARDINAL and CARDINAL , respectively .", "The applicant appealed against the taxation and the tax surcharges to ORG , where the case was still pending at the time of the present decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
