On DATE , at TIME , the applicant , at that time DATE , was taken by CARDINAL police officers , lieutenant NORP , chief - sergeant NORP , and a driver , to ORG in the town of GPE . The arrest took place in connection with a complaint filed DATE by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s neighbours , PERSON , in which she had alleged that the applicant had beaten her with a stick .", "CARDINAL . Once on the LOC of ORG , the applicant was placed in a detention room , where she spent some time . Then she was brought into the office of lieutenant PERSON in the room were also PERSON , Mr T.

The applicant denied the allegation and an argument erupted between her and PERSON left the room to take some documents from another office . As the argument between the applicant and PERSON continued , chief - sergeant NORP led the applicant out of lieutenant NORP \u2019s office , into the corridor .", "CARDINAL . According to testimony given later by chief - sergeant NORP and another police officer , sergeant PERSON , after being led out of the office and into the corridor , the applicant , who was irritated , called chief - sergeant NORP a \u201c brat \u201d , a \u201c piss - pants \u201d and a \u201c sniveler \u201d , and slapped him on the face . He then grabbed her hands and pushed her back but she kicked him in the ankle . Then sergeant PERSON intervened to help chief - sergeant NORP , and the CARDINAL forced the applicant into a detention room , from where she continued screaming insults at them . Then both officers left the detention room . Both officers denied having hit the applicant or having pushed her to the floor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s version of the facts significantly differed . She denied having insulted or hit chief - sergeant NORP She submitted that after taking her out of lieutenant NORP \u2019s office , chief - sergeant NORP and sergeant PERSON had guided her to a detention room , where they had started beating her in order to extract a confession . The applicant stated that sergeant PERSON had been holding her while chief - sergeant NORP had been hitting her face and temple and kicking her torso . Her nose had started bleeding and sergeant PERSON had taken her to the toilet to wash the blood . He had also made the applicant wash the basin and had brought her back to the detention room , where the CARDINAL had continued beating her . Chief - sergeant NORP had kicked her and , while falling on the floor , the applicant had bumped her head against the edge of a table . She had lost consciousness for some time . After that she had spent an unspecified amount of time lying in the detention room .", "CARDINAL . In his testimony given at the applicant \u2019s trial lieutenant NORP relayed that TIME he had come to the detention room and had found the applicant squatting on the floor . The applicant had told him that she \u201c [ had been ] killed , [ that ] her waist [ had been ] broken ... that she [ had been ] beaten \u201d . He had not seen any blood or visible traces of injury on the applicant but she had told him that her nose and mouth had been injured . The lieutenant had helped her sit on a chair . He had presented her a proc\u00e8sverbal establishing the fact that the previous evening the applicant had beaten PERSON and had asked her to sign it . The applicant had written \u201c I am not guilty \u201d and had signed . Lieutenant PERSON had led the applicant to the hallway of the police station and had left her there . She had told him that she could not walk .", "CARDINAL . After being left by lieutenant NORP at the hallway , the applicant asked several police officers to call an ambulance or a taxi to take her to hospital , but apparently no one responded to her request . Then the applicant crawled out of the police station on her hands and knees . She was seen crawling by a boy , PERSON , whom she asked to help her reach the nearest payphone by letting her lean against his bicycle . Shortly thereafter a driver , PERSON , came across them with his car and took the applicant to the surgical ward of the local hospital . Mr Y. later testified that he had not seen visible traces of injury on the applicant but that she had been crying and had said that she had been beaten at the police .", "CARDINAL . The on - duty surgeon , PERSON , arrived at the hospital at TIME and examined the applicant . For the investigation Dr PERSON stated that at the time of the examination he had not observed visible traces of injury , but at the applicant \u2019s trial he testified that she had come to him with traumas on her head and back . The one on the head had been a dull trauma in the left temporal zone , without skin rupturing . The one on the back had been also a dull trauma under the right scapula , with a visible sub - cutaneous haematoma . In his view , the injuries in question could have been caused by a blow with or against a blunt object .", "CARDINAL . Dr S. directed the applicant to a consultation with a neurologist from the local emergency ward . The neurologist examined her at TIME and noted that the applicant had \u201c [ PERSON capitis . ... [ c]ommotio cerebri \u201d . His opinion was that she had to be hospitalised and treated .", "CARDINAL . In TIME the applicant went back to her house and spent TIME there .", "CARDINAL . The following morning , on DATE , the applicant was admitted to the surgical ward of ORG in GPE . The doctors found :", "\u201c Head \u2013 painfulness upon palpation in the left temporal zone ; behind and above the left ear \u2013 sub - cutaneous haematoma ...

The diagnosis again was \u201c [ PERSON capitis ... [ c]ommotio cerebri . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the neurological ward of ORG in GPE . It appears that at that time the applicant was treated mainly for high blood pressure . She remained in hospital until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of incident , DATE , chief - sergeant NORP , the police officer who had allegedly beaten the applicant , submitted a report to the head of ORG in GPE . He alleged that the applicant had hit him and had used abusive language against him and asserted that he had put her in the detention room to prevent her from carrying on .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this report ORG initiated an inquiry and charged lieutenant NORP , CARDINAL of the officers who had arrested the applicant , to conduct it . The lieutenant finished the inquiry in DATE and on DATE submitted a report concluding that the facts warranted the opening of a criminal investigation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from ORG in PERSON opened a criminal investigation against the applicant for having caused a light bodily injury to an official and for having insulted him during the performance of his duties , offences under LAW ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c CC \u201d ) . The injury in question was the result of the applicant having allegedly slapped chief - sergeant NORP on the face and kicked him in the ankle . No medical evidence was presented . On DATE the investigator heard chief - sergeant NORP , lieutenant NORP , sergeant PERSON , PERSON DATE , on DATE , the investigator sent the material to ORG with a recommendation that the applicant be indicted . The case was assigned to prosecutor PERSON who filed a bill of indictment with ORG .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant \u2019s trial opened her counsel requested a medical expert report in order to determine whether the injuries sustained by the applicant could have been the result of beating by the police officer accusing her of violence against him . ORG did not appoint an expert but instead remitted the case to the prosecution with instructions to carry out the steps requested by the applicant \u2019s defence . However , no report was made , as the prosecutor in charge of the case held that the mechanism of the injuries had already been ascertained by the doctors who had examined the applicant upon her admitting to hospital .", "CARDINAL . When the trial resumed on CARDINAL and DATE , counsel for the applicant renewed her request for an expert report but it was denied by the court , which held that the facts of the case had already been established on the basis of the available evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant testified that she had been beaten by chief - sergeant NORP", "CARDINAL . In her closing argument at trial counsel for the applicant pointed out that the applicant had been beaten , had sustained injuries , had been treated for them in hospital and that a complaint had been filed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced her to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "On the basis of the testimony given by chief - sergeant NORP and sergeant PERSON ( the court held that PERSON and PERSON testimony was not credible because their relations with the applicant had been strained ) the court found that the officers had led the applicant out of lieutenant PERSON \u2019s office and into the corridor . There , some verbal exchange had taken place between the applicant and chief - sergeant NORP , while sergeant PERSON had stepped aside . The applicant had then slapped chief - sergeant NORP on the face , had tried to kick him and had called him a \u201c brat \u201d and a \u201c sniveler \u201d . The court noted that the applicant presented a completely different version of the facts , namely that it was her who had been subjected to violence . However , it went on to hold that PERSON , the surgeon who examined the applicant on DATE of the incident , had not found blood on the applicant but only a dull trauma on her right scapula . That could have been occasioned by a blow by or onto a blunt object . Thus , it was possible that the applicant had inflicted the injury on herself . Therefore her allegations of savage beating , kicks , pushing , falling down etc . did not correspond to the testimony of the doctors who had examined her . The fact that there had been no visible traces of beating on the applicant was also established through the testimony of PERSON , the boy who had helped her move out of the police station , and of PERSON , the driver who had taken her to the hospital .", "However , the court noted that the inquiry whether the applicant had been subjected to violence was not part of the subject - matter of the case before it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which upheld the conviction and sentence on DATE . The court noted , inter alia , that if the applicant \u2019s allegations of police ill - treatment were true , she could request the opening of criminal proceedings against the police officers involved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then petitioned ORG for review . At the hearing before that court a prosecutor of ORG appeared who pleaded for the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s petition . ORG dismissed the petition in a judgment of DATE .", "In its judgment ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c Counsel for [ the applicant ] calls into question the testimony of [ chief - sergeant NORP ] , who , she asserts , is \u2018 very interested in the outcome of the ORG , this interest being presumed from the allegations of [ the applicant ] that NORP had \u2018 savagely beaten her\u2019 . This argument is groundless ... The [ applicant \u2019s ] assertions that she had been beaten are completely unsubstantiated . In fact , the traces of the \u2018 savage ORG were a subcutaneous haematoma above the left ear and an identical haematoma in the lower part of the right thoracic half ... That could have been caused by a blow or a self - inflicted blow with or onto a blunt object ... These injuries and the statements of [ the applicant ] that she fell unconscious , had vertigo , nausea and had vomited DATE for the ascertaining of which no objective medical criteria exist \u2013 led to her hospitalisation during which no indications of brain damage were found ...", "Beside being unproven , the allegation of [ the applicant ] that ... she was the victim of an offence on the part of the police officers is also illogical . The police officers did not have any reason to be rude toward [ the applicant ] , or , in any event , not until [ she ] by words and conduct demonstrated her disparagement toward [ them ] and their work ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant was admitted to hospital , her daughter filed a complaint with ORG , alleging that her mother had been beaten by chief - sergeant NORP The complaint was dealt with by prosecutor PERSON , the same prosecutor who drew up the indictment in the criminal case against the applicant . On DATE he ordered that the complaint be sent for verification to ORG . In the accompanying letter he requested that the following facts be established within DATE :", "\u201c Who brought [ the applicant ] to ORG [ ? ] When and for what reasons [ ? ] Was she hit [ ? ] With what [ ? ] In which part of the body [ ? ] What injuries did she sustain [ ? ] \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG assigned the verification to lieutenant NORP , the officer who had arrested the applicant and who had conducted the inquiry against her .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE lieutenant PERSON concluded the verification . He sent a report to the head of ORG , asserting that the applicant had not been beaten and recommending that no criminal investigation be opened . The applicant submits that the lieutenant did not independently establish the facts but instead relied on testimony given in the criminal investigation against her to corroborate his conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the results from the verification were sent to ORG and given to prosecutor PERSON Apparently no further investigative actions were undertaken by the prosecution with regard to the complaint . No decision to open or to refuse the opening of a criminal investigation was issued .", "CARDINAL . In a separate effort to initiate an investigation , on DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter filed a complaint with ORG in GPE . ORG requested information form ORG in GPE , which in turn requested information from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter also filed a complaint with ORG , which DATE ordered ORG to conduct an inquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s daughter and to the Ministry , stating that it had not been established that chief - sergeant NORP had engaged in any unlawful actions . The letter added that an investigation had been opened into the matter , citing the case - number of the criminal investigation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG sent a reply to the applicant \u2019s daughter , stating that the prosecution authorities were handling the case and that the ORG would announce its position after they prosecution had finished dealing with it .", "CARDINAL .

Upon receiving a query from ORG , ORG sent a reply , in which it relayed that the applicant had been put in the detention room by sergeants NORP and NORP , but asserted that the applicant had not been beaten or ill - treated during her stay in the police station .", "CARDINAL . In its issue of CARDINAL DATE a national DATE newspaper , \u201c CARDINAL Hours \u201d , published an article describing the case of the applicant , the criminal prosecution against her and the investigation into her daughter \u2019s complaints under the heading \u201c A granny battered a police officer on his place of work \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
