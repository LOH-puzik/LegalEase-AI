ORG DATE before the birth of P , a social worker \u2019s case conference , at which the applicant was not present or represented , was held at the hospital to consider the expected child \u2019s interests . The conference had been arranged because ORG of the local authority ( \" the ORG \" ) was aware of marital difficulties between the applicant and her husband and of possible resultant accommodation problems and was concerned as to her capacity to look after the child . It was concluded that , although she would not deliberately neglect the baby , she might prove incapable of comprehending the baby \u2019s needs in view of her own intelligence ; intensive support from health visitors and ORG welfare officers was proposed .", "CARDINAL . ORG After the birth , the applicant and P returned to the matrimonial home . On DATE , a health visitor was called there after the applicant had suffered violence from her husband ; she went , with P , to live with her father .", "According to the Government , the applicant returned to the matrimonial home in DATE after a disagreement with her father but went back to his home on DATE as her husband was co - habiting with another woman . The applicant denies that she left her father \u2019s home during this period , but a social enquiry report prepared in connection with her wardship application ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) indicates that since she and P could not stay with the husband , who was living with another woman , a place was found for them at a mother and baby home .", "On DATE , the social workers concerned decided that the applicant might be able to cope with P if given continuous support by a responsible adult . Since the applicant \u2019s relationship with her father appeared to be stabilising , ORG for the area where he lived agreed to take over supervision of the family . However , this support was not given as a result of the prolonged illness of the social worker responsible .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Following a report of the last - mentioned incident , the ORG sought and , on DATE , obtained a place of safety order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of P. As a result of the order , the child was admitted to hospital , where the injuries were found to be minor . DATE , following a social workers\u2019 case conference , it was decided that since the applicant had no suitable accommodation P should be discharged from hospital to a foster family whose home was near that of the applicant \u2019s father , thus permitting her easy and regular access to the child . The ORG envisaged a rapid restoration of P to the applicant \u2019s care . DATE and DATE , during which time she changed addresses CARDINAL times and led an unsettled lifestyle , the applicant paid CARDINAL visits to the child , but somewhat erratically and without keeping to various arranged appointments .", "At a visit on DATE , the applicant \u2019s father was told by the social worker responsible of the circumstances leading to P \u2019s placement with the foster parents . He indicated that he was not then prepared to have the applicant back and that he was satisfied that P , who was happy and well cared for , should remain with the foster parents . At that time , he considered that this was the best place for the child , with whom he would not be able to cope because of his job .", "CARDINAL .

According to the social welfare report , \" it was decided that , in [ P \u2019s ] own interests the child \u2019s whereabouts should not be so readily available to [ the applicant ] , [ since ] she did not seem to be interested in [ P ] and [ P \u2019s ] longer term welfare needs seemed most likely to be met by placement with long - term foster parents \" . Neither the applicant ( whose whereabouts at the time were probably unknown to the ORG ) nor her father was directly involved in the procedure in which this decision was taken and they were unaware that the case conference was being held . The move was effected on DATE and the foster parents later applied to adopt P.", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE after the case conference the applicant \u2019s father expressed the wish to care for P. After extensive efforts , he succeeded in finding the applicant in DATE . She moved back to live with him and he indicated his interest in P \u2019s future and his preparedness to help the applicant to settle down . According to the social welfare report , \" in order to promote possible future rehabilitation , arrangements were made for regular DATE meetings ... between [ P ] and [ P \u2019s ] natural family \" . The first of such visits , between the applicant , her father and P , took place at DATE nursery on DATE and was followed by others on DATE and DATE . However , the visits ceased as a result of a strike by social workers from DATE to DATE , which made visits at the nursery under the supervision of a professional social worker impossible . The Government maintain that the applicant had agreed in advance with the ORG that visits should be so supervised , but she denies this .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG sought and , on DATE , obtained from the local juvenile court a care order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in respect of P. The applicant did not appeal against this decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Since the above - mentioned strike was then in progress , it is uncertain how the ORG proposed that the order should be implemented , other than by merely leaving P with the foster parents . In view of the strike no access was possible for the applicant , but the juvenile court had in any event no jurisdiction to decide the question of access , which remained a matter within the discretion of the ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and treated at a local hospital . She was discharged with her second child , who was born on DATE , but continued to attend as an out - patient until DATE when she was considered to be no longer suffering from the illness .", "After the end of the social workers\u2019 strike on DATE , the applicant requested DATE access to P , but this was refused by the ORG as impractical and not in the child \u2019s best interests . Following a case conference concerning P \u2019s brother held on DATE , it was agreed that representatives of the ORG should visit the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s home to assess the possibility of P returning to live there with the applicant . On DATE , she and her father visited ORG had recommended that such visits should continue on a DATE basis and the second took place on DATE ; on that occasion the applicant \u2019s father became aggressive and refused to permit the visit to his home envisaged at the DATE case conference .", "Following a further case conference held on DATE to review P \u2019s progress since coming into care , it was decided that the child was doing well with foster parents and that it was impossible to consider any proposal for rehabilitation whilst the applicant \u2019s father refused to allow the social workers to visit his home . The applicant was not informed in advance of this conference or offered the opportunity to attend it .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the juvenile court rejected an application by the applicant for the care order to be discharged ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but recommended an increase in the frequency of her visits to P. Following a case review on DATE , at which the social workers responsible and P \u2019s foster parents but not the applicant or her father were present , it was decided that the visits should henceforth be at DATE intervals ; the applicant was neither informed in advance of the review nor offered the opportunity to attend it . The last of such visits took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the social workers responsible held a statutory review of the case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which was also attended by professional agencies apart from the social services . The applicant and her father were not present or represented and there is nothing to suggest that they were aware of this meeting until after it took place . Without any prior consultation with the applicant , the meeting decided to terminate her access to P forthwith . According to a social - worker report of CARDINAL DATE , this decision was based upon the fact that prior to the social workers\u2019 dispute there were only vestigial signs of a relationship between the applicant and P , which had not justified an intensive programme of rehabilitation , and that these signs had disappeared when visits resumed in DATE . In addition , there was evidence of strong bonding between P and the long - term foster parents ; they were strong parental figures and the applicant \u2019s contact with P therefore caused the child confusion . The social enquiry report states :", "\" When access arrangements were made prior to the decision of CARDINAL DATE P would arrive at DATE Nursery with his foster parents always looking paler than usual , and was quiet , and clinging to the foster mother on arrival . The foster parents would stay in the room until P settled , and occupied with a toy or game , then they would leave the room . [ The applicant \u2019s father ] would leave the room for TIME so that P and [ the applicant ] could be observed together . The social worker usually would attempt to get P involved in some activity endeavouring to involve [ the applicant ] , as she had difficulty in holding P \u2019s attention . The social worker did on occasion leave the room so that P and [ the applicant ] could be alone but there was little or no evidence of a meaningful relationship developing . When [ the applicant \u2019s father ] was in the room he did get a positive response from P. He was able to engage in play activities with P and during these periods P would come to life ... A health visitor from the local clinic would see P after each of these visits to see if [ the child ] was at all distressed by the occasions . It was noticed that P became very clinging to [ the ] foster mother on DATE after each visit . P would wake up in TIME after the visit . On the last occasion of access [ the child ] soiled [ its ] pants on the way home from LOC . This was the first time this had occurred for DATE . \"", "On DATE , the ORG wrote to the applicant informing her that future access to P would not be permitted , giving as the reason that P had been showing signs of disturbance following visits by her which had proved unsettling .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the juvenile court rejected a further application by the applicant to discharge the care order . She lodged an appeal with ORG but this was not ultimately pursued : counsel had advised that ORG , like the juvenile court , had no jurisdiction over the question of access alone but could only consider the wider issue of whether the care order should be revoked ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Counsel advised that the proper course to have the access question examined was for the applicant to apply for P to be made a ward of court ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) , whereupon ORG would make such order as it thought fit in P \u2019s best interests . On DATE , the applicant accordingly issued an originating summons in ORG of ORG , pending the hearing of which P became a ward of court . The summons was dismissed - and the wardship thus terminated - on DATE , in the light of the decision in ORG , which had just been heard in the same ORG of ORG . The latter case was then pending in ORG , which gave its decision therein on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following the last - mentioned decision , the applicant obtained , on DATE , a limited legal aid certificate to permit her to seek counsel \u2019s opinion on the question whether or not there was a judicial remedy available to her to challenge the ORG \u2019s decision to refuse her access to P. On DATE , counsel advised , after a review of the authorities , that , applying the criteria set out by Lord Greene in ORG , Ltd. v. ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , \" the answer would be in favour of ORG \" . Counsel stated that \" [ since that ORG had ] decided that access was not in the interests of [ P ] , ORG would say that they had come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable ORG could ever have come to it . In these circumstances in my view there is not a scintilla of hope that [ the applicant ] would succeed in obtaining a judicial review \" . As a result of this opinion , the applicant \u2019s legal aid certificate was not extended .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , P \u2019s father consented , at the request of the long - term foster parents , to the child \u2019s adoption by them .", "The applicant refused to consent and the foster parents applied to ORG for an order that the refusal be set aside as unreasonable ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . After hearing evidence , the judge found as a fact that the applicant had at all times made genuine efforts to re - establish her relationship with P ; further , that when regular access to P was resumed in DATE , the ORG and the applicant \" understood and were agreed that rehabilitation between mother and child was to be pursued ... [ the applicant being advised that ] this rehabilitation was clearly bound to be a long and slow process \" . Whilst the judge accepted the possible correctness of the view of an educational psychiatrist witness that P \u2019s welfare was best served by remaining with the prospective adopters , he held , on DATE , that the applicant \u2019s refusal to consent was not unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . ORG An appeal by the foster parents against this decision was heard on DATE . ORG granted their request that the application to dispense with the applicant \u2019s consent to adoption be re - heard : it considered that ORG judge had given inadequate weight to the question whether P \u2019s welfare did not dictate that a reasonable mother would conclude that adoption , and only adoption , would provide the child with the requisite security .", "CARDINAL . ORG The matter was re - tried on CARDINAL and DATE , when the judge dispensed with the applicant \u2019s consent and granted an adoption order in respect of P. The judge approached the case from the point of view that if the applicant should have access to P , then no adoption order should be made ; having reviewed the history of access , the judge concluded that no access should now be granted since it had not been enjoyed by the applicant for such a considerable period and the welfare of P was the first and paramount consideration . The DATE care order in respect of P automatically terminated on his adoption .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the law of GPE and GPE , there are a number of different and partially co - ordinated procedures for dealing with the welfare of children . Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of ORG , it has for DATE co - existed with , but not been ousted by , various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority .", "Although the terms are not wholly accurate , the legislation is commonly divided into CARDINAL categories : the first provides for \" compulsory care \" , by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care ; the second concerns \" voluntary care \" , the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts . At any given time , there are CARDINAL children in public care in GPE and GPE , of whom CARDINAL are not living with their parents or a relative .", "The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on DATE .

ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) the authority failed to observe statutory procedural rules or to act fairly ( see notably R v. ORG , ex parte C and R v. GPE , ex parte B , ORG , DATE ) .", "The remedy of judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in question but rather the decision - making process itself , and the court will not act as a \" court of appeal \" from the body involved . Thus , where on a successful application for judicial review the court quashes an authority \u2019s decision , it will normally remit the matter to the authority for reconsideration ; it may , however , also direct the authority to reach a conclusion in accordance with the court \u2019s findings ( Rules of ORG , Order CARDINAL , rule ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In certain circumstances , the wardship jurisdiction may also be invoked to question the decisions of a local authority or a juvenile court relating to a child in the former \u2019s care . The general rule is that the prerogative power of the Crown is not for all purposes ousted or abrogated by the exercise of the duties and powers conferred on local authorities by legislation . In the leading case of ORG , ORG examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities\u2019 statutory powers . Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions , notably on such matters as access to the child : the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise ( except on judicial review principles ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute . Sometimes , however , the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court .", "The foregoing limits on ORG powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care . If he is not , ORG can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests .", "CARDINAL . ORG The inability of parents to approach the courts , save as explained above , where decisions are made by a local authority affecting access to their children led ORG , in ORG Social Security Adjudications Act CARDINAL , to modify the law on this point .", "Under the new provisions - which came into force on DATE , that is after the events giving rise to the present case - , a local authority may not refuse to make arrangements for access to a child in care and may not terminate such arrangements unless it has first given notice to the parent . The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order , requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify . Where an access order has been made , there is a right to apply for variation . An appeal against the juvenile court \u2019s decision lies to ORG . Any court dealing with the matter must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration .", "This new remedy applies only to decisions refusing or terminating access ; in all other cases , the nature and extent of access remain within the local authority \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the Government published a Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care . This document stresses the importance of involving the child \u2019s natural parents in the local authority \u2019s decision - making process in this area and of informing them fully and promptly as to the substance of decisions concerning access .", "CARDINAL . ORG A court can not make an adoption order in respect of a child unless , inter alia , it is satisfied that each parent freely and unconditionally agrees ( LAW DATE , section CARDINAL ) . However , such agreement may be dispensed with upon a number of grounds specified in that section , notably that the parent is withholding consent unreasonably or has persistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge his parental duties . In reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child , a court must have regard to all the circumstances , first consideration being given to the need to safeguard and promote his welfare throughout his childhood ( Children Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Adoption proceedings in respect of a child who is a ward of court may not be instituted without the leave of ORG . On an application for leave , the court \u2019s function is to consider whether the proposed adoption application is one that might reasonably succeed , the merits of the matter being examined subsequently , once leave has been granted and after compliance with the requirements concerning notices and reports ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
