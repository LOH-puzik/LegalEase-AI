On DATE the Agent of the Government replied as follows :", "\u201c ( ... ) The Government will DATE out of necessity \u2013 limit itself to a short reply , since it can not confirm that the applicant is the person who was apprehended , questioned and subsequently put in GPE detention on or DATE . A female person was indeed apprehended , questioned and put in GPE detention on DATE , but she was merely known as \u2018 NN cel PERSON and \u2018 PERSON . Her fingerprints led to a positive identification , but the matching fingerprints were registered under \u2018 NN onbekend\u2019 ( NN unknown ) , reference number CARDINAL . The latter were taken from a female apprehended in the course of a house - squat in the city of GPE on DATE , whose identity remained unknown .", "For the sake of completeness , I should add that the person apprehended on or around DATE appealed against the measure of aliens detention under the details mentioned above . Her representative informed the District [ i.e. Regional ] Court that she was also known as \u2018 Tjitske\u2019 . On DATE , higher appeal against ORG judgment was lodged by \u2018 Tjitske Drijfhout , alias NN cel PERSON alias Nn . PCARDINAL.v.CARDINAL.CARDINAL\u2019 .", "Upon receipt of your letter , the GPE police in GPE checked the information provided in the application . It appears that Tjitske Drijfhout , born in GPE on DATE and residing at GPE CARDINAL hs , PERSON , GPE , is unknown in the municipal database . There is , however , a person known as PERSON , born on DATE . The above mentioned appeal to ORG was lodged by a person claiming to be of minor age . The age of the apprehended person was estimated DATE . Under no circumstance could the apprehended person have reached DATE , let alone DATE nearly ) CARDINAL - and - ten . Furthermore , the postal code of CARDINAL JB does not relate to the address provided .", "The Government is of the opinion that \u2013 since at least part of the personal data submitted by the applicant are proven to be false \u2013 there is no reason to assume that the name provided by the applicant would be correct . The applicant \u2019s identity has therefore not been disclosed , as a result of which the application should be declared inadmissible for being anonymous , as stipulated in LAW ) of the Convention . The Government refers to the ORG \u2019s decision to that effect in the case of PERSON v. the GPE ( ORG . No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The fact that \u2013 other than the applicant in that case \u2013 the applicant in the present case has chosen to provide a somewhat less obvious pseudonym , does not alter that conclusion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A copy of this letter was transmitted to the applicant \u2019s representative for comment . In a letter dated DATE , the latter admitted that CARDINAL DATE was not the applicant \u2019s date of birth but did not give any other date . He claimed that the wrong postcode , which differed only slightly from the actual postcode of the address given , was an honest mistake . He further admitted that the person referred to as NN cel PERSON and ORG in the domestic proceedings was the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Court requested the applicant to establish her identity by submitting a copy of a valid identity document held by her .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representative , Mr Hemelaar , replied as follows ( translation ) :", "\u201c In the above - mentioned case you requested me , in your letter of DATE , for a copy of a valid identity document of the applicant .", "I have been informed by the applicant that she can not comply with that request , because she does not now hold a valid identity document from which her name as stated appears ( omdat zij thans niet beschikt over een geldig identiteitsbewijs waaruit haar naam als opgegeven blijkt ) .", "In the GPE there is no obligation to have an identity document . People can go through life without an identity document . Especially since the law has been changed and fingerprints are required , there is much resistance against applying for a passport in the circles in which the applicant moves . The situation of being \u2018 identity document - less\u2019 ( identiteitsdocumentloos ) now occurs more frequently in those circles than it used to .", "On behalf of the applicant , I point out that if the mere fact that the ORG denies the stated identity were enough to impose a duty of proof on the applicant , the effective exercise of the right of petition [ would be ] undermined . As you will be aware , especially in cases of GPE detention identity documents are usually unavailable . If now the ORG takes the position that the stated identity is incorrect ( as in fact GPE does in a large number of cases , often on the fallacious reasoning that \u2018 The stated identity can not be correct , because if it were correct , the authorities of the country of origin would issue / have issued a laissez - ORG ) , then no applications at all could be lodged against violations of human rights in cases of GPE detention .", "In certain cases a GPE citizen may in fact be asked for an identity document in specific situations and the failure to produce one may attract penal sanctions ( such as a MONEY fine or an extension of detention on remand ) and such sanctions were in fact imposed on the applicant . But a general obligation to purchase a passport or identity card , or possess one , does not exist in the GPE .", "My client takes the view that she has not submitted an anonymous complaint and also refers to the decision of ORG , the highest administrative court in the GPE , from which it appears that ORG did not base its decision on that fiction either . My client has stated a name and an address ( albeit with the wrong postcode ) . That ought to be sufficient . Unlike in the case of \u2018 Blondje\u2019 ORG has considered this sufficient . It appears incorrect to the applicant that the ORG should all of a sudden adopt a different position in the present case . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
