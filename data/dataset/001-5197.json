DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . He resides in GPE .", "", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE and charged with rape allegedly committed DATE . On DATE he was given a statutory hearing before ORG ( PERSON ) during which the applicant was represented by counsel ( N ) . Following this hearing the court decided to remand the applicant in custody for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was released by ORG whereas the charge against him was upheld .", "During the period from the arrest until DATE the police investigated the case . The police interrogated the applicant and interviewed the victim and various witnesses . Furthermore , the police carried out technical examinations at the scene of the crime and collected various technical declarations concerning a number of effects connected with the crime . Examinations were also carried out of the applicant \u2019s and victim \u2019s bodies to ascertain traces , if any , deriving from the crime .", "An indictment was drawn up on DATE and the case was set down for trial by ORG on DATE . However , the police did not succeed in serving the indictment on the applicant and it appears from the court records of the court session on DATE that the court had been notified by telephone that the applicant was hospitalised in GPE . The case was therefore adjourned pending another summons .", "The case was then set down for trial on DATE . However , the police did not succeed in serving the indictment on the applicant , informing him of the time of the trial . Despite various investigations carried out by the police it was not possible for the police to establish the applicant \u2019s whereabouts . It appears from the court records of the session on CARDINAL DATE before ORG that the judge decided to adjourn the case pending determination of the applicant \u2019s residence .", "Concurrently another case against the applicant was pending , in which he was charged with , and wanted in connection with , a large number of offences against property committed together with others . On DATE ORG had ordered the applicant , among others , to be remanded in custody as there was a strong suspicion that he had committed offences against property . The applicant was not present at the hearing , and the public prosecutor stated that the suspects , among them the applicant , were probably to be found in GPE . In its decision the court emphasised , inter alia , the lack of ties with GPE of the suspects , including the applicant , and the contradictory statements made by the suspects . It appears from the decision of the court that the suspects were to be brought before the court within TIME from being brought to GPE . The warrant for the arrest which was issued did not , however , concern the rape offence against the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant was apprehended at the border crossing at GPE / Oder in GPE . He was arrested on the ground of an expected NORP request for extradition . On the same date , ORG in GPE ( GPE ) notified ORG in GPE ( GPE ) thereof , and thus the NORP authorities received notice of the apprehension .", "A new warrant of arrest was issued on DATE . It appears from this that the applicant was to be taken into custody and brought before the court within TIME from being brought to GPE . Also this warrant related to the offences against property only and did not concern the rape offence .", "On DATE the GPE police requested ORG to make a request for extradition of the applicant for prosecution in GPE . In that connection , the police stated that he was provisionally charged with theft , forgery , assisting in forgery and rape .", "On DATE ORG submitted their request for extradition to ORG . It appears from the letter submitted to the NORP authorities that the applicant was provisionally charged with theft , forgery , assisting in forgery and rape .", "On DATE the NORP authorities requested further information for their processing of the extradition case , including the rape case .", "On DATE ORG replied , giving an account of the case , including the rape offence . ORG requested that the extradition also include the rape offence although the warrant of arrest of DATE from ORG did not include this offence . In that connection ORG stated that the applicant had been provisionally charged with rape and held in custody on the basis of that charge . ORG stated further that under NORP law extradition for prosecution for several offences could be effected although a warrant of arrest concerned only one of the offences charged . Moreover , ORG maintained that Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG was to be construed accordingly .", "On DATE the ORG granted the request for extradition in so far as it concerned the offences against property , but not in so far as it concerned the rape offence , as the NORP authorities found that the conditions of LAW were not satisfied in respect of this offence .", "During the period from the apprehension in GPE on DATE until DATE the applicant was detained in GPE with a view to extradition for prosecution in GPE . While he was detained in GPE the respondent Government submit that the applicant had contact with his defence counsel in the rape case , ORG According to a letter from counsel , the applicant had expressed a desire for extradition to GPE as quickly as possible so that he could appear in the criminal case . The applicant denies that he had any contact with N during his imprisonment in GPE .", "The applicant was extradited to GPE on DATE for prosecution of the offences against property . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , he was found guilty thereof and sentenced to imprisonment for DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the GPE police requested ORG to suspend the rape case until it could be resumed pursuant to LAW ( b ) of LAW . The police stated that the reason for this was that the NORP authorities had refused extradition for prosecution of the rape offence . The police consequently requested a provisional conclusion of the case by the court and an award of fees to counsel .", "On DATE ORG adjourned the case . The court awarded a fee of ORG to the assigned counsel , N , who had previously been awarded a fee of ORG on DATE . These amounts were to be provisionally covered by the ORG .", "The applicant was released on parole on DATE with a DATE probation period as concerns a residual sentence of DATE . There were no special conditions for the release on parole preventing the applicant from leaving the country immediately .", "On DATE the NORP police resumed the rape case and recommended ORG for Copenhagen to drop it on the ground of insufficient evidence . The police maintained that DATE had passed since the time of the offence , and that it was presumed that the statements which would be made during a trial would hardly be able to form a basis for conviction .", "However , on DATE ORG for Copenhagen decided that prosecution in the case should proceed due to the nature of the offence .", "Thus , on DATE the case was again forwarded to ORG . The GPE police requested that the case be set down for trial quickly . The case was set down for trial on DATE .", "The indictment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s case was heard by ORG . The court decided to appoint a new defence counsel , PERSON , to the applicant . During the trial the applicant and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . In addition to other documentary evidence a report prepared by ORG ( Retspatologisk Institut ) was read out in court . Following an evaluation of the available evidence the applicant was found guilty of the charge brought against him . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . It appears from the judgment that the applicant was ordered to pay costs , including a fee of ORG to the appointed counsel , J. It further appears from the judgment that the fees of ORG CARDINAL plus VAT and DKK CARDINAL plus VAT awarded to the previously assigned counsel , N , and provisionally covered by the ORG , were to be finally covered by the applicant .", "The applicant appealed against the conviction , claiming acquittal , and by notice of appeal of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor counter - appealed the sentence , claiming a more severe sentence .", "On DATE ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) received an extract of the case from the public prosecutor , and on DATE ORG notified the public prosecutor and the defence counsel that the trial had been set down for DATE .", "On DATE the case was tried by ORG .

The applicant was ordered to pay the costs before ORG .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG for leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) .", "The opinion of the public prosecution on this petition was presented to the applicant on DATE .", "By letters of DATE and DATE the applicant submitted his supplementary comments on the matter .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request for leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
