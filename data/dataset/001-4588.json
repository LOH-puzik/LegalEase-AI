The ORG also decided that the applicant should pay maintenance .", "On DATE ORG pronounced its new decision concerning access , partly allowing and partly dismissing the applicant 's claims . The court allowed the applicant to visit his DATE son P. on DATE from TIME on DATE to TIME on DATE and to take him out so that he could stay TIME with his father in PERSON ; to visit PERSON on other dates , for not DATE , from TIME of the first day until TIME of DATE and to take him home , upon DATE notice to his mother ; to take P. home DATE , for DATE and GPE , to spend DATE of the holidays with P. , and as from DATE , DATE of the holidays and to see his older son PERSON as ordered in the divorce judgment and , additionally , on the dates suggested by the applicant , if PERSON agreed to it in writing .", "The court ordered the mother to respect these arrangements and dismissed the remainder of the applicant 's claims .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment which was dismissed by ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) on DATE .", "II .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to take enforcement measures against his former wife , in particular to impose a fine on her , complaining that she had been failing to comply with the access arrangements as set out in the decisions of DATE and DATE . The applicant submitted that his wife had been persistently hindering his access to children and that she had made it unfeasible . Inter alia , when he had come to see them on DATE , she had provoked a violent altercation in the course of which she had breached the applicant \u2019s bodily integrity and had refused permission for him to see PERSON applicant further emphasised that it had not been for the first time that she had provoked such a scene . Subsequently , the police had been called in , and following their intervention , she had allowed the applicant to take P. The applicant further submitted that she had not been respecting his right to have a say in the children \u2019s education , as shown by the fact that P. had ceased to attend a kindergarten , contrary to the applicant \u2019s opinion . Moreover , she had put PERSON in a boarding school in GPE , contrary to a previous arrangement to the effect that he would attend secondary school in GPE and that he would live with his father . The applicant maintained that PERSON did not have suitable living conditions in the boarding school and that he would have had a better situation if he lived in the applicant \u2019s apartment .", "On DATE the applicant challenged judge LANGUAGE on the ground that she had been conducting CARDINAL sets of proceedings in which he had previously been involved and that , as a result , she lacked impartiality . He submitted in particular that the records of the hearings , as dictated by her , had completely distorted the actual statements of the parties .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge of judge R.S. The court considered that the challenge lacked statutory basis as it had not been shown that between the judge and the applicant there was a personal relationship of such nature as to cast doubt on her impartiality .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision , considering that the statutory requirements for a judge to step down were not satisfied .", "On DATE the applicant lodged his pleadings with the court in which he asked that the police be requested to submit information concerning their intervention in his wife \u2019s apartment on DATE and , if possible , also on DATE . He also requested that a case - file of proceedings concerning division of marital property , pending before ORG , or , failing that , certain pages of this file , be submitted to the court and that certain evidence obtained in the latter case be examined by the court . He argued that these documents were relevant to the outcome of the proceedings concerned .", "On DATE he complained to the President of ORG that the proceedings exceeded a reasonable time .", "On DATE , the applicant requested the court to give a provisional order allowing PERSON to move to his apartment . He argued that the longer the lapse of time between the beginning of the proceedings and the decision to be given , the more his relationship with PERSON suffered . This , he claimed , was largely a result of his mother \u2019s animosity towards him , and of her incessant endeavours to hinder the effective exercise of his access rights . He argued that the fact that PERSON had been placed in the boarding school had contributed to a limitation of his contacts with him , and that PERSON did not have adequate living conditions there .", "On DATE a hearing was held .", "By a motion of DATE the applicant requested the court to rectify the record of the hearing held on DATE , arguing that it did not reflect the actual statements of the parties .", "On DATE a next hearing was held .", "On DATE the court in part upheld and in part dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for rectification of the record of the hearing held on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant re - entered his motion for a provisional order submitted on DATE , and requested the court to oblige his former wife to cease any actions aimed at hindering the effective exercise of his access rights , on pain of withdrawal of parental rights . He requested the court to oblige her to permit him to see PERSON on each and every request made by him . The applicant submitted that since the last hearing , held on DATE , PERSON had not lived in the boarding school and that he had not been informed of this . This , in the applicant \u2019s opinion , showed the flagrant disregard of the mother for his parental rights , in particular in the light of her previous objections to PERSON 's moving to his apartment , the altercations which she had provoked , and the fact that she had requested the court to hear PERSON in the proceedings concerning access arrangements pending before the same court , which was not beneficial to the child \u2019s emotional stability and was stressful to him . The applicant further complained that she hindered his access rights also with regard to PERSON had refused that he could see P. on DATE and DATE . He further submitted that his contacts with P. were good , the boy was normally willing to see him and requested to be allowed to see his father for a longer time . The contacts with the applicant were beneficial to the boy \u2019s intellectual development . The applicant finally argued that the mother and her family had incessantly been making disparaging comments about him in the presence of the children , trying to negatively influence the children and to destroy the emotional links between them and their father .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request that a fine be imposed on the PERSON mother and also his request for a provisional order . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s access rights had been set out in the decision of DATE . It further noted that on DATE , when the applicant had come to the mother \u2019s apartment , he had demanded in writing that PERSON be allowed to see him and that PERSON should attend kindergarten . After he had been told that PERSON had been in the apartment but had not expressed a wish to see him , an altercation ensued between the parties . P. had started to cry and did not want to go with his father . The applicant had called the police . After CARDINAL policemen had come , there had again been an agitated exchange of views between the applicant and the mother . The applicant had eventually apologised and taken PERSON for a walk , as had been planned . PERSON had not met his father on DATE . In the court \u2019s view , it could not be said that the mother had acted with an intention to prevent the applicant from seeing P. It had rather been a result of the fight between the parties and of the police intervention that P. had to be calmed before he had agreed to go out with the applicant .", "The court further established that in DATE before Easter P. had spent DATE with his father in GPE , and later , DATE from DATE . Only on CARDINAL and CARDINAL May had the mother refused the applicant permission to see PERSON since she had wished to spend DATE with the boy herself .", "The court noted that the fact that P. had been attending a pre - school course in a kindergarten instead of a school , as the applicant wished , could not be regarded as disrespect for the applicant \u2019s parental rights . P. had good professional teaching here and achieved good results . The court had further regard to the questioning of PERSON in the access proceedings pending before the court . The court found that PERSON was a sensitive , intelligent , independent boy , strongly attached to both parents . PERSON had definitely refused to give his consent to moving to the applicant \u2019s apartment . The court considered that , as the applicant had categorically refused access to his apartment in GPE to his former wife , even if PERSON had lived there , the boy \u2019s position was understandable . The court also took into account PERSON \u2019s statement that if he was to be obliged to move to his father \u2019s apartment , he would leave the school in GPE and return to PERSON . In the ORG \u2019s view , this opinion should be respected .", "The court considered that the fact that PERSON was in a boarding school , which could give him a good education , was in his best interest . The court further observed that there were no indications that the applicant was in any way prevented by his former wife from seeing PERSON who had been living in the same town as the applicant . The court concluded that there were no grounds on which to accept that the mother had been acting in defiance of the access arrangements , and refused to impose a fine on her .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , arguing that the court had failed to establish the facts relevant for the determination of the case , that it had disregarded the flagrant contempt for his parental rights on the part of his former wife and that the decision under appeal had given countenance to her reprehensible and persistent refusal to respect his rights .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , considering that the lower court had carefully assessed extensive evidence and had properly concluded that there were no grounds on which to find that the applicant \u2019s former wife had been acting in defiance of the access arrangements as set out in the judgment of DATE .", "III .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG that custody of PERSON be awarded to him . He submitted that PERSON had been put in the boarding school without his knowledge and consent , that his living conditions there were inadequate since the building was old and in bad repair and as PERSON shared his room with CARDINAL other boys . He argued that this was contrary to PERSON \u2019s best interest and that his wife , without any sound reasons , had refused her consent to a change of PERSON \u2018s residence . He alleged that the fact that PERSON was living in the boarding school facilitated the weakening of the emotional links between PERSON and him , in accordance with his wife \u2019s intention . He requested the court to order PERSON to move to his apartment and to rule that the contacts of his former wife with PERSON be limited to meetings at times decided by the applicant and outside his apartment in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant challenged judge LANGUAGE on the ground that she had been conducting CARDINAL sets of proceedings in which he had previously been involved and that , as a result , she lacked impartiality . He submitted in particular that the records of court hearings in these proceedings , as dictated by her , had completely distorted the actual submissions of the parties .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his request for the judge to step down , considering that the statutory condition , i.e. a personal relationship between her and the party , capable of casting doubt on her impartiality , was not satisfied .", "", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , arguing that judge ORG had been conducting other proceedings concerning custody and his access", "rights and that she was biased against him , which should be construed as a personal relationship casting doubt on her impartiality within the meaning of LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , considering that the statutory requirements for a judge to step down , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions , were not met . His complaints could have been raised in the previous proceedings , but even if they had been upheld by an appellate court , it would not suffice in the present proceedings for a finding that the requirements for a judge to step down were satisfied and that she should therefore be prevented from examining the present case .", "In a letter of DATE to the President of ORG the applicant complained about the length of both sets of proceedings . He submitted in particular that no hearings were scheduled in these proceedings , despite a significant lapse of time since they had been instituted , and that he had been prevented thereby from lodging motions for evidence to be taken by the court . He complained that the court had requested ORG to submit the case - file of the divorce proceedings , which would unduly prolong the proceedings . He also argued that the establishing of the facts of the cases would be more difficult due to this lapse of time . He finally submitted that the proceedings were not conducted in compliance with the requirements laid down by LAW as to a \u201c reasonable time \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant requested the court to give a provisional order safeguarding his custody claims in that his son PERSON would be ordered to move to his apartment . He further requested the court to order his former wife to cease any actions that would negatively affect his son \u2019s relations with him . He further asked the court to request ORG to investigate , by way of an enquiry carried out by a court guardian , PERSON \u2019s living conditions in the boarding school and the conditions which he could have if he lived with the applicant in GPE . The applicant also objected to any evidence being taken or any investigations undertaken by experts of ORG at ORG as they had participated in the divorce proceedings and , as a result , were biased against him . He further argued that PERSON \u2019s marks at school had perceptibly deteriorated since he lived in the boarding school , and submitted a document showing the marks .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant reiterated his request for a provisional order and requested the court to speed up its actions in respect of his request that an enquiry be made regarding PERSON \u2018s living conditions in GPE .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a provisional order .", "In his pleading of CARDINAL DATE the applicant reiterated his request to be granted custody . He submitted that in the boarding school PERSON was deprived of parental care , and that , due to lack of adequate educational supervision by his teachers , he was exposed to negative influence of his environment , including such dangers as alcoholism , drugs and venereal diseases , such as , inter alia , AIDS . It was obvious that PERSON \u2019s arguments that he felt well in the boarding school were in part motivated by this freedom from parental supervision . The applicant further stressed that ORG \u2019s statements should not be decisive as they had been made under his mother \u2019s influence and dictated by his loyalty to her . Therefore the court should not PERSON regard his arguments as being sincere and credible . The applicant reiterated that the mother had strong links with her children and that she deliberately abused their feelings in order to destroy his relationship with them , as shown by the incident of DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for custody of PERSON The court had regard to the evidence gathered in the proceedings , which included the case - file of the divorce proceedings , the results of an enquiry made by the court guardian , a copy of the expert opinion prepared by ORG for the purposes of the previous access proceedings , the statements of the parties and the testimony of Z.", "The court recalled that in the divorce judgment the court had taken the decision concerning custody and access rights , having regard to the fact that the children had stronger emotional links with their mother and had preferred to be under her care . At that time , PERSON \u2019s opinion about his father had been rather disapproving as the child had thought that he had been too strict , very rigorous , that he had not had understanding for his needs and that he had been attaching undue weight to his orders being carried out . The court considered that the circumstances relevant for the determination of the question of custody and access , which had obtained at the time when the divorce judgment had been given , had not changed . PERSON had refused to live with the applicant in GPE in view of his categorical refusal to allow him to have contacts with his mother in his apartment . As the relation that PERSON had with her mother was warm and affectionate , and since it was from her that he needed and obtained emotional support and understanding , his refusal had to be seen as justified . PERSON was DATE and therefore he was able to assess his own and his family situation reasonably and his wishes had to be taken into account .", "The court went on to state that PERSON lived in the boarding school in the same town as the applicant , but , as the applicant himself had stated before the court , their contacts had become even less frequent than when he had still been living with his mother in PERSON . The court stressed that it fell to the applicant to ensure good and frequent contacts with the boy , to come to the boarding school and to show more interest in his problems and well - being . His attitude of criticising his son was not beneficial to their relationship . It would be conducive to developing a better relationship if the applicant ceased to communicate to PERSON his opinion that boarding school was dangerous to him and that it exposed him to all the evils of civilisation .", "In conclusion , the court dismissed the request for the transfer of custody to the applicant .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , complaining that the court had been biased in its interpretation of evidence . The applicant disputed the conclusions of the court , in particular as to his parenting skills and his attitude towards his son . He stressed that he could not visit PERSON more often in the school as there were no facilities therefor , and that the boarding school was located far from his apartment which , together with his professional obligations and PERSON \u2019s school duties , explained why the contacts between them were less frequent . He stressed that it was obvious that his former wife had been hindering his contacts with the children , having recourse to lengthy judicial proceedings and even to false testimony , and by lying and slandering him . He requested that the court upheld his claims in full .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , considering that the lower court had taken extensive evidence , assessed it carefully and had drawn reasonable and well motivated conclusions .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Article CARDINAL of LAW Code of Civil Procedure provides that the court competent to deal with an action for divorce is also competent to issue any interim orders concerning the manner in which the care of the parties ' minor children should be carried out and about the access rights until the divorce judgment is pronounced . Either of the parties can file a request to have such an order made ; or the court gives a ruling acting ex officio .", ".", "Such an order can be appealed against to a second - instance court .", "Under LAW , a final court decision as to parental rights and access arrangements can be changed at any time if the interests of the child so require , either upon a motion from either parent or by the court acting ex officio .", "Pursuant to LAW , if both parents who are not married retain their parental rights in respect of their children , a court may award custody to one of them , limiting the exercise of other person \u2019s parental rights to certain obligations and rights specified in the court \u2019s decision .", "If a parent who has been obliged by a court decision to respect the other parent 's access rights refuses to comply therewith , access decisions are liable to enforcement .
