THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life;Respect for private life);No violation of Article 13 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy);No violation of Article 14+8 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life;Respect for private life)", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , who was born in DATE , states that he was born from a relationship between his mother and a certain PERSON , a civil law notary ( notaris ) . Although his mother had wanted to marry , PERSON had not ; neither had the CARDINAL ever lived together . P. had not recognised ( erkenning ) the applicant . Nevertheless , he made regular payments towards the applicant 's care and upbringing , gave the applicant presents for his birthday , visited him and , together with the applicant 's mother , went on day trips with him . The applicant called P. \u201c Daddy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . P. died on DATE without leaving a will . His body was cremated . A nephew , PERSON , was identified as his sole heir .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought civil proceedings against PERSON , seeking an order that PERSON hand over P. 's estate . The applicant argued that he had had \u201c family life \u201d with P. within the meaning of LAW , and that the GPE legal provisions relating to the position of \u201c illegitimate \u201d and unrecognised children infringed LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) rejected the applicant 's claim by a judgment of DATE . It considered that the difference contained in GPE legislation on succession between children with and children without legally recognised family relationships ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) did not constitute an unjustified interference in the \u201c family life \u201d of \u201c illegitimate \u201d unrecognised children . In view of the rights and interests of third parties in relation to an inheritance , legal certainty required that only persons with a demonstrable legal family connection with the deceased be able to inherit . An \u201c interference \u201d with any \u201c family life \u201d the applicant might have had with PERSON was thus \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d and \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d . In the light of these considerations , ORG did not find it necessary to determine whether or not PERSON was the applicant 's biological father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) , complaining of ORG interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , as well as of the fact that ORG had declined to rule on the issue of paternity .", "CARDINAL . Four witnesses were heard before ORG : the applicant , his mother , a friend of his mother and the person who had been the applicant 's co - guardian ( toeziend voogd ) . The latter CARDINAL stated that they were convinced that PERSON was the applicant 's biological father and that he had never denied this fact to them but had , on the contrary , assured them that the applicant would be well provided for . The applicant 's mother stated that she had not known any man other than P. until DATE after the applicant 's birth , and that PERSON had referred to the applicant in public as \u201c my son \u201d or \u201c my little boy \u201d . In reply to PERSON 's argument that he had not been aware of the applicant 's existence , the applicant stated that PERSON 's mother , who was a sister of PERSON , had been so aware and had met the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant also submitted a number of photographs showing himself in the company of P. and his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment , dismissing the appeal . While it acknowledged that a situation where a court was unable to determine a case like the present one led to an unsatisfactory outcome for the applicant , ORG saw no possibility of departing from the recent case - law of ORG ( PERSON ) to the effect that it went beyond the jurisprudential task of the judiciary to determine the consequences of the possible incompatibility of GPE law with LAW taken in conjunction with LAW judgment of DATE , reported in PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG , which was dismissed on DATE . ORG held that , although an inability to inherit based solely on the ground of illegitimacy would be contrary to Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL , objective and reasonable grounds could exist to justify other kinds of restrictions on the intestate succession of \u201c illegitimate \u201d children . It then noted that in DATE a law had come into force aimed at bringing the position of \u201c illegitimate \u201d recognised children into line with the requirements enunciated by ORG in ORG v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . During the debate on the bill in ORG , the then Minister of ORG had declared that the question of the position of \u201c illegitimate \u201d unrecognised children in relation to their biological fathers was a valid one , but that it fell to be dealt with in the planned reform of the law of succession .", "CARDINAL . Since then a number of attempts had been made to bring about this reform and , at the time of ORG examination of the present case , a bill was before ORG . It thus appeared that the legislature was of the view that a reform of the law of succession required the making of important political choices and that the legislative process had not yet come to an end . From this , ORG concluded in the first place that the absence in GPE law at the time of a rule making \u201c illegitimate \u201d unrecognised children the heirs of their biological fathers was not based solely on illegitimacy but on the difficulty , inherent in a reform of legislation , of reaching a sound balance between all the interests involved in the law of succession . Secondly , it followed that the choices to be made fell beyond the scope of the judiciary 's jurisprudential tasks and that it was not possible to anticipate legislative developments by judgment . The judgment of ORG was published in GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , with a critical annotation by a learned author .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON \u2013\u201cCC \u201d ) , only those persons who have a legally recognised family relationship ( familierechtelijke betrekking ) with a person who has died intestate may inherit from that person .", "CARDINAL . Legally recognised family relationships between a father and a child exist where a child is born to a married couple or if it is born within DATE following the dissolution of the marriage ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) . An \u201c illegitimate \u201d child will have a legally recognised family relationship with its father ( who does not have to be the biological father ) if it has been recognised ( erkenning ) by the father , either before or after its birth ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , according to LAW , a legally recognised family relationship will also come into existence with the granting of letters of legitimation if it is established that the father , having died before the child was born and without having recognised it , was aware of the pregnancy and had intended to marry the mother .", "CARDINAL . According to the rules of intestacy , if a deceased does not leave any children with whom he has a legally recognised family relationship or a spouse , his parents and siblings ( or their descendants ) will inherit from him ( LAW ) . If there are such children or a spouse , the parents and siblings are excluded from the inheritance ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Within DATE of the death of the father , a minor child with whom the late father had no legally recognised family relationship may request that an obligation be imposed on the father 's heirs to make a lump sum available for his care and upbringing . In the determination of this amount , the court dealing with the request may not exceed the legally reserved portion of the estate ( wettelijk erfdeel ) to which the child would have been entitled had he had a legally recognised family relationship with his father ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . This is an elaboration of the principle enunciated in LAW that , where there is no legally recognised family relationship between a father and his child , the former is only bound to provide maintenance ( levensonderhoud ) for the child until it has come of age . The legally reserved portion of an estate is that part of a person 's estate which will be attributed , according to the rules of intestacy , to the heirs who are direct descendants or ascendants , and which the testator is unable to dispose of by way of donation when alive , or by will .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bill was presented in ORG aimed at amending , inter alia , the law of descent ( afstammingsrecht ; ORG ( ORG ) DATE , CARDINAL , ORG . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , and on DATE a change to the Civil Code came into force . It introduced a judicial declaration of paternity ( gerechtelijke vaststelling van vaderschap , LAW ) which may be requested by the mother or the child . A declaration of paternity has retroactive force to the time of the child 's birth , but it does not adversely affect any rights acquired in good faith by third parties .", "CARDINAL . According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill , the possibility of having paternity determined judicially exists in all neighbouring countries . The absence of this possibility could be in conflict with LAW taken in conjunction with LAW , since it could lead to a situation where a child was deprived of a father if the latter were unwilling to recognise it . It was felt that this defect could not be remedied by the fact that a request for determination of a parental maintenance contribution could be made against the father pursuant to LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
