The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE and living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant married PERSON . They had CARDINAL children : PERSON , born on DATE , and PERSON , born on DATE . PERSON died of cancer on DATE , at DATE . The applicant is the administrator of his late wife 's estate .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had been employed as a local authority housing officer . For the greater part of her married life , she was the primary breadwinner . She had paid full social - security contributions as an employed earner until DATE , and was subsequently entitled to contribution credits as a person unfit for work . On DATE the applicant gave up work to nurse his wife and care for their children . Following his wife 's death , he worked part time DATE and DATE , for an DATE salary of MONEY ( GBP ) , but since this proved uneconomic he stopped working to care full time for the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for the payment of social - security benefits . He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of PERSON would have been entitled , namely a widow 's payment and a widowed mother 's allowance , payable under ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the benefits he had claimed did not exist for widowers , and that his claim accordingly could not be accepted as valid . The letter continued :", "\u201c I am afraid I can only explain that the ORG says that it has no plans to introduce a widowers ' pension on the same line as the existing widows ' benefits .", "It may help if I explain the current policy underlying widows ' benefits was established at a time when married women rarely worked . It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse 's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship . The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems , those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for DATE .", "It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced . However , it is still broadly the case that on bereavement , women are more likely than men to be in financial need . For instance , most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives . They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work . Women on average earn less than men . So even for women who have been working , the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men .", "Widows ' benefits are not means tested and are paid regardless of the level of the widows ' earnings . The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings , and in some cases , very high earnings indeed . To make existing widows ' benefits provisions available to widowers would add MONEY to the DATE ORG budget . The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered , this is simply not a best use of scarce resources .", "In making these points , the ORG says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers , in particular those left with small children to care for . For them there are already available benefits such as ORG and CARDINAL Parent Benefit , together with the range of income - related benefits , for example , Income Support for those not in full time work and ORG for low paid workers . In the ORG 's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows ' benefits along the lines suggested . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on DATE . ORG declined jurisdiction on the basis that no appealable decision had been made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant currently receives child benefit and , in respect of his son PERSON , received a disability living allowance and an invalid care allowance for a period following his wife 's death . He is also in receipt of a widower 's pension under PERSON occupational pension scheme . The applicant has capital , much of which is derived from a joint endowment policy ( for which he and PERSON had paid premiums ) which matured on PERSON death , from which he obtains a further income of MONEY per month . Because of his savings , the applicant does not qualify for means - tested benefits such as income support or family credit . All the social - security benefits he receives would also be received by a widow , who would in addition be paid a widow 's payment and a widowed mother 's allowance .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under GPE law , certain social - security benefits , including widow 's payment , widowed mother 's allowance and widow 's pension , are paid for out of ORG . By CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the funds required for paying such benefits are to be provided by means of contributions payable to the Secretary of ORG by earners , employers and others , together with certain additions made to the ORG by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Male and female earners are obliged to pay the same social - security contributions in accordance with their status as employed earners or self - employed earners .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , a woman who has been widowed is entitled to a widow 's payment ( a lump sum payment of GBP CARDINAL ) if :", "( i ) she is under pensionable age at the time when her husband died , or he was not then entitled to a Category A retirement pension ; and", "( ii ) her husband satisfied certain specified social - security contribution conditions set out in a schedule to LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW of the DATE Act , a woman who has been widowed ( and who is not remarried ) is entitled to a widow 's pension if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the LAW ; and", "( i ) at the date of her husband 's death she was over DATE but under DATE ; or", "( ii ) she ceased to be entitled to a widowed mother 's allowance at the time she was over DATE but under DATE .", "If the applicant were a woman , he could look forward to entitlement to a widow 's pension at some stage DATE , depending on when his youngest child ceased to be a dependant , at which time he would no longer be entitled to the widowed mother 's allowance .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , which applies to the applicant , provides that no entitlement to a benefit arises unless a claim for the benefit is made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time .", "At the relevant time , the time - limits for claiming a widow 's payment and a widowed mother 's allowance were set out in ORG Regulations DATE ( Statutory Instrument CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , Regulation CARDINAL of which provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The prescribed time for claiming benefits not specified in column ( CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL shall be \u2013", "...", "( b ) DATE in the case of ... widow 's benefit ...", "( CARDINAL ) The periods of TIME prescribed by paragraph ( CARDINAL ) are calculated from DATE on which , apart from satisfying the condition of making a claim , the claimant is entitled to the benefit concerned . \u201d", "In addition , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE provides , in relation to claims for a widow 's payment :", "\u201c Where under subsection ( CARDINAL ) above a person is required to make a claim or to be treated as making a claim for a benefit in order to be entitled to it \u2013", "( a ) if the benefit is a widow 's payment , she shall not be entitled to it in respect of a death occurring DATE before the date on which the claim is made or treated as made ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) introduces CARDINAL new social - security benefits , the widowed parent 's allowance and the bereavement allowance . The widowed parent 's allowance replaces the widowed mother 's allowance . The bereavement allowance replaces the widow 's pension . Both are payable to men and women who meet the relevant qualifying conditions . LAW also introduces a new social - security payment , called a bereavement payment , payable both to men and women in place of the widow 's payment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant parts of the LAW came into force on DATE and allow any man whose wife dies before , on or after that date , or any woman whose husband dies on or after that date , to apply for the widowed parent 's allowance . It also allows any man whose wife dies on or after that date to apply for the bereavement payment or the bereavement allowance in exactly the same way as a woman whose husband dies on or after that date .", "CARDINAL . The transitional provisions of the DATE Act preserve the entitlements of women under LAW whose husbands died before DATE . Such women thus continue to be entitled to the widow 's payment , the widowed mother 's allowance and the widow 's pension where the relevant qualifying conditions are met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON delivered judgment in ORG in a case brought by CARDINAL claimants , all of whom were widowers claiming , inter alia , that their ineligibility for widows ' benefits under LAW was discriminatory contrary to LAW taken in conjunction with both LAW No . CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the claimants had been left with dependent children , with the result that the benefits at issue in their cases were the widow 's payment and the widowed mother 's allowance . The fourth claimant ( Mr Naylor ) had been left without dependent children , with the result that the benefits at issue in his case were the widow 's payment and the widow 's pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP The defendant government department conceded before ORG that there had been discrimination under LAW taken in conjunction with LAW to non - payment of the widowed mother 's allowance . As regards the question of whether the claimants ' complaints , in so far as they related to the widow 's payment and the widow 's pension , fell within the ambit of LAW commented as follows :", "\u201c In my view , the availability of pecuniary support afforded by ORG and ORG does have a significant effect on the relationship of a family prior to the death of the spouse . They form a significant part of a family 's plans for a secure future . ...", "Financial planning seems to me to be a significant aspect of family life and the benefits play some part in allaying fears for the future of a surviving spouse . ...", "Moreover , Widow 's Payments and Widow 's Pensions form part of a congeries of provisions , all of which are designed to provide support to a surviving spouse at different stages of her life . Widow 's Payments ... are CARDINAL - off payments made immediately on bereavement . Widowed Mother 's Allowances are paid whilst she looks after dependent children and PERSON 's Pension payable in the longer term DATE when she has finished bringing up her children . Viewed as part of a package , the payments and pensions payable to a widow are bound to be of concern to the family before the death of the husband .", "Accordingly , for those reasons I conclude that the failure to make Widow 's Payment and ORG available to a surviving widower falls within the ambit of LANGUAGE CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Thus LAW is itself engaged . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In dismissing the claimants ' arguments that the same complaints fell also within the ambit of LAW No . CARDINAL , Mr Justice PERSON commented :", "\u201c ... In order to establish that the benefits in issue are their possessions , the claimants must establish a pecuniary right based upon their contributions . Absent such contributions , they have no possession within the meaning of LAW . There is no hint , in any of the cases that the [ ORG intended to depart from the fundamental principle that to come within the ambit of LAW , a property right must be established . ...", "... A deceased widow 's entitlement to benefits depends upon the contributions of the deceased husband . ... A widower has no entitlement under domestic legislation arising from the contributions of his deceased spouse . He thus has no entitlement and consequently no possession within the meaning of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
