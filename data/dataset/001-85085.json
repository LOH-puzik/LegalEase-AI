The court described the facts set out in CARDINAL above , except the part concerning Mr M. NORP \u2019s indirect membership of ORG at the time when it had taken out bank loans which it had failed to repay , and held as follows :", "\u201c ... The actus reus of the offence of defamation is characterised by the divulging of vilifying DATE and untrue \u2013 circumstances relating to a specific individual . The expression used by [ the applicant ] \u2013 \u2018 credit DATE is derived from the Information About NonPerforming Credits Act [ of DATE ] , on the basis of whose section CARDINAL the administration of the [ ORG ] has published a list of all debtors , persons who have outstanding credits . Therefore the expression \u2018 credit ORG has a negative connotation and presupposes intolerance and extremely negative public attitudes . These are people who have prospered financially due to credits from financial institutions which they have failed to repay . In this sense , from a moral point of view these persons do not enjoy a good reputation and are perceived as dishonest . The law bans these persons from holding certain official posts .", "The above characterises the expression used by [ the applicant ] \u2013 \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 \u2013 as vilifying and damaging to the public reputation of the person [ in respect of whom it is used ] and the esteem of his personality . The vilifying circumstance has been divulged through the press to a large number of readers . The fact that the first version of the article had a smaller circulation than the second , which also contained [ Mr PERSON ] rebuttal , is of no consequence , because the circulation of the printed material has no impact on the criminality of the act .", "The act has been committed wilfully , the form of mens rea being recklessness . [ The applicant ] realised the criminality of her act and its injurious consequences , and accepted that they would occur . [ She ] pursued another aim , which is not unlawful \u2013informing the newspaper \u2019s readers of the latest news about the candidates for the post of deputy Minister of Finance in the ORG cabinet \u2013 , but was aware that the information published was untrue and did not correspond to the actual facts . The court \u2019s findings in this respect are based on the fact that [ the applicant ] did not carry out a proper journalistic enquiry before publishing her story .", "No regulations for conducting a journalistic enquiry were in existence at the time when the article was published . Accordingly , in his or her work each journalist had to abide by and comply with the settled customary rules in the branch , which are in line with Articles DATE to CARDINAL of the [ LAW of DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , which contain requirements and restrictions in the exercise of the rights proclaimed thereby . In the instant case , it was established that [ the applicant ] had not carried out the required comprehensive and thorough journalistic enquiry , as required by the rules of investigative journalism , that is , to receive confirmation from CARDINAL independent sources .", "The first of [ the applicant ] \u2019s sources was a Member of the majority in ORG , who conveyed the information relating to [ Mr PERSON ] off the record , citing no sources , that is , it was unclear whether he had obtained it through his participation in a parliamentary committee or also through unofficial channels . He should have therefore , according to best journalistic practice , been considered an unreliable source . This fact obliged [ the applicant ] to duly check the information she had received through other , public and reliable , sources and not trust completely what she had heard in ORG . The information received from [ Mr N. ] did not in fact constitute another dependable source of information . The latter relied on the publication of the ORG publishing house The Full List of Credit Millionaires , in whose preface [ Mr M. NORP ] had been identified as a debtor through CARDINAL of his companies \u2013 FBK Maxcom , Maxcom Holding and Maxcom OOD . [ The applicant ] was therefore under the obligation to check whether [ Mr PERSON ] indeed owned shares in these companies , because the mere linking of his name to the companies in a publication was not enough to perceive the information as authentic . This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the publication in issue gave the names of the companies , not of their shareholders , for which reason the statement in its preface was not confirmed by its contents . However , [ the applicant ] did not take the requisite steps to verify the facts alleged by [ Mr N. ] and the publication \u2019s preface . She merely established , after a check in the ORG information system , that [ Mr PERSON ] was a shareholder in the company Vitaplant [ OOD ] , which also featured on the list of persons with outstanding credits . The company Vitaplant [ OOD ] was not , however , among the companies connected to [ Mr PERSON \u2019s name in the publication \u2019s preface , and that should have prompted [ the applicant ] to doublecheck her assumptions . However , [ the applicant ] assumed that the link uncovered by her was sufficient to corroborate the statement that [ Mr PERSON ] was a credit millionaire . She thus failed to comply with her duty of thoroughly verifying the information through reliable , independent sources . [ The applicant ] did not check whether the statement in the [ publication \u2019s ] preface that [ Mr PERSON ] was connected to CARDINAL debtor companies corresponded to the truth , which was mandatory . The fact that she works at a DATE newspaper does not absolve her of the obligation to carry out thorough journalistic enquiries . She had access to information in the register of companies , which is public , in order to check the veracity of the information she had gathered . Not only did [ the applicant ] not do that , but in her article she relied on a document with which she had not been duly acquainted DATE the official list of borrowers compiled by the [ ORG ] . The statement in her article that the CARDINAL companies \u2013 Maxcom Holding , Maxcom OOD and ORG DATE were companies of [ Mr PERSON ] was not supported by due journalistic enquiry . Her source , [ Mr N. ] , relied on the publication of ORG , which in fact means that [ the applicant ] \u2019s information was solely based on the preface of the list , which was not enough , considering that this information had not been verified either .", "The readers\u2019 right to be informed of socalled \u2018 hot ORG does not absolve the article \u2019s author from checking carefully the accuracy of her publication . The fact that [ the applicant ] did not take the necessary steps in this direction confirms the court \u2019s conclusion that her act was wilful . There must be a balance between the reader \u2019s right to information and the rights of the persons affected by journalistic materials . The one responsible for this balance is the author , who must abide by the rules of investigative journalism . It is beyond doubt that the time and means available to a journalist on a DATE newspaper for a proper enquiry concerning a current issue are greatly limited , but [ the applicant ] was bound to do what was possible to verify the information she had gathered . In the case at hand [ the applicant ] had enough time to consult the register of companies , so as to report on the rumours heard in the lobby of the ORG building and at the same time to present the actual facts . It is precisely [ the applicant ] \u2019s passivity in respect of this second element which makes her act criminal . The lack of a full enquiry into the facts , performed with due journalistic care , and the applicant \u2019s own statement that she did not carry out a full enquiry into Mr PERSON involvement in the companies mentioned in the article , allow [ the court to conclude ] that she was not confident that her allegations were true . On the contrary , the fact that [ the applicant ] is an experienced journalist , maintains contacts with colleagues of hers from other media , with whom she exchanges information concerning such news , allows [ the court to conclude ] that she knew that information about outstanding credits of [ Mr PERSON ] had been published before . She was therefore aware that the CARDINAL newspapers which had published similar articles had also published refutations , and had apologised to [ Mr PERSON ] for the untruthfulness of their allegations . [ The applicant ] did not do all she was professionally bound to do in respect of the specific enquiry , which points to intent . She allowed herself to rely on sources which she had not checked , but which made her article look persuasive and objective .", "CONCERNING THE PENALTY :", "In determining the type and quantum of punishment the court had regard to the following :", "The court is of the view that all necessary prerequisites for replacing [ the applicant ] \u2019s criminal liability and imposing an administrative punishment on her are in place . The offence committed by her is punishable by a fine . [ The applicant ] has not been previously convicted of a publicly prosecutable offence and exonerated of criminal liability ... For this reason , the court is of the view that [ the applicant ] should be exonerated of criminal liability and punished administratively by a fine .", "In determining the amount of the fine the court had regard to [ the applicant ] \u2019s means , earned as a journalist , as well as to certain mitigating circumstances , such as a critical attitude to her act , cooperation in establishing the facts , [ and ] good character . All of these favour a lower fine , that is [ ORG ] CARDINAL .", "The court contemplated the possibility ... of imposing an additional punishment , but accepted that this is not necessary as the fine is sufficient to reform and deter [ the applicant ] and the general public .", "CONCERNING THE CIVIL CLAIM :", "The existence of damage resulting from the offence under LAW of the [ LAW of DATE ] is an unrebuttable presumption and , in view of the court \u2019s finding that the applicant acted with mens rea , the only outstanding issue is the quantum of damage . It is beyond doubt that the publication authored by [ the applicant ] damaged [ Mr M.D. ] \u2019s reputation and public esteem . He should therefore be compensated for that damage . At the same time it has not been proved beyond doubt that the article has affected [ Mr PERSON \u2019s business relations with his partners , [ or ] has hindered his prospective career in the executive , that is , has prevented him from being appointed to a highranking position . [ His ] allegations in this respect remained a mere conjecture , lacking clear distinction between reality and possibility . All averments in a criminal complaint are subject to proof at trial , including the quantum of the damage . For this reason , the lack of evidence leads to the conclusion that [ Mr PERSON \u2019s claim for ORG is unproven . [ The claimant ] is not relieved of the burden of proving the exact quantum of the sustained damage , irrespective of his statement in the criminal complaint that the amount will be donated for charitable purposes .", "The court ruled in equity , as required by [ the law ] and the established caselaw , accepting that [ the applicant ] should be ordered to pay [ Mr M. D. ] the amount of ORG CARDINAL as compensation for the nonpecuniary damage suffered as a result of the offence . [ The applicant ] is to pay interest on this amount at the legal rate from DATE until settlement . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . She argued , inter alia , that the lower court had erred in varying its order giving her leave to present evidence on the ground that that evidence had already been adduced by the private prosecuting party . It had thus restricted her capacity to prove the veracity of her allegations against Mr PERSON The lower court had also erred in accepting that she had acted with mens rea , which was excluded on account of , in particular , the fact that there had been prior publications stating that Mr PERSON was a \u201c credit millionaire \u201d . The applicant finally stated that her conviction and sentence were contrary to , inter alia , LAW . A journalist had the right to impart information received from others acting in their official capacity , which is how it was received in this case . She was under no obligation to verify publicly disclosed information . She had received the information from a Member of ORG , immediately after a discussion within his parliamentary group on the matter , and had simply passed it on .", "CARDINAL . In a supplementary memorial of DATE the applicant further said that she had not committed the actus reus of defamation , as Mr PERSON was indeed a \u201c credit millionaire \u201d , which was the actual vilifying circumstance , not the fact that he had been involved in certain companies . This fact was further evidenced by the judgment dismissing his tort action against ORG . The evidence presented merely proved that he was not on the list of \u201c credit millionaires \u201d as a physical person . It was therefore still possible that he could have been one through participation in certain companies , as she had tried to prove . The lower court \u2019s findings in respect of , inter alia , Mr PERSON direct and indirect participation in the companies mentioned were likewise erroneous . The court had also incorrectly held that the applicant had acted recklessly . She personally , and also her colleagues , had made numerous checks through various sources , which had led them to believe , in good faith and in line with the rules of investigative journalism , that Mr PERSON was a \u201c credit millionaire \u201d . The alleged insufficiency of the verification could only indicate negligence , not intent . Finally , the fact that the impugned information had previously been made public excluded defamation .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court held a hearing on DATE . It admitted in evidence a number of documents produced by the applicant with a view to establishing Mr PERSON participation in Vitaplant OOD , refused certain other evidentiary requests by the applicant , and heard the parties\u2019 arguments .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG noted the facts set out in paragraphs PERSON above , including the part relating to Mr M. D. \u2019s participation in Vitaplant OOD at the time when it had taken out bank loans which it had failed to repay , and upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence in the following terms :", "\u201c ... The parties are not in dispute about the facts [ established by the court ] . There is also no dispute about the [ lower court ] \u2019s finding that the statement that a given person is a \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 because companies owned by him appear on the [ ORG ] \u2019s list of debtors with \u2018 bad PERSON is objectively vilifying for him or her . [ The applicant \u2019s ] defence raises legal arguments , which outline CARDINAL disputed questions . The first is whether there is defamation where the facts set out in the publication are untrue , but the conclusion made on their basis is true on other grounds . The defence argues that [ Mr PERSON ] is in fact a \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 , not on account of the companies cited in the publication , but because of [ his involvement in ] another company \u2013 Vitaplant OOD . The second is whether an individual who owns a share in a company with outstanding credits can be deemed a \u2018 credit ORG . The view of [ the court ] on these questions is as follows :", "The expression \u2018 credit ORG is not legally defined . It has entered the journalistic vernacular and is used in everyday speech to describe individuals who have acquired large amounts of money as a result of the use , by them personally or by physical or legal persons connected with them , of unsecured bank credits , which have remained unpaid and have been listed by the [ ORG ] as unrecoverable . The expression is pejorative , because it implies that the people in question are supposedly responsible for the crisis in the banking system and the socalled \u2018 ORG of the banks \u2013 generally persons who have become rich in a criminal way . A list of \u2018 credit FAC as an official document emanating from the [ ORG ] has never existed . There exists a list of the persons with outstanding credits as of DATE , which has been compiled pursuant to ORG . This LAW requires the [ reportable ] credits to exceed MONEY \u2013 it does not concern only credits with CARDINAL or more figures . According to [ the LAW ] , the list is published in a special bulletin , which is not covered by bank secrecy and is sent to ORG , ORG , the tax and customs authorities and ORG . After its receipt at ORG on DATE the list was made available to journalists and was published in full or in part as a list of the \u201c credit millionaires \u201d . In fact , the vilifying circumstance is not to own specific companies , but to be a \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 . In the view of the [ court ] , however , such a dissection of the statement in [ the applicant ] \u2019s publication and the application of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ] to CARDINAL of the resulting parts can not be made , for the following reasons . Readers are not bound to accept journalistic statements uncritically . An abundance of specifically alleged facts in support of those statements is key to persuading readers that they are truthful . Such facts in the case at hand are the citing of an official document featuring [ Mr PERSON \u2019s name ( untrue ) and the citing of specific companies owned by [ Mr PERSON ] with specific debts ( also untrue ) . There is no doubt that without these untrue allegations the statement that [ Mr PERSON ] is a credit millionaire would have been uncorroborated and unconvincing and its refutation would have presented no problem for him . It would be wrong to divide an averment containing a vilifying circumstance into CARDINAL parts for a second reason : the damage to the reputation and the public esteem of a defamed person is not a constant value . The degree of that damage may vary significantly . In the instant case , where there is a statement that an individual is a \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 because of his involvement in companies which have received credits , the [ court ] considers that the greater the amount of the outstanding credits , the more numerous the companies having received them , the more direct the connection of the individual with these debtor companies , and , last but not least , the noisier the public scandal , the more vilifying is the statement . [ Mr PERSON ] would suffer a lesser degree of defamation if the amount of the outstanding credits was one and not MONEY , if the article had cited CARDINAL unknown company instead of CARDINAL companies which had become notorious because of their link with criminal investigations , and if [ Mr PERSON ] had not been indicated as [ their ] sole owner instead of merely a shareholder [ in them ] .", "Because of the meaning implied in the expression \u2018 credit millionaire\u2019 the [ court ] considers that in the event of a credit taken by a company , an individual could be deemed as having profited therefrom , in the range of MONEY , only if [ his or her ] connection with that company is direct , and not through the intermediary of participation in companies which in turn participate in other companies , and if the shareholding is big enough to allow a substantial amount of the credit to pass on to him . The link may likewise exist through participation in the management [ of these companies ] . At the time when the credit was received [ Mr PERSON ] did not participate directly in Vitaplant [ OOD ] . He was neither a manager of that company , nor a substantial shareholder . The credit itself was not in an amount which would make him a \u2018 millionaire\u2019 .", "The arguments relating to the existence of a civil judgment dismissing a tort action by Mr PERSON against ORG are irrelevant , as from the reasons of this judgment it is apparent that the action had not been supported by evidence of the nonpecuniary damage sustained , whereas the civil courts are under no obligation to gather such evidence . This judgment is not binding on the criminal court .", "The arguments relating to the lack of mens rea are unfounded . The court considers that the [ lower court ] has correctly accepted as true [ the applicant ] \u2019s statements that she had verified the information from CARDINAL independent sources \u2013 the Members of ORG and [ Mr N. ] , after which she had assured herself of its veracity from the existence of numerous prior publications in different newspapers .
