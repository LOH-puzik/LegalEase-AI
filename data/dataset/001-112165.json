The applicant association , which was set up in DATE , is a non - profit association registered in PERSON ( GPE of GPE ) . It is the national branch of ORG , an organisation based in GPE and founded in DATE by PERSON , known as \u201c PERSON \u201d . According to its constitution , its aim is to make the first contacts and establish good relations with extraterrestrials .", "CARDINAL . According to the information available on the applicant association \u2019s website at the time of the adoption of the present judgment , ORG doctrine is based on PERSON \u2019s alleged contact with the \u201c Elohim \u201d , extraterrestrials with \u201c advanced technology \u201d , who are said to have created life on earth and a number of world religions , including NORP , ORG and ORG . ORG followers believe that scientific and technical progress is of fundamental importance and that cloning and the \u201c transfer of conscience \u201d will enable man to become immortal . In that connection ORG has expressed opinions in favour of human cloning .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some texts of ORG or works written by PERSON himself advocate a system of government called \u201c geniocracy \u201d , a doctrine whereby power should be entrusted only to those individuals who have the highest level of intellect .", "CARDINAL . In his book Sensual Meditation Ra\u00ebl defines this concept as an \u201c instruction manual \u201d given to humans by extraterrestrials , enabling each person \u201c to discover his / her body and especially to learn how to use it to enjoy sounds , colors , smells , tastes , caresses , and particularly a sexuality felt with all one \u2019s senses , so as to experience the cosmic orgasm , infinite and absolute , which illuminates the mind by linking the one who reaches it with the universes he / she is composed of and composes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association requested authorisation from the police administration for the city of ORG ( the \u201c police administration \u201d ) to conduct a poster campaign in the period DATE . The poster in question , measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY , featured in the upper part the following wording in large yellow characters on a dark blue background : \u201c The Message from Extraterrestrials \u201d ; in the lower part of the poster , in characters of the same size but in bolder type , the address of ORG website , together with a telephone number in GPE , could be seen ; at the very bottom was the phrase \u201c Science at last replaces religion \u201d . The middle of the poster was taken up by pictures of extraterrestrials\u2019 faces and a pyramid , together with a flying saucer and the LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police administration denied authorisation , referring to CARDINAL previous refusals . It had been indicated in a NORP parliamentary report on sects , dating from DATE , and in a judgment of the president of ORG for the district of GPE Sarine ( GPE of GPE ) , that ORG engaged in activities that were contrary to public order ( ordre public ) and immoral .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the municipal council of the city of ORG dismissed an appeal from the applicant association , finding that it could not rely on the protection of religious freedom because it was to be regarded as a dangerous sect . The interference with freedom of expression had been based on LAW ( the \u201c Regulations \u201d ) ; its purpose was to protect the public interest and it was proportionate , since the organisation advocated , among other things , human cloning , \u201c geniocracy \u201d and \u201c sensual meditation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision . It noted that , for ORG , life on earth had been created by extraterrestrials , who were also the founders of the various religions and were capable of saving the world , and accepted that this amounted to a religious conviction protected by freedom of conscience and belief . It further accepted that the Regulations constituted a sufficient legal basis in such matters . The ORG observed that there was nothing offensive in the text and picture on the poster , or in the allusion to extraterrestrials . However , it pointed to the fact that ORG advocated \u201c geniocracy \u201d ( a political model based on intelligence ) and human cloning . Moreover , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had found that the movement also \u201c theoretically \u201d advocated paedophilia and incest , especially in the works of PERSON himself . The practice of \u201c sensual meditation \u201d could also easily lead to abuse . In addition , the website of PERSON , to which ORG site contained a link , offered specific services in the area of cloning , and the notion of eugenics was contrary to the principle of non - discrimination . The poster campaign was prejudicial to morals and to the rights of others . In any event , ORG had other means by which to disseminate its ideas .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association appealed to ORG for ORG . It claimed , among other things , that the mere defence of \u201c geniocracy \u201d , cloning and sensual meditation were not offensive opinions . Moreover , it argued that the movement denounced paedophilia through its association GPE . The refusal to authorise its poster thus amounted purely and simply to censorship , especially as the applicant association \u2019s website was , in any event , accessible through a search engine .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , after acknowledging , however , that the applicant association defended a global vision of the world and was entitled to both freedom of opinion and religious freedom . It found first that the impugned measure was based on ORG , which constituted a law in the substantive sense , and that the poster had to be assessed in relation to the message conveyed by the books and websites that could be accessed from the movement \u2019s website . The services proposed by PERSON were manifestly contrary to NORP public order . The court further observed that criminal complaints had been filed against ORG alleging the existence of sexual practices that were intended to systematically corrupt young teenagers . The content of the works on \u201c geniocracy \u201d and \u201c sensual meditation \u201d could lead certain adults to sexually abuse children , the child being described in certain works as a \u201c privileged sexual object \u201d . The comments on \u201c geniocracy \u201d and the criticisms of contemporary democracies were likely to undermine public order , safety and morality . For those reasons ORG concluded that it was not justifiable to authorise the dissemination of such ideas on the public highway .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant association lodged a public - law appeal against that judgment with ORG , requesting that it be set aside and that the case be referred back to the respondent authority for a new decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , served on the applicant association on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . The relevant passages read as follows :", "\u201c The ORG , and subsequently ORG , acknowledged that the [ applicant ] association could rely on the right to freedom of religion ( Art . CARDINAL of the LAW , Art . CARDINAL ORG and Art . CARDINAL UN Covenant II ) , in so far as it defended a global vision of the world , especially as regards its creation and the origin of the various religions . ORG disputes this , noting that the aim of the [ applicant ] association as defined in LAW , is not religious in nature . According to a report on \u2018 sects\u2019 produced in DATE for ORG , ORG is classified among the movements that present dangers for the individual , especially on account of the excessive financial demands made of its members and practices that cause bodily harm , and also dangers for the community , in particular through an antisocial discourse . Many of the movement \u2019s publications contain passages described as offensive .", "There is no need to ascertain whether a religious movement may , on account of the dangers it represents , be precluded from relying on the right to freedom of religion , or whether the [ applicant ] association presents such dangers . Indeed , the parties agree that the [ applicant ] is entitled to rely on the right to freedom of opinion . As to the conditions in which such freedom may be restricted , as laid down in LAW , it makes little difference whether LAW is relied on ( see also LAW and LAW ) . The [ applicant][applicant ] relies on the principles of proportionality and public interest , without distinction as to the constitutional right invoked .", "...", "CARDINAL According to case - law , citizens do not have an unconditional right to an extended use of public space , in particular when a means of advertising on the public highway involves activity of a certain scale and duration , and excludes any similar use by third parties ( ORG judgment CARDINAL I CARDINAL point CARDINALc / aa p. CARDINAL and the judgments cited therein ) . When it wishes to grant authorisation for extended or private use of public space , or when it supervises the conditions under which a licence is used , the ORG must nevertheless take into account , in balancing the interests at stake , the substantive content of the right to freedom of expression ( ORG judgment CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL point CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL In the present case , the grounds given by ORG to confirm the refusal by GPE relate to respect for morality and the NORP legal order . ORG took the view that it was necessary to take into account not only the content of the poster but also the ideas conveyed by ORG , together with the works and websites that could be accessed from the movement \u2019s website . CARDINAL different criticisms are thus directed against the [ applicant ] association . Firstly , the [ applicant ] association \u2019s website contains a link to that of PERSON , via which this company offers specific cloning - related services to the general public and announced , in DATE , the birth of cloned babies . Cloning is prohibited under NORP law , pursuant to Art . CARDINAL of the LAW and to ORG ( RS CARDINAL ) . Secondly , ORG referred to a judgment of ORG , which mentioned possible sexual abuse of children . Numerous members of the movement had , moreover , been investigated by the police because of their sexual practices . Thirdly , the promotion of \u2018 GPE , a doctrine according to which power should be given to the most intelligent individuals , and the criticism consequently directed at contemporary democracies , was likely to undermine the maintaining of public order , safety and morality .", "CARDINAL The [ applicant ] no longer contests , at this stage , the existence of a sufficient legal basis , namely , in this case , LAW . A municipal by - law offers the same guarantees , in terms of democratic legitimacy , as a Cantonal law , and thus constitutes a sufficient legal basis ( judgment MONEY of DATE , point CARDINAL , ORG judgment CARDINAL I xxx ; ORG judgment CARDINAL I CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and the references cited therein ) . The [ applicant ] invokes , however , the principle of public interest and criticises the respondent authorities for going beyond the content of the poster and engaging in an assessment of the [ applicant ] association \u2019s activities . It argues that if it had generally engaged in conduct that was immoral or in breach of public order , it would have been dissolved by the courts pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW . If no decision had been taken to that effect , it would not be possible to prohibit it from publicising its philosophy and world vision .", "CARDINAL The poster in itself does not contain anything , either in its text or in its illustrations , that was unlawful or likely to offend the general public . Above the central drawing representing extra - terrestrials appears the text \u2018 The Message from Extraterrestrials\u2019 , without any explanation . Below that , the [ applicant ] association \u2019s website address and a telephone number are printed in bolder type . The phrase \u2018 Science at last replaces ORG is admittedly capable of offending the religious beliefs of certain persons , but it is merely the expression of the movement \u2019s doctrine and can not be described as particularly provocative .", "The poster as a whole can thus clearly be seen as an invitation to visit the website of the [ applicant ] association or to contact it by telephone . Faced with such advertising , the authority must examine not only the acceptability of the advertisement \u2019s message as such , but also that of its content . It is therefore legitimate to ascertain whether the website in question might contain information , data or links capable of offending people or of infringing the law .", "Moreover , contrary to the [ applicant ] \u2019s allegation , an association may be criticised for opinions or activities which , without constituting grounds for dissolution within the meaning of LAW , nevertheless justify a restriction on advertising .", "CARDINAL As regards cloning , it was not the opinions expressed by the [ applicant ] association in favour of such practices ( particularly in the book Yes to Human Cloning , published in DATE and available via the [ applicant ] \u2019s website ) that were penalised , but the link with the company PERSON , set up by the association itself , which offers various practical services in this area for payment . The issue is thus not simply , contrary to what the [ applicant ] has argued , the expression of a favourable opinion of cloning , protected by LAW , but the practice of that activity , in breach of its prohibition under LAW ( a ) of LAW . That provision , accepted in DATE by the majority of the population and of GPE ( in the form of LAW novies ( a ) of the LAW ) , falls in particular within a policy of protection of human dignity , according to the conception thereof that is generally shared in this country ( FF DATE III CARDINAL ; see also the response of ORG to a question from PERSON of DATE ) . The [ applicant ] does not contest the unlawfulness of human cloning , especially if it is carried out for commercial gain ( section CARDINAL Medically Assisted Reproduction Act ; Art . CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( e ) of the LAW ) . Nor can it seriously contest the fact that the link to the PERSON website contributes to the promotion of an unlawful activity , and goes further than the mere expression of an opinion . On that first point , which already justifies the decision under appeal , the [ applicant ] has not put forward any real relevant argument within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL On DATE the Intercantonal Beliefs Information Centre provided information on ORG . This information shows , among other things , that the movement apparently has a political mission . Virulently attacking democracies , which are referred to as \u2018 mediocracies\u2019 , it defends the notion of \u2018 GPE , a political model based on ORG level of intelligence . A world government would consist of geniuses , elected by individuals whose intelligence is PERCENT higher than average . Admittedly , \u2018 GPE is presented as a utopia and not as a genuine political project ; contrary to the finding of ORG , this doctrine does not appear likely to undermine public order or safety .", "However , apart from the fact that the doctrine appears to be largely inspired by eugenics , it is manifestly capable of offending the democratic and anti - discriminatory convictions that underpin the rule of law ( see , in particular , the wording of the preamble to LAW of DATE , together with LAW concerning equality and the prohibition of discrimination ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL Lastly , according to the judgment under appeal , it can not be considered that ORG advocates paedophilia . However , numerous members have apparently been investigated by the police on account of their sexual practices . According to a judgment delivered on DATE by ORG Sarine , concerning a right of reply requested by ORG , the remarks made by PERSON in his works could lead certain adults to commit acts of sexual abuse against children . The judgment quotes extracts from works by PERSON that can be downloaded from the website of the [ applicant ] association , according to which the sexual education of children should not only be theoretical but should consist of a sensual education aimed at showing them how to derive pleasure from it . That judgment further indicates that , notwithstanding the denial subsequently issued on this point , certain articles published in the DATE newsletter Apocalypse described the child as a \u2018 privileged sexual object\u2019 . Lastly , it is stated that a friend and a member of ORG were convicted by ORG and sentenced to DATE imprisonment for sexually assaulting a DATE girl . The judgment was confirmed on CARDINAL DATE by ORG . An ordinary appeal and a public - law appeal by ORG were dismissed on DATE by ORG , having regard in particular to the equivocal writings of the movement \u2019s founder or members ( judgments ORG and PERSON ) .", "The case - file , moreover , contains various documents concerning criminal proceedings brought against members of the [ applicant association ] for sexual assault . A judgment of DATE of ORG clearly shows that acts of sexual abuse were committed by leaders of the movement against minors . The movement \u2019s leaders are thus said to have advocated \u2018 a broad sexual freedom strongly encouraging commission of the act\u2019 ; they had thus corrupted young teenagers by supposedly philosophical discourse , by increasingly specific sexual fondling and by inciting them more and more forcefully , in order to satisfy \u2018 their sexual needs and fantasies with young girls who had just turned DATE , and who were changing partners very quickly\u2019 .", "The fact that the impugned articles date from DATE and that there has been no conviction in GPE does not negate the involvement of members of the [ applicant ] association in acts leading to criminal sanctions . The [ applicant ] does not dispute the fact that certain passages in the books available via its website could lead adults to abuse children . On that point also , the [ applicant ] \u2019s arguments do not address the grounds set out in the decision under appeal . Since acts of abuse have indeed been recorded on the part of certain members of ORG , the argument that paedophilia is strongly condemned by the movement \u2019s official doctrine is not decisive .", "CARDINAL Having regard to the foregoing , the refusal issued to the [ applicant ] appears to be justified by sufficient public - interest grounds , because it is necessary to prevent the commission of acts constituting criminal offences under NORP law ( reproductive cloning and sexual acts with children ) . Moreover , certain passages in the works available via the [ applicant ] \u2019s website ( in particular about the \u2018 sensual LOC of children , and \u2018 GPE ) are likely to be seriously offensive to readers .", "CARDINAL The [ applicant ] invokes the principle of proportionality . It points out that the poster itself contains nothing that is contrary to public order , and maintains that the measure is not appropriate to the aim pursued .", "CARDINAL In accordance with LAW , any restriction on a fundamental right must be proportionate to the aim pursued . It must be appropriate to the fulfilment of that aim and any damage to private interests must be kept to a minimum ( ORG judgment CARDINAL I CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , and the references cited therein ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL In the present case , the public interest does not only consist in limiting the publicity given to the [ applicant ] association \u2019s website , in view of the reservations expressed above about public order and morality ; it is even more important to ensure that the ORG does not provide any support for such publicity by making public space available for it , which might suggest that it endorses or tolerates the opinions or conduct in question . From that perspective , the prohibition of the posters is appropriate to the aim pursued . Furthermore , the measure criticised by the [ applicant ] is confined to the display of posters in public spaces . The [ applicant ] association remains free to express its beliefs by many other means of communication at its disposal ( see the PERSON judgment of DATE , ORG CARDINAL-IX , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL The [ applicant ] takes the view that the authority should have suggested that it make changes to the poster in order to make the content acceptable . However , even though it was aware of the objections raised against its poster campaign , the [ applicant ] itself never proposed a version of the poster that was likely to be authorised . ORG , for its part , found that the poster should be prohibited even without the reference to the website , but this seems questionable ; there is no doubt , however , that the removal of the address in question would deprive the poster campaign of its object , which , as has been shown , is essentially to advertise the website itself . It is therefore difficult to see what comprehensible meaning the poster could have had without that reference to the website and to the telephone number .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL The impugned measure therefore respects the principle of proportionality , in all its aspects . It constitutes , for the same reasons , a restriction that is necessary \u2018 in a democratic society\u2019 , in particular for the protection of morals , within the meaning of LAW and LAW ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Posters of a similar design to that concerned by the present case \u2013 also containing ORG website address and a telephone number but a different text , namely \u201c The true face of God \u201d \u2013 were authorised in DATE in a number of NORP cities such as GPE and GPE . The applicant association was also able to conduct further campaigns with posters of other designs \u2013 some of which indicated ORG website address DATE in various NORP towns and cities other than ORG . However , in DATE , the town council of ORG refused to authorise a poster that the applicant association wished to display with the wording \u201c God does not exist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE concerns reproductive medicine and gene technology involving human beings . That provision reads as follows :", "\u201c Human beings shall be protected against the misuse of reproductive medicine and gene technology .", "The ORG shall legislate on the use of human reproductive and genetic material . In doing so , it shall ensure the protection of human dignity , privacy and the family and shall adhere in particular to the following principles :", "( a ) All forms of cloning and interference with the genetic material of human reproductive cells and embryos are unlawful .", "( b ) Non - human reproductive and genetic material may neither be introduced into nor combined with human reproductive material .", "( c ) Methods of medically assisted reproduction may be used only if infertility or the risk of transmitting a serious illness can not otherwise be overcome , but not in order to conceive a child with specific characteristics or for research purposes ; the fertilisation of human egg cells outside a woman \u2019s body is permitted only under the conditions laid down by the law ; no more human egg cells may be developed into embryos outside a woman \u2019s body than are capable of being immediately implanted .", "( d ) The donation of embryos and all forms of surrogate motherhood are unlawful .", "( e ) Trade in human reproductive material and in products obtained from embryos is prohibited .", "( f ) The genetic material of a person may be analysed , registered or made public only with the consent of the person concerned or if the law so provides .", "( g ) Everyone shall have access to data relating to their ancestry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a response of CARDINAL DATE to a ORG Member , who had asked whether measures should be taken against ORG under paragraph ( a ) of that LAW , ORG stated :", "\u201c As , in GPE , ORG is merely calling for the social recognition of cloning techniques \u2013 or for the lifting of the ban on cloning \u2013 its activity falls within the freedom of opinion ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
