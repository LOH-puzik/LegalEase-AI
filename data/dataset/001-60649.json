The first applicant , Mr PERSON , was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape in DATE . His tariff period ( the minimum period of detention satisfying the requirements of retribution and deterrence ) was set at DATE and expired in DATE . His time in prison was characterised by periods of thought disorder , delusions and behavioural problems and the Secretary of ORG decided that he was in need of care and treatment in a secure hospital . In DATE , he was made the subject of a transfer direction and a restriction order under , respectively , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( LAW ) and transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the Secretary of ORG decided , following consultation with the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice , that the first applicant should be regarded as a \u201c technical lifer \u201d ( that is a person who was suffering from a mental disorder which influenced him to a significant extent at the time of the offence although the court had not made a hospital order on sentencing ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the first applicant was transferred to ORG . On DATE , his case for discharge was considered by ORG which found that it was not satisfied that the first applicant did not any longer require treatment in a hospital for mental illness .", "CARDINAL . When his case was reviewed most recently , on DATE , the ORG recommended his discharge . The Secretary of ORG accepted the recommendation and the first applicant was discharged .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , PERSON , was sentenced to life imprisonment for buggery of a young girl in DATE . The court had before it psychiatric evidence to the effect that he suffered from mental illness . Expert psychiatric evidence recommended that he should be made subject to a hospital order coupled with a restriction order without limit of time under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG . Due to an absence of any beds in hospitals providing the level of security that the trial judge considered necessary , the judge felt unable to make the orders and passed , instead , a discretionary life sentence . The judge commented that the second applicant could later be transferred to hospital if his condition required it . His tariff period was set at DATE and expired in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the second applicant was transferred to hospital under LAW DATE ( later replaced by LAW ) . In DATE , the applicant returned to prison and there were several other transfers to and from hospital in subsequent DATE . In DATE , the second applicant was transferred to ORG under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act . In DATE , following consultation with the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice , the Secretary of ORG decided that the second applicant should be regarded as a \u201c technical lifer \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG considered the second applicant 's case for discharge and found that they were not satisfied that he no longer required treatment in hospital for mental illness . His case was reviewed most recently on DATE when the ORG again did not recommend discharge .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of the Secretary of ORG for ORG communicated to the applicants in DATE and DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused to certify the applicants as eligible for review by the discretionary lifer panels empowered by LAW CARDINAL to order their release on licence . Leave to apply for judicial review of the decisions was granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , granting the application , made a declaration that the Secretary of ORG 's policy not to certify discretionary life prisoners under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the Criminal Justice Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) on the ground that they had been transferred to hospital under LAW was unlawful ( [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE , ORG reversed ORG decision in part . It considered that , although the applicants were existing life prisoners within the meaning of the paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL , their discharge nevertheless remained subject to the procedure laid down in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . The rights to a hearing under the CARDINAL Act were conferred only on persons who were solely subject to that Act , and not on those who were mental patients ( [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were informed by letter of CARDINAL DATE that ORG had refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the Secretary of ORG may transfer a person serving a sentence of imprisonment to hospital if he is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness , psychopathic disorder , severe mental impairment or mental impairment , and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment , and , in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment , that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition . A transfer under LAW is called a \u201c transfer direction \u201d , and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( that is , where a court convicts a person and , instead of sentencing him , orders his detention in hospital ) .", "CARDINAL . At the same time as making a transfer direction , the Secretary of ORG may also make a \u201c restriction direction \u201d under section CARDINAL of LAW . A restriction direction has the same effect as a restriction order made by a court under LAW of LAW on conviction , save that because the person was not given a hospital order by the court , the Secretary of ORG must consent to his discharge from hospital , as well as to the granting of leave of absence or transfer to another hospital .", "CARDINAL . A transferred life prisoner subject to restriction directions can be discharged from hospital in CARDINAL possible ways . Each can be initiated only by the Secretary of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act gives the Secretary of ORG power , if he thinks fit , by warrant to discharge the patient either absolutely or subject to conditions .", "( CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that where the Secretary of ORG is notified by the responsible medical officer , and other registered practitioner or ORG that the person no longer requires treatment in hospital for mental disorder , or that no effective treatment for the disorder can be given in the hospital , the Secretary of ORG may remit the person to a prison or to a different institution , or he may exercise any power of releasing or discharging him which would have been exercisable if he had been so remitted .", "( CARDINAL ) Under LAW of LAW ,", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where an application to a ORG is made by a restricted patient who is subject to a restriction direction , or where the case of such a patient is referred to such a tribunal , the tribunal -", "( a ) shall notify the Secretary of ORG whether , in their opinion , the patient would , if subject to a restriction order , be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged under LAW ... ; and", "( b ) if they notify him that the patient would be entitled to be conditionally discharged , may recommend that in the event of his not being discharged under this section he should continue to be detained in hospital .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If in the case of a patient not falling within subsection ( CARDINAL ) below-", "( a ) the tribunal notify the Secretary of ORG that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged ; and", "( b ) within DATE beginning with the date of that notification the Secretary of ORG gives notice to the tribunal that the patient may be so discharged ,", "the tribunal shall direct the absolute or , as the case may be , the conditional discharge of the patient .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If , in the case of a patient who is subject to a transfer direction under LAW above , the tribunal notify the Secretary of ORG that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged , the Secretary of ORG shall , unless the tribunal have made a recommendation under subsection ( ORG ) above , by warrant direct that the patient be remitted to a prison or other institution in which he might have been detained if he had not been removed to hospital , there to be dealt with as if he had not been so removed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( which relates to restricted patients under section CARDINAL of LAW ) provides that the tribunal must direct conditional discharge if they are satisfied that he is not suffering from mental illness or disorder of a type which makes it appropriate for the person to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment , or that it is not necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment , and they believe that it is appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG Secretary announced that life sentence prisoners who had been transferred to hospital would normally be discharged under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act rather than sections DATE ( CARDINAL ) or CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) . This enables release on life licence with life - long control rather than the possibility of eventual absolute discharge by the Secretary of ORG .
