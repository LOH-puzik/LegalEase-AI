The applicant is a Gypsy by birth . Since her birth she has travelled constantly with her family , mainly in the GPE area , in search of work . When she married , the applicant and her husband continued to live in caravans . They have CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her husband used to stop for as long as possible on temporary or unofficial sites while he found work as a landscape gardener . They stayed for DATE on an unofficial site in GPE . They travelled for DATE in the ORG area . They were on the waiting list for a permanent site but were never offered a place . They were constantly moved from place to place by the police and representatives of local authorities . Their children 's education was constantly interrupted because they had to move about .", "CARDINAL . Due to harassment while she led a travelling life , which was detrimental to the health of the family and the education of the children , the applicant bought a piece of land in DATE with the intention of living on it in a mobile home . The land is within the area of ORG in GPE where there is no official Gypsy site . The applicant alleges that a ORG official had told her in DATE when she was encamped on the roadside that if she bought land she would be allowed to live on it . The Government state that there is no record of such a promise being made and that it would be unlikely that such a promise would be made , since it would be for ORG , not ORG , to decide any application . The land was also subject to a DATE discontinuance order requiring the site not to be used for the stationing of CARDINAL caravans .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her family moved on to the land and applied for planning permission . This was to enable the children to attend school immediately . ORG refused the application for planning permission on DATE and served enforcement notices .", "CARDINAL . Appeals were lodged against the enforcement notices . In DATE a public inquiry was held by an inspector appointed by ORG . He dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the ORG as the land was in FAC and he considered that the national and local planning policies should override the needs of the appellant . Since there was no official Gypsy site in the CARDINAL LOC district the family was given DATE to move from their land , the ORG having stated that a suitable location was being sought for them and that they would be able to move to a new official site within DATE .", "CARDINAL . When the DATE period expired , the family remained on the site since they had nowhere else to go . The applicant applied for planning permission for a bungalow , as it had been stated at the public inquiry that this would be a more appropriate use of the land than a mobile home . Planning permission was refused and the ORG 's decision was upheld at a further local inquiry . The family remained on the site and the ORG served summonses on the applicant and her husband for failure to comply with an enforcement notice . On DATE they were both fined MONEY ( GBP ) , with costs of GBP CARDINAL in the Magistrates ' Court . On DATE they were again fined , this time GBP CARDINAL each , with costs of GBP CARDINAL . To avoid further court action , the family returned to a nomadic life and were constantly moved from place to place by ORG officials . The applicant 's eldest daughter had started a hairdressing course at a college of further education and the second daughter was about to start studying at college for a diploma in forestry . Both of these courses had to be abandoned and the CARDINAL younger children could no longer attend school .", "CARDINAL . During this period the applicant made a further planning application for a bungalow on her land . Again her application was refused and failed after an inquiry . In DATE the applicant and her family returned to their land in a caravan . Enforcement notices were issued by ORG . The applicant appealed against them and there was a planning inquiry on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision letter of DATE , the inspector dismissed the appeal . In his decision , he stated , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Local policies in GPE of DATE , as revised by LAW of DATE and the CARDINAL LOC of DATE , reaffirm that PERSON and the surrounding countryside lie within FAC ... The Structure Plan contains policies also on ORG and Gypsy sites . ORG shows that the site lies outside the core of the village , but within an ORG and also , within an Area of Great Landscape Value , now , by virtue of ORG , termed a LOC .", "...", "CARDINAL . The appeal site is a deep plot of QUANTITY ha on the frontage of PERSON which leads from PERSON , a village in the Metropolitan Green Belt ; past the site to the west are a few dwellings , a nursery and LOC . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . From the evidence before me and from my inspection of the site and the surrounding area it is clear to me that the principal issues in these matters are , first , whether the developments for which permissions are sought would be appropriate within FAC and , second , whether there are any very special circumstances in your client 's cases which would outweigh the general strong presumption against inappropriate development in LOC .", "CARDINAL . Structure Plan policies presume against planning permission in LOC , except in very strong circumstances , for the construction of new buildings , including residential caravans , or certain other specified categories of development . Para . CARDINAL of Planning Policy Guidance CARDINAL \u2013 Green Belts \u2013 states that , inside a Green Belt , approval should not be given , except in very special circumstances , for other than certain categories of appropriate developments . The previous paragraph emphasises the national presumption against inappropriate development within ORG .", "CARDINAL . The latest national guidance , in Circular DATE , on ORG states in the introduction that a main intention of the document is to withdraw the previous guidance indicating that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy sites in protected areas , including GPE sites . LAW goes on to say that gypsy sites are not regarded as being amongst those uses of land which are normally appropriate in FAC .", "CARDINAL . None of [ the applicant 's ] projects fall within the categories identified as exempt from national or local assumptions against inappropriate development in GPE . ...", "CARDINAL . I hold the very firm conviction that none of the developments referred to in these notices could properly and reasonably be regarded as appropriate in the terms of strong national guidance or long established local policies which all seek to protect the value of the LOC designation of the area .", "CARDINAL . This site is in a part of ORG , near to a motorway and particularly vulnerable to development pressure . In my judgment the local and national worthwhile policies that seek to protect the Green Belt would undoubtedly be frustrated for a main purpose of ORG is to protect the surrounding countryside from further encroachment .", "CARDINAL . As for alternative accommodation for [ the applicant ] , I was referred to the statutory duty of ORG to provide a site for [ the applicant ] , who is a gypsy resident in the area , to place her caravan ; DATE after statutory requirement to provide better living conditions for gypsies there were not sufficient sites in GPE . The ORG would save public money by letting [ the applicant ] remain here and not put another caravan on the roadside ; there had never been an official gypsy caravan site in the District , which , in consequence , had not acquired the benefit of a statutorily designated area .", "CARDINAL . [ The applicant ] also said that ORG were under a Direction from the Secretary of ORG for the Environment , under section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE to provide further accommodations for gypsies in the LOC , but ORG were not able to confirm progress to establish a CARDINAL pitch gypsy caravan site at GPE , GPE . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . I note that the ORG did not refute [ the applicant 's ] comment on caravan site provision in the area , but I do not accept her argument as of sufficient weight to overturn , in the absence of very special circumstances , the cogent planning argument against inappropriate development in LOC here .", "...", "CARDINAL . Your client said that the site had been tidied ; rubbish , undergrowth and some neglected buildings had been removed ; a building had been renovated . ... The caravans are set further back on the site and partly screened by the previously erected large brick building ; moreover they were considerably less conspicuous than the previous mobile home which was stationed close to PERSON . ... As for the caravans , your client said that there were few places from which they are likely to be seen by very many members of the public , apart from drivers on PERSON whose attention was likely to be on traffic conditions .", "CARDINAL . I attach more weight to the fact that this site lies in an attractive setting of mainly sporadic dwellings in extensive grounds and in a designated LOC . To the north - west is the built - up area of the village and to the south - west attractive open countryside in LOC ; it was agreed that the area is popular for recreational walking and riding .", "CARDINAL . I do not consider that the arguments put forward by [ the applicant ] would justify allowing residential development of this site . I find no reason to differ from the conclusions of my predecessors who considered that it would be wrong to grant permission for this site in a part of ORG which is particularly vulnerable to development pressure . Whatever the conditions attached to specific grants of permission , stationing a residential caravan here would detract significantly from the quiet rural character and appearance of the site . As well as the caravan itself and the external signs of occupation there would be the activities associated with a family on the site and the comings and goings inevitable with the residential occupation .", "...", "CARDINAL . There is another factor which reinforces , to my mind , rejection of [ the applicant 's } appeals . Whilst the local planning authority has to consider every application on its merits at the time , these projects , if allowed , would be very likely to encourage similar schemes . The ORG would undoubtedly find it more difficult to refuse such other schemes , with this site as a precedent , and those additional developments would cause significant harm to interests of acknowledged importance , which I consider to be unacceptable .", "...", "CARDINAL . At the inquiry in DATE , following enforcement action , the ORG told that ORG that a suitable location for a gypsy caravan site was being sought ; [ the applicant ] would be able to move to the new site within DATE . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . It appears that little progress has been made since the appeal in DATE . LAW and DATE above indicate that the information given in DATE to the ORG about the provision of gypsy caravan sites in GPE was optimistic ; estimates among ORG officers apparently varied DATE .", "CARDINAL . I note the ORG 's statement that [ the applicant ] had not shown interest in a pitch on a ORG caravan site but , to my mind , other factors militate against their argument . First , it is not unreasonable for [ the applicant ] to wait the outcome of these appeals ; second , [ the applicant ] might not unreasonably have declined to make an application for a caravan pitch site provided by the ORG , for , as agreed at this inquiry , she has no prospect of obtaining one . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . ... As I believe [ the applicant ] to have no better prospect now of obtaining another pitch than in DATE , I shall in the exceptional circumstances of this case , vary the notice , as before , to specify a period of DATE for compliance with it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's father , aged DATE , who suffers from senile dementia , now lives with the applicant as he needs constant care and has no one else to look after him . He receives DATE injections from a doctor . The applicant , who has suffered bereavement in respect of her son and grandson since DATE , suffers from depression and has a heart condition . Her husband receives treatment from his doctor and the hospital for arthritis . The applicant 's children , previously living on the site , have moved away .", "CARDINAL . There are no local authority sites or private authorised sites in the CARDINAL LOC district . However , the ORG submit that there are local authority and authorised private sites elsewhere in the same county of GPE , which contains CARDINAL local authority sites which can accommodate CARDINAL caravans .", "CARDINAL . According to the draft ORG applied by the ORG to planning , policy PERSON specifies that the LOC area covers the entire CARDINAL LOC district save for defined urban areas and GB.CARDINAL specifies that with the exception of the villages planning permission for development was to be refused except in very special circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( as amended by LAW DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section DATE ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see PERSON the GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG 's decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other relevant considerations ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "CARDINAL . Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "CARDINAL . Where any steps required to be taken by an enforcement notice are not taken within the specified time - limit , the local authority may enter the land to take the required steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances . ...", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Part II of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to GPE as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post - war years , in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . LAW of LAW defined \u201c NORP \u201d as", "\u201c persons of nomadic habit of life , whatever their race or origin , but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen , or of persons engaged in travelling circuses , travelling together as such \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any Gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , LAW gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates ' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was inadequate , and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems .

He reported in DATE ( Accommodation for Gypsies : A report on the working of GPE DATE \u201c the FAC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Sir PERSON estimated that there were approximately CARDINAL NORP living in GPE and GPE .

The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued by ORG . Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on \u201c statutory procedures , alternative forms of Gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management \u201d . It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Among other advice , it encouraged local authorities to enable self - help by NORP through the adoption of a \u201c sympathetic and flexible approach to [ NORP ' ] applications for planning permission and site licences \u201d . Making express reference to cases where NORP had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming , it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was issued on DATE , stated , inter alia , that \u201c it would be to everyone 's advantage if as many NORP as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation \u201d , and thus advised local authorities that \u201c the special need to accommodate GPE ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson ( DATE ) , PERSON referred to LAW as \u201c NORP \u201d legislation . He commented that :", "\u201c For DATE the commons of GPE provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic . Enough common land had survived DATE of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable , but by s.CARDINAL of ORG and ORG DATE local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers . This they proceeded to do with great energy , but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.CARDINAL of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons . By DATE , therefore ORG legislated to make the s.CARDINAL power a duty , resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils . ... For DATE there followed a history of non - compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of DATE , marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty , to apparently little practical effect . The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer , were rarely , if ever used .", "The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non - compliance was the enactment of ... the Act of DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . New guidance on Gypsy sites and planning , in the light of LAW , was issued to local authorities by the government in FAC ( DATE ) , which cancelled ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see above ) .", "Councils were told :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves , to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control . \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies . ... \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for Gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were Gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping of GPE and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( see LAW above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments \u201d :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating gypsies ' presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water .", "...", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in GPE that Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL required local planning authorities to assess the need for Gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria - based policies against which to decide planning applications . The government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up . ORG research ( see below ) had shown that PERCENT of local authorities ( CARDINAL ) had no policy at all on Gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on Gypsy provision . It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of Gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided . Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the ORG 's objective that NORP should seek to provide their own accommodation , applying for planning permission like everyone else . It was necessary , therefore , that adequate Gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process .", "CARDINAL . ORG for ORG and other Travellers ( ACERT ) which had carried out research sponsored by ORG , noted in this report that since DATE private site provision had increased by CARDINAL caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by CARDINAL caravans , disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision . Noting the increase of NORP in housing and the increased enforcement powers under LAW , it questioned , if these trends continued , the extent to which the ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity of Gypsies and Travellers would be protected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The research looked , inter alia , at CARDINAL refused private site applications , which showed that PERCENT related to land within the countryside and that PERCENT were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value ( for example , PERSON , conservation area locations ) . For most of the CARDINAL Gypsy site applicants interviewed , obtaining permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life and gaining independence and security . For many , the education of their children was another important reason for private site application . All save CARDINAL had applied for permission retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . The report stated that the success rate in CARDINAL planning appeals before DATE had averaged PERCENT but had decreased since . Having regard , however , to the way in which data was recorded , the actual success rate was probably PERCENT , being the figures given in DATE and DATE by the ORG and ORG respectively . Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for NORP , most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by NORP and reached planning decisions on the basis of land - use criteria in the particular case . It was therefore not surprising that most NORP made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authorities would permit development . The granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG figures on Gypsy caravans in GPE disclosed that of CARDINAL caravans counted , CARDINAL were stationed on local authority pitches , CARDINAL on privately owned sites and CARDINAL on unauthorised sites . Of the latter , CARDINAL Gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non - Gypsies ( mainly local authority land ) and CARDINAL Gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by NORP themselves . On these figures , CARDINAL caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over PERCENT of caravans were stationed on authorised sites .", "CARDINAL . Local authority duties to the homeless were contained in Part VII of LAW , which came fully into force on DATE . Where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless , eligible for assistance , had a priority need ( for example , the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age , physical disability , etc . ) and did not become homeless intentionally , the authority was required , if it did not refer the application to another housing authority , to ensure that accommodation was made available to the applicant for a minimum period of DATE .
