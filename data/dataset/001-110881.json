Many media organisations are not economically viable and their continued existence can depend on the support of political or business interests . External studies have concluded that PERSON reporting can often be influenced by financial inducements leading to self - censorship . Against this background , the state has tolerated the accumulation of significant arrears by a number of the largest media companies , including most major private TV stations . Such a situation may compromise editorial independence and media monitoring studies have observed that the TV news is notably less critical of the government than the written press . There are also credible reports of locally elected officials using public office to influence the editorial policy of local newspapers , radio and TV stations , e.g. through the selective award of public advertising contracts . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
