She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr V.A. Schorm , from ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the daughter and heir of PERSON , a NORP nobleman who died in DATE . On DATE during the NORP occupation of GPE , the latter \u2019s estate and castle in PERSON were confiscated by the occupying forces . After the war and after the estate had been returned to the applicant \u2019s family , the former ORG ( zemsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor ) confiscated the estate on the ground that the applicant \u2019s father was to be considered NORP , as he had stated that he was of NORP origin in a questionnaire during the war .", "On DATE ORG , deciding upon an appeal by the applicant \u2019s late father , quashed the confiscation decision finding that the statutory requirements necessary for the confiscation had not been met in his case . The estate remained in the possession of the ORG .", "In DATE the applicant filed an action with the ORG ( okresn\u00ed soud ) , whereby she sought to order the ORG represented by ORG ( pam\u00e1tkov\u00fd \u00fastav ) to conclude with her a restitution agreement with regard to the castle and other facilities under LAW . On DATE ORG rejected her action but the ORG Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) quashed this judgment on CARDINAL DATE and sent the case back to ORG which , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s action for the second time , finding that she did not meet requirements enshrined in the restitution legislation , including the requirement that the transfer or passing of the ownership of the property occurred in DATE should have been due to racial persecution .", "The judgment was subsequently upheld by ORG .", "In judgment no . CARDINAL Cdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL adopted on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , deciding upon the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed both judgments . In its view , the confiscation by GPE had been due to the applicant \u2019s NORP origin , as NORP were regarded by the NORP as an inferior race , and therefore amounted to racial persecution within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act . It noted that the estate had been taken under a confiscation measure that applied to NORP . Having regard also to the fact that the estate had been taken from the applicant \u2019s family twice , first by the NORP and then by the communist regime , the court found that the requirement of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW was met . It stated obiter dictum that any interpretation of the term of racial persecution , limiting the application of that notion only to NORP , would be contrary to LAW and to LAW pr\u00e1v a svobod ) . The court held in particular :", "\u201c Having regard to the objectives of the restitution laws , it appears unsustainable to ORG to interpret the notion of racial persecution in a restrictive manner when the NORP administration of ... [ occupied GPE ] sanctioned the applicant \u2019s ascendant for \u201c efforts adverse to the Reich \u201d .", "On DATE ORG , bound by ORG judgment , found in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to conclude a restitution agreement with her and to transfer the ownership of the estate to her . On DATE ORG upheld this judgment .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant concluded with ORG ( N\u00e1rodn\u00ed pam\u00e1tkov\u00fd \u00fastav ) , successor in title to ORG , the restitution agreement on the transfer of the estate to her . On DATE she was registered as the owner of the estate with the land register and during DATE entered into possession in accordance with the restitution agreement .", "On DATE ORG declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law by ORG which , on DATE , made a constitutional appeal alleging an infringement of its property rights and the right to judicial protection under the Charter .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the lower courts\u2019 decisions and remitted the case to ORG . It admitted that in civil proceedings , it was incumbent upon the parties to assert their rights and to allege relevant facts , but considered that the ordinary courts were nevertheless obliged to search for and take further evidence on their own initiative . It found that , not having done so , they had breached LAW . According to the court , the conclusion of the lower courts that the applicant \u2019s late father had met the conditions set by LAW was erroneous , since he had been registered as NORP when filling in a questionnaire . It added that , the courts had omitted to take into consideration certain material , including an essay entitled \u201c The PERSON family and the PERSON family of PERSON \u201d of which ORG took judicial notice , which showed that the applicant \u2019s late father had been disloyal during the war as he had applied for NORP citizenship .", "The court also considered that the confiscation of the estate by the NORP occupying forces could not be regarded as constituting racial persecution of the applicant \u2019s late father within the meaning of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act , as ORG had found on DATE . It was apparent from sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this LAW , from its aim and from the record on the debate preceding the adoption of LAW no . CARDINAL in the lower chamber of the ORG , that the term of \u201c racial persecution \u201d covered in particular NORP who were victims of the Holocaust . This was , however , not the case of the applicant \u2019s father . The court rejected as inappropriate ORG obiter dictum that such a restrictive interpretation would constitute inequality among victims of the period of lack of freedom and would privilege CARDINAL group of people on the ground of race contrary to LAW and the LAW . Indeed , the principle of equality could not be interpreted as an absolute one and equality among citizens could not be construed as an abstract category , but as a relative equality within the meaning of all modern constitutions . A restrictive interpretation of the notion of racial persecution under LAW was not contrary to the principle of equality .", "Apparently on DATE ORG asked the parties to the procedure whether they would propose further evidence . It also requested the applicant to specify whether she would propose further evidence in support of her assertions that the confiscation had taken place due to racial persecution and that the estate had been taken away and passed into the ownership of ORG in the relevant period within the meaning of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act . It also requested the defendant to indicate whether it would propose any further evidence to support its assertion that the NORP citizenship of the applicant \u2019s late father had legally ceased to exist . Both parties submitted further documentary evidence .", "At the hearing of DATE ORG considered extensive documentary evidence , including a historical essay by Dr. PERSON called \u201c The PERSON family and the PERSON family of PERSON \u201d ( PERSON a opo\u010den\u0161t\u00ed PERSON ) , the so - called administrative record and correspondence between ORG and ORG of DATE and DATE when these CARDINAL authorities were searching for documents concerning the examination of the citizenship of the applicant \u2019s late father .", "On DATE ORG , having held another hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It found that all the requirements for restitution had been met with the exception of loss of property due to racial persecution . The court underlined that when assessing that requirement it was bound by the ruling of ORG of DATE .", "On DATE ORG upheld this judgment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , referring to the binding interpretation by ORG of the notion of racial persecution .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , asserting an erroneous interpretation of the notion of racial persecution within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act and procedural shortcomings in consequence of which she had not put forward any evidence establishing that her father \u2019s mother was of NORP origin . It appears that her constitutional appeal remains undecided .", "On DATE the ORG represented by ORG filed against the applicant an action for determination of ownership of the estate with ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE the court granted the ORG \u2019s action and found it to be the owner of the estate and decided that the ORG was empowered to maintain the estate .", "On DATE ORG quashed this judgment as to ORG finding that the ORG was empowered to upkeep the estate , stayed the proceedings in this respect and transferred this part of the case to ORG . It noted that ORG had been bound by the judgment of ORG of DATE . The judgment became final on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG was registered in the land register as the owner of the estate .", "The act provides for mitigation of injustices caused by the NORP rule in GPE from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the relevant period \u201d ) .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) property injustices caused by , inter alia , unlawful practices carried out in the relevant period , are to be mitigated , inter alia , by the surrender of the property , provided that the injustices originated in political persecution or in a practice contravening universally accepted human rights and freedoms ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ) .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) extended the application of the LAW to natural persons who had lost their property due to racial persecution during the Second World War and were entitled to restitution of it after the war pursuant to Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL or Act no . CARDINAL and in respect of whom the NORP regime established on DATE had failed to grant such claims whilst pursuing its policy of political persecution or carrying out practices contrary to universally accepted human rights and freedoms .", "Under section CARDINAL if a chamber comes to a legal view differing from that expressed by the court in a previous ruling , it shall submit the issue to the ORG for its consideration . The latter \u2019s legal view is binding on the chamber in further proceedings .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , a constitutional appeal may be lodged pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of the LAW by a natural or legal person , alleging that its fundamental rights or basic freedoms guaranteed by the constitutional law have been infringed as a result of a final decision in proceedings to which it was a party , a measure , or any other infringement by a public authority .", "ORG rejected a constitutional appeal lodged by a group of MPs seeking to abrogate the adjective \u201c racial \u201d from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act . In their view , the term \u201c racial persecution \u201d created inequality on the ground of race among those whose property was adversely affected during the occupation . They asserted that it manifestly contravened LAW adopted by ORG in DATE and LAW . In the court \u2019s view the impugned provision had to be interpreted in conformity with these legal instruments . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c [ I]t is evident that racial discrimination under ORG concerned a much larger group ( groups ) of people than only those concerned by LAW [ i.e. NORP ] , and that the legal terms such as \u201c national , racial and political \u201d used in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL are largely superfluous . \u201d", "ORG rejected a constitutional appeal lodged by ORG . The ORG had contested the legal assessment of ordinary courts as to which ORG body should be held liable to pay compensation to a private individual . Having noted that that issue was governed by public law , the court ruled that the ORG could not be regarded as an owner disposing freely of its property , but merely as a ORG body acting in its public authority , which does not have a standing to appeal to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
