SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE province ) . Before the ORG he was represented by PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , acting on the basis of statements made by a criminal turned informer , Mr R.P.R. , in the context of criminal investigations into international drug trafficking conducted by the Audiencia Nacional \u2019s central investigating judge no . CARDINAL , the public prosecutor \u2019s office lodged a criminal complaint against a number of people , including the applicant , suspected of drug trafficking .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL declared the criminal complaint lodged by the public prosecutor \u2019s office admissible and ordered a number of investigative measures . However , contrary to LAW , the investigating judge did not inform the applicant that the complaint concerning him had been declared admissible .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL ordered the commencement of ordinary proceedings ( incoaci\u00f3n de sumario ordinario ) against several persons , including the applicant .", "On DATE the investigating judge ordered that the proceedings be kept secret for DATE , ordered the persons charged , including the applicant , to be detained pending trial in solitary confinement and appointed a lawyer to act for them under the legal aid scheme during the time they were to spend in solitary confinement . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the judge rescinded the solitary confinement .", "By a decision of DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL declared the investigation closed and committed the CARDINAL persons charged for trial before ORG the Audiencia Nacional . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG the Audiencia Nacional ordered that counsel for all the accused , including the applicant , be supplied with a complete copy of the investigation file , which ran to more than CARDINAL volumes , so that they could make a provisional classification of the offences .", "After the exchange of various pleadings and other procedural steps , the trial began on DATE . It lasted until DATE . The trial followed the following distinct phases : from DATE to CARDINAL DATE all but CARDINAL of the accused gave evidence ; the witnesses gave evidence DATE and DATE ; the expert reports were examined DATE ; the written evidence was examined DATE and DATE ; the oral submissions of the prosecution , the civil parties and the defence lasted from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . The accused spoke last .", "In a judgment delivered at a hearing on DATE after proceedings at which all parties were represented the Audiencia Nacional found the applicant guilty of the offence of drug trafficking ( ORG , CARDINAL bis A , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and CARDINAL bis B of LAW ) , sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and fined him MONEY . The applicant was found guilty of participating with other co - defendants , including CARDINAL P. , in the acquisition of a suitable boat to bring QUANTITY of cocaine into GPE .", "The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG , alleging the breach of LAW on account of the fact that he had not been notified of the criminal complaint against him . He argued that the fact that he had not been informed of the proceedings against him had infringed the rights of the defence . He also alleged an infringement of his right to the presumption of innocence .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . With regard to the argument relating to the fact that the applicant had not been notified by central investigating judge no . CARDINAL that he had declared the criminal complaint against him admissible , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c At the beginning of the proceedings , when the results of the criminal investigations begun in GPE were transmitted to central investigating judge no . CARDINAL , the public prosecutor lodged a complaint against various persons identified by their surnames and forenames . That complaint was declared admissible ( admisible ) in a decision of [ CARDINAL ] DATE , but this decision was not brought to the attention of the persons named as suspects ( querellados ) , so that LAW was clearly contravened , as the appellants maintained and the impugned judgment admitted . There then followed judicial and police investigations consisting in substance in a large number of statements made by the initial complainant , who decided after committing the offences to provide information , and who on a number of occasions accompanied police officers to various locations in GPE in order to obtain accurate information on events , places and persons involved in large - scale hashish and cocaine trafficking operations which had taken place and were continuing .", "It can readily be understood that in order to investigate such offences it was important to act without the persons implicated being informed of the investigations . Offences of this type , committed by large - scale organisations with extensive connections , including international links , require investigative work by police and judges to be conducted without the persons implicated being aware of it . If in the present case the persons implicated had been informed in accordance with LAW it is obvious that the investigation would not have been possible .", "...", "Quite clearly , as has been observed already , a criminal investigation conducted without the knowledge of the suspected offenders may be particularly necessary in connection with offences committed by organised gangs , as is the case with drug trafficking at the start of the distribution process , and this is authorised by LAW in Article CARDINAL thereof ...", "...", "Thus , in the present case , the investigating judge had the power to conduct investigations , without informing the persons under investigation , into the serious offences of drug trafficking which formed the subject of the public prosecutor \u2019s complaint . But in order to do so he should have ordered the proceedings to be kept secret for DATE , duly justifying any extensions necessary , in accordance with the above - mentioned Article CARDINAL and the case - law of ORG cited . But he did not do so and it is accordingly evident that there was a procedural irregularity in that respect , as the impugned judgment admits .", "The ORG now turns to the question what the consequences of such a procedural irregularity should be .", "...", "The situation in this case is similar to the CARDINAL considered in ORG recent judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , and the solution to the problem must be the same , that is to find that the defence was not materially hindered because those charged were examined as such and were able to consult the file with full knowledge of the investigations conducted well before the close of the investigation , so that they had time to inspect the content of the investigation file and request any investigative measure during that stage of the proceedings , that is before the time - limit for such requests .", "...", "... as stated in the \u2018 As to the law\u2019 section of the impugned judgment ... , P. ( the criminal turned informer ) , the protagonist throughout the initial inquisitorial stage , was questioned at length with the result of almost wholly invalidating the evidence for the prosecution , which initially consisted of the statements he had made on his own initiative alone , with only the investigating judge and the public prosecutor being present , without anyone else being informed ... Accordingly , those statements are not declared null and void since , as will be seen , no - one \u2019s interests were harmed by them ... as they were used only to the extent that they benefited the other accused , regard being had to their contradictory and vague nature ...", "In conclusion , the failure to comply with LAW had no bearing on the truth and probative value of the incriminating evidence , the evidence which , in the final analysis , secured the convictions , and was considered with all the proper safeguards ... \u201d", "ORG also held that the trial courts had based their finding of the applicant \u2019s guilt and his conviction on a large body of evidence on which the defence had had the opportunity to comment in court .", "The applicant lodged a recurso de amparo against this judgment with ORG , alleging the violation of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( right to a fair trial and respect for the presumption of innocence ) . By a decision of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal as being manifestly ill - founded . With regard to the complaint of a breach of LAW of LAW , ORG held that despite the fact that the investigating judge had failed to comply with the provision in question the result of this breach of the law had not been to deprive the applicant for all practical purposes of his right to due process since from the time when he was charged ( imputado ) he had been informed of all the steps taken and had had the opportunity of submitting whatever arguments he thought pertinent in his defence and of requesting whatever investigative measures he thought might be useful to counterbalance the investigations initially carried out without his involvement . With regard to the complaint of an infringement of the presumption of innocence , ORG held that , in accordance with its case - law , the right to be presumed innocent was not infringed where conviction by a court after a criminal trial was based on the incriminating statement of a co - accused , given that the trial courts had expressly found that the statement in question was not prompted by invalid motives , and where the statement was corroborated by other evidence , which the trial courts had described as fundamental , namely the confrontation between PERSON ( the criminal turned informer ) and ORG ( another co - accused ) . The fact that the applicant had not had access to the recording of that confrontation was without any constitutional relevance given that the applicant had not alleged any omissions from the transcript of the recording placed in the investigation file nor specified in what way his knowledge of any such missing elements might have been decisive for the preparation of his defence .", "\u201c Anyone accused of an offence may exercise the rights of the defence by taking part in the proceedings , of whatever type , from the time when he is first informed of their existence , whether he has been detained pending trial , has been the subject of any other preventive measure , or has been charged with an offence , and to that end he shall be informed of this right .", "Where a criminal complaint or any procedural step resulting from criminal charges being preferred against CARDINAL or more named suspects is ruled admissible , this decision shall be brought to the attention of the persons concerned immediately . \u201d", "\u201c The parties to the proceedings may inform themselves what steps have been taken and participate in all procedural steps .", "However , notwithstanding what is provided in the previous paragraph , if the offence is against the public interest the investigating judge , on a proposal from the public prosecutor \u2019s office or any party to the proceedings , or of his own motion , may order that the proceedings be kept wholly or partly secret from all parties for a period not exceeding DATE ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
