On DATE he gained a law degree .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr ORG informed the Chairman of ORG that he intended to apply for enrolment on the list of pupil advocates . On DATE he had an interview with the Chairman .", "CARDINAL . ORG , when it learnt of the applicant \u2019s intention at its session on DATE , reacted in a somewhat unfavourable manner , but took the view that it was unnecessary to give a decision as no formal application had been made .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , in the course of a telephone conversation , the Chairman of ORG allegedly told the applicant that ORG had decided not to enrol him because he had completed CARDINAL full career and FAC already had CARDINAL members .", "CARDINAL . ORG By a letter of CARDINAL DATE Mr ORG submitted an application in the prescribed form .", "CARDINAL . ORG At a meeting on DATE ORG decided to consult the Chairman ( doyen ) of ORG .", "On DATE , after considering the latter \u2019s opinion , according to which there were no grounds for refusing Mr ORG application ( \" er geen argumenten zijn om ORG FAC te weigeren \" ) , the ORG appointed CARDINAL rapporteurs from among its members .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Chairman read out the report of the first rapporteur , which was unfavourable , and the second submitted a comprehensive report on the matter . During the deliberations , it was pointed out that Mr ORG had not taken the oath and had therefore not been entitled to seek enrolment . DATE the ORG rejected the application .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Chairman of ORG informed Mr ORG of this decision in a letter of CARDINAL DATE . He stated that it was consistent with the practice followed by ORG according to which persons who had completed a full career outside the Bar were not admitted to the list of pupil advocates .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr ORG filed an application in the PERSON d\u2019Etat to have the decision set aside on the ground that ORG did not constitute an \" independent and impartial tribunal \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG produced its statement of defence . It argued that the PERSON d\u2019Etat lacked jurisdiction and that Mr ORG had no interest in the proceedings inasmuch as he had not taken the oath and could not therefore be enrolled on the list of pupil advocates . On the merits , it affirmed that a refusal to enrol could be based on reasons other than those justifying disciplinary measures . The fact that the applicant had already completed CARDINAL full career justified the impugned decision , particularly because he had stated that , as his income was sufficient , he wished to engage in what he regarded as a stimulating occupation on a part - time basis .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr ORG filed his reply on DATE . He maintained that the uncertainty concerning his admission to the Bar had made it impossible for him to find an advocate who was prepared to present him so that he could take the oath ; this obstacle could be surmounted only by the designation of an ad hoc pupil master .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the Legal Adviser ( auditeur ) responsible for preparing the case requested various documents from ORG , which sent them to him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the auditeur submitted his report , which was communicated to the applicant on DATE . He expressed the view that the ORG d\u2019Etat had jurisdiction and that Mr ORG had an interest in having ORG decision quashed . There was no legal obligation for a law graduate to take the oath before seeking enrolment on the list of pupil advocates . The text of the decision refusing the applicant admission to that list had not cited as a reason the fact , mentioned orally on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that FAC already had a large number of lawyers . It had referred solely to the circumstance that the applicant had completed a full career outside the Bar . Yet , in the light of the judgment of ORG CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , a refusal to enrol of this nature should have been grounded either on the failure to comply with the conditions laid down in LAW or on the postulant \u2019s unfitness or incompetence to practise as a lawyer . It followed that the reason given by ORG did not justify in law the decision of CARDINAL DATE , which should therefore be set aside .", "CARDINAL . ORG On CARDINAL DATE ORG filed a final pleading , reiterating the same CARDINAL objections to the admissibility of the application ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . It added that the reason given fell within the scope of the wide discretion that ORG considered itself to enjoy in this area .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the President of the ORG d\u2019Etat , PERSON , transferred the case from the ORG before which it was pending and directed that it should be heard by ORG . On DATE he postponed the public hearing until DATE as some members of the ORG d\u2019Etat were unable to attend on DATE , the date for which it had been initially set down .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG sought leave to intervene in the proceedings . It considered Mr ORG application inadmissible . As he had not taken the oath and did not therefore satisfy one of the statutory conditions for enrolment , ORG could only have given an opinion , in respect of which an application for annulment could not lie . It argued in addition that the PERSON d\u2019Etat lacked jurisdiction . In its view , the intention of the legislature had been that only the ordinary courts , and not the ORG d\u2019Etat , should have jurisdiction for disputes arising from the decisions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG gave leave for this intervention and heard the parties , after which the President reserved the decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant complained to the President of the length of the proceedings . He allegedly received no reply .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE he laid a formal complaint with ORG for a denial of justice . On DATE he learned of the authorities\u2019 decision not to proceed with his complaint .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , presided over by Mr Baeteman , President of the ORG d\u2019Etat , noted that the assembly which had heard the case up to that point had not concluded its deliberations and could no longer validly sit on account of the death of the judge - rapporteur , the appointment of CARDINAL of the judges to another post and the retirement of PERSON on DATE . It consequently decided to reopen the oral proceedings before ORG composed differently , at a hearing to be held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE that assembly , refusing to follow the opinion of the auditeur , Mr PERSON , ruled that the objection based on the PERSON d\u2019Etat \u2019s lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae was well - founded . It took the view , inter alia :", "\" that having regard to the relations between the LOC and the judiciary and the concern to preserve advocates\u2019 independence , the legislature \u2019s intention [ had been ] that the decisions of ORG should fall outside the scope of review by the PERSON d\u2019Etat .
