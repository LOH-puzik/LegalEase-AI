The applicants , who are the elder daughter of the late Prince Rainier III of GPE and her husband , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the first applicant has been trying \u2013 often through the courts DATE to prevent the publication of photos about her private life in the press .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL series of photos , published in DATE respectively in CARDINAL NORP magazines and showing the first applicant with the actor PERSON or her husband , had been the subject of CARDINAL sets of proceedings in the NORP courts and , in particular , leading judgments of ORG of DATE and of ORG of DATE dismissing the first applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . Those proceedings were the subject of the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) in which ORG held that the court decisions had infringed the first applicant \u2019s right to respect for her private life , a right guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the reasoning of the domestic courts , the ORG made the following findings in particular :", "\u201c DATE . The ORG finds it hard to agree with the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , which consists in describing a person as such as a figure of contemporary society \u2018 par excellence\u2019 . Since that definition affords the person very limited protection of their private life or the right to control the use of their image , it could conceivably be appropriate for politicians exercising official functions . However , it can not be justified for a \u2018 private\u2019 individual , such as the applicant , in whom the interest of the general public and the press is based solely on her membership of a reigning family , whereas she herself does not exercise any official functions .", "In any event the ORG considers that , in these conditions , the LAW has to be interpreted narrowly to ensure that the ORG complies with its positive obligation under the ORG to protect private life and the right to control the use of one \u2019s image .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the distinction drawn between figures of contemporary society \u2018 par excellence\u2019 and \u2018 ORG public figures has to be clear and obvious so that , in a ORG governed by the rule of law , the individual has precise indications as to the behaviour he or she should adopt . Above all , they need to know exactly when and where they are in a protected sphere or , on the contrary , in a sphere in which they must expect interference from others , especially the tabloid press .", "CARDINAL . The Court therefore considers that the criteria on which the domestic courts based their decisions were not sufficient to protect the applicant \u2019s private life effectively . As a figure of contemporary society \u2018 par excellence\u2019 she can not \u2013 in the name of freedom of the press and the public interest \u2013 rely on protection of her private life unless she is in a secluded place out of the public eye and , moreover , succeeds in proving it ( which can be difficult ) . Where that is not the case , she has to accept that she might be photographed at almost any time , systematically , and that the photos are then very widely disseminated even if , as was the case here , the photos and accompanying articles relate exclusively to details of her private life .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the criterion of spatial isolation , although apposite in theory , is in reality too vague and difficult for the person concerned to determine in advance . In the present case , merely classifying the applicant as a figure of contemporary society \u2018 par excellence\u2019 does not suffice to justify such an intrusion into her private life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the first applicant \u2019s case , the applicants subsequently brought several sets of proceedings in the civil courts seeking an injunction against any further publication of photos that had appeared in NORP magazines .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL photos were published by the publishing company ORG in the magazine PERSON i m Spiegel .", "CARDINAL . The first photo , which appeared in issue no . CARDINAL of DATE , shows the applicants out for a walk during their skiing holiday in GPE Moritz . It is accompanied by an article with the heading : \u201c Prince PERSON \u2013 not home alone \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u2013 PERSON \u201d ) . The article reads as follows .", "\u201c The first magnolia buds are flowering in the grounds of FAC \u2013 but Prince PERSON ( DATE ) appears to have no interest in DATE . He goes for a walk outside with his daughter PERSON ( DATE ) . She supports him as he walks along slowly . He is cold despite the sunshine . The old gentleman is weary . The Monegasques saw their prince for the last time DATE at a circus festival . He had appeared bright and cheerful , walking along beside his daughter who was laughing . But since then he has not left the palace . Not even for the PERSON celebration held in honour of the national Patron Saint . The ORG is worried , as are Prince PERSON \u2019s children . Prince PERSON ( who is currently taking part in the Olympic Games in GPE ) , PERSON ( on holiday in GPE with Prince PERSON DATE von GPE ) and Princess PERSON take it in turns to look after their father . He must not be left home alone when he is not well . Not without his children \u2019s love . \u201d", "A photo of Prince PERSON with his daughter Princess PERSON and a photo of Prince PERSON of GPE taken during the Olympic Games in GPE appeared on the same page .", "CARDINAL . The second photo , which appeared in issue no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , shows the applicants out for a walk in GPE . The caption says : \u201c PERSON DATE GPE and his wife , PERSON of GPE , enjoy the sun and snow in GPE . \u201d A small photo of PERSON and CARDINAL photos of members of a NORP royal family appeared on the same page . The article accompanying the photos , bearing the heading \u201c LOC fun in the snow \u201d , is about how happy the persons photographed are to meet up in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The third photo , which appeared in issue no . CARDINAL of DATE , shows the applicants in a chair lift in GPE am PERSON during DATE . On the same page there is a small photo of Prince PERSON , the first applicant and PERSON , taken during the national holiday on DATE and bearing the heading \u201c The princess \u2019s last appearance \u201d . Another photo , taking up CARDINAL the page , shows the first applicant at FAC .", "The CARDINAL photos illustrate an article bearing the heading \u201c Princess Caroline . The whole of GPE awaits her \u201d , of which the passages relevant to the present case read as follows .", "\u201c Tickets for FAC , which will be held on DATE in GPE , have been selling for DATE . And the guests will be coming only for her : Princess PERSON ( DATE ) . She has not attended any official engagements since the national holiday ... She was not at the circus festival or the GPE celebration held in honour of the patron saint of GPE . By tradition , the eldest daughter of Prince PERSON ( DATE ) opens the annual ball . She has inherited this role from her mother , who died in an accident , and this ball is PERSON \u2019s favourite ... The prince , who is seriously ill , has just come out of hospital after a heart operation and is still too weak to attend the ball . The welcome speech which he will be making in honour of the guests will be retransmitted via television cameras and projected onto a big screen . PERSON and her husband [ Prince ] PERSON DATE GPE will open FAC with a waltz .", "They celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary together in DATE . And there was more cause for celebration in the von Hannover household : the prince turned DATE on DATE . He celebrated his birthday with PERSON and some friends at the fashionable resort of GPE , glistening white in the snow . The couple were actually spending DATE in GPE am ORG , but for the birthday party they went down to FAC in GPE for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The publishing company ORG published in issue no . CARDINAL of DATE of the magazine PERSON the same photo ( or a virtually identical CARDINAL ) as the one that had appeared DATE in the magazine PERSON i m Spiegel no . MONEY ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The article accompanying the photo in PERSON bears the heading : \u201c That is genuine love . Princess PERSON . She is the only one looking after the sick prince . \u201d The relevant passages of the article are worded as follows .", "\u201c Her love life may appear unbridled . CARDINAL thing is certain , though : as far as her father is concerned , Princess PERSON knows where her heart lies . While the rest of the family are travelling around the world , she has run to be at the side of Prince PERSON ( DATE ) , who appears to be seriously ailing . She is the only one who takes care of the sick monarch . PERSON \u2019s sister , PERSON ( DATE ) , has taken a few days\u2019 holiday with her husband PERSON ( DATE ) and their daughter PERSON ( CARDINAL ) at the fashionable GPE ORG ski resort in GPE . Prince PERSON , for his part , has been at the Olympic Games in GPE taking part in the CARDINAL - man bobsleigh race . \u2018 For DATE time,\u2019 he said . From time to time he would disappear for DATE . It is said that the prince has seen his heart - throb , PERSON ( CARDINAL ) , an NORP pole vaulter who is rumoured to become his future wife . [ Prince PERSON ] , who hates being alone now , was very glad to see his younger daughter . PERSON has devoted a lot of time to him . She has been out on long walks with him and they have greatly confided in each other . \u2018 PERSON has relished the company of his younger daughter . When she is at his side he truly flourishes . During those moments he forgets that he is old and GPE say the Monegasques . \u2018 PERSON should come much more CARDINAL \u201d", "On the same page there is the photo of Princess PERSON with her father that had appeared the same day in the magazine PERSON i m Spiegel no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , a headshot of her and CARDINAL other photos , CARDINAL of Prince PERSON alone and the other of the prince with PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , the first applicant sought an injunction in ORG against any further publication of the CARDINAL photos by ORG publishing company .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG granted the injunction on the ground that the first applicant had not consented to publication of the photos , which was a precondition under LAW of ORG ( hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court stated , however , that even if consent were deemed unnecessary in the case of the first photo on the ground that it was an image from contemporary society ( PERSON Bereich der GPE ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the same LAW , publication of the photo was not justified . Under subsection CARDINAL of that provision , publication of such an image was only lawful if it did not interfere with a legitimate interest of the person photographed . According to the court , the question as to whether there was such a legitimate interest had to be determined by balancing the interests of the person photographed against those of the public in being informed .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in the present case it was the first applicant \u2019s right to the protection of her personality rights that prevailed . In reaching that conclusion ORG referred extensively to the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON . It found that the first applicant \u2019s relationship with her father , regardless of the fact that he was ill , did not contribute to a debate of general interest to society especially as the first applicant was connected to the prince of a ORG of minor importance in international politics merely through a family tie and did not exercise any official function .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that , whilst that reasoning was not entirely in keeping with the principles established by ORG , which did not recognise a legitimate interest unless the person photographed had retired to a secluded place away from the public eye , it was not bound by that precedent to the extent that it could not take into consideration the ORG \u2019s case - law on the subject .", "CARDINAL . The publishing company appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG set aside the judgment on the ground that the applicant \u2019s right under LAW had to yield to the fundamental rights of the press . It found that , whilst the articles were primarily of entertainment value , publication of the photos was nonetheless lawful in terms of the judgment of ORG of DATE whose main legal reasoning ( tragende ORG ) was binding on ORG . It pointed out that public figures should certainly be protected from the risk of being photographed at any time and anywhere and seeing the photos subsequently published . However , in ORG opinion , the legitimate interest of such figures , within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , should not result in the prohibition of any reporting on wellknown people outside their official appearances . In any event , the right to respect for private life did not require the banning of publication of photos taken in public places accessible to all and where the individual concerned was amongst many other people .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( no . PERSON CARDINAL ) , ORG dismissed her appeal in respect of the first photo . With regard to the second and third photos , it upheld her appeal , quashed the judgment of ORG and reinstated the injunction imposed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the opinion of ORG did not correspond to the concept of graduated protection ( abgestuftes PERSON ) that had been developed in the case - law on the basis of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and which it had clarified in a number of recent decisions delivered following the GPE judgment and in response to the reservations of principle which the ORG had expressed in that judgment . According to that new concept of protection , section CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provided for an exception to the rule according to which a photo could not be published without the prior consent of the person concerned , took account of the public \u2019s interest in being informed and of the freedom of the press . Accordingly , when assessing whether or not the impugned publication portrayed an aspect of contemporary society within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a balancing exercise had to be undertaken between the rights under LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL of the Convention on the one hand , and those under LAW , second sentence , of LAW on the other hand .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the ORG \u2019s criticism of the expression \u201c figure of contemporary society par excellence \u201d ultimately concerned the determination of the conditions in which the media could report on well - known people such as these . It considered that , irrespective of the issue whether the first applicant should be regarded as a figure of contemporary society par excellence , she was in any case a well - known person who particularly attracted public attention . In the court \u2019s view , that fact , combined with the fact that she had not been in a secluded place out of the public eye when the photos had been taken , was nonetheless insufficient to deprive her of protection of her private sphere . That conclusion was not only appropriate in the light of the ORG \u2019s ruling but also reflected a proper understanding of the concept of protection thus developed .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG found that the publication of images of persons who \u2013 on account of their importance in contemporary society \u2013 were in theory required , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , to tolerate the publication of photos of themselves was nevertheless unlawful if the legitimate interests of the person concerned were infringed ( section CARDINAL ) ) . There could be no exception to the obligation to obtain the consent of the person in question unless the report in question concerned an important event of contemporary society . The expression \u201c contemporary society \u201d \u2013 and indeed the term \u201c information value \u201d \u2013 had to be interpreted in a broad sense and according to whether there was a public interest . It comprised any matter of general interest to society and included reports for entertainment purposes , which could also play a role in the formation of opinions , or even stimulate or influence these to a greater degree than purely factual information .", "CARDINAL . Whilst the freedom of the press and the prohibition of censorship required the press to be able to decide for itself which subjects it intended to report on and what it intended to publish , the press was not exempt from the duty to weigh its interest in publishing the information against the protection of the privacy of the person concerned . The greater the information value for the general public , the more the right to protection had to yield . Conversely , where the interest in informing the public decreased , the importance of protecting the person concerned carried correspondingly greater weight . The reader \u2019s interest in being entertained generally carried less weight than that of protecting privacy , in which case the reader \u2019s interest did not merit protection .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that , accordingly , even where persons who had hitherto been regarded as figures of contemporary society were concerned , consideration must be given to the question whether the report contributed to a factual debate ( PERSON ) and whether the content went beyond a mere intention to satisfy public curiosity . In determining that question , there was nothing to prevent regard being had to how well the person concerned was known to the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG stressed that that manner of balancing the various interests at stake corresponded to the requirements of the ORG regarding effective protection of the private sphere and the requirements of the freedom of the press , and that it did not conflict with the binding force of the judgment of ORG of DATE . Admittedly , that court had limited the protection afforded to the private sphere against the publication of unwanted photos to cases of spatial seclusion . That did not , however , prevent the courts \u2013 when balancing the various interests \u2013 from having more regard to the value of the information for the public . Furthermore , ORG had [ recently ] endorsed the balancing exercise undertaken by ORG according to those criteria in a judgment concerning the second applicant ( decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG specified that as the determining criterion for the balancing exercise was the information value of the photo in question and as it had been published in the context of a written article , the content of the text accompanying the photo could not be ignored .", "CARDINAL . Applying the criteria thus established to the case submitted to it , ORG , beginning with the second and third photos , observed that the second photo showed the applicants in a busy street in GPE PERSON during their skiing holiday . Whilst the press could , as a matter of principle , make its own decision regarding the content of its publications and the applicants had indeed been in a public place amongst other people , neither the article nor the photo related to an event of general interest or contemporary society . A celebrity \u2019s holidays fell within the core area ( PERSON ) of his or her private sphere . The publication of the article and photo had been for entertainment purposes only and was not in any way relevant to matters of public interest , so could only be done with the first applicant \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the third photo showed the applicants in a chair lift in GPE during their skiing holiday . Whilst PERSON shortly to be held in GPE , which was the subject of the article accompanying the photo , could possibly be regarded as an event of contemporary society that was a matter of general interest to society , there was no link between the photo and that event . The purpose of the photo had been to supplement the part of the article about the second applicant \u2019s birthday party in PERSON and the applicants\u2019 skiing holiday in GPE . Thus the information centred exclusively on the first applicant \u2019s private life and served merely entertainment purposes . Accordingly , the third photo could not be published without the first applicant \u2019s consent either .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the first photo , ORG observed that whilst it contained no information having any connection with an event of contemporary society or contributing to a debate of general interest , the same was not true of the accompanying text . Admittedly , the part about the first applicant \u2019s skiing holiday did not concern an event of contemporary society or general interest , even interpreting those terms broadly . However , with regard to the prince \u2019s health , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The information also concerned the ill - health of the reigning Prince of GPE . His ill - health was thus an event of contemporary society on which the press was entitled to report . The journalistic quality and the conception of the article are not decisive because the principle of the freedom of the press does not allow the applicability of a fundamental right to depend upon the quality of the press coverage or how the article is drafted . This also applies to the comments in the article on the conduct of members of the family during the prince \u2019s illness , and , moreover , the applicant has not complained about the article in that respect . The photo in question supports and illustrates the information being conveyed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that , in those circumstances and having regard to the context of the report as a whole , the first applicant had no legitimate interest that could have opposed publication of the photo of the applicants out in the street . There had , in particular , been nothing about the photo itself that constituted a violation ( eigenst\u00e4ndiger PERSON ) and thus justified a different conclusion ; nor was there anything to suggest that the photo had been taken surreptitiously or by using secret technical devices that rendered its publication unlawful .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) of ORG dismissed constitutional appeals lodged by the first applicant ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and by ORG publishing company ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against the judgment of ORG ( no . VI ZR CARDINAL ) .", "In the same judgment it allowed a constitutional appeal ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged by ORG publishing company against an injunction , imposed by ORG ( judgment of DATE , no . VI ZR CARDINAL ) , on any further publication of a photo that had appeared in CARDINAL PERSON magazine showing the applicants on holiday in an unspecified location and accompanying a written and photographic report on the possibility of renting a holiday villa owned by the PERSON family in GPE . Those proceedings are the subject of a separate application by the first applicant to ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court observed , firstly , that the court decisions constituted an interference with the first applicant \u2019s right to the protection of her personality rights guaranteed by ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . There were limits on the protection afforded to that right and on the freedom of the press , however . The freedom of the press was subject to the restrictions laid down in sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW and LAW , whilst the provisions of LAW and LAW limited the right to the protection of personality rights . In the NORP legal order the ORG had the status of an ordinary federal law . At constitutional - law level , the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law served as guides to interpretation when determining the content and scope of a fundamental right .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court reiterated the case - law of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and its own case - law on the different fundamental rights at stake by referring to the principles established in its leading judgment of DATE ( PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) . It added that in so far as an image did not itself make any contribution to the formation of public opinion , its information value had to be assessed in the context of the accompanying article . However , if that article was merely a pretext for publishing a photo of a well - known person , no contribution was made to the formation of public opinion and there were therefore no grounds for allowing the interest in publication to prevail over the protection of personality rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to say that , in order to determine the weight to be attached to the protection of personality rights , regard had to be had not only to the circumstances in which the photo had been taken , for example whether it had been taken surreptitiously or as a result of persistent hounding by photographers , but also to the situation in which the person concerned had been photographed and how he or she was portrayed . The right to protection of personality rights thus carried more weight where the photo showed details of the person \u2019s private life that were not normally the subject of public discussion . The same was true where the person concerned could legitimately expect , having regard to the circumstances , that no photo would be published because he or she was in a private place ( r\u00e4umliche PERSON ) , such as in a specially protected location . The right to protection of personality rights could also prevail over the interest in publication in cases other than those of spatial isolation , notably where the person concerned was pictured enjoying a moment of relaxation or letting go , freed from the constraints of professional or everyday life .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that importance had to be attached in that connection to the allocation of procedural obligations regarding the presentation of the facts and the burden of proof . It had to be ensured that neither the press nor the person being photographed was prevented from adducing proof of circumstances relevant for the balancing of the competing interests . Where the press intended to publish a photo without the consent of the person concerned , it could be required to substantiate the circumstances in which the photo had been taken in order to allow the courts to examine the question whether publication of the photo could be opposed on grounds of the legitimate expectations of the person photographed .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court observed that it was the task of the civil courts to apply and interpret the provisions of civil law in the light of the fundamental rights at stake while having regard to the Convention . It added that its own role was limited to examining whether the lower courts had had sufficient regard to the impact of fundamental rights when interpreting and applying the law and when balancing the competing rights . Such was also the scope of the scrutiny of the Constitutional Court regarding the question whether the courts had fulfilled their obligation to incorporate the ORG \u2019s relevant case - law into the national legal order ( GPE ) . The fact that the court \u2019s balancing exercise of the various rights in multi - polar disputes \u2013 that is , disputes involving the interests of several different persons \u2013 and complex ones could also result in a different outcome was not sufficient reason for requiring ORG to correct a court decision . However , there would be a violation of the LAW if the protective scope ( PERSON ) or extent of a fundamental right had been wrongly determined and the balancing exercise were accordingly flawed , or if the requirements under constitutional law or the LAW had not been duly taken into account .", "CARDINAL . Applying those principles to the case submitted to it , ORG observed that ORG and the criteria it had established were constitutionally unobjectionable . It considered in particular that nothing , from a constitutional - law perspective , had prevented ORG from departing from its own established case - law in the field and developing a new concept of protection . The fact that it had not itself called into question , in its leading judgment of DATE , the former concept of protection established by ORG merely meant that this had been in conformity with constitutional - law criteria . It did not mean , by extension , that a different concept could not meet those criteria . ORG had not been prevented , in particular , from dispensing with the legal concept of \u201c figure of contemporary society \u201d and instead balancing the competing interests when examining the question whether a photo was an aspect of contemporary society and could accordingly be published without the consent of the person concerned ( unless it interfered with a legitimate interest of the latter ) .", "CARDINAL . Applying the criteria thus established to the photos in question , starting with the second and third ones on which an injunction had been imposed by the courts and then challenged by the publishing company ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG noted that ORG had had regard to the fact that the second photo showed the applicant in a public place which was neither isolated nor out of public view . It had attached decisive weight , however , to the fact that the article concerned only the applicant \u2019s skiing holiday , that is , a situation falling within the core area of private life and concerning the applicant \u2019s need for peace and quiet , and the consequent lack of public interest other than satisfying public curiosity . Contrary to the submissions of the publishing company , the ORG interest in the applicant \u2019s fashionable ski suit did not amount to a public interest . Moreover , that aspect had not been mentioned anywhere in the article .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of ORG , the same conclusion had to be drawn with regard to the third photo whose publication had been challenged by the first applicant . There had been no public interest , beyond merely satisfying public curiosity , in the information contained in either the article commenting on the first applicant and her husband \u2019s trip to PERSON to celebrate the latter \u2019s birthday or the photo showing them both in a chairlift . Whilst the article had also mentioned FAC an event which , according to ORG , could possibly be regarded as an aspect of contemporary society \u2013 no link had been made between that event and the photo .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the first photo , ORG found that ORG had had valid grounds for considering that the reigning Prince of GPE \u2019s ill - health was a matter of general interest and that the press had accordingly been entitled to report on the manner in which the prince \u2019s children reconciled their obligations of family solidarity with the legitimate needs of their private life , among which was the desire to go on holiday . The conclusion reached by ORG , according to which the photo that had been published had a sufficiently close link with the event described in the article , was constitutionally unobjectionable .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that ORG had indicated that the protection of personality rights could prevail in cases where the photo in question had been taken in conditions that were particularly unfavourable for the person concerned , for example where it had been taken surreptitiously or following continual harassment by photographers . However , the publishing company had given details about how the photo had been taken and the first applicant had not complained before the lower civil courts or ORG that those details were insufficient . In particular , she had not alleged that the photo had been taken in conditions that were unfavourable to her .", "CARDINAL . ORG also dismissed the first applicant \u2019s allegation that ORG had disregarded or taken insufficient account of the ORG \u2019s case - law . Pointing out that a complaint of that nature could be raised in constitutional proceedings if it was based on a fundamental right guaranteed by LAW , it observed that ORG had taken account of the judgments delivered in GPE , cited above , and GPE and ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALX ) and had not failed to comply with its obligation to satisfy the criteria established by the LAW . ORG had undertaken an analysis of the ORG \u2019s relevant case - law and observed that the ORG \u2019s decisive criterion when balancing the competing rights was the question whether the report in its entirety ( article and photo ) contributed to the free formation of public opinion . Furthermore , a distinction had to be drawn between political figures , public figures and ordinary individuals . Whilst the latter enjoyed the greatest protection of the CARDINAL groups , political figures could expect only a small degree of protection from media reports about themselves .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( PERSON v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , and GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL-I ) , the first applicant was a public figure , which allowed the press \u2013 where there was an interest in informing the public \u2013 to publish photos , even of the person going about his or her DATE business in public . Publication of that sort , which , moreover , attracted the protection of LAW , could serve to exercise public scrutiny over the private conduct of persons who were influential in the economic , cultural or media sectors . ORG pointed out that the ORG had previously criticised the approach taken by domestic courts which had applied over - restrictive criteria to the question whether the media were or were not reporting matters of public interest when they reported on circumstances relating to the private life of a person who was not part of political life ( PERSON and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . It was sufficient that the report concerned , at least to some degree , important matters relating to politics or another sphere ( PERSON and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that ORG had found in the present case that the report in question concerned important subjects in a NORP society . In its PERSON judgment , cited above , the ORG had not categorically excluded the possibility that a report contributing to a debate about questions of interest to the public could be illustrated by photos showing a scene from the daily life of a political or public figure . Even though the ORG had concluded in GPE that the photos in question had not been of information valueand having regard to the ORG \u2019s case - law \u2013 that the photo in question was of information value was constitutionally unobjectionable .", "CARDINAL .
