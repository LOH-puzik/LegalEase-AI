In the ensuing proceedings , the applicant was assisted by defence counsel of his choice . On DATE a bill of indictment was preferred .", "After several hearings at which numerous witnesses testified and the opinions of CARDINAL medical and CARDINAL technical experts were obtained , on DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . On DATE the FAC ORG quashed this judgment as unfounded ; the bench included PERSON , PERSON and PERSON", "In the resumed proceedings ( megism\u00e9telt elj\u00e1r\u00e1s ) , ORG held QUANTITY hearings . On DATE it found the applicant guilty as charged . It held that , apart from the responsibility of another driver who had died in the multiple collisions , the accident had essentially been caused by the applicant \u2019s failure to maintain the brakes of his truck and his grossly negligent driving . The applicant \u2019s offence was punishable with CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . ORG took account of the protraction of the proceedings as an important mitigating factor ( nyomat\u00e9kos enyh\u00edt\u0151 k\u00f6r\u00fclm\u00e9ny ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL half GPE imprisonment and a DATE prohibition on driving .", "The applicant appealed , seeking an acquittal , pleading that the judgment was ill - founded .", "On DATE ORG , again with the participation of PERSON and NORP , upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction but reduced his sentence to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment and a DATE prohibition on driving . The court reviewed the entirety of the proceedings and the first - instance judgment , and held that the first - instance proceedings had been lawful . Furthermore , it considered that the findings of fact were not ill - founded , within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , and were thus suitable for appellate review without taking further evidence . This consideration enabled the court to hold deliberations in camera , in application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , without the attendance of either the defence or the prosecution .", "The applicant states that this judgment was served on his lawyer only on DATE . However , on DATE he had already been called upon to start serving his sentence on DATE .
