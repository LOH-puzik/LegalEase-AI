The judiciary \u2019s allegedly unlawful and unethical behaviour provoked considerable public debate and attracted wide media coverage . ORG and ORG launched an inquiry ( p\u0101rbaude ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG established a working group consisting of CARDINAL judges . The working group was tasked with carrying out an assessment of whether \u201c the judges of ORG who were purportedly involved in the telephone tapping scandal , which raises doubts about the independence of the judiciary and the honesty of judges \u201d had violated LAW . On DATE the working group received transcripts of the alleged telephone conversations from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the annual conference of judges , the chairman of ORG made a speech about the effects of the book and the public debate which followed . He stated :", "\u201c DATE have passed since information emerged about alleged telephone conversations between judges and a particular lawyer . That event further confirmed the conviction of at least some people in society that doubts about the impartiality and the independence of courts , and therefore the lawfulness of their judgments , are justified .", "Society sees the information that was published as credible , irrespective of whether it was obtained lawfully or unlawfully and no matter what the result of the investigation carried out by ORG will be , and it undermines trust in the judiciary . ...", "... I think that the information about the alleged conversations between judges and the lawyer [ ... ] should be treated as a signal or a call to look at the problems in the judiciary in a wider context ...", "... In relation to this particular situation , I think it was caused by the attitude to the rule of law and the code of ethics which regulate judges\u2019 behaviour . The superficial , irresponsible and perhaps even the unlawful behaviour of certain judges has fundamentally affected trust in the judiciary ...", "Therefore [ we ] should also talk about the responsibility of judges , [ we ] should be conscious of the fact that a lack of self - criticism and an inability to apply ethical standards properly pose a threat to the independence of the judiciary .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the inquiry carried out by ORG concluded that the alleged telephone conversations had taken place DATE . As there were no audio records of the conversations , the authenticity of the content of the transcripts could not be established .

With regard to Judge O.D.J. , a judge of the ORG of ORG , ORG observed that the book had referred to a brief telephone conversation of DATE in which the lawyer ORG had arranged a meeting in the Judge O.D.J. \u2019s office . The impugned conversation had not referred to any specific civil case so ORG concluded that there were insufficient grounds to investigate Judge O.D.J. \u2019s activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the working group established by ORG published a report on their inquiry into alleged ethical wrongdoing by judges . The working group identified that CARDINAL of the QUANTITY judges , whose conduct had been assessed , had violated LAW , but that Judge O.D.J. , whose conversation with the lawyer had been published in the book , had not . It stated :", "\u201c ... [ CARDINAL ] In his submissions [ CARDINAL ] O.D.J. did not deny that he might have had conversations [ with the lawyer ] but that they had only concerned NORP compensation claims , however in those cases [ the lawyer ] had not been representing any of the parties , and therefore the working group concluded that O.D.J. had not violated LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
