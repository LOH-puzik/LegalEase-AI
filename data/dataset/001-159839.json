NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born , went to school and grew up in the municipality of DATE . In DATE he inherited real estate from his parents , and he returned to live in the house situated on the property . His closest family members as well his friends live in the area .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant obtained a building permit allowing him to extend the house situated on the inherited property . During the works , the applicant \u2019s application for communal aid for increasing energy - efficiency was rejected by the municipality as the real estate was marked in the detailed plan as a holiday home and not as a house destined for permanent , year - round use .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the applicant requested that the municipality grant a derogation ( poikkeaminen , undantag ) from the planning norms and change the entry in its records from a holiday home into a house in permanent use , in order to reflect the real situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal environmental board rejected the applicant \u2019s request . It reasoned its decision by stating that the real estate was situated in an area destined for holiday homes and that the building permit had been granted only for a holiday home . Accepting a derogation in the applicant \u2019s case would affect the realisation of plans and be detrimental to urban development . If a derogation were made in the applicant \u2019s case , then all other landowners would have the same right , as they all had to be treated equally . Moreover , the real estate was located a long way from the services of the municipality and was not therefore suitable for permanent residence .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of the municipal environmental board to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that his house be designated as a house for permanent residence . He pointed out that the house fulfilled the requirements for a house in permanent use . The neighbours did not object to the applicant \u2019s request . Moreover , the house was situated QUANTITY from the centre of the municipality and such a location was not in any way unusual in other villages . Accepting the applicant \u2019s request would not create any new service obligations for the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the applicant \u2019s house was located in an area which , in detailed plans , was destined for holiday use only . The same plans indicated other areas in which permanent housing should be concentrated . The equal treatment of all landowners required that they should also be able to live permanently in the area in question , which would lead to an uncontrolled increase in permanent housing in the area . The applicant \u2019s personal circumstances and the fact that the house in question was suitable for permanent residence were not relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal presented before ORG . Moreover , the applicant argued that the right to live permanently in a place of one \u2019s choice could not be dependent on the municipality in which CARDINAL lived and the will of a particular civil servant in that municipality . The question of a constitutionally - protected right to equal treatment of citizens arose , since similar requests had been accepted in other municipalities . For example in the GPE area the municipalities had abandoned the idea that permanent housing could not be accepted in sparsely populated areas .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to avoid periodic penalty payments which were likely to be imposed , the applicant moved to a rented apartment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant applied again for communal aid for increasing energy - efficiency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request was again rejected by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant requested that the municipal environmental board rectify the decision of DATE and state that there was no impediment to registering his house as a house for permanent use .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal environmental board upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE not to grant communal aid for increasing energyefficiency . No decision was made concerning the registration of the applicant \u2019s house as a house for permanent use . It is not known whether the applicant appealed further against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no .
