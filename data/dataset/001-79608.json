They were masked with stockings pulled over their heads and entered the club after closing time . They forced the last remaining employee to hand over cash and a stock of cigarettes by threatening him with a starting pistol and an electric paralyser .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after TIME , the police detained and subsequently charged the applicant and his former classmate and friend , NORP , with armed robbery within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 LAW b ) of LAW ( ORG ) . The applicant who was assigned an ex officio lawyer did not appeal against the charge .", "CARDINAL . At his first interrogation NORP confessed to having committed the robbery together with the applicant and gave all relevant details . The applicant only confessed to having planned and prepared the robbery . According to him he had withdrawn from the plan at TIME because he had become anxious . He had driven NORP to the scene and had agreed to wait for him in a place agreed upon , but NORP had not come to that place .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his subsequent interrogation before a judge of FAC s\u00fad ) the applicant repeated the above version . He did not know the person who had committed the robbery with NORP and had no explanation as to why NORP wished to inculpate him . The applicant added that he had a debt which he intended to pay off from the proceeds of the planned robbery . He and NORP had previously wanted to burgle a holiday cottage , but had abandoned the idea after a light had gone on inside . The applicant also stated that he was a self - employed entrepreneur and could settle his debt using money from his business or obtained from his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in detention . Testimonies of NORP and a witness and other evidence provided a basis for a strong suspicion against the applicant . Even assuming that he had not taken part in the robbery as such , his involvement had in any event amounted to the offence of aiding and abetting under LAW ( c ) of the ORG . As the motive of his actions was his need to obtain money to pay off his debt , it could be presumed that , if released , the applicant would carry on his criminal activities to achieve that objective . This rendered his detention justified under LAW ( c ) of LAW ( ORG ) . On DATE ORG corrected clerical errors in the decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a complaint ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) against his detention arguing that he had no previous convictions and that the weapon had been used by NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint observing that the testimony of NORP and documentary evidence justified the suspicion that the applicant had been at least an accomplice to the robbery . It was true that he had no previous convictions but , at the same time , it was clear from his own submissions that his objective was to obtain money to discharge his debt . The reasons for detaining him , as established by ORG , were therefore valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant discharged his lawyer and appointed a new CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted to stand trial in ORG on charges of conspiracy and robbery ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( b ) of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s new lawyer lodged a petition for the applicant \u2019s release . He relied on extracts from the applicant \u2019s accounting books and argued that the recent profits of his business were sufficient to settle the applicant \u2019s debt . There was therefore no need to detain him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that a request for his release had been submitted on his behalf by a lawyer but that it could not be processed because the lawyer had not shown that he had a valid power of attorney from the applicant . On DATE the previous lawyer informed ORG that his power of attorney had been terminated and that the applicant had new legal representation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a private session ( neverejn\u00e9 zasadnutie ) to examine the petition of DATE for the applicant \u2019s release . The session was attended by a public prosecutor , but neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present . ORG dismissed the petition . It referred to a previous statement by the applicant according to which it was the applicant who had proposed to NORP that they should find a way to obtain money . The fact that the applicant had income from his business was not new . However , the information submitted by him as to the amount of his earnings was inconsistent and had no impact on the necessity to keep him in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained of the decision of CARDINAL July CARDINAL to ORG . He argued that at the time of his remand he had not had detailed information about his financial situation . He now had such information and it showed that his financial standing had improved and was better than expected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a private session to decide on the applicant \u2019s complaint . It was attended by the prosecutor but not by the applicant and his lawyer . ORG dismissed the complaint . It considered that the concern that the applicant might commit further offences was still justified . He had a debt which he could not repay and the evidence available indicated that this was the reason why he and NORP had decided to carry out the robbery . As for the extracts from the accounting books which he had submitted , it could not be established whether they related to the business of the applicant or his father \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing ( hlavn\u00e9 pojedn\u00e1vanie ) in the case . It took evidence from the applicant and NORP and examined depositions of CARDINAL witnesses .", "The applicant again petitioned for release arguing that he had sufficient means to pay off his debt and that the initial reason for detaining him therefore no longer existed . His petition was dismissed as the court found no new relevant facts which would invalidate the reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention as set out in the earlier decisions .", "The hearing was adjourned until DATE in order to await a judgment of the ORG nad ORG in a different criminal trial against NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint against the dismissal of his petition for release . He argued that the courts had not convincingly refuted his argument that he had sufficient means to settle his debt . The applicant further complained of a violation of his right to be presumed innocent in that in their previous decisions the courts had expressed the view that he had committed the robbery despite the fact that he had not yet been convicted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a private session to consider the applicant \u2019s complaint . It was attended by the prosecutor in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer . ORG dismissed the complaint holding that :", "\u201c The accused was indicted for complicity in robbery ... The evidence which has been taken so far has proved that the accused ORG committed that offence as he needed money to pay off his debts ( \u201c ... bolo preuk\u00e1zan\u00e9 , \u017ee ob\u017ealovan\u00fd GPE uveden\u00e9ho trestn\u00e9ho \u010dinu dopustil sa z d\u00f4vodu , \u017ee potreboval peniaze ... \u201d ) . On this basis the authorities dealing with the case established that [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention was necessary within the meaning of LAW ( c ) of LAW , as the specific fear persisted that the accused would continue criminal activities in case of his release .", "Having examined the challenged decision and the reasons for the complaint against it , ORG [ considers ] that the danger still exists that the accused will continue committing offences in case of his release regardless of his argument that his financial situation has improved and that he can pay off the debt . ORG reached this conclusion also having regard to the fact that the accused had been tried by ORG in ORG on DATE and ORG in Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161 adjourned the hearing only because the judgment of [ DATE ] had not become final and [ ORG in Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161 ] may be required to impose a consolidated penalty . The above thus shows that the accused has a tendency to commit offences regardless of his financial situation . The risk that , if released , he may continue to commit further offences with a view to obtaining financial means therefore still persists .", "The way in which the offence was committed also indicates the extent to which the accused is corrupt . This confirms the conclusion that he could commit further offences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held another hearing following which , on DATE , it found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment .", "ORG noted that , at the pretrial stage of the proceedings , the applicant had admitted that he had come up with the idea of illegally obtaining money and that with NORP they had explored the possibilities of doing so . At that time he had claimed that he had participated in preparing the robbery but had finally abandoned the idea of carrying it out . However , at the hearing , the applicant had changed his testimony and alleged that he had informed NORP beforehand that he would not participate in the crime .", "ORG also noted that NORP had described in detail how the offence had been committed . According to him the initiative to steal money had come from the applicant and the applicant had actually carried out the robbery with him . This version of facts was supported by other evidence , in particular by the statements of the employee of the club and CARDINAL other witnesses . It was corroborated by police reports concerning the discovery of weapons and other items connected with the robbery and the booty . ORG found no grounds to disbelieve the version of NORP The applicant \u2019s version was however not supported by any evidence and was thus unreliable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He argued that the first - instance court had failed to establish adequately the relevant facts and to give convincing reasons for its conclusion . In particular it had relied exclusively on the statements of NORP and had given no relevant reasons for rejecting the applicant \u2019s version . There was no evidence showing that the applicant had actually committed the robbery and ORG had failed to address his argument that there were inconsistencies in the submissions of NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed another request for release lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the decision of DATE and challenged the judges of ORG dealing with his case . He contended that in the above decision of DATE they had expressed the view that the applicant had a tendency to commit offences and , in that connection , referred to the judgment of the ORG nad ORG of DATE . That judgment , however , concerned NORP and not the applicant . According to the applicant , in the circumstances , the impartiality of ORG judges was open to doubt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , under LAW of the ORG , a different chamber of ORG found that the CARDINAL ORG judges dealing with the applicant \u2019s case were not biased . It acknowledged that the reference in the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL to the judgment of DATE was a mistake . However , that mistake had no impact on the determination of the charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG modified the first - instance judgment in that it reduced to DATE the sentence imposed on the applicant . The chamber of ORG was composed of the same judges who had delivered the decision of DATE .", "In its judgment ORG addressed the applicant \u2019s arguments . It found no discrepancy in the relevant part of the statements of NORP indicating that he had committed the offence together with the applicant . Relying on the contents of the case file , ORG upheld the conclusion that the applicant had initiated the offence and that he had committed it together with NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision of DATE . It noted that the applicant \u2019s conviction had become final and that he was to start his sentence .
