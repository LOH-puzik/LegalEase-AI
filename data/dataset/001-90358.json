The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in flagrante delicto for receiving a package containing QUANTITY of cannabis and remanded in custody . Following his arrest , the applicant \u2019s house was searched . The investigating authorities found and seized a large number of NORP and NORP antiquities , including small statues , ancient coins , vessels and fossils .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before ORG who charged him with having received a package containing drugs . Concerning the antiquities found in the applicant \u2019s house , the Prosecutor decided not to press charges unless new evidence was adduced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG , after questioning the applicant , remanded him in custody with effect from CARDINAL DATE , the date of his arrest , on the grounds that there were serious prima facie indications that the defendant had committed the drug - related offence and that it was necessary to prevent him from absconding and to make sure that he would not commit further offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for release on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It held as follows :", "\u201c ... [ the way that the packet was carefully prepared ] reveals a dexterous and studied action , established by the choice of special means for the commission of the crime of drug trafficking , as well as a collective action . Furthermore , during the lawful search of the accused \u2019s house ... a significant number of antiquities were found , including in particular , CARDINAL coins from different periods , a small statue of ORG , a small bronze statue of PERSON , an ancient vessel , a fossil in lava from the volcano of PERSON , part of a fresco and numerous NORP antiquities , the possession of which demonstrates the perpetrator \u2019s propensity to commit further offences relating to antiquities . In view of the above , there is very serious evidence of the applicant \u2019s guilt and ... his request should be rejected since it is reasonably considered that even the replacement of his pre - trial detention by preventive measures would not be sufficient to ensure his appearance in court and the execution of any judgment the court may deliver . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG submitted to ORG of ORG his proposal to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention in compliance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , since the applicant had been in detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG replaced the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention by preventive measures ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In particular , it held that :", "\u201c ... the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention is not absolutely necessary since he has a known residence in GPE , and has family and property in GPE , he has not made preparations with a view to absconding , he has never been a fugitive in the past and it is improbable , on the basis of his criminal record and his social and professional status , that he will commit further crimes if he is released . In the light of the above and in view of the applicant \u2019s old age and serious health problems ... ORG considers that the prolongation of the detention imposes on the applicant a disproportionate burden and that his appearance in court and the execution of any judgment the court may deliver can be ensured by the above preventive measures : ( a ) prohibition from leaving the country and ( b ) an obligation to report to his local police station twice DATE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG laid supplementary charges against the applicant for misappropriation of antiquities . On DATE the investigating judge questioned the applicant in that connection .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case - file that the criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending before the investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suffers from various health problems , including chronic duodenal ulcer , persistent urinary problems , inguinal hernia ( when part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in muscles in the groin , the area between the abdomen and thigh ) and degenerative spine disorders .

On several occasions he was granted leave to be consulted by external doctors and undergo special examinations in ORG , including gastroscopy , echocardiography and chest X - rays . According to the medical certificates submitted by the applicant and the Government , the results of a number of medical examinations ( kidneys , bladder and prostate ultrasound , chest computed tomography , bronchoscopy and heart triplex ultrasound ) were imminent . The applicant was prescribed medication for his urinary and gastro - intestinal problems . Concerning the inguinal hernia , surgical treatment was advised .", "CARDINAL .
