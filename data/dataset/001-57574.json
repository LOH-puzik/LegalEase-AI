Mr. PERSON is a professor of law at ORG and Mr. PERSON is an officer in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are members of trade unions affiliated to CARDINAL of the main federations representing ORG employees , namely ORG ( ORG FAC , abbreviated to ORG ) in the case of Mr. PERSON and ORG ( PERSON , abbreviated to ORG ) in the case of Mr. PERSON .", "In DATE , after expiry of CARDINAL collective agreement and during negotiations for a new agreement , the ORG unions called selective strikes not affecting the sectors in which worked the applicants , who thus did not come out on strike . Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON complain that on conclusion of the new agreement , they , as members of the \" belligerent \" unions , were denied certain retroactive benefits paid to members of other trade unions and to non - union employees who had not participated in the strikes .", "General background", "CARDINAL . For DATE , workers and employers in the private sector in GPE have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and associations and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the ORG .", "Certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in DATE and DATE by the following legislation :", "( i ) the DATE LAW ( lag om kollektivavtal ) ;", "( ii ) the DATE LAW ( lag om arbetsdomstol ) ; and", "( iii ) the DATE Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate ( lag om f\u00f6renings - och f\u00f6rhandlingsr\u00e4tt ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW deals with collective labour agreements between employers or ORG associations and trade unions . It specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements . For example , the parties may not take strike or lock - out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW contained rules governing the composition , jurisdiction and procedure of ORG . ORG was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of LAW on the Right to Organise and Negotiate . It also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation or application of collective agreements , but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue . Unions or non - union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable ( paragraph CARDINAL below ) were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts , as the case might be .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned LAW of DATE guarantees CARDINAL distinct rights to the parties on the labour market , namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate .", "The right to organise is defined in LAW as being the right of employers and employees to belong to an ORG organisation or a trade union , to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union , and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union , without interference or pressure by the other party . LAW specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated \" if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer , as the case may be , to refrain from becoming a member of , or to resign from , an association , to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association , or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association , and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer , as the case may be , on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association , exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association \" .", "The only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the LAW is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as intervention in the affairs of the association .", "The right to negotiate is defined in LAW as being \" the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general \" . It imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations , to attend meetings for negotiations and , where necessary , to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved . This provision is applicable to all trade unions .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the ORG determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the ORG and the employees .", "As from DATE , the DATE LAW ( statstj\u00e4nstemannalag ) has virtually assimilated ORG employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights , strikes , lock - outs , etc . The LAW made LAW , the DATE LAW and LAW on the Right to Organise and Negotiate applicable in the public sector . Furthermore , the LAW provided for collective agreements to be concluded , subject to certain exceptions , between the National Collective Bargaining Office ( Statens GPE , hereinafter referred to as \" the ORG \" ) , representing the ORG as employer , and the organisations of ORG employees . ORG has a nominee on the governing board of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The DATE legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the NORP trade union movement ; CARDINAL factor which greatly contributed to its adoption was the conclusion in DATE of LAW ( slottsbacksavtalet ) between the ORG and the CARDINAL main trade union organisations of ORG employees , namely :", "( i ) ORG ( PERSON , abbreviated to GPE and known prior to DATE as Statstj\u00e4narkartellen ) ,", "( ii ) ORG ( ORG ) ,", "( iii ) ORG ( ORG ) ,", "( iv ) ORG ( Tj\u00e4nstem\u00e4nnens Centralorganisations Statstj\u00e4nstemannasektion , abbreviated to ORG ) .", "According to the information at the disposal of the ORG , these federations represent the large majority of NORP ORG employees : CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL whose terms of employment are negotiated by the ORG . CARDINAL trade unions are affiliated to these organisations . The few independent trade unions represent CARDINAL ORG employees in all .", "Insofar as they are union members at all , university teachers and army officers generally belong to ORG and ORG respectively . These CARDINAL organisations , which are respectively open to staff possessing a university degree or the school leaving certificate ( the equivalent of the baccalaur\u00e9at ) , recently merged after the case had been brought before the Commission .", "According to the trade ORG own published figures , the number of ORG members in respect of whom the ORG conducts collective negotiations was CARDINAL in DATE and DATE ; it rose to CARDINAL in DATE and was CARDINAL at DATE . The university ORG union affiliated to ORG had CARDINAL members in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL at DATE . ORG had CARDINAL members in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL at DATE . The army ORG union affiliated to ORG had CARDINAL members in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL at DATE ; it would appear that in DATE its membership had fallen to CARDINAL or CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Clause CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees\u2019 behalf by the \" main organisation \" concerned , unless the ORG and the \" main organisation \" agree otherwise .", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE relating to LAW ( ORG om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m . ) includes the following provisions :", "\" Collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the King - in - Council or by ORG shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the King - in - Council . \"", "\" An ORG which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers , notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement . \"", "CARDINAL . Collective agreements in GPE are normally concluded for a period of DATE . For various reasons , however , the new collective agreement is often concluded some time after the previous agreement has expired . In such cases , the new agreement has often specifically provided that its terms shall apply retroactively as from the date of expiry of the previous agreement . In the case of a strike during the bargaining period , on the other hand , employers - both in the public and private sector - have customarily refused to grant retroactive benefits in order to deter unions from taking industrial action in the future ( application of the principle that \" a strike destroys retroactivity \" ) .", "CARDINAL . Negotiations in the public sector of the labour market are centralised in that they are conducted by the federations on behalf of their member unions . Moreover , strikes and other collective action may not be taken by the different trade unions independently but rather on the basis of a decision by , or after receiving the approval of , the federation concerned , which chooses and designates in accordance with its pre - arranged policy or tactics those of its members who are to take part in the action . According to the present practice , the negotiations between the ORG and the federations result in CARDINAL single agreement which regulates the increase in salaries , the grading of different categories of employees , working TIME , various salary allowances , etc . , and which applies , as a result of LAW referred to above ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , to all categories of ORG employees , including those who are not represented by the federations . The agreement is normally signed by all the federations .", "The question whether an individual employee has any means of challenging his union \u2019s decision to go on strike is a matter exclusively governed by the internal rules of the union concerned . These may provide for a right to ask for a secret ballot or for other rights to object to the union \u2019s decisions to take industrial action .", "CARDINAL . The law described above at paragraphs CARDINAL has in DATE undergone various changes which , being subsequent to the facts at issue , are not relevant for the present case .", "Facts of the particular case", "CARDINAL . In DATE a global agreement for DATE was concluded by ORG and the CARDINAL federations . When this period expired on DATE , the parties were still engaged in negotiations regarding the new global agreement . No agreement was reached and ORG was appointed , but negotiations before it broke down as well . Consequently , ORG and ORG proclaimed selective strikes which became effective on DATE and involved CARDINAL members . This resort to strike action , which was quite lawful ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) , did not apply to university teachers or the ORG so that neither Mr. PERSON nor Mr. PERSON took any part in the strikes .", "The ORG retaliated and , on DATE , CARDINAL members of ORG and ORG were locked out . This affected all university teachers belonging to ORG , including Mr. PERSON , and some officers belonging to ORG , but not Mr. PERSON . New strikes and lock - outs were proclaimed , but did not become effective . On DATE , an Act was promulgated which gave the King - in - Council power to order the prolongation of certain collective agreements for a period of DATE , but not extending beyond DATE , provided that collective industrial action threatened vital public interests . By virtue of this LAW the previous collective agreement was reinstated on DATE for a period of DATE and all strikes and lock - outs terminated forthwith .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent negotiations before ORG resulted in DATE in a new global agreement for DATE . According to this agreement , certain posts were upgraded and the salary scales were generally increased retroactively as from DATE . Clause CARDINAL , however , provided for an exception in this respect :", "\" Officials who were members DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( or any part of this period ) of organisations that organised industrial action for any part of this period , shall not be entitled from DATE to CARDINAL DATE to the increased wage benefits applicable under the agreement , unless ORG decides otherwise . This declaration also concerns other officials if they took part in any such industrial action . \"", "CARDINAL . The agreement was only signed by ORG and GPE . ORG and ORG refused since they considered the terms unacceptable . The agreement , and in particular clause CARDINAL , was nevertheless applied to their members by virtue of LAW above - mentioned Royal Order ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "According to the applicants , during the negotiations GPE and ORG had urged that the non - retroactivity clause should not be included in the agreement and expressed the opinion that it properly belonged to an agreement between the ORG and the CARDINAL organisations concerned , ORG and ORG . GPE and ORG declared this expressly and inserted a reservation in the record before putting their signatures to the agreement . ORG had , however , attempted to entice to itself some members of ORG , which was in its opinion a purposeless organisation , and had in fact written to the applicant PERSON in this vein .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the agreement , members of ORG and ORG , insofar as they were upgraded , did not receive the higher salary for the period from DATE , nor did they benefit from the general increase in the salary scales during the same period , regardless of whether or not they had been on strike . ORG employees who were not members of ORG or ORG but who had all the same participated in the strike , were also refused the benefit of retroactivity .", "The exception clause applied to both applicants as members of ORG and ORG , even though they themselves had not gone on strike at all . Mr. PERSON was affected for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , being the date when he was locked out and thus deprived of his salary . Mr. PERSON , who was upgraded under the new agreement , was affected for the whole period DATE . During these periods the applicants performed work for a lower salary than that paid to other employees who were in the same salary brackets but not members of ORG or ORG . Their financial losses amounted to ORG . CARDINAL and ORG . CARDINAL respectively .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , following the conclusion of the collective agreement , gave notice to the ORG that , through his special treatment in regard to wages , his right to organise had been violated . When the ORG nevertheless refused him the benefit of retroactivity , ORG and ORG brought an action against the ORG before ORG under LAW on the Right to Organise and Negotiate , seeking on behalf of the applicants ( and a third person who was also a member of ORG ) , inter alia :", "( i ) a declaration that the measures taken by the ORG constituted a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to organise and that this involved an interference with the affairs of ORG and ORG ;", "( ii ) a declaration that clause CARDINAL of the agreement of DATE was of no effect in regard to the applicants ;", "( iii ) an order that the ORG pay compensation to the applicants for financial loss and infringement of their right to organise .", "ORG and ORG asserted that the ORG had infringed their ORG right to organise as guaranteed in LAW since , with regard to retroactive wage benefits , they were subjected to special treatment in comparison with members of ORG and GPE and non - union officials . ORG denied any such infringement since members of ORG and ORG had been refused the benefit of retroactivity only for the reason that the ORG wanted to maintain the principle that \" a strike destroys retroactivity \" . A comparison between ORG and ORG members , on the one side , and members of ORG and GPE and non - union officials , on the other , did not provide any basis for the conclusion that the ORG acted on such a basis or with such a purpose as was envisaged by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG unanimously rejected the claim of the ORG unions . ORG first confirmed the parties\u2019 common view that the right to organise did not exclude the possibility for the ORG to enforce the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity . The adoption of such a position , and its enforcement after a conflict , were not to be regarded in themselves as an attack on the right to organise . Furthermore , the employer \u2019s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non - union employees or to members of different organisations . The mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating LAW had been employed . However , any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non - union employees , with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in LAW , would constitute a violation of that provision .", "The ORG then found that no such purpose on the part of the ORG could be established . In particular , no support had appeared for the idea that the ORG intended to induce members of ORG and ORG to switch over to ORG and GPE . In this context , the ORG assumed that the latter organisations would also have been refused retroactivity if they had organised industrial action during the process of negotiations .", "With respect to non - union employees the ORG found that the reason why they were granted a special benefit had nothing to do with their position as being non - union . Any procedure designed to refuse the benefit of retroactivity generally to non - union employees in sectors where ORG and ORG were dominant or representative obviously could have become very complicated and time - consuming . Moreover , no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors , and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed . The ORG then referred to the ORG \u2019s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non - union employees within the sectors in which ORG and ORG were representative . In this respect the ORG considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the ORG to violate the right to organise . Otherwise , the ORG would , as soon as CARDINAL federation organised industrial action , be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations . Such a general limitation of the ORG \u2019s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on LAW .", "In the case before it , the ORG did not consider the granting of retroactive benefits to non - union employees who had not been on strike as proof of any purpose to violate the right to organise . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the parties had not been able to present anything more than quite uncertain information on the total number of non - union officials or on their field of employment . ORG indicated that the GPE view concerning the ORG \u2019s purpose in its treatment of non - union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non - union officials were active within the main field of activity of ORG and ORG . Conversely , it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non - union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of GPE and ORG The uncertainty in regard to these circumstances argued , in the ORG \u2019s conclusion , in favour of the GPE declaration that its purpose did not extend beyond upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity .", "CARDINAL . In their application , lodged with the ORG on DATE , the applicants complained that in the particular circumstances the implementation of the ORG \u2019s policy regarding payment of retroactive benefits had amounted to preferential treatment , in particular in comparison with non - union employees , and had consequently violated LAW ( LAW ) of the Convention .", "The Commission declared the application admissible by a decision of DATE .", "During the examination of the merits , the applicants relied on LAW ) and also LAW , read in conjunction with LAW ( article DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In its report of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG :", "( i ) confirmed its opinion , previously expressed in the report in the NORP ORG case , that LAW para . CARDINAL ( LAW ) may legitimately extend to cover ORG responsibility in the field of labour - management relations and thus to provide some protection for unions against interference by employers ;", "( ii ) expressed the opinion :", "- by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL with CARDINAL abstention , that the ORG \u2019s policy of denying retroactive benefits to non - striking members of belligerent unions did not in the circumstances infringe the applicants\u2019 right , under LAW para .
