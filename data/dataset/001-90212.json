According to the information received from non - governmental sources , torture is being used in virtually all cases in which articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL CC [ Criminal Code ] ... are invoked , in order to extract self - incriminating confessions and to punish those who are perceived by public authorities to be involved in either religious , or political , activities contrary to ORG interests ( socalled security crimes ) . These provisions , which are rather vaguely worded and whose scope of application may be subject to various interpretations , are said to have been used in numerous allegedly fabricated cases and to have led to harsh prison sentences . The CARDINAL crimes that , following recent amendments , are now the only capital offences are said to lead to a death sentence only if they are combined with aggravated murder charges . Evidence gathering in such cases is said to rely exclusively on confessions extracted by illegal means . It is reported that religious leaflets as well as weapons or bullets have been planted as evidence that a person belongs to banned groups such as ORG - ut - GPE , a transnational NORP movement which calls for the peaceful establishment of the ORG in LOC . It is also reported that torture and ill - treatment continue to be used against inmates convicted on such charges , inter alia to force them to write repentance letters to the President of the LOC or to punish them further ...", "CARDINAL . The combination of a lack of respect for the principle of presumption of innocence despite being guaranteed by LAW ( article CARDINAL ) and [ LAW ] ( article CARDINAL ) , the discretionary powers of the investigators and procurators with respect to access to detainees by legal counsel and relatives , as well as the lack of independence of the judiciary and allegedly rampant corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies , are believed to be conducive to the use of illegal methods of investigation . The excessive powers in the overall criminal proceedings of procurators , who are supposed at the same time to conduct and supervise preliminary criminal investigations , to bring charges and to monitor respect for existing legal safeguards against torture during criminal investigations and in places of detention , make investigations into complaints overly dependent on their goodwill .", "CARDINAL .

Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty , the copious testimonies gathered are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process can not be denied .
