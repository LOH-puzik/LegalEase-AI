The fact that [ CARDINAL of ] the defendants ... have withdrawn their appeals on points of law , thereby confirming the judgment against them , argues decisively in favour of the correctness ( materielle PERSON ) of the judgment .", "As to the plea alleging a breach of substantive law ( materielle GPE ) , the defence \u2019s submissions again provide nothing to support the hypothesis that the proceedings were moving towards an acquittal . The quotations from the trial court \u2019s judgment are taken out of context , do not cover the considerations ( ORG ) subsequently set out by that court in the reasons for its judgment and are accordingly not consistent with its assessment of the case as a whole .", "For the same reasons the court declines to award compensation for the time spent in detention on remand , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] .", "Nor , to the extent that the proceedings were provisionally stayed under LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , are there any grounds for ordering the ORG to pay the defendant \u2019s necessary costs and expenses , because in view of the reasons given for the judgment , it was much more likely , having regard to the adverse financial position of the ORG holding company , that if the proceedings had continued , the defendant would have been convicted on the counts in question ( FAC nach den Ausf\u00fchrungen i m PERSON der ung\u00fcnstigen wirtschaftlichen Situation des Stummkonzerns bei einer GPE des PERSON wesentlich wahrscheinlicher war , dass es insoweit zu einer ORG gekommen w\u00e4re ) .", "That being so , the court does not consider it necessary to defer judgment until a decision has been given on the co - defendant M \u2019s appeal on points of law .", ".... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to ORG against that decision on DATE . In written pleadings dated DATE , she challenged , inter alia , ORG finding that , had her husband not died , he \" would almost certainly have been convicted or his conviction almost certainly have been upheld \" . She claimed that that statement was erroneous and infringed LAW ) and LAW ) ( article DATE , article CARDINAL ) and LAW ) ( article DATE , article DATE ) of the LAW . The court caused the conviction to \" become final \" posthumously , thereby prejudicing her as the defendant \u2019s widow with regard to the rights relied on and , in particular , entailing a violation of LAW ( article LAW ) of the Convention . It was as if it were sought to obtain a final ( abschliessend ) conviction of the deceased by a side wind in the form of a decision as to costs although no final ( rechtskr\u00e4ftig ) judgment had been handed down confirming that he had committed the offences with which he was charged . ORG likewise disregarded the presumption of innocence in stating that the grounds of appeal afforded no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted . It ought at most to have decided , after a summary examination of the case , that the appeal on points of law had some prospects of success , or it should have refrained from expressing a view . It was precisely for that reason that the applicant had requested an adjournment to await the judgment of ORG in the appeal proceedings brought by CARDINAL of the co - defendants . The court , however , had prejudged ORG decision by holding that the plea alleging a breach of substantive law again provided nothing to support the hypothesis of an acquittal : the court should have known that vital points in Mr. PERSON \u2019s appeal were also relied on by the co - defendant M.", "The applicant pointed out in addition that from the outset her husband had denied having committed any offences and had indeed been acquitted on several counts . In the light , inter alia , of LAW ( article LAW ) of the LAW , it therefore had to be assumed that in the event of a new trial he would have been acquitted completely . Since criminal law was based on the principle of individual guilt , it was quite simply unacceptable - and , once again , contrary to LAW ( article LAW ) - to judge the deceased by the conduct of CARDINAL of the co - defendants . In any case , the fact that those co - defendants had withdrawn their appeals on points of law could not be regarded as an admission of guilt ; besides , they had held responsibilities within ORG different from those of her husband .", "CARDINAL . ORG The public prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE and the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office ( ORG ) at ORG , to which Mrs. PERSON \u2019s appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) had been forwarded for any comments , contended that the appeal should be dismissed .", "On DATE , the GPE public prosecutor submitted that , having regard to the state of the proceedings , there was every likelihood ( hohe PERSON ) that the conviction would have been upheld .", "The principal public prosecutor gave his opinion on DATE . He considered that an assessment of the likely outcome of the proceedings ( Pr\u00fcfung des mutmasslichen Verfahrensausgangs ) , having regard to the reasons given in the judgment of ORG and the grounds of the appeal on points of law , could lead to CARDINAL conclusion . It could be assumed - and , indeed , had to be - that if the proceedings had been continued , the defendant \u2019s conviction would have been upheld . The principal public prosecutor took the view that the outcome of the appeal brought by the co - defendant M and still pending before ORG was of some relevance in assessing the likely outcome of the proceedings concerning Mr. PERSON , who , according to the aforementioned judgment , had committed his various offences in concert ( Mitt\u00e4terschaft ) with the said co - defendant .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , to whom the public prosecutors\u2019 observations had been communicated , replied on DATE .

In order to avoid repetition , reference is made to the reasons given for the contested decision , which are valid ( zutreffend ) . It should be noted in addition that the appeal on points of law of the co - defendant M was subsequently dismissed , on DATE , by ORG ... as being manifestly ill - founded .

The refusal of the applications for an order that the ORG should bear the deceased defendant \u2019s necessary costs and expenses is based on LAW , second sentence , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . The decision on the claim for compensation is based on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG . Both provisions , whose conformity with the LAW can not be doubted , confer on the courts a degree of discretion . There is nothing to suggest that the courts exercised their discretion in a manner contrary to LAW .", "( a ) Admittedly , the decisions being challenged make a prediction of the probable outcome of the proceedings had they been continued . However , such an assessment does not amount to a finding of guilt but merely to a finding of a continuing state of suspicion ( Eine derartige PERSON indessen nicht die PERSON , sondern lediglich die PERSON fortbestehenden PERSON ) . Consequently , it does not offend the presumption of innocence .", "( b ) Nor was the prediction of the outcome of the proceedings arbitrary in nature .", "( aa ) Neither the alleged defects ... in the judgment convicting the defendant nor the grounds of the appeal on points of law make it possible to dismiss as untenable the conclusion reached in the contested decisions that a ( subsequent ) acquittal was unlikely in respect of each of the offences of which the deceased defendant had been convicted . That was the only relevant issue for the order as to costs . The courts\u2019 reference to the lack of success of the appeal proceedings instituted by the co - defendant M and to the withdrawal of the appeals on points of law entered by the other defendants is clearly to be regarded merely as an additional argument , and the impugned decisions are not based on it .", "( bb ) Nor do the grounds advanced in support of the constitutional complaint show the unreasonableness of ORG opinion that , had the proceedings been continued , a conviction would have been more likely than an acquittal ...
