The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in GPE no . CARDINAL Prison ( \u201c the prison \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the wardens conducted a routine cell inspection and body searches of life prisoners . Following such an inspection in the applicant 's cell an incident took place , the parties ' accounts of which differ .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he requested warden PERSON to clean up the mess left behind after the search , after which the latter handcuffed him , took him out into the corridor and repeatedly threw him against the walls until the applicant pushed him away in self - defence . At that point another warden , PERSON , joined in the applicant 's beating . Both wardens continued kicking and punching him even after he had been knocked on to the floor . Later the applicant was conveyed to the operational unit , where he was beaten again by wardens whose identities and number he was not able to establish . The applicant was left on the floor for TIME , examined superficially by CARDINAL medical assistants who found his condition to be satisfactory , and then taken back to his cell . Although he had a fever and was suffering from pain in the chest which severely constrained his movements , the applicant felt discouraged from seeking any medical assistance by what he perceived to be indifference and mockery on the part of the prison 's medical staff .", "CARDINAL . As submitted by the Government with reference to the information provided by the prison administration , the applicant resisted being body - searched by warden PERSON , using obscene language and attempting to hit the latter with his head . Although warned that force might be used against him if he resisted further , the applicant tried to kick officer PERSON , who , in his turn , knocked him down using a martial art technique ( sambo ) . The applicant was then convoyed to the prison 's operational unit where he was held until he had calmed down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE warden PERSON completed a \u201c Form regarding application to a prisoner ( detainee ) of handcuffs , straitjacket or other special measures \u201d , in which he reported to the prison governor that he had used a sambo technique against the applicant caused by the latter 's \u201c physical resistance \u201d . CARDINAL other wardens certified the form as accurate . The prison surgeon , in his turn , issued a report on the applicant 's examination \u201c following the usage of a sambo technique \u201d , in which he noted that the applicant 's condition was satisfactory with no pathology of the internal organs discovered , while the applicant himself had not raised any complaints .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG 's submissions based on the domestic investigation materials , on DATE the applicant was X - rayed with no bone fractures discovered . The applicant denied having been X - rayed before DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison governor disciplined the applicant for the incident of DATE by way of a written reprimand .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant complained to the prison 's medical unit of pain in the left part of his chest which worsened with a deep inhalation or sharp movement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the prison 's medical unit , a therapist , a surgeon and a radiographer examined the applicant and diagnosed him with \u201c osteochondrosis \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's mother complained to the prosecution authorities that prison wardens had used unjustified force against her son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator of ORG with ORG ( \u201c ORG Office \u201d ) examined wardens PERSON and PERSON , whose description of the events of DATE was identical to that summarised in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings against warden P. as there had been nothing criminal in his actions . It was based on a finding that force had been used against the applicant on the grounds and in the manner envisaged by LAW . The investigator also took into account the fact that the applicant had been examined by a doctor immediately after the incident , with no complaints received from him and no injuries discovered . It was further mentioned in the decision that the applicant had refused , with reference to LAW ( absolving a person from any responsibility for refusing to testify or to explain anything about himself ) to give any explanation as regards his disobedience of the legitimate orders of the prison administration on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor of ORG quashed the above decision as not based on comprehensive investigation . Specifically , the investigator had wrongly dispensed with questioning the applicant 's cellmate . He should also have identified and heard other prisoners who might have witnessed the incident . Lastly , no forensic medical examination of the applicant had been undertaken with a view to establishing the nature and gravity of his injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator examined ORG , the inmate with whom the applicant shared a cell from DATE , who stated that he knew the applicant as a calm and even - tempered person . A. described the events of DATE as follows . Warden P. and his colleague conducted a search in the cell , which they left in a mess . The applicant made a remark to PERSON , who advised him to officially complain to the prison administration if he wished to . The applicant , in his turn , addressed some obscene language to PERSON , who then unlocked the cell and took the applicant out into the corridor . A. submitted that he had seen P. kicking the applicant once and punching him twice . After that the door to the cell was closed and he heard the sound of blows . The applicant returned TIME with the left part of his back bruised and his left ear injured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE warden T. , as well as another prison staff member , gave written statements concordant with those of P.", "CARDINAL . From DATE ORG examined the applicant and studied his medical documentation at the investigator 's instruction with a view to clarifying : whether there were any injuries on the applicant 's body and what their origin was ; as well as the date , the nature and the gravity of the injuries , should any be discovered . In the course of that examination the applicant was X - rayed on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . According to him , that was his first X - ray since the incident of DATE . The experts discovered ( in addition to some changes in the applicant 's lungs characteristic of chronic tuberculosis ) that he had a closed blunt chest injury and fractures of CARDINAL ribs estimated to be of medium gravity and DATE . The possible date of the fractures was established on the basis of the appearance of the broken bones ' edges on the X - ray film , which were only to a slight extent covered by callus ( a connective tissue emerging on a bone at the site of a fracture and transforming into normal bone in DATE ) . The fractures had resulted from blows with blunt objects . As regards the X - ray film of DATE , which was among the applicant 's medical documents , CARDINAL radiographers participating in the examination concluded that it was impossible to identify it as belonging to the applicant , given that it was of low quality and did not mention his name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to institute criminal persecution of warden PERSON and the prison doctors ( against whom the applicant and/or his mother had apparently also made complaints ) having found that the elements of the crime had not been set out . In addition to the reasons given for the refusal on CARDINAL September CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the investigator referred to the medical report of DATE , according to which the applicant 's injuries could not have dated back as far as to DATE . While noting the statement given by the applicant 's cellmate PERSON ( summarised in paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the investigator decided to treat it with scepticismprison administration \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG directed the prison governor to investigate the circumstances in which the applicant could have sustained the rib fractures which had been discovered during his medical examination in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation subsequently undertaken the prison governor took written statements from CARDINAL wardens who had been on duty at various times during DATE and DATE . All of them stated that the applicant had never complained about anything and that there had been no fights or other incidents during their shifts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison administration issued a report about the applicant 's refusal to give any explanation regarding the injuries supposedly sustained by him DATE before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the prison medical unit issued a report , according to which the applicant had not addressed any complaint to the medical unit regarding his injuries .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ( the date is illegible on the available copy ) the prison governor issued a report finding no grounds to initiate criminal investigations into the infliction of the rib fractures on the applicant . He noted that the applicant had neither complained about those injuries nor explained their origin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE , finding that additional investigation was required . It noted that the investigation had failed to duly examine all the concerned staff of the prison . Neither had it clarified whether any force had been applied to the applicant when he was being convoyed from his cell to the operational unit and later in the operational unit . The applicant 's cellmate PERSON had not been duly examined as regards the applicant 's beating supposedly witnessed by him . While the medical examination established that the applicant had had CARDINAL ribs broken , the circumstances in which he had sustained those injuries remained unknown . Furthermore , it had not been established whether the applicant had in fact been X - rayed on DATE and whether that had been duly reflected in the documentation of the prison 's medical unit . Lastly , the decision to refuse to institute criminal proceedings concerned only warden PERSON , while the applicant alleged that he had been beaten up by several wardens .", "CARDINAL . On DATE wardens P. and PERSON gave additional written statements . According to ORG , he had not participated in the applicant 's convoying to the operational unit on DATE and was therefore not aware whether any force had been applied to the applicant at that stage . As submitted by PERSON , he had been among the wardens who had convoyed the applicant . He stated that he could give an assurance however that no force had been used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator examined the scene of the incident of DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to his report , also dated DATE , the applicant 's cellmate at the material time , A. , \u201c unequivocally refused to give any explanations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator questioned another inmate , O. , who had been sharing the cell with the applicant DATE and DATE . He contended to have noticed bruises on the applicant 's face and on the left side of his torso as soon as he had been transferred to that cell . The applicant had told him that he had been beaten by wardens P. and CARDINAL on DATE . O. further submitted that he had not had any conflict with the applicant , and that during the period when they had been sharing the cell the applicant had not had any fights with anybody and had not fallen . CARDINAL other inmates who were held later in the same cell with the applicant refused to make any statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another medical report was issued with a view to clarifying , at the prosecutor 's request , whether the applicant could have sustained the fractures of his CARDINAL ribs as a result of a fall or of being punched or kicked . The expert replied that the injuries could have been inflicted by punches , kicks or by other blunt objects , while he excluded any accidental fall as a plausible reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a new decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings against wardens PERSON and PERSON , as well as against the staff of the prison 's medical unit , for lack of corpus delicti in their actions . In addition to the findings of the previous similar decisions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) , the investigator mentioned the medical report of DATE ( DATE ) and the statements of inmate O. , without comment . Having repeatedly referred to the doctors ' finding of CARDINAL DATE , the investigator concluded that it should be interpreted as refuting the applicant 's allegation about his ill - treatment on DATE . He further noted that the applicant had had unfriendly relations with warden PERSON and therefore his allegations against the latter had to be taken with criticism .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted to the ORG a copy of a letter of ORG addressed to the applicant 's mother and dated DATE , by which it informed her about the aforementioned decision , as well as that it was possible to challenge it with ORG within DATE of receiving its copy ( which would be sent to her if requested ) . The applicant and his mother denied ever having received that letter .", "CARDINAL . Following the communication of the application to the Government , Mr GPE , the applicant 's lawyer representing him in the proceedings before the Court , requested a private expert , PERSON Professor of the ORG of ORG , Ph.D. in medicine ( \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a ) and a forensic medical expert of the highest - qualified category according to the existing appraisal system ) for an advisory opinion with a view to clarifying , in particular : what could have been the object , which had caused the fractures of the applicant 's ribs ; the probable date of the fractures ; explanation of the absence of any visible injuries on the applicant 's body during his examination by the prison 's doctors ; what illnesses the applicant was suffering from ; and whether his tuberculosis and lengthy stay in prison could have delayed the fractures ' healing process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert issued the requested advisory opinion , which was based on the applicant 's medical documentation and contained the following findings : The fractures in issue could have been inflicted by a foot in a shoe or by another object with a short protrusion . Having regard to the statements given by the applicant 's cellmates A. and ORG , the applicant 's consistent complaints of pain in the left part of his chest and the nature of those complaints , as well as the poor quality of the applicant 's X - ray film of DATE , it was not ruled out that the applicant could have sustained the fractures on DATE . As to the medical report of CARDINAL DATE , according to which those fractures could not have been inflicted DATE before the last X - ray ( CARDINAL and DATE ) , that conclusion was based on an assumption that a regular recovery process was being analysed , while the coalescence in the applicant 's case could well have been retarded by his chronic tuberculosis ( from which he was suffering , as was obvious from his X - rays ) , as well as by the fact that the prison conditions were not the most favourable for a quick recovery . In other words , the expert found it possible that while indeed under the normal circumstances the callus on the edges of the broken ribs had the appearance of being DATE , in the applicant 's case it could have in fact been older ( DATE ) . Lastly , as regards the fact that the prison doctors who had examined the applicant shortly after the incident of DATE had not seen any visible injuries on his body , the expert noted that it could have been explained by the \u201c depth \u201d of the haematomas , which could have become apparent with a delay .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was diagnosed with tuberculosis .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he considered himself to have fully recovered , attributing that to his faith . From then on he refused all treatment , for religious reasons , and complained to various authorities that his diagnosis was false . The doctors however considered that the applicant remained ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ordered the applicant to be treated forcibly for tuberculosis , which was apparently undertaken .", "CARDINAL . NORP As discovered by a routine check in DATE and confirmed by control X - raying in DATE and DATE , the disease reappeared . The applicant however again refused from any treatment for religious reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission of ORG examined him and confirmed infiltrative tuberculosis of both lungs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred for specialised treatment to Kherson no . CARDINAL Prison , where he stayed till DATE , when his condition was found satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . According to his submissions to the ORG , he had contracted tuberculosis anew at some point because of being forced to share cells ( or wards ) with inmates who were ill .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been serving his sentence of life - term imprisonment in GPE no . CARDINAL Prison since DATE , with exception of the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The cells in which the applicant was held fell short of meeting basic hygienic standards being dirty , damp and poorly ventilated . The situation deteriorated even more after the prison authorities had stopped providing prisoners with chlorine powder in DATE . The applicant had to whitewash and paint his cell at his own expense once in an attempt to improve its sanitary condition .", "CARDINAL . The medical wing of the prison , which was situated on the ground floor and where the applicant was placed occasionally , was often flooded with sewage and its walls were covered in mould . While staying there , he had to share a ward with another inmate suffering from tuberculosis , while he considered himself to have recovered from that disease . The ward lacked proper ventilation . The medical staff were not well qualified and lacked compassion . No medical assistance was provided when it was required , but was imposed on prisoners who did not need it .", "CARDINAL . The nutrition was insufficient and inadequate , while the prices of food in the prison shop were unreasonably high and the administration either refused to accept parcels of food for the applicant from his mother or kept them for themselves . There was a practice of adding bromine to food , adversely affecting the prisoners ' cerebral cortex and sexual potency . While being treated for tuberculosis the applicant did not receive the required diet .", "CARDINAL . The cells for life prisoners underwent cosmetic repairs on the DATE basis . Prisoners of this category are never involved in any repairing of the cells , which is the job of other prisoners assigned to the maintenance service of the prison . Life prisoners are transferred to a different cell twice DATE . The cells in which they are held measure QUANTITY and QUANTITY . They have natural ventilation and double window frames with ventilation panes . An assigned staff member disinfects once a week the cells of life prisoners who are under follow - up medical monitoring after recovery from tuberculosis . The prison does not have any shortages of disinfection materials , and the chlorine powder is never issued to prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The prison medical unit is staffed with highly - qualified doctors and assistants of various areas of specialisation . Namely , its staff includes : the chief of the medical unit , a therapist , a tuberculotherapist , a dermatovenerologist , a radiologist , a dentist , CARDINAL medical assistants ( \u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0438 ) , a clinic laboratory assistant , an X - ray examination assistant , a pharmacist , and a disinfector . Some of the personnel are assigned qualification categories meaning that they have extensive work experience and positive theoretical and practical competence appraisals reaffirmed on a regular basis . Thus , the dermatovenerologist has the first qualification category , for which DATE experience is required ; the dentist and the clinic laboratory assistant have the highest qualification category assignable after DATE experience ; while the X - ray examination assistant and the pharmacist have the second qualification category ( DATE experience ) . The medical assistants are occasionally seconded to the GPE ambulance station with a view to improving their skills . Pursuant to the accreditation certificate issued by ORG on DATE , the medical unit has the right to carry out medical practice in the following areas : therapy , surgery , psychiatry , dermatovenereology , dentistry , radiology , phthisiology , and clinical laboratory diagnostics . The unit is fully equipped in compliance with applicable standards . Its premises , which are wet - cleaned and disinfected on a DATE basis , are of satisfactory sanitary condition . The applicant never shared a cell or ward with prisoners with an active form of tuberculosis .", "CARDINAL . NORP The food for prisoners is subjected to regular and strict control . A staff member of the medical unit and the deputy prison governor taste each meal after the cooking and certify its quality in a special logbook , that being a precondition for its distribution to prisoners . The food undergoes laboratory verification as regards its nutritional value and chemical composition twice a year . During the whole period of the applicant 's stay in the prison there was not a single case of any deterioration of prisoners ' health caused by inadequate quality of food . Prisoners with tuberculosis follow a special diet in the framework of the recurrence prevention programme twice a year . Thus , during the period from DATE to CARDINAL May , from DATE to DATE , and from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant received dietetic nutrition according to his medical condition and in compliance with the applicable regulations . The prices of food in the prison shop are within the limits set by ORG . In any event , the applicant never had any money on his prison account and never bought anything there .", "CARDINAL . The prison administration returned to the applicant 's mother the parcel of food she had sent , which was received on DATE , as it had been sent DATE following the previous one , while the applicant had only been entitled to CARDINAL parcels per year at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's mother complained about the conditions of his detention and insufficient nutrition to the prison governor , who , in his turn , had a conversation with the applicant . According to the prison governor , the applicant did not complain about anything .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the prison administration reviewed all his incoming and outgoing correspondence and did not dispatch any of his complaints to the authorities . It also delayed or reported lost some of his correspondence with his mother .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's mother complained to ORG of , inter alia , a failure of the prison authorities to dispatch the applicant 's letters to various authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG found her allegation unsubstantiated , referring to a number of letters successfully sent by the applicant to the prosecution and other authorities in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant 's mother complained to the ORG , on his behalf , about his alleged ill - treatment , health problems , conditions of detention , and alleged interferences of the prison administration with his correspondence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received the application form signed by the applicant 's mother . Enclosed to it there was a standard authority form distributed earlier by ORG , which had been completed by the applicant 's mother and signed both by her and the applicant and by which the latter authorised her to represent him in the proceedings before ORG . It did not state the date it had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received a letter from the applicant , in which he referred to the number of his case file and reiterated the earlier submitted complaints . It was sent by his mother and contained additional notes written by her in the margins .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's lawyer submitted to the ORG , inter alia , a copy of an informally worded letter of authority dated CARDINAL DATE , in which the applicant stated that he fully trusted his mother to represent his interests before any domestic or international authority , including ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code on Enforcement of Sentences ( DATE ) sets out rules governing the use of force in prisons . Prison officers are entitled to use force with a view to putting an end to physical resistance , violence , outrage ( \u0431\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) and opposition to lawful orders of the prison administration , or with a view to preventing prisoners from inflicting harm on themselves or on those around them . The use of force should be preceded by a warning if the circumstances so allow . If the use of force can not be avoided , it should not exceed the level necessary for fulfilment by the officers of their duties , should be carried out so as to inflict as little injury as possible and should be followed by immediate medical assistance if necessary . Any use of force must be immediately reported to the prison governor .", "CARDINAL . The above rules are reiterated in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( DATE ) . LAW of the ORG further specifies that prison officers are entitled to use force , including martial art techniques with a view to putting an end to wrongdoing by prisoners and overcoming their resistance to lawful orders of the administration when other means prove ineffective for the officers to be able to carry out their duties . The choice of a special measure to be used and its time and intensity depend on the circumstances , the nature of the wrongdoing and the personal characteristics of the perpetrator .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to LAW , prisoners suffering from contagious diseases who have not completed their medical treatment and refuse from it should be treated forcefully . A decision to that regard shall be taken by a court following a respective application from the prison administration .", "CARDINAL . Before it was amended on DATE , Article CARDINAL of the Code on Enforcement of Sentences allowed life prisoners to receive CARDINAL parcels ( packages ) per year . After the aforementioned date that restriction was lifted .", "CARDINAL . The relevant extracts from the ORG to ORG on the visit to GPE carried out by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) from DATE to DATE [ ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ] read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In its report on the DATE visit ... , the ORG stated that the treatment of prisoners serving life sentences was a major source of concern to ORG , and it made a whole series of recommendations with a view to improving their situation .", "The delegation 's on - the - spot observations in DATE in FAC no . CARDINAL ... confirmed that certain improvements have been made to material conditions and some aspects of the regime .", "CARDINAL . Material conditions of detention for these prisoners in FAC . CARDINAL ... were acceptable . The cells were clean , properly lit and ventilated , equipped with beds with full bedding , a table , a stool and toilets that were partitioned off . The cells measured CARDINAL to CARDINAL.CARDINAL m\u00b2 .

Cells measuring CARDINAL ORG could be considered acceptable for CARDINAL people , provided the prisoners are able to spend a reasonable part of DATE outside their cell . ...", "CARDINAL . The DATE visit confirmed that life - sentenced prisoners may now receive CARDINAL large parcels weighing QUANTITY DATE and CARDINAL small packets weighing QUANTITY each a year ; they may also buy supplies at the prison shop . It emerged , however , that the amount they could receive was much smaller than that which sentenced persons in the colonies could receive . In addition , for many of them , access to supplies from the prison shop was only theoretical since , because of lack of work , they did not earn any money . ...", "CARDINAL . In Prison No .

However , this implies that the penitentiary administration is in a position to respond adequately to prisoners ' fundamental needs ( food , clothing , medication , etc . ) . The fact is that this is not yet the case , since economic problems are preventing it from meeting prisoners ' basic needs .
