ORG observed that the article contained personal information about A. , such as his profession , age , first name , the initial of his family name and the place of his residence . ORG concluded that the article perfectly allowed for ORG \u2019s identification . Moreover , the article referred to A. as a person guilty of an offence , as opposed to a detainee or a suspect .", "In conclusion , it held that the article interfered with A. \u2019s right to be presumed innocent .", "CARDINAL . ORG acknowledged that the impugned article , as well as the follow - up piece ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , fell within the realm of reporting , the purpose of which was to inform the public on matters of public interest . However , in view of the course and outcome of the investigation against GPE , the reporting in the present case could not be considered \u201c socially desirable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Observing that the article \u201c had been published relatively widely \u201d , ORG held that , by definition , the dignity and public image of A. , who was known beyond his municipality mainly on account of his involvement in the association , had been diminished to an extent that called for monetary compensation .", "CARDINAL . The interference with ORG \u2019s personal integrity had been serious and gave rise to negative and still persisting consequences , in particular in his personal life and in relation to his public reputation .

The applicant company was accordingly ordered to publish an apology and PERSON was awarded the equivalent of some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and the reimbursement of his legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal ( odvolanie ) . It contended that ORG had failed to make clear what had constituted the interference with the rights of A. , the article in question or other articles about the same events which had been published in other papers ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As for the impugned article , it had only reported the information available to the law - enforcement authorities at the given time and , from the language and context , it was plain that PERSON was merely a suspect and that the proceedings were at the investigation stage only .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , it was not true that the article contained full details of A. \u2019s identity . In particular , only the profession , but not the employer , of ORG had been mentioned and , contrary to ORG observation , there had been no mention of where PERSON was from .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the published information had to be considered accurate , and had been published in an appropriate manner . This ruled out the alleged lack of justification in respect of the interference with the rights of A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , through the intermediary of a new lawyer , the applicant company made an additional submission in support of its appeal , arguing that ORG had misconceived the notion of the right to be presumed innocent , and that it in any event that right had not been interfered with .", "The applicant company had relied on the accuracy of information that it had obtained from an official source , namely , the law enforcement authorities . The publication of the article had not been unlawful but had been consonant with the applicant company \u2019s freedom of expression and the latter was consequently not liable for any damage suffered by A.", "The identification of A. had been a result of his arrest and searches of his house and the premises of his employer \u2013 factors which were outside the control of the applicant company and for which it accordingly bore no responsibility - rather than a result of the article and the information contained therein .", "Furthermore , in its judgment , the first - instance court had also referred to the follow - up article ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE above ) and had probably taken that article into account in making its decision , even though the follow - up piece had not been contested by the claimant .", "The ruling concerning damages and their amount was not supported by adequate and sufficient reasons and the amount of damages awarded was excessive .", "Moreover , in determining the amount of damages , no consideration had been given to the attenuating circumstance that the applicant company had taken precautions against the identification of A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) upheld the judgment in so far as the essence of the orders for an apology and payment of damages was concerned ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG corrected typographical errors in the apology to be published pursuant to the operative part of the judgment , which consisted of an incorrect figure concerning DATE and the fact that , contrary to the facts , the quotation of the relevant part of the article in the operative part of ORG judgment erroneously included a mention of the town A. was from ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG also shortened the text of the apology .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant company \u2019s submission of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which contained further grounds for its appeal , had been filed after the expiry of the statutory period for appealing ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) and that , therefore , it could not be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . ORG acknowledged that the article fell within the purview of a \u201c news - reporting licence \u201d and that , as such , it could be published without the consent of those concerned .", "ORG also acknowledged that the press was not only entitled to report on illicit activities , it was in fact also obliged to do so . If such reporting was based on official information from the law - enforcement authorities , and if that information was reported accurately , the media could not be required to verify the veracity of such information independently .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company had therefore been entitled to report on everything contained in the charge sheet against ORG However , the article suggested more .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the article suggested that ORG had been involved in arranging for the booby trap to be planted by the house of a judicial enforcement officer while the charge sheet had only accused him of having assembled a component constituting such a device . Similarly , the charge sheet contained no mention that any arms had been found in GPE \u2019s illegal possession . The description of the actions imputed to A. was therefore distorted .", "CARDINAL . As for the personal details about A. contained in the article , in correlation with those contained therein about B. , they did enable PERSON to be identified unequivocally and had therefore interfered with A. \u2019s constitutional right to the protection of his name .", "CARDINAL . NORP The combination of the elements mentioned in the preceding CARDINAL paragraphs also constituted a violation of A. \u2019s right to the preservation of his human dignity , personal honour and good reputation .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the negative repercussions that the article had had on ORG \u2019s life , as established by the first - instance court , ORG also observed that , as a consequence of the article , A. had been prevented from carrying out his job for some time .", "CARDINAL . The loss that ORG had suffered by being prevented from carrying out his job and in the area of his political ambitions was not sufficiently compensated by an apology and called for financial compensation , the amount of which , as reduced by the first - instance court in relation to the claim , reflected the fact that these consequences were due not only to the article in question but also to other articles on the same topic in other media ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG made no express pronouncement in respect of the right of A. to be presumed innocent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) , relying on Articles CARDINAL ( f ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraphs DATE in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company objected mainly that ORG had unilaterally corrected the operative part of the first instance judgment without the claimant having requested it , while that correction had benefited the claimant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company also argued that ORG had substantially changed the legal reasoning of the first - instance court , that the defendant had only learned of the change from ORG judgment and that it had accordingly had no possibility to contest the new reasoning .", "In particular , the central reason behind the first - instance court \u2019s judgment had been the alleged interference with ORG \u2019s right to be presumed innocent , a conclusion that had not been endorsed by ORG . The latter on its part had considered it decisive that the article had been factually inaccurate in part .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company contended specifically that the above mentioned objections were not merely formalistic but had direct implications for the evidence taking and assessment in respect of the causal link between the alleged unlawful interference and the occurrence and extent of the alleged non pecuniary damage .", "In other words , as it transpired from the oral evidence taken , what was crucial for the witnesses\u2019 perception of A. was the very fact that he had been charged with a criminal offence and not the offence itself and its details . The question of the relevance of the inaccuracy of the reported information to the occurrence and extent of the non - pecuniary damage had not been examined at all .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a private session ( bez pojedn\u00e1vania ) , ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) rejected the appeal on points of law without examining the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . In the decision , ORG noted that \u201c [ CARDINAL claimant [ had ] requested that the defendant \u2019s appeal on points of law be dismissed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that although ORG had not endorsed the conclusion of the first - instance court concerning the violation of A. \u2019s right to be presumed innocent ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it had not rejected it either .", "ORG conclusion concerning the distortion of facts by the applicant company did not amount to a new and different legal assessment of the case but rather was a clarification and precision as to the nature , form and circumstances of the interference with ORG \u2019s personal integrity .", "The applicant company had thus not been prevented from acting before the courts within the meaning of LAW ( f ) of the ORG and its appeal was not admissible on the ground envisaged by that provision .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG correction of typographical errors in the first - instance judgment did not amount to a \u201c modification \u201d of that judgment within the meaning of LAW ORG , which was why the appeal was not admissible under that Article either .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the appeal was not admissible on any of the statutory admissibility grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company challenged the decisions of DATE and DATE in ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) by way of a complaint under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL in the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . In substance , it relied on its rights to a fair trial and to freedom of expression ( to impart information ) , repeating its previous arguments and disputing the ORG conclusions .", "CARDINAL . In addition , on page CARDINAL of the complaint , the applicant company argued that , in violation of the equality - of - arms principle , ORG had obtained and taken into account the observations of the claimant in reply to its cassation appeal ( see paragraph DATE above ) without giving the applicant company an opportunity to acquaint itself with those observations and to comment on them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible , having found no constitutionally relevant unlawfulness or arbitrariness imputable to ORG .", "Moreover , the decision of ORG could not be reviewed by ORG as it had been taken outside the statutory DATE time - limit for bringing a constitutional complaint .", "In reaching these conclusions , ORG took no notice of , and gave no response to , the applicant company \u2019s argument concerning the claimant \u2019s observations in reply to its appeal on points of law ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "The decision was served on the applicant company \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
