On DATE an extraordinary general conference of the applicant elected its management bodies . In particular , Mr GPE was elected chairman of ORG and PERSON chairman of ORG . In accordance with the articles of association they became ex officio representatives of the party . The general conference also decided to change the party \u2019s address and to create several regional branches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to amend the information contained in ORG . In particular , it asked that its new address and the names of its ex officio representatives be entered in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to make the amendments because the party had not submitted documents showing that the general conference had been held in accordance with the law and with its articles of association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant re - submitted its request . It produced the minutes of the conferences of its regional branches at which delegates to the general conference had been nominated , the list of the delegates and the minutes of the general conference .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused for the second time to register the amendments . It found that the applicant had not submitted documents confirming the number of its members . Moreover , TIME of the GPE , GPE and GPE regional conferences did not include the lists of participants . TIME NORP regional conferences were flawed because they indicated that those conferences had been convened at the initiative of the GPE regional branch . The PERSON regional conference had not actually been held . Some of the participants at the general conference were not members of the party or had not been elected delegates . Due to those and other omissions it was not possible to establish whether the regional conferences had been quorate and whether the general conference had been legitimate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the refusal before a court . It argued that it was not required to submit documents confirming the number of its members . In any event , that information was already in the ORG \u2019s possession because the party had submitted it in its DATE activity report in DATE . ORG was not empowered to verify whether the general conference and the regional conferences were legitimate . Domestic law required that such verification be conducted only before the registration of a new party or of amendments to the articles of association , which was not the case of the applicant . In any event , the general conference had been convened in accordance with domestic law and the articles of association . It had brought together CARDINAL delegates from CARDINAL regional branches . The delegates had been nominated at regional conferences held in compliance with the party \u2019s internal rules . The law did not require the TIME of regional conferences to contain the list of participants . TIME had indicated the total number of the members of the regional branches and the number of participants at the conferences . That information had been sufficient to establish that the conferences had been quorate . The applicant conceded that TIME and NORP regional conferences contained typing errors , which , however , did not affect the outcome of the voting . ORG finding that the PERSON regional conference had never been held had been refuted by the documents . The finding that some of the participants at the general conference had not been members of the party or had not been elected delegates was not supported by any documentary evidence . The applicant lastly submitted that officials of the regional departments of ORG who had attended some of the regional conferences had not noted any breaches of the substantive or procedural rules . The applicant claimed that the refusal to amend the ORG violated its freedom of association and hindered its activities . In particular , ORG had refused to register CARDINAL regional branches precisely because the ORG did not contain the names of the applicant \u2019s ex officio representatives .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of Justice maintained that the decision of DATE had been lawful . ORG was not only entitled , but had a legal obligation to verify the information submitted by the applicant . The verification had revealed that the documents produced by the applicant had not met the legal requirements . In particular , the TIME of the regional conferences did not all contain the list of participants . CARDINAL regional conferences had been inquorate . The applicant had never submitted any information about its local branches and it was therefore not clear who had nominated delegates for the regional conferences and whose interests they had represented . TIME NORP regional conferences indicated that the conferences had been convened at the initiative of the GPE regional branch . Due to those omissions it had not been possible to establish whether the delegates to the general conference had been duly nominated . Moreover , the decision to convene the general conference had been taken on DATE , while some of the regional conferences had taken place in DATE . As the general conference had been convened in breach of the procedural rules , it had been illegitimate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the decision of DATE . It held that , under sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of LAW , ORG had been empowered to verify the information and documents submitted by the applicant before registering any amendments to the ORG . ORG had found that the documents submitted did not meet the requirements established by law . The court had no reason to doubt its findings because they were corroborated by the case materials and had not been refuted by the applicant . The court held that the decision of DATE had been lawful and had not violated the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its appeal submissions the applicant claimed , in particular , that ORG requirement to submit the same documents as for the initial registration of a party or the registration of amendments to its articles of association had no basis in domestic law . Under LAW amendments concerning a party \u2019s address or the names of its ex officio representatives were to be registered on the basis of a written notification to the registration authority . The applicant also argued that ORG had no authority to verify the legitimacy of its general conference . It insisted that the general conference had been held in conformity with its articles of association and with domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . It referred to section QUANTITY of LAW and held as follows :", "\u201c ...

The court further found that ORG had not submitted any evidence in support of their conclusions that ORG , LOC and GPE regional branches had CARDINAL members , therefore the court accepted the number of members suggested by the applicant . The court also accepted that the party had several unregistered branches . However , their members could not be taken into account for establishing the total number of party members . The court concluded that on DATE the applicant had CARDINAL members , and CARDINAL regional branches with CARDINAL members .

It submitted that the ORG \u2019s submissions had not been supported by any documents .

The first - instance court had refused to admit evidence submitted by the applicant , namely individual applications for membership and other documents confirming the number of party members . The court had not taken into account CARDINAL members living in the regions where the branches were not registered , although they had been admitted to the party at the federal level and were members of the party itself and not members of its unregistered regional branches . ORG had conducted an inspection in DATE ; it had never verified the number of the applicant \u2019s members as at DATE .

The court had taken into account the number of the party \u2019s members as at DATE . Individual applications submitted by the party after that date could not be taken into account because they could have been written after DATE and backdated .

Such structuring of the political scene is aimed at preventing the division of the political forces and the emergence of numerous artificial small parties ( especially during electoral campaigns ) created for a short duration and therefore incapable of fulfilling their mission ... in the country \u2019s political system .", "CARDINAL . ... In the contemporary conditions where NORP society has not yet acquired solid experience of democratic existence and is faced with serious challenges from separatist , nationalist and terrorist forces , the creation of regional political parties \u2013 which would inevitably be interested in vindicating mainly their own purely regional or local interests \u2013 might result in a breach of the territorial integrity and unity of the political system and undermine the federative structure of the country .", "The legal line between regional political parties and political parties based in fact on ethnic or religious affiliation would be blurred .

Although it provides for a multiparty system and guarantees the right to freedom of association in political parties and the freedom of their activities , LAW does not set any requirements concerning the number of parties , or any membership requirements .

In other words , the lawmaker must be guided by the criteria of reasonable sufficiency ensuing from the principle of proportionality .", "When deciding on the minimum membership and the territorial scale of the activities of political parties the lawmaker has a wide discretion , taking into account that this issue is to a considerable degree based on political expediency . This follows from the fact that there exist different solutions to the issue in the legislation of other countries ( the minimum membership requirement for political parties is considerably higher or lower than that contained in section CARDINAL of [ LAW ] ) ...", "Defining the minimum - membership requirement for political parties in [ LAW ] , the lawmaker apparently proceeded from the necessity for a political party to have considerable support in society . Such support is required to fulfil the main mission of a political party in a NORP society , namely forming and articulating the political will of the people .

Countries applying registration procedures to political parties should refrain from imposing excessive requirements for territorial representation of political parties as well as for minimum membership .

Registration of political parties", "CARDINAL . The already mentioned study on the establishment , organisation and activities of political parties conducted in DATE by ORG on ORG has shown that many countries view registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party , for participation in general elections or for public financing . This practice \u2013 as ORG has stated before in its LAW even if it were regarded as a restriction of the right to freedom of association and freedom of expression , would not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . The requirements for registration , however , differ from CARDINAL country to another . Registration may be considered as a measure to inform the authorities about the establishment of the party as well as about its intention to participate in elections and , as a consequence , benefit from advantages given to political parties as a specific type of association . Far - reaching requirements , however , can raise the threshold for registration to an unreasonable level , which may be inconsistent with the Convention . Any provisions in relation to registration must be such as are necessary in a NORP society and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved by the measures in question .", "b. Activity requirements for political parties and their control and supervision", "CARDINAL . Similar caution must be applied when it comes to activity requirements for political parties as a prerequisite for maintaining their status as a political party and their control and supervision . Far - reaching autonomy of political parties is a cornerstone of the freedoms of assembly and association and the freedom of expression as protected by LAW . As ORG has stated , the LAW requires that interference with the exercise of these rights must be assessed by the yardstick of what is \u2018 necessary in a democratic FAC . The only type of necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of those rights is , therefore , one which may claim to DATE from \u2018 democratic society\u2019 . In particular , control over the statute or charter of a party should be primarily internal , i.e. should be exercised by the members of the party . As regards external control , the members of a party should have access to a court in case they consider that a decision of a party organ violates its statute . In general , judicial control over the parties should be preferred over executive control .", "CARDINAL . Another important aspect is that of equal treatment of parties by public authorities . In the case of registration procedure ( if it is foreseen by national legislation ) the ORG should proceed carefully in order to avoid any possible discrimination of political forces which might be considered as representing an opposition to the ruling party . In any case , clear and simple procedures should exist to challenge any decision and/or act of any registration authority in a court of law .", "...", "d.

Parties on local and regional levels", "CARDINAL . Member states should not restrict the right of association in a political party to the national level . There should be a possibility to create parties on regional and local levels since some groups of citizens might want to associate in groups limiting their action to local and regional levels and to local and regional elections . However , certain new democracies consider such extensive approach to the freedom of association premature in the light of their effort to preserve the unity of the ORG . Such concern can be understood , but before any restrictions are imposed , the principle of proportionality and the yardstick of what is \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 should be considered thoroughly . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

They are thus a specific kind of association , which in many countries is submitted to registration for participation in elections or for public financing .
