The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE , apart from FAC PERSON , who lives in GPE , GPE . Before her death in DATE , PERSON Hampartsum PERSON lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Ancestors of the applicants owned a plot of land measuring QUANTITY in the old part of GPE , which had a QUANTITY house built on QUANTITY of it . In DATE the building was declared a cultural monument . In DATE the property was expropriated and the ORG ancestors received compensation . After that , the building was the subject of substantial renovation work , in particular after a fire destroyed part of it in DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the adoption of ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , some of the applicants and other heirs of the original owners ( from whom the remaining applicants succeeded in the course of the domestic proceedings ) applied for the revocation of the expropriation . On DATE they were informed that their application had been refused by the mayor of GPE municipality , and on DATE they applied for judicial review of that refusal . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the administrative decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in a final judgment of DATE ORG reversed . It found that the applicants\u2019 property had been taken under legislation regulating expropriations made with a view to carrying out public works , namely expropriations intended to be followed by the construction of new buildings or infrastructure . The property in issue , however , had been declared a cultural monument , and had been expropriated to be used as such , thus the expropriation had been in breach of the law . The fact that no construction work had ever been envisaged had to be assimilated to a situation where no public works within the meaning of LAW had ever been commenced . In addition , the renovation work carried out after the expropriation did not represent \u201c public works \u201d either , as it had only aimed to preserve the building . Lastly , it was noted that the property still existed . All of those factors meant that the preconditions for restitution had been fulfilled . On this basis , ORG revoked the expropriation , quashing the mayor \u2019s refusal in that regard .", "CARDINAL . Following the above judgment , in order to make the restitution effective ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on CARDINAL DATE the applicants paid back to the municipality the monetary compensation received by their ancestors at the time of the expropriation . The parties disagreed as to whether the applicants had also received compensation in the form of other property at the time of the expropriation , and whether they had to return that as well .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants obtained a notarial deed , which named them as the property \u2019s owners .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite the events described above , the applicants could not take possession of the property , because it was being held and used by the GPE municipality , which in DATE had declared it a public municipal property and had rented a room in the building to an organisation called \u201c CARDINAL Centuries Bulgaria \u201d ORG ( \u201c the Fund \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate an agreement , in DATE the applicants brought rei vindicatio proceedings against the GPE municipality and the ORG . The action was dismissed by a final judgment of ORG DATE . In the first place , the domestic courts found that they were competent to examine the action . According to the second - instance ORG , the judgment of DATE was open to indirect judicial review , because it was replacing the mayor \u2019s administrative decision on the ORG request for restitution , and did not have a res judicata effect in proceedings specifically concerning the right to property . According to ORG , the defendants to the rei vindicatio action , namely the GPE municipality and ORG , had not participated in the earlier judicial proceedings and therefore were not bound by the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Next , the domestic courts found that the reparation work carried out on the building which the applicants were claiming had been so substantial ( the building \u2019s appearance had been preserved , but the internal construction had been largely modified \u2013 the roof , some windows and other elements had also been replaced ) that , within the meaning of LAW , it could not be said that the building still existed . In addition , the property was being used for the purpose for which it had been expropriated , namely as \u201c a cultural monument \u201d , which , in the courts\u2019 view , constituted \u201c public works \u201d within the meaning of the same LAW . Accordingly , none of the preconditions for restitution had been satisfied ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
