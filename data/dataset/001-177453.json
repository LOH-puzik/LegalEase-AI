NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a barrister at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant qualified as a solicitor on DATE . He joined the firm ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in DATE . At that time ORG was a limited liability partnership with CARDINAL members , namely ORG , the managing partner , and a private company called ORG ( \u201c WBLTL \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant became a salaried partner of ORG and a director of ORG .", "CARDINAL . After he became a salaried partner of ORG and a director of ORG the applicant became aware that ORG was defrauding clients and reported him to ORG ( \u201c SRA \u201d ) . PERSON resigned from ORG and ORG in DATE and was later struck off the roll of solicitors .", "CARDINAL . Following PERSON \u2019s resignation , the applicant continued to practice through ORG . As CARDINAL years\u2019 post - qualification experience was required before a solicitor could supervise a practice alone , another solicitor , ORG , became a member of ORG and a director of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP WBL remained in financial difficulty and was purportedly closed on DATE . On DATE WBLTL , which was already authorised by the ORG to trade as a solicitor \u2019s practice , was renamed PERSON ( \u201c CGL \u201d ) . Thereafter the applicant and PERSON practised through ORG , taking some of the client files of ORG with them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was placed into administration by CARDINAL of its creditors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicant reminding him that he and PW were responsible for the files , documents , and client money of ORG . In that letter it stated that it was satisfied , in light of assurances previously given by the applicant , that he and ORG had attended to the closure of ORG correctly , but warned that the matter could be reinvestigated in future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE resigned from ORG as the applicant , having achieved CARDINAL PERSON post qualification experience , was qualified to supervise the practice alone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that information received from ORG \u2019s administrators suggested that the closure of the firm had not been dealt with in accordance with its regulatory requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE members of the ORG \u2019s ORG visited the offices of ORG to assess that firm \u2019s compliance with the Solicitors\u2019 Account Rules ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) , LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) and other issued codes and guidance . The resulting report dated DATE was sent to the applicant . It identified a number of breaches and requested confirmation that these would be rectified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s ORG commenced an investigation into ORG . On DATE a ORG ( \u201c the Report \u201d ) concluded , inter alia , that ORG appeared to be the successor practice to ORG ; that the administrators of ORG had complained that the applicant had not been helpful in effecting the administration of the firm ; that the administrators had received a number of enquiries and complaints from former clients of ORG ; and that the client account of ORG appeared to have a shortfall of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG formed the basis of a case - note submitted to the ORG \u2019s ORG . The case - note identified a number of breaches of the Rules and the LAW in respect of ORG and recommended that the ORG exercise its powers of intervention in respect of ORG and any other firm or recognised body of which the applicant or PW were members , directors , managers or owners in order to protect the interests of the clients and former clients of ORG . The case - note indicated that due to the urgency of the matter no explanation had been sought from the applicant or GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG resolved to exercise its powers in accordance with the recommendations made in the case - note . As a result the accounts of both ORG and ORG were frozen and the applicant \u2019s practising certificate was automatically suspended , leaving him unable to practise . Control of ORG passed to a nominated agent appointed by the ORG to manage the firm . The case was referred to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was notified of the intervention by fax on DATE . The notice indicated the terms of the ORG \u2019s resolution but the applicant was not provided with a copy of the ORG or the case - note . In the course of a telephone call with the ORG on DATE and a meeting on DATE the applicant was informed that under paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to the Solicitors\u2019 Act CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) he was entitled to apply to ORG within DATE of the service of the notice for an order directing its withdrawal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG disclosed the ORG to the applicant and requested his explanation of the issues identified within it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently applied to the ORG for his practising certificate to be reinstated . On DATE it was restored subject to a number of restrictive conditions . However , ORG remained under the control of the ORG \u2019s nominated agents and was eventually placed into administration on DATE . The applicant was unable to obtain alternative employment as a solicitor due to the outstanding disciplinary proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The professional disciplinary proceedings against the applicant came before the Tribunal on DATE . The ORG found that there had been breaches of the LAW and the LAW in respect of both ORG and ORG but it did not find that the applicant had been dishonest or reckless . It ordered that the applicant be suspended from practice as a solicitor for DATE on DATE and recommended to the ORG that following the end of the suspension period he should only practise in approved employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had issued a claim for damages against the ORG in ORG under LAW DATE ( \u201c HRA DATE \u201d ) . In respect of the applicant \u2019s Convention rights , the particulars of claim asserted that his LAW rights had been breached by the provision of the DATE limitation period , which precluded effective access to the courts ; that as a consequence , he had been deprived of his property rights in ORG , in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL ; and that he was entitled to damages for the loss of an opportunity to challenge the intervention . He further complained that the intervention had been contrary to LAW of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the claims concerning LAW DATE were struck out by consent . This left a single issue for determination by ORG ; namely , whether the DATE time - limit contained in paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to the Solicitors Act DATE was incompatible with the applicant \u2019s human rights .", "CARDINAL . The ORG applied to strike out the applicant \u2019s claim and/or for summary judgment to be entered in its favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for permission to amend his particulars of claim to assert , inter alia , that there had been a breach of the principle of natural justice , a breach of the rule of law and misfeasance in public office . He also sought to reintroduce a claim for breach of statutory duty . In respect of his Convention complaints , the amended particulars of claim averred that even if the intervention regime was in general compatible with the HRA DATE , the manner in which it was operated by the SRA \u2013 and in particular the process which led to the decision to intervene in ORG \u2013 had breached his Convention rights on the specific facts of his case .", "CARDINAL . Both applications came before Mrs Justice Sharp on DATE . She identified CARDINAL reasons why the claim in relation to the statutory timelimit was hopeless and doomed to failure . First of all , the domestic courts had established that the statutory scheme for intervention was compatible with FAC see , for example , the decision of ORG in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , PERSON v. the Law Society [ DATE ] EWCA ( Civ ) DATE and PERSON The Law Society [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( QB ) ) . Secondly , as the DATE time - limit was prescribed by statute and not by ORG , the ORG could not be held liable for damages or for any breaches of the applicant \u2019s human rights that might result from it . Thirdly , the applicant \u2019s claim was academic since he had not sought to challenge the intervention within any other period which he himself considered reasonable but instead had waited DATE before bringing a claim by a different and inappropriate procedure ( the claim under the HRA DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that all other matters complained of were matters which \u201c could and should have been dealt with by a challenge to the intervention via the statutory procedure and within the time - limit laid down by ORG ( and in the course of which disclosure would have been provided of the documents PERSON has since been given or asked for ) \u201d . As such , his claim was \u201c a collateral challenge to the intervention process by other means \u201d and an attempt \u201c to circumvent the statutory limitation on the right of challenge \u201d . It was not open to the applicant to do this and , in the circumstances , his attempt to do so was an abuse of the process .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the judge noted that the applicant had been well aware of the DATE time - limit , and there was \u201c no evidence at all \u201d that he had lacked sufficient resources to challenge the intervention when all that would have been required in the first instance was the court fee to issue a claim . Had he been genuinely unable to pay the fee it would have been open to him to apply to the ORG \u2019s nominated agent for the release of some of ORG \u2019s frozen practice money to use for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the application to amend the grounds of appeal , the judge found that the claim for breach of statutory duty was misconceived ; the common law principles of natural justice did not apply to the intervention process and , in any case , any procedural unfairness in the process leading to the intervention could have been raised in a statutory challenge to the intervention ; the newly advanced claim for breaches of his human rights was only notified to the ORG in DATE , and the limitation period for bringing such a claim had been DATE from the date of the alleged breach ; a \u201c breach of the rule of law \u201d was not a pleading known to LANGUAGE law , but insofar as he was claiming that ORG acted ultra vires , such a challenge could have been made under the statutory procedure ; and finally , the claim for misfeasance in public office was not maintainable in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Having found that the applicant \u2019s claim had no real prospect of success , the judge refused the application for permission to amend the particulars of claim and ordered summary judgment to be entered in favour of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for permission to appeal the judge \u2019s order on the ground that it was arguable that at least in exceptional cases a challenge to an intervention could be brought outside the DATE time - limit , and the present case was exceptional on account of his impecuniosity and the fact that he had not been provided with reasons for the intervention until DATE . Permission was refused on the papers . The application was then renewed orally before ORG on DATE but permission to appeal was again refused .", "CARDINAL . In refusing permission to appeal , ORG found that even if it were to assume that the DATE time limit could be read down to allow for out - of - time applications in exceptional cases , this was not an exceptional case . First , impecuniosity was not a justifiable basis for not having brought a statutory challenge in time . The proceedings in the present case were not especially complex and the applicant was a solicitor who should have been well able to deal with the allegations against him . It was therefore not arguably necessary that he should have been provided with legal assistance . Secondly , although it was \u201c difficult to understand \u201d why the ORG and the case - note had not been disclosed to the applicant prior to the expiry of the DATE time limit , and there was some merit in the contention that it may have been difficult for him to have pursued proceedings without the ORG , on the facts of the case the court did not consider this to be a ground for reading down the DATE time limit . In particular , it noted that the basis of the applicant \u2019s complaint was essentially that he had acted in good faith and co - operated with the authorities in relation to the wind - up of ORG , and those were matters which had been known to him when he received the original notice of intervention . Furthermore , even if some departure from DATE period was justified by reference to Convention principles , it had plainly been critical for the applicant to have acted very speedily thereafter . However , while he did take steps to get himself put back on to the register so that he could practice as a solicitor , he had taken no steps in relation to the intervention for DATE . There was no reasonable prospect for saying that the time - limit should be read down so as to allow a challenge so long after the expiry of that period .", "CARDINAL . The Law Society is the governing body of the solicitors\u2019 profession . It has a regulatory function and regulatory powers under LAW CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which it exercises through the ORG . Under section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG is given the power to intervene in a solicitor \u2019s practice in circumstances specified in Part I of Schedule CARDINAL to LAW by exercising any or all of the powers set out in Part II of Schedule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Part I to Schedule CARDINAL provides that ORG may exercise its right of intervention where , inter alia , it has reason to suspect dishonesty on the part of a solicitor in connection with that solicitor \u2019s practice or in connection with any trust of which that solicitor is or formerly was a trustee ; where it is satisfied that a solicitor has failed to comply with rules as to professional practice , conduct and discipline ; and where it is satisfied that it is necessary to protect the interests of clients ( or former or potential clients ) of the solicitor or his firm .", "CARDINAL . Part II of Schedule CARDINAL sets out the powers available to ORG upon intervention . Under paragraph CARDINAL , ORG has the power to take control of the practice \u2019s accounts .", "CARDINAL . Finally , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides for the suspension of the solicitor \u2019s practising certificate in the event of an intervention .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act allows an intervened - upon solicitor to apply to ORG to request the withdrawal of an intervention . Under paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL , a decision to take possession of the practice monies can be challenged within DATE of the service of the notice by application to ORG for an order directing ORG to withdraw the notice , with not less than QUANTITY notice to ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that upon an application under paragraph CARDINAL ) ORG may make such an order as it thinks fit .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the HRA DATE requires , so far as possible , that primary legislation and subordinate legislation be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with Convention rights .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the HRA DATE further provides that a person who claims to be a victim of an unlawful act by a public authority may either bring proceedings against the authority under that Act in the appropriate court or tribunal , or rely on the Convention rights concerned in any legal proceedings . Subject to any rule imposing a stricter time limit in relation to the procedure in question , proceedings brought under the HRA DATE should be brought within DATE beginning with the date on which the act complained of took place , or such longer period as the court or tribunal considers equitable having regard to all the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , a solicitor may , at any time before the expiry of his practising certificate , apply to ORG to have the suspension of the certificate terminated . Under LAW ) , upon receipt of an application ORG may terminate the suspension either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as it may think fit .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG refuses the application or terminates the suspension subject to conditions , the solicitor may appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In LAW Society [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ORG accepted that an intervention under LAW gave rise to an interference with a solicitor \u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions DATE . CARDINAL to the Convention . However , having regard to issues of proportionality and the margin of appreciation it concluded that both the legislation itself and the approach taken by ORG had struck the fair balance required by LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Sir PERSON , who agreed with the leading judgment of Lord Justice Carnwath , observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the exercise of its powers of intervention ORG must of course comply with LAW . I can imagine circumstances where ORG might be found not to have complied with the LAW , or with LAW DATE . After all , a solicitor whose practice is the object of an intervention loses his practising certificate , and in all probability his livelihood as well . The provisions for bringing an intervention to an end are very unlikely to restore the solicitor \u2019s goodwill and his prosperity . If it comes about that the intervention was mistaken or unjustified , there is a risk that the solicitor will suffer a substantial loss without recourse to any remedy . In practice this may never happen ; but it is a cause for concern . However , not in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL , [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL PERSON , at the end of his leading judgment , made further obiter comments regarding the summary process for bringing a statutory challenge to an intervention and its compliance with claimants\u2019 Convention rights of in light of the decision in Holder :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... In Holder v Law Society [ DATE ] EWCA Civ DATE , [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , this ORG DATE and rejected \u2013 an argument that the procedure for which ORG had made provision was incompatible with the solicitor \u2019s Convention rights . It rejected that argument ( inter alia ) on the basis that the court \u2019s power to consider whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the protection of the individual \u2019s fundamental rights met the requirements of LAW . But it is clear that , unless the matter can be determined by the court within a short time of the intervention , the solicitor is likely to be denied an effective remedy . That is because the consequences of intervention \u2013 if the intervention continues for more than a short time \u2013 are likely to be irreversible . The solicitor \u2019s clients will have to take their affairs elsewhere ; the staff will have found other employment ; and the practice will be destroyed in any event .", "CARDINAL . There is an obvious tension between the need to have an application to the court determined speedily and the need for the court to give full and fair consideration to the task which it has been set under LAW and , now , LAW DATE . This case illustrates the need for the Society to give thought as to how that tension can be resolved ...", "CARDINAL ... The ORG should , I think , give thought to the need for Panel resolutions to identify , with much more specificity than in this case , the reasons which ( in the Panel \u2019s view ) make intervention necessary . If those reasons are not identified at an early stage , there is a danger that the solicitor will be denied the effective protection which ORG plainly intended a summary process to provide .", "CARDINAL . There will , of course , be many cases in which the solicitor who has suffered intervention will be in no doubt as to the ORG \u2019s concerns . And , as I have said , there will be cases where the solicitor wishes to challenge the validity of the resolution on public law grounds . But , in cases where , although the solicitor knows what material was before the Panel , there is genuine doubt as to the matters which the ORG regards as sufficiently serious to justify intervention , it seems to me that the court should be ready to assist DATE on an early application for directions following the issue of an application under the schedule CARDINAL procedure \u2013 by requiring the ORG to state the grounds upon which ( on the material then known to it ) the application will be resisted . Such a statement would enable the solicitor to address the ORG \u2019s concerns in a focused response . And , in the light of that response , the ORG can explain to the court why it takes the view ( if it does ) that the concerns have not been met .", "CARDINAL . I appreciate that the process suggested in the previous paragraph may require the court to adopt a more pro - active role on applications under schedule CARDINAL to LAW than hitherto ; and that the need for an early determination of such applications will place demands on the court \u2019s resources which it may be difficult to meet . But , as it seems to me , the court will be ready to meet those demands in order to ensure that the solicitor does obtain the effective protection which the LAW requires and which LAW was plainly intended to provide . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
