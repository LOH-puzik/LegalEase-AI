On DATE the applicant and his wife purchased by notarial deed a dwelling house built on land in the municipality of GPE , in the d\u00e9partement of GPE . The house had been built on a dyke that overlapped with land on the seashore falling within the category of maritime public property .", "CARDINAL . It can be seen from the various documents relating to the house that , by a decision of DATE , the prefect of ORG had authorised Mr A. , in consideration of payment of a charge , to \u201c retain on maritime public property in the cove of ORG , in the municipality of GPE , a dyke ... on which stands a dwelling house \u201d . The house had allegedly been built prior to that decision despite a decision of the prefect of CARDINAL DATE refusing an application for a building permit . The decision of CARDINAL specified that \u201c the existence of this dyke and dwelling house on maritime public property was recorded in DATE ... and the permittee undertakes to pay the charge from DATE \u201d . It also pointed out that the dyke , irregularly shaped and of a surface area of QUANTITY . m , on which stood the dwelling house measuring MONEY by QUANTITY , \u201c can not interfere in any way with navigation rights or maritime coastal traffic on condition that steps are built at DATE of the dyke in order to facilitate public access \u201d and that the authorities \u201c reserved the right to modify or withdraw the authorisation without the permittee thereby acquiring any right to claim compensation or damages in that regard . He must , if required , restore the site to its original state \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Prior to that , on DATE , ORG had written to the prefect in the following terms :", "\u201c ... Having regard to PERSON genuine lack of means , as a former seaman who has reached an advanced age and can not possibly pay the normal charge , and considering , furthermore , that it would be a drastic measure to order the demolition of the little house that he has built on land reclaimed from the sea and uses as a dwelling house , I have decided to impose the minimum charge thus reflecting the precariousness of the occupancy and preventing the rights of the ORG from becoming time - barred .", "In the circumstances I consider ... that there is now no further obstacle to disposing of this case by issuing a concession order , but on PERSON death , his heirs should be served with notice either to purchase the usurped land or to pay the charge at the rate applicable for private occupancy of maritime public property . \u201d", "\u201c Title and entry into possession : the purchasers shall hereby acquire title to the land and the little house of ORG from DATE \u2019s date .

CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE on the development , protection and enhancement of coastal areas ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , and in particular section CARDINAL thereof , no longer allowed him to renew authorisation on the previous terms and conditions . LAW provided that decisions regarding the use of maritime public property had to take account of the vocation of the zones in question , which ruled out any private use including dwelling houses . However , in order to take account of the length of occupancy and the applicant \u2019s sentimental attachment to the house in question , he proposed to enter into an agreement with the applicant that would authorise limited and strictly personal use and prohibit him from transferring or selling the land and house and from carrying out any work on the property other than maintenance and would include an option for the ORG , on the expiry of the authorisation , to have the property restored to its original condition or to reuse the buildings .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the applicant and his wife rejected the prefect \u2019s offer and requested a concession to build a dyke that would be valid as a transfer of ownership under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prefect of ORG gave a decision , based on section CARDINAL of LAW , in which he considered that there was no public interest justifying the concession requested .

On DATE the applicant and his wife applied to ORG for the prefect \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to be set aside . In support of their application , they submitted that the refusal to grant them a concession to build a dyke was unlawful .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prefect of GPE lodged an application with ORG citing the applicant and his wife as defendants in respect of an offence of unlawful interference with the highway as they continued to unlawfully occupy public property . He sought an order against them to pay a fine and restore the foreshore to its original state prior to construction of the house and to restore the dyke on which it stood , within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG served notice on the applicant to pay the sums due for DATE for unauthorised occupancy of public property , namely , a total of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) was dismissed on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... In support of their argument that the stretch of land on which the dwelling house stands belongs to the category of maritime private property the applicants have exhibited in the proceedings a decision authorising the temporary occupancy of maritime public property dating back to DATE . However , this decision merely takes note that the land in question has been drained and does not certify the lawfulness thereof . Accordingly , it does not call into question the classification of the land as public property .", "In accordance with LAW of LAW , \u2018 the ORG may concede , on conditions it shall determine ... the right to build a ORG . While section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW DATE [ LAW ] has reduced the scope of application of that Article , it does nonetheless specify that \u2018 land draining carried out prior to the present Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation\u2019 . Accordingly , the only provisions applicable to the present case are LAW of the above - mentioned LAW and ORG of DATE , which provides that ... \u2018 subject to any contrary provisions of deeds of concession , land artificially removed from the action of the tide shall be incorporated into the category of maritime public property\u2019 . In rejecting the request on the basis of the principles and guidelines laid down in the inter - ministerial circular of CARDINAL DATE setting out the policy to be followed for the use of maritime public property , the prefect DATE when examining the applicant \u2019s particular situation involving an application for a concession \u2013 did not err as to the scope of the circular in question , which neither repeals nor amends the above - mentioned legislative provisions but is limited to applying them .", "The above - mentioned circular , which instructs the authorities responsible for deciding whether or not to grant concessions to build dykes not to transfer title to the plots of land thus created and to accept only installations designed for collective use , to the exclusion of private dwellings , was issued in respect of an area in which the relevant authorities have discretionary power . In referring to the principles laid down in the circular , the prefect does not appear to have interpreted the legislative provisions inaccurately ; nor did he fail to consider the specificity of the applicant \u2019s proposal before concluding that there was no special factor justifying an exemption from the instructions analysed above . \u201d", "The application lodged by the prefect of GPE ( case no . CARDINAL ) was granted . The court stated that \u201c the land on which PERSON and PERSON dwelling house stands is indeed public property \u201d .

The purpose of prosecuting someone for the administrative offence of interference with the highway is to preserve the integrity of public property . As can be seen from the judgment delivered by the court DATE in case no . CARDINAL , the land on which PERSON and PERSON dwelling house was built is indeed public property .", "The administrative courts base their determination of the substance of artificial public property on the judicial interpretation of any private deeds that may be produced whose examination raises a serious difficulty . In the present case the dyke and the house are not publicly owned property , given the exclusively private use made of them and the fact that they do not belong to a public authority , as confirmed by the deed of sale dated DATE . Accordingly , as it is not seriously disputed that the property in question has been appropriated for private use , it is not necessary to adjourn the application . ...", "Whether there has been unlawful interference with the highway", "While PERSON and PERSON have full title to the dwelling house occupied by them and claim , accordingly , that they are therefore not the unlawful occupants of public property , the fact remains that the erection of a permanent structure on public property could not be legally undertaken without either a concession to build a dyke or another type of concession . The investigation into the facts and , in particular , the absence of any documents evidencing that a concession was granted show that the dwelling house in question was illegally built on maritime public property . Accordingly , and despite the production by the owners of undisputed title deeds , the prefect is justified in requesting an order against Mr GPE to pay a fine and restore the foreshore to its original state prior to the construction of the house .", "Penalty for the offence", "...

On DATE the applicant and his wife lodged an appeal against the judgment delivered in case no . CARDINAL . On DATE they appealed against the judgment delivered in case no . CARDINAL .", "In support of their appeal against the judgment delivered in case no . DATE , the applicant and his wife submitted that the land in question was not public property belonging to the ORG . They maintained that the land was private property belonging to the ORG with the twofold effect that the usual rules governing acquisition by adverse possession under private law were applicable to their situation and that the administrative courts did not have jurisdiction to decide the dispute .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG decided to join the CARDINAL sets of proceedings on the ground that they were connected and to dismiss the applicant and his wife \u2019s appeals on the following grounds :", "\u201c With regard to the application ... concerning the offence of unlawful interference with the highway :", "Regarding the State property proceedings", "Firstly , it is not disputed that the land on which the dyke on which the house occupied by PERSON and PERSON was built was entirely covered by water , independently of any exceptional meteorological circumstances , prior to the draining works undertaken in order to build the dyke . It has not been established , or even alleged by the applicants moreover , that the undrained portion of this land had ever been removed from the action of the tide . The investigation shows , moreover , that the dyke is the result of land draining carried out prior to the entry into force of the above - mentioned LAW DATE [ ORG ] ... and that , notwithstanding the various authorisations of temporary occupancy granted by the authorities , as this was not done in the manner prescribed for concessions for the construction of a dyke it has not had the effect of bringing this part of the land thus removed from the action of the tide outside the category of maritime public property . In accordance with the principles of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property , the submissions by PERSON and PERSON to the effect that the house was built legally and its occupancy accepted by the authorities for a very long time and tolerated even after expiry of the last authorisation to occupy it do not alter the fact that the property falls within the category of maritime public property .", "Secondly , as has been said , the last decision in favour of PERSON and PERSON authorising temporary occupancy of the maritime public property expired on DATE . In the absence , since that date , of a lawful title of occupancy , the prefect of GPE is justified in requesting an order against the occupants to restore the site DATE if they have not already done so \u2013 to its original state prior to construction of the house on maritime public property . In disputing that obligation , the applicants can not properly rely on the long period of occupancy of the LOC or on the fact that the authorities have tolerated the continuation of that occupancy since DATE and proposed draft occupancy agreements in order to regularise the situation , which , moreover , they have not taken up . ...", "Fifthly , [ the obligation to restore the site to its original state ] does not constitute a measure prohibited by the requirement of LAW No . CARDINAL that no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest . ...", "The application regarding the refusal to grant a concession to build a dyke", "... Secondly , as section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW DATE [ LAW ] provides that draining works carried out prior to enactment of that Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation , the provisions codified under LAW of LAW according to which \u2018 the ORG may concede , on conditions it shall determine ... the right to build a dyke ... \u2019 are applicable .", "The prefect of GPE based his decision not to grant PERSON and PERSON the requested concession to build a dyke on the guidelines set out in the circular of DATE issued by the Minister for ORG and the Minister for Regional Development on the use of public property other than commercial or fishing ports . He did not discern any general - interest ground in favour of granting the applicants\u2019 request .", "By instructing the authorities responsible for granting concessions to build a dyke not to allow any plot of land whatsoever falling into the category of public property to be reclassified as private property with a view to transferring full title thereto , the ministers signatory to the circular of DATE did not adopt any legal rules amending or supplementing the above - mentioned provisions of LAW of LAW but confined themselves to applying them . Accordingly , as stated above , the plot of land in question is ORG - owned public property . There is no evidence in the case that the prefect , before reaching his decision , either failed to examine the particular circumstances of PERSON and PERSON request or made a manifest error of assessment in concluding that there was no special feature or general - interest consideration in the case justifying an exemption from the above - mentioned rules . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE . The ORG Commissioner pointed out , in the same submissions as those made in a similar case , that the value in DATE \u2019s terms of the purchase price of the house was MONEY ( ORG ) . He continued as follows :", "\u201c ... However , the acquisition of rights in rem is not permitted under LAW DATE on ORG - owned ORG ... nor were these acquired before that PERSON was passed ... The appellants have not acquired any property rights over their houses ; nor have they acquired rights in rem over public property as a result of the successive sales . Given the precarious situation of the buildings , the market value could not be established without taking account of that essential fact and it is to be hoped that the applicants were duly informed of the position when the purchase deeds were drawn up ... Lastly , and despite the fact that we are not especially enthusiastic about the outcome of this case , we have no alternative but to dismiss the ORG pleadings . ... They probably committed a tactical error in refusing the prefect \u2019s reiterated offer . Even if they were not exactly delighted by the prospect , it was at least preferable to a straightforward demolition order which will have to be judicially enforced at their expense . All hope is perhaps not lost of renewing contact with the authorities with a view to finding what might be a less drastic solution .", "There may be a case for suing the ORG in tort for allowing occupants of public property to nurture for DATE the hope that they would not be ruthlessly compelled to demolish their property . It should be pointed out that the prospects of success of such an action are fairly slim , however , given the legitimate protection enjoyed by public property . In any event , it is clear that if the public authority were to be found liable , the offenders would bear a considerable portion of liability too . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment delivered on DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that he could not rely on any right in rem over the land in question or over the buildings that had been erected on it and that the obligation to restore the land to its original state without any prior compensation was therefore not a measure prohibited by LAW . CARDINAL . It also held that the applicant could not rely on the fact that the authorities had tolerated the occupancy of the property in support of his submission that he should be allowed to restore the site to the state it had been in at the time of acquisition of the house .", "CARDINAL . Following a fire in DATE the applicant applied for a building permit for identical refurbishment of the house . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , he was issued with a building permit following a favourable opinion given by an architect from the NORP des b\u00e2timents de GPE under LAW . The permit was subsequently revoked , however , at the request of the prefect lodged with the mayor of GPE , on the ground that it was illegal because it had been issued in contravention of the rules of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE ORG sent the applicant a reminder to pay the charges for DATE and DATE in the sum of ORG MONEY and ORG CARDINAL respectively , plus property tax .", "CARDINAL . The applicant produced a valuation of his house drawn up by an estate agent \u2019s office in DATE which states as follows :", "\u201c ... a dwelling house ... situated on a plot of land measuring QUANTITY m. ... Having regard to the geographical situation of the property , the condition of the building , the surface area , its location on maritime public property and the local property market , and subject to the ORG ability to produce a concession agreement in respect of maritime public property , this property is worth between ORG CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The idea that the foreshore is \u201c common property \u201d , that is , can not be appropriated for private use and is managed by the public authorities , dates back to ORG times ( PERSON , Book II , Title I , PERSON rerum divisione ) , when even then a permit was necessary in order to build on the seashore . PERSON \u2019s Ordinance of the NORP of DATE codified the principle and up until recently was still the legal basis for the ORG \u2019s management of maritime public property . In addition to defining what constituted the \u201c seashore and foreshore \u201d , it laid down the applicable rules :", "\u201c No one shall build on the foreshore , set stakes in the ground or erect any construction that may interfere with navigation , on pain of demolition of the constructions , confiscation of the materials and discretionary fines . \u201d", "At the time of the Revolution , the idea developed that maritime public property was governed by the government in the interest of the nation , and not merely as part of the heritage that used to belong to the ORG and now belongs to the ORG . The management of maritime public property is still largely guided by this principle DATE . Over and above the idea of ORG ownership of such property , the conservation and management of it are more a matter of implementation of a policy regarding its use than the exercise of the owner \u2019s \u201c civil \u201d rights . The prefect has a major role in the protection of maritime public property . He is the authority who , generally , governs the use of the property at local level , decides whether or not to allow private occupancy and protects the integrity of the property by prosecuting offenders ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr , consulted on DATE ) .", "ORG \u2019s Ordinance of the NORP was definitively repealed in DATE . Since DATE LAW owned by ORG ( Code general de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des personnes publiques \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) has replaced LAW ( dating from DATE ) . It restructures the law governing ORG - owned land and public bodies and combines the rules governing maritime public property into a whole , including provisions relating to the environment in particular .", "CARDINAL . Maritime public property , determined on the basis of natural phenomena , lies between the highest point of the shore , that is , up to the high - tide mark under normal meteorological conditions ( CE Ass , PERSON , DATE ) and the boundary of the territorial waters , seaward . Under Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG , \u201c State natural maritime public property \u201d shall comprise :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The seabed and marine substrata between the external boundary of the territorial waters and , on land , the foreshore .", "The foreshore comprises the whole area covered ( and uncovered ) by the sea , up to the high - tide mark under normal meteorological conditions ;", "CARDINAL . The beds and substrata of salt pans communicating directly , naturally and permanently with the sea ;", "CARDINAL . Land naturally reclaimed from the sea :", "( a ) which was part of the ORG \u2019s private property at DATE , subject to third - party rights ;", "( b ) which has been constituted since DATE .", "...", "CARDINAL . Land reserved for public - interest maritime , seaside or tourist needs which has been purchased by the ORG .", "Land artificially removed from the action of the tide shall remain in the category of natural maritime public property unless otherwise stipulated in legally concluded and lawfully executed deeds of concession transferring ownership . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The principle of inalienability of public land , which was established in the case - law and then incorporated into the Code of State Property ( Article L. CARDINAL ) and the ORG ( Article PERSON ) , is inextricably linked to the notion of public land . The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use . As long as it remains thus designated , and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property , no transfer of land can be authorised . It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law , hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability . Accordingly , in its PERSON judgment , on the subject of plots of land situated close to the seashore in LOC , the ORG d\u2019Etat found :", "\u201c ... while the public authorities have authorised various building works on this land and on several occasions waived their right to apply the rules governing public land ... , neither the founders of the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du domaine des pr\u00e9s sal\u00e9s nor the company itself have been able to acquire any property right over the land , which , being part of public land , was inalienable and imprescriptible ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has stated that inalienability is limited to precluding the transfer of public property that has not first been reclassified as private property ( ORG , no . PERCENT of DATE , ORG ) . It has not , however , recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status ( ORG , DATE . no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , Rights in rem over public property ) . The ORG d\u2019Etat has recently reiterated that \u201c where property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus , it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property \u201d . Accordingly , it has held that the question whether or not short - stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact \u201c that these short - stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private - law contracts \u201d ( ORG , PERSON , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The effect of the principle of inalienability is that any transfer of public land that has not been \u201c reclassified \u201d is null and void , so third - party purchasers have a duty to return the land even if they have purchased it in good faith . Moreover , the fact that public land is inalienable means \u2013 in theory \u2013 that no rights in rem can be established over it . However , the legislature has departed from this principle by passing CARDINAL Acts , CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE which creates long administrative leases , and the other of CARDINAL DATE on the constitution of rights in rem over public land , thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property . LAW of DATE concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof . LAW DATE relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity ( Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of ORG and Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) . In its above - mentioned decision of DATE , ORG held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the LAW as public services were maintained and public property protected under LAW of DATE . However , it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond DATE unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority \u2019s right to the automatic return , free of charge , of any constructions and therefore undermine the \u201c protection due to public property \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The last consequence of the principle of inalienability is that property belonging to public authorities can not be seized ( Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) . This consequence has been attenuated by a decision of the ORG d\u2019Etat in a case which subsequently came before ORG and NORP fermi\u00e8re ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Apart from public easements intended to protect public property from the encroachment of private properties , such as a QUANTITY wide right of way along the coast over properties adjoining maritime public property , created by an Act of DATE reforming town and country planning , the land conservation policy guarantees the protection of the physical integrity of maritime public property and compliance with its designated use . Offenders are prosecuted for unlawful interference with the highway on grounds of infringement of the land conservation policy . An interference of this kind is liable to a criminal fine imposed by the administrative courts and the offender is required to restore the site to its original state . The relevant provisions on unlawful interference with maritime public property no longer refer essentially to navigation but take account of the protection of coastal areas for their own sake ( Articles L.

Regarding a plot of land incorporated into maritime public property at ORG beach ( southern Corsica ) , the PERSON d\u2019Etat decided the following :", "\u201c ... the fact that ORG produced title deeds to the property in question and had been authorised to build on the land under the regional planning legislation , as distinct from the legislation governing maritime public property , does not mean that the offence of unlawful interference with the highway has not been made out and , in any event , can not preclude prosecution by the prefect ... \u201d ( CE , no .

The use of maritime public property may be collective or private . Collective use which allows all citizens to benefit from public property ( navigation on watercourses , beaches ) is freely exercisable , equally available to all and free of charge . However , the principle that use is free of charge has not been expressly incorporated into the ORG because it is subject to numerous exceptions .", "Private occupancy must be compatible or in conformity with the designated use of the public property . Unlike collective use , it is subject to authorisation , issued personally , and a charge and is of a precarious nature .", "Article L. CARDINAL of the Code of State Property ( Article L.

The precariousness of these authorisations derives from the principle of inalienability , according to which the protection \u2013 and accordingly the disposal \u2013 of public land is vested in the authorities . According to the caselaw :", "\u201c ... any authorisation to occupy public land is precarious and revocable . Consequently , the fact DATE assuming it is made out DATE that , prior to adoption of the decision being challenged , PERSON had been granted authorisation to occupy the part of common public property ... does not affect the lawfulness of the mayor \u2019s decision requesting him to demolish the buildings he had erected and restore the public land to its original state ... \u201d ( CE , PERSON , DATE )", "It also states very clearly that those to whom authorisation has been granted have not thereby \u201c acquired rights \u201d to renewal of the authorisation ( CE , Helie , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The conditions of occupation of public property are determined either in unilateral concessions granted by the authorities ( of the type referred to above in LAW of LAW ) or in contracts signed with the occupant . The latter are called concessions to occupy public land , which DATE on maritime public property \u2013 may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke . By means of this concession , the ORG authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide . In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in DATE , traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred ( former LAW of LAW ) : the concessionaire was authorised to drain land , which , once removed from the action of the tide , no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the ORG . That arrangement , which was originally used to build agricultural polders , has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas , reclaimed from the sea . Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore , a circular was issued in DATE prohibiting such arrangements \u2013 a prohibition later confirmed by LAW , which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore . It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred . This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr , consulted on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Up until DATE maritime public property was protected by the rules governing the highways . LAW introduced new rules for the protection of natural public land ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr ) .", "CARDINAL . As early as DATE enthusiasm for seaside holidays brought about an increase in the number of tourists and thus in the number of buildings on the seashore . Awareness of the economic importance of the seashore and of the degree to which it is coveted made it necessary to introduce a rule of overriding legal force that would arbitrate between the many uses of coastal areas . It is in this spirit that LAW of DATE ( consolidated on DATE ) was unanimously passed by ORG . LAW provides that coastal areas are \u201c geographical entities which call for a specific policy of development , protection and enhancement \u201d . The general principles of that LAW consist in preserving rare and fragile areas , managing spatial planning and tourist development economically and , lastly , making the shore \u2013 like the beach DATE more widely accessible to the public and giving priority in coastal areas to marine - related activities .", "CARDINAL . It is in the planning sphere that the principles established are the best known and have given rise to the most litigation . Planning permission for further development must be granted with regard to continuation of existing constructions or new hamlets . It is forbidden to build roads on the shore and through roads can not be built closer than QUANTITY from the shore . In order to preserve natural sites the LAW imposes a \u201c no building \u201d rule within a CARDINAL-metre band DATE outside urban centres \u2013 from the shore , and restricts development in areas near the shore . Lastly , sites of outstanding interest or characteristic of the shore must be preserved and only small - scale development can be allowed .", "CARDINAL . The Act has laid down rules for managing maritime public property which include a mandatory public inquiry prior to any substantive change of use , clarifying the procedures for delimiting the foreshore , prohibiting DATE other than in exceptional circumstances \u2013 interference with the natural state of the seashore and establishing specific rules for collective mooring . Lastly , it has established the principles of unobstructed and free public use of the beaches and facilitated public access to the sea ( see LAW and LAW", "\u201c Pedestrians shall have free access to beaches ... Beaches are fundamentally reserved for the unobstructed and free use of the public . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW , now Article L.

A report entitled \u201c Assessment of LAW and measures in favour of coastal areas \u201d , prepared by the government for ORG ( DATE ) , contains a part devoted to opening coastal areas to pedestrians which is worded as follows :", "\u201c The purpose of LAW is to maintain or develop tourism in coastal areas . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the LAW , in particular , lay down the conditions in which the public may visit natural sites , the seashore and the corresponding facilities . The provision of coastal paths goes some way towards giving effect to these legislative provisions . ...

If the land is considered to be accessible without any risk to the environment , regard will have to be had to where the path is routed , particularly across private property , it being observed that the statutory route ( QUANTITY in width running along the boundary of maritime public property ) is not always the most appropriate solution .

In all these GPE maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed - term concessions . And in all these GPE illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties . In particular , the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation . This type of measure also exists in GPE , where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea .", "CARDINAL .
