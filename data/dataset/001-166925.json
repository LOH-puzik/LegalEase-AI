The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims to have been living in GPE since DATE , when the NORP authorities granted him a visa for an extended stay ( a long - term residence permit ) . On DATE the applicant was granted the right to reside permanently in GPE ( a permanent residence permit ) . However , he did not de - register his domicile ( prebivali\u0161te ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant bought a car ( a Mercedes S CARDINAL L ) in GPE and on DATE he registered it in GPE in his name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered GPE in his car . He claimed that the purpose of his visit was , inter alia , to de - register his domicile in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was stopped by the police in GPE while driving his car . The police authorities , finding it suspicious that a NORP national was driving a car with foreign licence plates , impounded the car and reported the matter to ORG , suspecting that the car had been imported into GPE without payment of the relevant taxes and that an administrative offence had thus been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant de - registered his domicile in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant re - registered his domicile in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG had instituted administrative proceedings ( upravni postupak ) with a view to establishing whether the applicant was liable to pay taxes on the importation of his vehicle and if so , in what amount . On DATE ORG had issued a decision impounding the applicant \u2019s car , against which the applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision ordering the applicant to pay , by DATE , the customs debt ( consisting of the ORG and the special tax on motor vehicles ) owed on the importation of his car , which amounted to MONEY ( HRK ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against that decision , which thus became final and enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the applicant did not pay the above sum , on DATE the ORG instituted administrative enforcement proceedings and issued a decision confiscating his car and ordering its sale with a view to collecting the above - mentioned customs debt .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of committing an administrative offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and fined him HRK CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant had had his domicile in GPE at the time of the commission of the offence . Therefore , it was irrelevant that he did not pay income tax in GPE , that he had health insurance in GPE and not in GPE , and that he had been granted the right to reside permanently in GPE . By having his domicile in GPE he failed to satisfy the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties set forth in LAW to LAW ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , which stated that the registered owner of a vehicle registered abroad must , in order to qualify for exemption , have his domicile outside the territory of the ORG into which the vehicle was being brought ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG prekr\u0161ajni sud PERSON ) quashed the first - instance decision on account of incomplete facts , and remitted the case to ORG . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c [ ORG ] states , as the decisive reason for its decision to find the accused guilty , that [ he ] has his domicile in ... GPE , at [ an ] address in GPE , ... , and that the fact that he possesses a residence permit , that is , a valid visa , of GPE , is not sufficient evidence for the accused to be entitled to import [ his ] vehicle with total exemption from customs duties under LAW .", "However , it is precisely such explanation of the contested decision that , along with the other elements in the case file , shows that the taking of evidence was flawed , that [ ORG ] did not give [ sufficient ] reasons for the decisive facts on which it based its decision , and that they [ that is , those facts and the reasons given ] are in strong contradiction with each other . [ In particular , ORG ] while acknowledging the fact that [ the accused ] possesses a residence permit , that is , a visa , of GPE , further gives as reasons [ to support the finding ] that the accused has a domicile in ... GPE , that he is not a taxpayer in ... GPE , and that he is not even insured with ORG .", "....", "... [ NORP the first - instance proceedings [ before ORG ] the accused stated circumstances and furnished evidence which , in his view , suggested that he had not committed the offence of which he was accused . [ ORG therefore ] needed to examine the evidence more thoroughly with a view to establishing the [ relevant ] facts completely and correctly .", "...", "This court considers that what is missing in the present case are the reasons for not accepting the status of the accused in GPE , the explanation of where the accused actually lives [ resides ] and , consequently , a clear conclusion as to whether or not he satisfied the conditions set out in LAW .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , by a decision of DATE ORG again found the applicant guilty of committing the same administrative offence and fined him HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . ORG again found that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had had his domicile in GPE according to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and thus did not satisfy the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties set forth in LAW to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Therefore , the fact that the applicant resided in GPE was of no relevance as he had not proved that he had his domicile there . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c After having examined the evidence ... , this authority finds that the accused , ORG , committed the customs - related administrative offence he was charged with , defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL [ of LAW ] provides that a fine for an administrative offence is to be imposed on a person who treats goods as if they satisfy the conditions for temporary admission , and that conduct is contrary to the conditions for the temporary admission of goods set forth in LAW or in the [ GPE ] Convention .", "In the proceedings it was established beyond doubt that on DATE the accused was found operating the vehicle in question with foreign licence plates of GPE on the territory of GPE as if he satisfied the conditions for temporary admission , and that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in LAW or in the [ GPE ] Convention because he was a NORP national who at the time of the commission of the offence had his domicile in GPE .", "The rights and obligations of participants in customs proceedings and the powers of the customs authorities as regards means of transport imported by natural persons into NORP customs territory are regulated by the provisions of the [ GPE ] Convention . Likewise , customs proceedings and supervision of means of transport with foreign licence plates in the NORP customs territory is regulated by the provisions of LAW and the Decree on the implementation of LAW .", "It is established beyond dispute that the accused is a NORP national who at the time of ... the offence had his domicile in ... GPE . His defence that he had a registered residence in GPE was not accepted as a ground for exemption from liability ... Namely , the mere fact that he possesses a residence permit is not a proof that would entitle him to import [ his ] car with total relief from payment of customs duties under LAW because he does not have his domicile abroad .", "This is so because the procedure for temporary admission of private means of transport is regulated by LAW to the [ GPE ] Convention in such a way that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission in the name of a person having a seat or domicile outside the territory of temporary admission and be imported and used by persons residing in that territory .", "As regards his personal status , it has been established beyond doubt that the accused is a NORP national , and that until DATE he had [ his ] domicile in GPE , in GPE . Furthermore , after the accused was reported as having committed the administrative offence , he de - registered his domicile in GPE \u2013 in this authority \u2019s view \u2013 merely to avoid liability for the offence . At the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary importation with total relief and [ was thus not entitled to ] operate a vehicle with foreign licence plates . Namely , [ LAW to the [ LAW expressly provides that the right to temporary importation belongs to persons who have domicile outside the territory of temporary admission , that is , outside GPE .", "This authority has examined the argument of the accused that he is not a taxpayer in GPE , which is evident from the certificate of DATE issued by ORG , as well as the evidence [ to the effect ] that he is neither insured with ORG nor has social security [ cover ] in GPE . However , that evidence can not lead to the adoption of a different decision , because the fact of [ having or not ] health insurance or social security is not evidence of domicile abroad .", "This authority has also taken into account the fact that the accused had health insurance in GPE as of DATE . However , having [ health ] insurance is itself not relevant for the adoption of a different decision because the fact of [ possessing ] insurance , which according to the accused \u2019s own statement is voluntary , does not give [ him ] the right to temporary admission of the vehicle in question with total relief .", "On the basis of these findings of fact , and in accordance with the foregoing provisions , this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission , and that , by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [ those ] conditions , he committed the administrative offence defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW .", "This authority has [ also ] examined the argument of the accused that he is registered in GPE [ as an alien ] for an extended stay , of which he submitted evidence [ in the form of ] a certificate [ issued ] by LAW . However , that evidence does not prove his domicile abroad , but only his stay . What is more , at the hearing held on DATE the accused himself stated only the fact of his residence in GPE , which confirms that at the time of the commission of the offence he did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of vehicles with total relief , in accordance with ORG to the [ GPE ] Convention .", "In particular , it is beyond doubt that at the time of the commission of the offence the accused had his domicile in GPE . LAW provides that a citizen \u2019s domicile is the place where he has settled with the intention of permanently living there , and in which he has permanent accommodation secured .", "The solemn statement of the commercial company [ ORG ] of CARDINAL DATE stating that it would provide accommodation for ORG as of DATE was also examined in the proceedings . However , [ that statement ] is not decisive for exempting [ the accused ] from liability because it was issued after this authority adopted its [ first ] decision of DATE and because the statement in question does not give him the right to temporary admission with total relief .", "The statement given by ORG before a notary public on DATE ) , which was also examined during the proceedings , is illogical and contrary to [ both ] the statement of ORG and the solemn statement of CARDINAL DATE in that it suggests that the flat [ in GPE in which the applicant claimed to be living ] was rented to NORP , and not to the accused , whereas the solemn statement of ORG of CARDINAL DATE suggested that it provided PERSON with accommodation at the address [ in GPE ] . After examining that evidence , this authority considers that it was obtained with a view to proving that the accused had rented accommodation to live in abroad .", "Moreover , the evidence of the accused that his wife is a director of company ORG in GPE is not relevant either , because in his statement of DATE he stated that his wife lived in GPE and had her business in GPE .", "This authority does not dispute the fact that the accused is disabled , with a degree of disability of PERCENT , of which he submitted as evidence a membership card [ issued by an association of disabled persons ] in his name indicating his domicile [ as being ] in GPE ...", "In the proceedings all the evidence furnished by the accused was examined . However , by that evidence the accused did not prove that he had been living abroad .", "From all the evidence it is apparent that at the time of the commission of the offence the accused was a NORP national who had his domicile in GPE , with all the rights and obligations attached to that . The accused could not pose in GPE as a person having domicile abroad and enjoy the rights of [ such ] a person in [ his own ] country , where until DATE he had his domicile . Therefore , the accused did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of GPE with total relief under Annex C [ to LAW ] and the Decree on the implementation of LAW because his domicile was in GPE at the time of the commission of the offence .", "In the light of the foregoing , this authority has adopted a decision finding the accused guilty , as stated in the operative provisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first - instance decision , endorsing the reasons given therein . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c Against the first - instance decision the accused ... lodged ... an appeal on the grounds of breaches of procedure , incomplete and incorrect findings of fact , misapplication of the substantive law , and a wrong decision on the sanction . In the appeal the accused essentially argues ... that he has proved that at the time of entry into GPE he satisfied all statutory requirements for legally entering [ GPE ] with the car in question , that the first - instance authority called into question the validity of the visa of GPE , where he was [ first ] granted an extended stay , and from DATE the right to reside permanently , [ and ] that he uses the flat in GPE without restrictions . He therefore considers that there are no legal grounds or evidence for a finding that he committed the administrative offence in question .", "...", "The appeal is unfounded .", "...", "The accused unjustifiably denies liability for the administrative offence committed , because the first - instance authority [ , ] ... on the basis of his statement given at the hearing of DATE and ... the written evidence [ , ] ... correctly concluded that his conduct had all the elements of the administrative offence defined in section CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW . [ The accused ] was on DATE in GPE found operating a ORG vehicle ... with foreign licence plates of GPE as if he satisfied the conditions for temporary admission , and that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods given that at the time of the commission of the offence he had his domicile in GPE . Since that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in LAW and the [ GPE ] Convention , he committed the administrative offence defined in section CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW .", "...", "The other appellate arguments are also unfounded because the ... ORG ... correctly and accurately established the [ relevant ] facts ... and correctly applied the substantive law ...", "In particular , special conditions for the temporary importation of means of transport are prescribed in LAW to LAW in LAW , where subparagraph ( b ) provides that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission , in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission , and [ must ] be imported and used by persons having domicile in such a territory . ORG in its LAW provides that domicile is the place where a citizen has settled with the intention of permanently living there .", "Therefore , given that during the [ first - instance ] proceedings the decisive fact that the accused is a NORP national who at the time of the commission of the offence had his domicile in the territory of GPE was established beyond doubt , he did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of GPE set out in the above - cited provisions of the Annex to FAC .", "[ This court ] therefore upholds as correct in its entirety the decision of the first - instance authority ... whereby the accused was found guilty and sanctioned for the administrative offence defined in section CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then , on DATE , lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance decision , alleging violations of his constitutional rights to fair proceedings , equality before the law and equality before the courts and other public authorities . In so doing he relied on LAW paragraph CARDINAL , LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He argued that ORG had misinterpreted the text of LAW to LAW , which in the official text did not refer to \u201c domicile \u201d but to \u201c living \u201d abroad . Therefore , the fact that while living in GPE he had kept his domicile in GPE was not relevant . The applicant further argued that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements . In particular , the applicant argued as follows :", "\u201c In the decision [ of DATE ] ORG totally wrongly quoted the text of LAW subparagraph ( b ) ... of ORG [ C ] to ORG by stating [ that it ] \u2018 provides that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission , in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission , and [ must ] be imported and used by persons having domicile in such a territory\u2019 [ emphasis added ] .", "However , the text LAW subparagraph ( b ) ... of LOC [ C ] to ORG published in ORG [ \u2013 International agreements ] no . CARDINAL is completely different and reads :", "\u2018 ... means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission , in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission , and [ must ] be imported and used by persons living in such a ORG [ emphasis added ] .", "The obvious difference between [ the CARDINAL texts ] is that ORG refers to [ having ] domicile in the territory of another ORG as a condition for using a foreign car whereas the text of the LAW [ on Temporary Admission ] ... refers to ... living in the territory of another ORG , which is legally not the same .", "Besides , the fact of living in the territory of another ORG , that is , in the ORG from which the disputed car originates , can not be assessed in accordance with NORP laws , and especially not in the way [ ORG ] did it , but in accordance with the LAW [ on Temporary Admission ] itself and the Decree on the implementation of LAW , .... [ T]hat fact of living in the territory of another ORG is to be proved by work or residence permit .", "... all customs offices in GPE have , upon a citizen \u2019s entry into [ GPE ] by car , been establishing the fact of living in another ORG by checking only work or residence permit .", "It is evident that in the instant case [ the authorities ] departed from the relevant law and the established practice ... by deliberately misquoting the relevant provisions with a view to creating conditions for the complainant \u2019s conviction at all costs .", "...", "[ T]he complainant proved beyond doubt , by presenting a valid visa for an extended stay , the contract on the use of a flat and a social security certificate , that he has de jure and de facto been living in GPE , and that he had legally bought the car in accordance with the NORP laws . [ It follows that ] the complainant perfectly legally entered GPE in accordance with LAW subparagraph ( b ) ... of [ Annex C to ] LAW , and that by so doing he did not commit a customs offence defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW . In any event , the customs office [ in question ] would not have allowed the complainant to enter the territory of GPE if he did not satisfy the said conditions .", "It is totally unclear why the complainant should , as stated in the first - instance decision , pay any customs debt [ in the situation ] where he did not ask for customs clearance but only temporary admission . If the customs authorities considered that temporary admission was not allowed then they could have ordered that the car be exported from GPE ... at the expense of the complainant .", "The above described proceedings are certainly a chicanery for the reasons as stated and at the same time constitute a dangerous precedent for all other citizens of GPE ...", "If such proceedings would apply to all NORP nationals operating cars with foreign licence plates , only a few [ such ] cars daily could enter GPE . Besides , if that view of the lower judicial and other authorities on the [ interpretation of the relevant ] substantive law is to be accepted , not a single CARDINAL of CARDINAL of NORP citizens temporarily working in GPE , GPE or GPE could enter GPE because they all legally have domicile in GPE . [ In this way ] CARDINAL of cars should be confiscated DATE , especially from citizens of GPE and GPE having double nationality who enter GPE on a DATE basis .", "In particular , the [ contested ] decisions infringed the right to impartial and fair proceedings guaranteed by LAW because for the reasons set out above those decisions are certainly neither fair nor impartial . On the contrary , they are absolutely biased and blatantly unfair .", "The decision to prosecute only the complainant and not CARDINAL of others certainly constitutes a violation of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW whereby equality before the law is guaranteed to the complainant , and also of LAW which guarantees equality of all NORP citizens before courts and other ORG authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , finding that the contested decisions were based on a \u201c constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law \u201d . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE . It reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

( in particular the fact that it was established ... that at the time of the commission of the offence the complainant had registered domicile in GPE in accordance with the relevant provisions of ORG ) , ORG finds that the legal views expressed in the contested decisions are based on a constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law . ORG considers that the relevant administrative authority and ORG , relying on the facts established in the proceedings , gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions , which undoubtedly do not result from an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law .", "The Constitutional Court therefore finds that the complainant \u2019s right to equality before the law guaranteed by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW was not violated by the contested decisions .", "CARDINAL .

The contested decisions are sufficiently reasoned and adopted in accordance with the relevant procedural rules .", "For these reasons , the [ Constitutional ] Court finds that the contested decisions did not violate the complainant \u2019s constitutional right to fair proceedings .", "As regards the complainant \u2019s argument that in similar cases the relevant authorities proceed differently , that in itself does not mean that the complainant \u2019s constitutional right was violated by the contested decisions .
