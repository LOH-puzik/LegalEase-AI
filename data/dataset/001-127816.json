On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE sent a request for the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE to ORG .

On DATE the applicant and his lawyer sought judicial review of the extradition order . They submitted , in particular , that it was unlawful since it had been issued before the applicant \u2019s request for refugee status had been determined by the domestic authorities . They argued that the \u201c Wahhabism \u201d movement was not an organisation banned in GPE and the documents submitted by the NORP authorities lacked information on the applicant \u2019s membership of a religious organisation after DATE . They pointed out that , according to the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was charged with several offences as the perpetrator . However , the facts outlined in the statement of charges concerned acts allegedly committed by several other persons , but not by the applicant . They stated that the applicant had been charged with an attempt to overthrow the ORG order of his home country and therefore his criminal prosecution was politically motivated . Finally , referring to the ORG \u2019s extensive case - law on the matter and various reports by international observers , the defence stressed that the use of torture and ill - treatment against detainees in GPE was systematic and went unpunished by the law - enforcement and security authorities , and that the applicant ran an individualised risk of ill - treatment in the event of extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the extradition order as lawful and well - founded . The applicant was present , represented , and assisted by an interpreter . During the hearing the applicant maintained that he had a limited command of NORP , and that he had decided to leave GPE after his neighbour \u2019s arrest out of fear of arrest and torture . He had not applied for refugee status in GPE immediately after his arrival there , since he had at first been unaware of the charges against him and then he had thought that such information would lead to his expulsion from GPE . He had only made such an application after receiving his lawyer \u2019s advice . The lawyer maintained his grounds for appeal and pointed out that the case - file did not contain the first statement of charges but only the second , which was different from the initial one .", "CARDINAL . The defence further requested the admission of PERSON as the applicant \u2019s defender ( \u00ab \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a GPE ) , since she could provide an expert opinion on the situation in GPE and law - enforcement practice in similar cases . The court rejected that request , finding that the applicant was represented by a professional lawyer , and that PERSON was not a member of the applicant \u2019s family , had only a technical education and did not practise \u201c in the law - enforcement sphere on extradition matters \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant did not have refugee status in GPE ; he had failed to either apply for it in a timely manner or to advance a plausible explanation for that omission . The court observed that on DATE the ORG Novgorod ORG ( ORG ) had refused to accept his request for an examination on the merits ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , noting that the decision \u201c was , in substance , correct \u201d and that it had not been appealed against within the time - limits set out in the domestic law . The court noted , without giving further details , that there was no evidence that the applicant had been , or would be , prosecuted in GPE on political or religious grounds . Turning specifically to the allegation of persecution on political grounds , the court rejected it as having no legal basis . The court noted that , in accordance with the reservation of GPE on ratification of LAW , NORP law did not contain a definition of a \u201c political offence \u201d and the list of offences GPE would not consider as \u201c political \u201d or \u201c connected with political offences \u201d was not exhaustive . Finally , the court found no formal obstacles to the applicant \u2019s extradition and noted that the NORP authorities had provided assurances in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence appealed against ORG decision , arguing that the first - instance court had omitted to make a legal assessment of the evidence submitted in support of the argument concerning the risk of ill - treatment in custody . The defence pointed to various discrepancies between the CARDINAL statements of charges constituting the basis for the arrest request and the formal extradition request , respectively , and concluded that the charges had been fabricated . They further argued , on the basis of the first statement of charges , that it did not contain information about offences committed by the applicant but referred to suspicions in respect of other persons . They maintained that the decision to extradite the applicant had been taken unlawfully in the absence of a final ruling in the refugee status proceedings , and also challenged the refusal to admit PERSON as the applicant \u2019s defender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged objections regarding the court hearing transcript , stating , in particular , that the following information had not been included therein : the applicant \u2019s request for a letter from the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees to be admitted to the case file ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , submissions regarding the applicant \u2019s limited command of NORP , and a request for a legal assessment of the charges against the applicant . At some point ORG rejected these objections .", "CARDINAL . At some point the applicant\u2019 lawyer lodged a request with the office of ORG for clarifications as regards the significant discrepancies in the CARDINAL statements of charges against the applicant . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that , inter alia , it had requested clarifications on the matter from the office of the of ORG prosecutor . In the meantime , on DATE ORG office of GPE received a letter dated DATE from their NORP counterpart specifying that the applicant \u2019s extradition was sought only in connection with the offences listed in the formal request for extradition ( apparently , those listed in the second statement of charges ) and asking for the first statement of charges forwarded by the NORP authorities on the date of the applicant \u2019s arrest in GPE to be disregarded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE and upheld the extradition order and ORG decision as lawful and wellfounded . In reaching that conclusion , ORG referred to the assurances by the NORP authorities and noted that ORG of GPE had not pointed out any obstacles to the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The court found no evidence that the applicant had been , or would be , prosecuted on political or religious grounds and observed that the applicant neither had refugee status nor could be regarded as a person seeking such status in GPE . As regards the alleged discrepancies in the statements of charges provided by the NORP authorities to their NORP counterparts , ORG rejected that argument as irrelevant , since it was not the task of the domestic courts , or the prosecutor \u2019s office , to decide on the applicant \u2019s guilt in the extradition proceedings . ORG rejected the request for Ms Ryabinina to be admitted as a defender and questioned as a specialist , upheld ORG refusal to do so and endorsed its reasoning in that respect . The extradition order became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for refugee status in GPE with ORG on the ground of fear of persecution because of his religious beliefs . He submitted that the accusations against him were unfounded and that he faced torture and other forms of ill - treatment if extradited to GPE . He had left GPE after the arrest of a neighbour with whom he had regularly attended the mosque . He referred to reports by the ORG agencies issued in DATE and reports by respected international NGOs demonstrating that torture was widespread in GPE and confessions were often extracted from defendants under duress . He also referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , concerning extradition to GPE . He specified that he had not applied for refugee status immediately after his arrival in GPE because of his poor command of NORP and also because he had \u201c not been aware of such a possibility \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG NORP ORG advised the applicant that it could not examine his application since he did not meet the \u201c refugee \u201d criteria set out in the domestic law . On DATE the applicant challenged that refusal before ORG of GPE ( \u201c the NORP FMS \u201d ) , submitting that ORG had failed to establish the facts of the case and , furthermore , that he had left GPE before the opening of the criminal case against him in his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG notified the applicant that it had instructed ORG to examine his request .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Nizhniy NORP FMS informed the applicant that on DATE it had refused to examine the complaint , since the applicant did not meet the \u201c refugee \u201d definition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to the NORP ORG , referring to the regional migration authority \u2019s failure to assess the risk of ill - treatment . In addition to his earlier submissions he provided references to articles from the local press published in DATE concerning the continuing practice of ill - treatment of detainees in GPE . The appeal was received by the NORP ORG on DATE . On DATE the NORP ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s complaint and remitted it to the regional migration authority for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) informed the defence that the applicant met the criteria established by its statute and was eligible for international protection under its mandate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Novgorod ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for refugee status by a letter received by the applicant on DATE , citing CARDINAL grounds for the refusal : ( CARDINAL ) failure to meet the \u201c refugee \u201d definition ; and ( CARDINAL ) the inapplicability of LAW to individuals who had \u201c committed a serious criminal offence of a nonpolitical nature outside GPE before being admitted to GPE as a person requesting refugee status \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that refusal , maintaining that the charges had been fabricated and pointing to the risk of illtreatment , with extensive references to reports by ORG and ORG , and information from ORG of ORG . He also requested an extension of DATE time - limit for lodging his appeal , since he had allegedly not been able to understand the contents of the letter of CARDINAL DATE because of his poor command in NORP , and his lawyer had explained the grounds for the refusal to him only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that , according to information from ORG , the human rights situation in GPE was \u201c ambiguous \u201d . The dissemination of ideas of religious extremism and separatism constituted a criminal offence in that country . After the defeat of the ORG uprising the importing of NORP literature had been proscribed . The GPE leadership had an expressed intention to fine and put in jail individuals who worshipped outside the areas designated for that purpose . The NORP authorities considered that members of ORG and PERSON , a branch of PERSON - ut - GPE , had actively participated in the NORP events of DATE , and criminal proceedings against CARDINAL persons , including CARDINAL members of PERSON , were underway . Turning to the applicant \u2019s case , the ORG noted that the applicant had failed to apply for asylum in due time after his arrival in GPE and had referred to his poor command in NORP to justify that failure . However , the migration authority noted that , first , the applicant had performed military service in GPE , GPE , in DATE , which would have been impossible without an adequate knowledge of NORP , and second , he had received a temporary resident permit for GPE in DATE . Thus , the NORP ORG concluded that the applicant had provided false information about his language proficiency and that fact \u201c undermined confidence in the applicant and in the remainder of his submissions \u201d . The ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c Having analysed the applicant \u2019s submissions and the information provided by ORG and ORG of GPE on the situation in GPE and the activities of banned religious organisations , [ the NORP ORG ] finds no grounds to consider that the applicant would be persecuted on racial , religious , nationality , social or political grounds in the event of his return [ to the requesting country ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged that decision in court . In written submissions and an oral statement made during the court hearing the defence reiterated the applicant \u2019s fear that , in the event of extradition to GPE , he would be subjected to torture with a view to extracting a confession from him in respect of offences he had not committed . He further stated that the ORG had failed to duly assess that risk . As to his limited command of NORP , he stated that he had performed his military service DATE prior to his arrest , that fluent NORP had not been necessary for obtaining the temporary residence permit and , furthermore , that his difficulty in understanding NORP had been confirmed in several hearings concerning his extradition and the extensions of his pretrial detention , where the courts had heard him in person and had agreed that he needed an interpreter \u2019s assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected that appeal . The court reiterated that the applicant had not complained of a risk of persecution in GPE and had not raised his wish to remain in GPE as a refugee until his arrest . His allegations of persecution for attending a mosque were ill - founded , given that the majority of the population of the destination country freely practised ORG . In addition , the court noted that the destination country had signed various international human rights treaties concerning , in particular , the protection of refugees . The court further endorsed the NORP ORG \u2019s decision as lawful , noting the applicant \u2019s failure to adduce \u201c convincing arguments to support his allegations of fear of unlawful persecution on religious grounds \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , maintaining the claims summarised in paragraph CARDINAL above and submitting in addition that the first - instance court had failed to assess the risk on the basis of all available information , as well as to address his counter - arguments to the ORG \u2019s conclusion regarding his command of the LANGUAGE language .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . The appeal court found that the migration authority had taken its decision in compliance with the existing procedure and that the firstinstance court had ORG endorsed the conclusion that no evidence of the applicant \u2019s persecution on religious grounds had been adduced , and noted that the defence had not referred to any new facts capable of altering that conclusion . The court also referred to several international human rights treaties signed by GPE and noted that on CARDINAL DATE ORG had lifted various sanctions , including an arms embargo , against that country on account of progress achieved in the human rights sphere and the abolition of the death penalty there .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the ORG Novgorod transport prosecutor ordered his placement in custody pending extradition . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order . On DATE the Nizhniy ORG upheld decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon receipt of the formal request for the applicant \u2019s extradition ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG GPE deputy transport prosecutor , by a separate decision , again ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition . It is unclear whether the decision was appealed against .", "CARDINAL . It appears that at some point the ORG Novgorod transport prosecutor \u2019s office asked the court to extend the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined that request , found that the latest extension of the applicant \u2019s detention had been granted on DATE [ sic ] , and the applicant could be held in custody on the basis of a prosecutor \u2019s order for a period not exceeding DATE . The court noted the receipt of the formal extradition request from the NORP authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , observed that the extradition proceedings had not been completed , and decided that the applicant should remain in custody until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the applicant had been held in custody unlawfully since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal and endorsed the extension of DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG of Nizhniy Novgorod Nizhniy GPE extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition until DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the Nizhniy ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE and upheld the extension order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , when examining the applicant \u2019s appeal against the extradition order ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , authorised the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court found no reason to apply a preventive measure other than detention , since it was necessary to ensure the applicant \u2019s extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by an additional statement of appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the defence challenged ORG findings in so far as they concerned the extension of the detention . He complained , in particular , about the overlap of the extension with the ruling of LOC of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , deciding on the applicant \u2019s appeal against the extradition order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , upheld the entirety of the lower court \u2019s findings without addressing the detention issue separately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a separate decision , extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the extension on appeal . ORG found there was no contradiction between the CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE issued by ORG and ORG since the first CARDINAL concerned the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition , whilst the second one dealt with the lawfulness of the extradition order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the transport prosecutor \u2019s office lodged an application for a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined the matter and granted an extension until DATE . According to the hearing transcript , the applicant requested the court to change the preventive measure in respect of him to CARDINAL of house arrest , and gave the address of a relative in GPE Novgorod where he could reside pursuant to the application of such a measure . He stated that before his arrest he had lived in PERSON and not in GPE , the place of his formal residence registration . He did not remember the exact address in GPE PERSON he had resided at . The applicant \u2019s lawyer stated at the hearing that the applicant had introduced an application with the ORG and that an interim measure had been applied to his case under Rule CARDINAL of ORG . The lawyer pointed to the similarly between the applicant \u2019s case and several others previously examined by ORG ( for instance , the case of PERSON and Others , cited above ) and stated that the applicant had a good chance of winning his case in GPE . The lawyer submitted that \u201c there exist[ed ] legal grounds for decreasing the amount of compensation , and even reducing it to CARDINAL \u201d if the preventive measure in respect of the applicant was changed to a milder one . The lawyer provided a full address in PERSON where the applicant could be placed under house arrest and specified that the applicant himself had by mistake cited the wrong street name .", "CARDINAL . When granting the extension , ORG observed that the circumstances requiring the applicant \u2019s detention remained unchanged . The court noted that the extradition order in respect of the applicant had indeed become final but the extradition had been suspended pursuant to the application of Rule DATE by ORG , and therefore the extradition order could not be enforced . However , there existed a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding if he was released . The court noted that the applicant was wanted for particularly serious offences , had been hiding from the NORP authorities , and measures were being taken to ensure his extradition which involved the application of international treaties ; therefore his case should be considered exceptional . His detention was in accordance with the domestic law . Various case documents demonstrated the reasonableness of the suspicion against him as regarded the well - foundedness of the accusations brought by the NORP authorities , but ORG was not competent to decide on that matter . It concluded that the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention was in compliance with LAW . The court further rejected the possibility of changing the preventive measure to house arrest , since the applicant had been unable to indicate a specific address where he could reside if such a measure was applied , or to provide any further details in support of his petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision . In particular , he challenged ORG reference to the gravity of the charges against him and the exceptional nature of the case as immaterial . With reference to the PERSON case ( see PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) , he stated that no action had been taken with a view to his extradition since DATE , when the extradition order had become final , and ORG had failed to indicate any specific measures to be taken to enforce the extradition order after that date . He drew the court \u2019s attention to contradictory documents submitted by the NORP authorities and submitted that the charges were fabricated and unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court endorsed the firstinstance court \u2019s reasoning as lawful and well - founded . In particular , it upheld ORG findings as to the gravity of the charges against the applicant , the possibility of his absconding or obstructing justice , and the exceptional nature of his case . ORG observed that the lower court had reached its conclusions on the basis of all available material , including the information on the application pending before ORG . The court further upheld as reasonable the refusal to place the applicant under house arrest , since the address of his registration was no longer his place of residence , he had failed to give his latest place of residence in GPE , and he had been unable to provide either an address where he could he held under house arrest or any other details .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE LOC changed the preventive measure in respect of the applicant to house arrest , on account of the expiry of the maximum term for his detention pending extradition and in order to ensure the applicant \u2019s extradition , which was suspended at the time pursuant to the application of the interim measure by ORG . The applicant and his representative were present at the hearing . The court referred , in particular , to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the CCrP \u201d ) . The house arrest order read as follows :", "\u201c ... to prohibit [ the applicant ] from leaving his permanent place of residence at the address [ ... ] , communicating , without an investigator \u2019s prior consent , with suspects , accused , victims or other participants in the criminal case , and from sending and receiving correspondence , or using any means of communication . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
