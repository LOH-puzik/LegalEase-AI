The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking involving QUANTITY of hashish and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of a drug offence , following the discovery in his garage of CARDINAL bags containing QUANTITY of cannabis , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , in addition ordering his exclusion from NORP territory for DATE . It gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c We have a young man returning from GPE in DATE , with no job or verifiable income , who , having tried his hand in turn at property , trading in linen , crockery , air - conditioners , foie gras and , incidentally , counterfeit CARDINAL notes ( ? ? ) , found himself , somehow or other \u2013 he repeatedly tried to explain this with a story about profitable ' air - conditioners ' DATE in possession of a considerable pile of money , MONEY , at his home ( see ORG ) , scattered about and hidden in the unlikeliest places ( such as the maintenance hatch under the bath ! ! ) .", "Even better , the arrest on DATE in the morning resulted in the seizure , without a warrant , of CARDINAL bundles of drugs , consisting of QUANTITY of prohibited substances , laid out , packed and wrapped in a manner bearing little resemblance to a craft industry .", "Nobody claimed them DATE which CARDINAL of H. or PERSON turned the other one in ? ?", "What is more , PERSON was in possession of QUANTITY of the same kind of resin ( see the expert report , DCARDINAL ) and MONEY in cash , stored in the glovebox of his car .", "The circumstances outlined above amount to CARDINAL pieces of evidence against PERSON , which elicited nothing more than vague and inconsistent explanations in which he accused PERSON of being the delivery man , claimed ignorance as to the nature of the CARDINAL bundles ( ! ! ! ) , and referred again and again , as a kind of ' judicial trump card ' , to the money - spinning air - conditioners ( repeatedly ) and the savings of his late brother ( A. ) .", "A third piece of evidence results from shadowing , tracking and telephone - tapping .", "Treading stealthily like a NORP and behaving like a secret agent , before and after DATE , PERSON moved about a good deal , showing a preference for TIME , twisting and turning constantly , keeping a sharp lookout where necessary , and receiving his ' contacts '' vehicles in his garage ( albeit for very short amounts of time ) ... What was going on ? ?", "What was going on , his counsel argued , as , subsequently , did counsel for NORP and NORP , was indeed ' trading ' , but in linen , foie gras ( in ' blocks ' ) , counterfeit banknotes , trousers , but never hashish .", "This cunning strategy was supported by the statements of PERSON ( DCARDINAL ) , and indeed those of ORG or C.", "Furthermore , and above all , no air - conditioners , foie gras or trousers were seized on DATE ; what was physically observed in this case was hashish , and a sizeable quantity of it .", "Accordingly , PERSON , who already has several convictions , having , in particular , been sentenced to DATE imprisonment in DATE for a drug offence , can not lay claim to any indulgence , even in view of the particularly well - organised nature of his activities ( the court has left aside the pagers , mobile phones , etc . used for ' contacts ' ) . The public prosecutor , for his part , sought an DATE term of imprisonment and the court endorses and imposes that sentence , which is still mild when it is borne in mind that the defendant is classified in law as a recidivist . A proportionate fine and continued detention , in addition , in order to ensure that the sentence is executed and that the offence is not repeated . Lastly , as an additional penalty , exclusion from national territory for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also sentenced the applicant 's mother and his partner , PERSON , to DATE imprisonment , suspended , for handling the proceeds of drug offences .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG increased the applicant 's sentence to DATE imprisonment and upheld the exclusion order . It observed , among other things :", "\u201c By LAW , a person is deemed to be a recidivist where , having already been convicted with final effect of an offence punishable by DATE imprisonment , he commits a further offence carrying a similar sentence within DATE of the expiry of the limitation period for enforcing the previous sentence .", "That was so in the case of ORG , who , having been sentenced by ORG on DATE , after adversarial proceedings , to DATE imprisonment for offences under the regulations on buying , possessing , using , trading in and transporting drugs , punishable under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , as applicable at the time , by a term of DATE imprisonment , and having completed that sentence on DATE , committed the offences with which he was charged , which likewise carry a sentence of DATE imprisonment pursuant to LAW , in the course of DATE and DATE .", "In convicting him on the charges set out in the order committing him for trial , the court below made a correct analysis of the facts of the case and drew the necessary legal inferences . Its judgment must therefore be upheld as to the finding of guilt .", "Despite having been convicted on DATE of drug offences relating to the possession of QUANTITY of cannabis resin , PERSON , with no declared income since DATE , had no hesitation in committing further drug offences , making a substantial profit which he shared with his family and amassing a sizeable fortune which he invested shrewdly .", "A total of QUANTITY of cannabis resin \u2013 a substance extremely harmful to the health of young people , in particular those living in poverty , who are exposed to the illegal and dangerous activities of unscrupulous individuals \u2013 was found at his home . He had asked PERSON , who had sought his help in finding a decent job , to sell hashish for him .", "Accordingly , both the nature and the seriousness of the accused 's conduct , reflecting a deep - seated inclination to crime for financial gain regardless of the risk to other people 's lives and occurring at a time when he was liable to be classified as a recidivist , dictate that he should be sentenced to DATE imprisonment ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on points of law , arguing , among other things , that his classification in law as a recidivist contravened the rule governing the application of successive criminal laws , ORG having retrospectively applied the harsher provisions of the new legislation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . It held that ORG had been justified in deeming him to be a recidivist , on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... where a law introduces new rules on recidivism , for them to apply immediately it is sufficient for the offence constituting the second component of recidivism \u2013 which the offender may choose to commit or not to commit DATE to have been committed after the law 's entry into force . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant is due for release on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Accordingly , new legislation may , without having retrospective effect , lay down the penalties that may be imposed in future for offences committed while it is in force ; the offender can not request the application of the penalties under the previous legislation for an offence committed since the new legislation has been in force , his status as a recidivist being determined by the new legislation . \u201d ( PERSON . crim . , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON )", "CARDINAL .
