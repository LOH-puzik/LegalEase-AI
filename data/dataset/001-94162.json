A NORP military officer picked out some of the prisoners , including the applicant , who were taken away . PERSON had not seen the applicant since .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government disputed that the applicants had been taken into captivity by the NORP army during the military action in GPE in DATE . They considered that the inevitable conclusion from the information provided in the application forms was that all the alleged \u201c missing persons \u201d , except PERSON , were military personnel who died in action during DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government noted that , since the introduction of these applications , files relating to the same \u201c missing persons \u201d had been submitted by ORG to ORG on ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in GPE during DATE . In these files there were no assertions that these people had been seen in any of the prisons in GPE . The names of the alleged witnesses listed in applications nos . CARDINAL ( Christakis Ioannou ) , CARDINAL ( PERSON ) , PERSON ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL ( Efstathios Selefcou ) , MONEY ( Costas Themistocleous ) and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( PERSON ) were not cited in support . The alleged sightings were therefore without foundation .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , who was a civilian , the respondent Government noted that the ICRC had visited ORG where he had allegedly been held but his name , contrary to the ORG assertion , did not appear in the list of NORP Cypriots held . In any event , it was a transit centre where people were not held for DATE before being released or moved elsewhere . In the file submitted to the ORG , there was only a reference to witnesses seeing the key case which he was alleged to always carry on his person . The materials of the ICRC , who paid regular visits to prisoners and internees in GPE , also showed that none of the alleged missing persons had been brought to GPE or detained . All prisoners that had been taken to GPE were repatriated DATE and DATE and lists of those concerned had been handed over to the NORP Cypriot authorities .", "DATE . As concerned the alleged identification of the missing persons in photographs , the Government pointed out that a scientific investigation of certain published photographs and documentary film had been carried out by Professor PERSON of ORG at the request of the third member of the ORG . This had shown that it was extremely dubious that anyone could be identified from these documents and that any alleged identification by relatives was unreliable given the quality of the material and their emotional feelings .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE submitted that the first applicants went missing in areas under the control of the NORP forces .", "CARDINAL . These CARDINAL applicants had been brought with their units to the area of PERSON to man NORP outposts along the front line . On DATE NORP armed forces launched the attack which gained them control over the whole of northern and eastern GPE by DATE . When the NORP forces broke through the NORP line of defence and advanced on PERSON , the NORP forces retreated and dispersed in all directions . The NORP forces rapidly gained control of the entire surrounding area . Many NORP soldiers , including the CARDINAL applicants , were hemmed in and completely surrounded . They could not have escaped as the intervening Government would have known of their fate .", "CARDINAL . This applicant was in charge of the soldiers who were defending ORG . After the NORP forces encircled ORG , the NORP forces were ordered to retreat . The applicant \u2019s group put on civilian clothing and unsuccessfully tried to break out of the village . When the NORP forces entered the village TIME , the applicant \u2019s group dispersed to avoid capture . At TIME on DATE , the applicant was seen by PERSON . Tampas in a warehouse tending a soldier with a head injury . Mr ORG was later captured and detained . His was the last reported sighting of the first applicant . It was most likely that the first applicant had remained with the injured man and was taken into detention by the NORP forces who were in control of the entire area . Only one man was known to have escaped from the village and he , unlike the first applicant , had local knowledge of the terrain .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under attack from the NORP army , the first applicant \u2019s unit was ordered to split into CARDINAL groups and withdraw westwards . The applicant \u2019s group reached the GPE - GPE road , QUANTITY metres from the \u201c Airkotissa \u201d restaurant . The applicant and another man were sent to investigate shouting coming from the restaurant . After TIME when they did not return , the group left for Panagra . At the time that the applicant and the other soldier were sent to the restaurant , there were NORP forces in the area . The most plausible explanation for the QUANTITY men not returning , in the absence of any sound of fighting or shooting , was that they had been detained , either to prevent them giving away the NORP positions , for information or as prisoners of war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was discovered to be missing from his unit at roll call after they had broken through encircling NORP forces . The area in which his unit had been stationed was captured by NORP forces . Whatever happened to the applicant afterwards occurred in an area controlled by the NORP forces .", "CARDINAL . This applicant was seen wounded in his right hand and on the left side of his ribcage after a clash between NORP forces and QUANTITY buses full of NORP soldiers coming from ORG village . His wounds were cleaned by a witness named PERSON and he was told to make his way uphill with CARDINAL other men , CARDINAL of whom was also injured , to the monastery where the NORP forces were . The other CARDINAL men were discovered dead DATE when the NORP forces withdrew . It was clear that the applicant had either been found dead by the NORP forces or , as was more likely , found and detained in an injured condition .", "CARDINAL . This applicant was among those attempting to prevent the invasion of GPE . Some individuals were identified as killed in the operation ; the applicant was not among them . The intervening Government had no evidence that this applicant was dead . It had to be assumed that the applicant had been detained alive .", "DATE . This was further corroborated by the photograph published in the Special News Bulletin , issued DATE by the NORP administration , on DATE , of NORP prisoners of war having their lunch . The first applicant was identified at the time by his father , the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . In their observations before ORG , the intervening Government provided a copy of a statement dated DATE by ORG taken by a police officer which stated that while being carried as a prisoner on a ship from GPE to GPE he had seen and spoken briefly to PERSON , whom he knew from school . They also provided a copy of the ICRC Central Tracing Agency sheet ( ref . no . EZG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) according to which PERSON had been sighted in a NORP army hospital in GPE in LOC . The intervening Government explained that they had not provided this information to the ORG as it had no mandate to investigate outside the territory of GPE and a policy decision had been taken when submitting documents to the ORG on DATE not to antagonise GPE whose cooperation was necessary if the ORG was to begin effective operation .", "CARDINAL . By DATE NORP forces were in control of northern and eastern GPE , including the NORP peninsula where the first applicant worked as general cashier in ORG in GPE . On DATE NORP and NORP soldiers arrived in the village and a NORP officer ordered a census of ORG DATE . DATE , the lists were handed over and NORP soldiers carried out searches . They left , taking with them on a bus , QUANTITY individuals , including the first applicant . This was reported by fellow villagers .", "CARDINAL . Turkish NORP came to the village in the circumstances reported by the applicants ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . They had the CARDINAL keys for a safe , which the first applicant always carried with him . It was highly probable that ORG had obtained the keys by informing those holding the first applicant , showing that he was alive and in detention for DATE . There was some evidence that he was detained after DATE , at least until DATE , at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The list of persons seen by the PERSON detained at FAC on CARDINAL DATE included ORG , which was the name under which this first applicant had been recorded ( the first name being misspelled and the surname of his father ( PERSON ) , as appearing on the first applicant \u2019s identity card , also being misspelled ) .", "CARDINAL . An affidavit dated DATE by ORG , a lawyer of the firm representing the applicants in this application , was submitted to ORG . It stated that the son of the missing man , Mr PERSON , recounted that at DATE he had met a NORP writer who had informed him that , while investigating disappearances , she had discovered evidence indicating that the QUANTITY missing persons from PERSON had been buried near the NORP village of GPE . When the son conveyed this information to the ORG he was informed that the inhabitants of GPE had already given information to the ORG about the execution and burial of NORP prisoners near their village .", "CARDINAL . This first applicant withdrew with his section from ORG towards GPE . They were ambushed by NORP military forces and dispersed . There has been no news of the applicant since . The intervening Government had no knowledge of the first applicant , which meant that he had not escaped . Nor was there any evidence that he was killed in the ambush . It was more than likely that he had been detained by the NORP armed forces .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the context of the activity of the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , human remains were exhumed from a mass grave near the NORP village of GPE in the NORP area . After anthropological and genetic analyses , the remains of PERSON ( named as the first applicant in application no . CARDINAL ) were identified , along with the remains of the other CARDINAL missing persons from GPE and CARDINAL other missing NORP Cypriots . The bodies of the CARDINAL missing persons from Yialousa were lined up next to each other in the grave , with CARDINAL other bodies on top close to the ground surface . The forensic report dated CARDINAL DATE detailed the process of exhumation and noted that it appeared to be a primary and synchronous burial site as the condition of the bodies indicated that they were buried while soft tissue was still present and placed in direct contact with each other . According to the report , the main object of the analysis of the human remains was their identification .", "CARDINAL . Several bullets from firearms were found in the grave . In regard to PERSON , the medical certificate for the cause of death , signed by a doctor on DATE , indicated bullet wounds to the skull and right arm and a wound to the right thigh . His family was notified and a religious funeral took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was officially set up in DATE .

According to its terms of reference , it \u2018 shall only look into cases of persons reported missing in the intercommunal fighting as well as in the events of DATE and ORG . Its tasks have been circumscribed as follows : \u2018 to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities , specifying as appropriate whether they are alive or dead , and in the latter case approximate time of the deaths\u2019 . It was further specified that \u2018 the committee will not attempt to attribute responsibility for the deaths of any missing persons or make findings as to the cause of such deaths\u2019 and that \u2018 no disinterment will take place under the aegis of this committee . The committee may refer requests for disinterment to the LAW for processing under its customary GPE . \u2018 All parties concerned\u2019 are required to cooperate with the committee to ensure access throughout the island for its investigative work . Nothing is provided as regards investigations in mainland GPE or concerning the NORP armed forces in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG consists of CARDINAL members , CARDINAL \u2018 humanitarian person\u2019 being appointed by the NORP side and one by the NORP side and the third member being an \u2018 official selected by the ICRC ... with the agreement of both sides and appointed by the Secretary - General of the LOC Nations\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has no permanent chairman , the presidency rotating on a DATE basis between all CARDINAL members . Decisions are to be taken by consensus to the extent possible . According to the procedural rules agreed upon in DATE , the procedure is to be conducted as follows :", "\u2018 CARDINAL . Individual or collective cases will be presented to the ORG with all possible information . The ORG will refer each case to the side on whose territory the missing person disappeared ; this side will undertake a complete research and present to the ORG a written report . It is the duty of the ORG members appointed by each side , or their assistants , to follow the enquiries undertaken on the territory of their side ; the third member and/or his assistants will be fully admitted to participate in the enquiries .", "CARDINAL . The ORG will make case decisions on the basis of the elements furnished by both sides and by ORG of the ICRC : presumed alive , dead , disappeared without visible or other traceable signs .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the ORG is unable to reach a conclusion on the basis of the information presented , a supplementary investigation will be undertaken at the request of a ORG member . The third ORG member and/or his assistants will participate in each supplementary investigation , or , as the case may be , investigators recruited by the ORG with the agreement of both sides.\u2019", "CARDINAL . The DATE rules state as \u2018 guiding principles\u2019 that \u2018 investigations will be conducted in the sole interest of the families concerned and must therefore convince them . Every possible means will be used to trace the fate of the missing ORG . The families of missing persons may address communications to the committee which will be passed on to its appropriate member . That member will eventually provide the family with \u2018 final information as to the fate of a particular missing person\u2019 , but no interim information must be given by any member of the committee to the family of a missing person during the discussion of a particular case .", "CARDINAL . The committee \u2019s entire proceedings and findings are strictly confidential , but it can issue public statements or reports without prejudice to this rule . According to the DATE procedural rules , a press release will be issued at the close of a meeting or series of meetings and occasional progress reports will also be published . Individual members may make additional statements to the press or the media , provided they comply with the rule of confidentiality , avoid criticism or contradiction to the joint statement and any kind of propaganda .", "CARDINAL . Due to the strict confidentiality of the ORG \u2019s procedure , no detailed information about the progress and results of its work is available . However , from the relevant sections of the regular progress reports on ORG in GPE submitted by the ORG Secretary - General to ORG it appears that the committee \u2019s work started in DATE with a limited , equal number of cases on both sides ( Doc . S/CARDINAL , of CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) ; that by DATE an advanced stage had been reached in the investigation of the initial CARDINAL individual cases , supplementary investigations being started in CARDINAL cases in which reports had been submitted ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/Add . CARDINAL , of DATE , para . CARDINAL ) ; and that , while no difficulties were encountered as regards the organisation of interviews or visits in the field , real difficulties then arose by the lapse of time and , even more importantly , lack of cooperation by the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . This prompted the committee to issue a lengthy press release on DATE ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/Annex ) . There the committee stated that it considered the cooperation of the witnesses as absolutely fundamental , but that the witnesses were often reluctant , unwilling or unable to give full information as to their knowledge about the disappearance of a missing person . However , the committee could not compel a witness to talk . The explanation of the witnesses\u2019 reluctance to testify was that they were afraid of incriminating themselves or others in disappearances , and this despite the witnesses being told by the committee that the information given would be kept strictly confidential and being reassured that they would \u2018 not be subject to any form of police or judicial prosecution\u2019 . The committee appealed to the parties concerned to encourage the witnesses to give the very fullest information in their knowledge . It further stated :", "\u2018 In order to further allay the fears of the witnesses , the committee , so as to give the strongest guarantees to the witnesses , is examining measures that could be taken to ensure that they would be immune from possible judicial and/or police proceedings solely in connection with the issue of missing persons and for any statement , written or oral , made for the committee in the pursuit of activities within its mandate.\u2019", "CARDINAL . In the same press release , the committee pointed out that it considered as legitimate the desire of the families to obtain identifiable remains of missing persons . However , despite systematic enquiries on burial places of missing persons , on both sides , it had not been successful in this respect .

In its judgment on the merits ( DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , the PERSON considered the disappearance as marking the beginning of a \u201c continuing situation \u201d .

The PERSON came to a similar conclusion in cases of disappearances in which the victim \u2019s whereabouts had never been established . In Serrano- PERSON v.

In a more recent judgment , Heliodoro GPE v.

It was competent to examine the following violations arising out of the disappearance : the deprivation of liberty of the victim ( Article CARDINAL ) , the violation of the relatives\u2019 right to humane treatment ( Article CARDINAL ) , the non - compliance with the obligation to investigate into the alleged disappearance , the failure to incriminate forced disappearances and tortures in domestic law and the failure to investigate and punish acts of torture . On the merits , the ORG went on to find a violation of the right to liberty ( Article CARDINAL ) and a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG on Forced Disappearance of Persons with regard to the deceased .

DATE on LAW and QUANTITY of the LAW , emphasised that the failure to investigate in respect of grave violations such as enforced disappearances or torture , as well as the failure to bring to justice perpetrators of such violations , could give rise to a separate breach of the LAW .

GPE , DATE , ORG , although describing enforced disappearance as a continuing act , noted that the original acts of arrest and abduction , as well as the refusal to give information about the deprivation of freedom , had occurred before the entry into force of the Covenant for Chile . The ORG further considered that the author had made no reference to any action of the ORG after the crucial date ( entry into force of the Optional Protocol ) that would constitute \u201c a confirmation of the enforced disappearance \u201d .

CARDINAL ) , the ORG applied this act of confirmation approach , and also changed its analysis in considering a failure to investigate a death which had taken place prior to the critical date . Although it found that it had no jurisdiction ratione temporis over the death of PERSON PERSON , it went on to consider the subsequent proceedings and failure to correct his death warrant ( which stated the cause of death as natural ) and their effect on PERSON wife and CARDINAL children . It found that there had been a failure to conduct an inquiry into PERSON death , to prosecute those responsible and to conclude legal proceedings begun by the author to remedy this situation .
