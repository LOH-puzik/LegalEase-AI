THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Remainder inadmissible;Damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and , at the time of lodging his application with the ORG , was serving a sentence of imprisonment in ORG ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , in response to an increase in the availability of heroin in GPE , the police commenced \u201c FAC \u201d , to identify and target those responsible . On the basis of intelligence reports the police reached the conclusion that the applicant was the head of a group of NORP drug traffickers operating in the area . Video recordings made of his house and his itemised telephone bill indicated that he was in regular contact with suspected drug dealers from elsewhere in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with ORG ( \u201c the LAW : see paragraphs CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment , cited in paragraph CARDINAL below ) the Chief Constable authorised the use of a covert listening device in the applicant \u2019s house . On DATE the applicant was arrested for suspected car theft and a warrant was obtained to search his house for documents relating to motor vehicles . When executing the warrant the police covertly installed listening and recording equipment inside his house . Recordings were made between DATE and DATE . The Chief Constable \u2019s authorisation had been obtained for the entire period , except DATE and DATE , when the authorisation had lapsed and not been renewed , due to an oversight .", "CARDINAL . It was the prosecution \u2019s case at the subsequent trial that the recordings obtained in this way revealed detailed discussions between the applicant and his co - accused demonstrating their involvement in conspiracies to import and distribute Class A drugs , in particular heroin .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested , together with a number of alleged associates , and charged with conspiracy to import and supply Class A drugs . He and his co - accused applied to have the prosecution struck out for abuse of process and/or the recordings excluded from evidence . On DATE the trial judge ruled against the defendants , observing as follows :", "\u201c I respectfully note the conclusion of ORG rights in the case of PERSON v. the GPE , adopted DATE , to the effect that the use of covert listening devices in accordance with the Guidelines is not done in accordance with the law and is thus in breach of LAW , because in GPE there is as yet no legally binding publicly accessible body of law regulating such activity . I bear in mind that the Convention is not yet part of our law , but that where possible domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with Convention principles .", "I take into account that in intruding on the privacy of ORG \u2019s home the police will have committed civil trespass and possibly criminal damage . I take into account that there may have been conduct outside FAC , in that the authority for the continued use of the listening device may not have been in place DATE and DATE . On the other hand , I bear in mind my finding that the police followed the LAW to the letter in all other respects and did not intend deliberately to circumvent the requirement to obtain the Chief Constable \u2019s authority . I take into account that the police acted in good faith throughout in pursuit of the public good in the detection and prosecution of very serious crime . Balancing these factors , I \u2019m satisfied that there is no evidence of abuse of power by the police which could found the basis for a stay of the proceedings as being an abuse of process . ...", "I turn next to consider the court \u2019s exclusionary power under s. CARDINAL of ORG . ... Being in tape recorded form there \u2019s unlikely to be dispute about [ the evidence \u2019s ] authenticity . It is highly relevant and potentially probative of the defendants\u2019 involvement in the conspiracies alleged . It did not result from incitement , entrapment or inducements , or other conduct of that sort . The fact that the defendants may not have said what they did if they PERSON known the police were listening in does not mean that reception of evidence of what they said is unfair . The potential branches of the civil or criminal law and LAW and the possible lack of the Chief Constable \u2019s authority between certain dates do not affect the quality of the evidence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following this ruling , the applicant absconded . He was convicted in his absence on DATE , and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant was arrested DATE , at which point he appealed against conviction , arguing that the covertly obtained recordings should not have been used at trial and that he had made the damaging recorded statements only because he had been entrapped into so doing by participating informants . His renewed application was rejected by the full ORG on DATE , on the grounds that the trial judge \u2019s ruling of DATE was irreproachable and that there was no evidence of entrapment or any other abusive action on the part of the police ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
