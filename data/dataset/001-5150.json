The post mortem examination carried out on DATE resulted in a finding that it was likely that she had died on DATE TIME from a loss of blood caused by stab wounds . The autopsy conducted on DATE confirmed this finding .", "On DATE and DATE respectively , the deputy public prosecutor ( hulpofficier van justitie ) ordered the police to conduct a search of the crime scene and the adjacent allotments . A plaster cast was made of the bicycle tire tracks found at the crime scene . No other traces were found .", "On DATE , PERSON gave a statement to the police to the effect that , at TIME , she had seen the victim , a friend of her daughter , sitting on the back of a pink lady \u2019s bicycle ridden by a man . She gave a description of this man \u2019s features and clothes .", "Given certain factual similarities of the killing of F. and the killing of a young girl in DATE of which the applicant had been found guilty , the police placed him under observation as from DATE . On DATE , upon request of the public prosecutor , a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) against the applicant was opened . On DATE , the applicant was arrested and detained on remand . On that occasion the police also seized , amongst other items , a coat and a pink and white lady \u2019s bicycle found in the applicant \u2019s home .", "The police interrogated the applicant repeatedly . During some of these interrogations in DATE , the interrogating police officers used a specific interrogation technique ; the so - called \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d . The applicant did not make any confession statement .", "Upon the order of the deputy public prosecutor , the ditches in the area of the crime scene were searched on DATE , which resulted in the finding of a blade , apparently broken off a pocket knife . Furthermore , on DATE , a pocket knife with a missing blade was found in a ditch .", "On DATE , the forensic laboratory informed the investigating authorities that the bicycle tire tracks found on the crime scene globally corresponded with the rear tire of a bicycle seized in the applicant \u2019s home , but that no characteristic similarities had been found . The front tire of the bicycle seized did not correspond with the tracks found .", "On DATE , the forensic laboratory informed the investigating authorities that fibres discovered in the pocket knife found on DATE corresponded , given the colour and material , with a coat seized in the applicant \u2019s home and that the blade found on DATE could have caused the stabbing holes in the victim \u2019s clothes .", "According to a report of DATE by the forensic laboratory on the investigation of fibres found on the coat seized in the applicant \u2019s home on DATE and the coat of the victim , it was very well possible that both coats had been in contact with each other .", "At some unspecified point in time , the applicant was summoned to appear before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on charges in relation to F. \u2019s killing .", "By judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of the GPE .", "On DATE , ORG took evidence from the applicant , from the witness PERSON and from the expert - witness PERSON , an official of the forensic laboratory .", "On DATE , ORG granted the request of the defence to be provided with copies of the tapes of the applicant \u2019s interrogations by the police . It further ordered the applicant \u2019s examination at ORG of FAC ( PERSON het GPE ) .", "On DATE , ORG rejected a request by the defence to make funds available to the defence in order to enable the defence to commission CARDINAL or more experts .", "In its report dated DATE , ORG stated , inter alia , that the applicant was suffering from a serious personality disorder with narcissistic , dependent and anti - social features . It was further found that he was incapable of adequately expressing his aggression and to regulate his aggression when such feelings would emerge . Consequently , his behaviour could be both impulsive and explosive . The report also stated that there continued to be a distinct likelihood of repetition of aggressive behaviour towards women and girls .", "On DATE , ORG took evidence from PERSON , a psychologist who had examined the applicant in ORG over a period of DATE . She declared , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s examination had disclosed a great discrepancy between his verbal and performal IQ , which expressed itself in the applicant \u2019s case by a specific disorder , i.e. a nearly total inability to read and write . In her opinion , there were no indications that this disorder caused mental problems in other areas . She stated that , for instance , his capacity for concentration was very good and that he was able to compensate his handicap by a reasonably good memory .", "On DATE , ORG took evidence from QUANTITY police officers who had been involved in the applicant \u2019s interrogations and from Mr PERSON , the communication expert who had assisted the police in their interrogations of the applicant .", "By judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of homicide and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . In addition , ORG imposed a post - sentence confinement order ( \u201c ORG - order \u201d ; terbeschikkingstelling ) with compulsory treatment at public expense ( met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ) .", "ORG rejected the request by the defence for an adjournment of the court \u2019s examination in order to seek further evidence from experts as to the applicant \u2019s mental health , interrogation techniques and the forensic findings . It held on this point that this concerned in fact requests for a counter - expertise and considered that the defence had had sufficient opportunity to obtain this . It concluded that the criminal investigation authorities had carried out sufficient investigations and that it considered itself to be sufficiently informed .", "As regards the admissibility of the prosecution , the judgment of DATE , insofar as relevant , reads :", "< Translation >", "\u201c The examination of the arguments submitted by the defence consist of CARDINAL parts , those submitted by PERSON ( I ) and those submitted by Ms Later ( II ) .", "( I ) . According to PERSON , the public prosecution department must be declared inadmissible in its prosecution , because the actions of the police and the prosecution in the criminal investigation are , to a too large extent , contrary to the requirements of a fair trial .", "In the first place , the combination of a ) premature investigatory activities and b ) the manner of interrogation ( use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d ) constitutes a gross violation of the prohibition of pressure set out in LAW ) and of the requirements of a fair trial ( LAW ) .", "Secondly , by keeping secret the use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d and the calling in of the expert PERSON , the finding of truth has suffered to such an extent that , also on that ground , it can no longer be held that there has been a fair trial .", "\u2026", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , the suspect has been observed for DATE , during which several \u201c indications \u201d have been gathered . This observation was an unlawful act of investigation , as on that moment the suspicion of guilt was absolutely insufficient . The suspicion of < the applicant > was only based on the fact that there appeared to be similarities in the modus operandi between the present fact and the fact of DATE . This comparison is , however , incorrect .", "CARDINAL.b . Although the defence suspects that the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d has been used as from the outset , the objections of the defence are aimed in particular at the interrogations having taken place on DATE and DATE under the direction of PERSON . At the beginning of the interrogation on DATE , the birthday of the suspect \u2019s daughter who is about the same age as the victim ( creative extension of the collage of photographs of family and victim ) , TIME are spent talking about trivialities . Subsequently the thumbscrews are tightened and the suspicion is brought up . By sitting close to the < suspect > , by the ORG encircling of the < suspect > , unbridled pressure is exerted on the < suspect>. Despite the emotionally deplorable situation of the suspect , the interrogators have pursued the interrogations in as much as possible . The particular personality features of the suspect have in no way been taken into account .", "This manner of interrogation is unlawful and in violation of the prohibition of pressure .", "ORG According to the defence , the police and justice < department > consider the named PERSON as an expert . His appointment only becomes apparent in the public prosecutor \u2019s official report of DATE ; also the investigation judge , who was aware of the calling in of PERSON , has remained silent about this . Both the police officers involved and the investigation judge should have recorded in TIME the activities of PERSON - the judge ( and also the defence ) need to be enabled to verify the application of methods and means of investigation - and further PERSON should have made a report . \u2026", "The court rejects these arguments .", "Ad CARDINAL.a . The following has appeared during the trial :", "On DATE , near the allotments complex Loolaan \u2026 in GPE , the victim was found , the upper part < of the body > dressed , jeans and underpants pulled down . She was killed by a large number of stab wounds , no traces of sexual violence were found . A partially broken off bush was found at a distance of QUANTITY . The girl had been seen TIME with a man < sitting > on the back of a bicycle . On DATE , CARDINAL of the police officers involved in the investigation checked the police administration for facts that , qua modus operandi , were similar to the present case . He found the following : In DATE , in the dunes near \u2026 , a DATE girl was found dead , she was partially undressed , pants and underpants had been pulled down . She had been killed by stab wounds , no traces of sexual violence were found . The girl was covered with branches . In relation to these facts , the accused was placed at the Government \u2019s disposal ( ter beschikking PERSON gesteld ) .", "It was subsequently determined that the applicant \u2019s home is located at a distance of QUANTITY from the < present > crime scene . CARDINAL police officers involved in the investigation \u2026 on DATE \u2026 saw the applicant looking outside through the window < of his home > and found that he resembled a composition drawing made on the basis of a witness statement . The court considers that the foregoing constituted a sufficient suspicion of guilt for further investigatory activities against the suspect . In that context \u2026 the suspect was observed for some time on CARDINAL and DATE . \u2026 There is no question of a premature prosecution activity , so that the < applicant \u2019s > observation by the police neither in itself nor in combination with the manner of interrogation constitutes a violation as argued .", "Ad CARDINAL.b . As to this < point > the following has appeared during the trial :", "In DATE PERSON , a communication expert , has become involved in the case because the team that interrogated the accused had internal problems and because the investigation had reached deadlock .", "In DATE of CARDINAL and DATE PERSON has spoken for the first time with the team and has offered his assistance in the interrogation of the suspect . The only time he had available for this was DATE . In DATE , the suspect has been interrogated at length during which the team members sat close to him . In an adjacent room , the interrogation was watched and listened to by PERSON , who drew the police ORG attention to various communication signals . During this interrogation use was made of collages of photographs in which , inter alia , CARDINAL photographs of the suspect \u2019s family members were displayed around a photograph of the victim . The court considers this use of family photographs in a collage of this kind contrary to the requirements of a fair trial . The infringement of these requirements thus made is - also in the light of the exceptional seriousness of the fact - in the court \u2019s opinion neither in itself nor in connection with what has appeared in respect of the interrogations of such gravity that this should lead to the inadmissibility of the prosecution .", "Ad CARDINAL . It has not appeared from the case - file or otherwise that the police and justice < department > ( and the investigating judge ) considered PERSON as an expert within the meaning of LAW . A report by PERSON is therefore not required .", "The court further considers that - apart from the question whether this was required - that the suspect \u2019s rights have not been neglected as argued by the failure to mention the assistance by PERSON , as the use of the contested collage of photographs appears already sufficiently from the case - file .", "Counsel has referred in various places , in support of his pleadings , to LAW and the case - law of ORG . Also considered along those lines , the court does not reach other findings than those set out above .", "( II ) Apparently in the context of her primary argument that the public prosecution should be declared inadmissible , counsel Ms Later , in addition to what PERSON has already submitted in relation to ORG , has argued that in this case various other provisions of the Convention have been violated .", "a ) Counsel has placed the manner of interrogation of the suspect by the police and the use of the so - called method \u201c Hoenderdos \u201d in the context of LAW ; inhuman treatment .", "\u2026", "d ) Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL sub b would be violated because the defence has insufficient facilities . This provision is submitted in conjunction with", "e ) Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , access to court , which provision is violated because , for lack of financial means , the suspect has in fact not been enabled to defend himself in the proceedings .", "f ) By the withholding of information , in particular information about the method \u201c Hoenderdos \u201d , the principle of fair trial and in particular < the principle of > equality of arms , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , has been violated , also by the public prosecutor \u2019s selection of investigation data , the public prosecutor \u2019s approaching of the judges\u2019 chamber about a judicial on - site inspection and the conducting of a search of the LOC of ORG for FAC without informing the defence of this .", "g ) Finally a violation of LAW is argued , because there was insufficient indication of guilt , so that the < suspect \u2019s > situation of detention must be considered as contrary to this provision .", "Ad a. The court has already expressed itself about the use of the method \u201c Hoenderdos \u201d in the present case and the consequences to be attached to this .", "Noting the seriousness of the act committed , the court considers the intensity of the interrogations not of such a nature that these < interrogations > justify the qualification of inhuman treatment .", "\u2026", "Ad d and e. After the preparation of the case before the court , it has been examined for the first time on DATE . Subsequently , on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , further examinations on the substance have taken place . Taking into account that the case must be dealt with within a reasonable time , the court considers that the defence has been provided with sufficient facilities during that period to investigate what it wished to investigate .", "The counter - investigations at the expense of < the > justice < department > , as wished by the suspect , have been refused by the court , since the contention that the suspect has a right to a counter - expertise at the ORG \u2019s expense finds no support in the law . On that ground , the absence of facilities and financial means can not have as consequence the inadmissibility of the prosecution .", "Ad f. It has not been established that information , essential for his defence , has been withheld from the suspect . As to the withholding of information about the method \u201c Hoenderdos \u201d the court refers to it remarks already stated above . It has also not been established \u2026 that there has been an unbalanced compilation of the case - file . That the defence was not informed of a request by the prosecutor for a judicial on - site inspection and < that the defence > has not been informed , prior or during this search , of the search of the LOC of ORG for ORG can not lead to the inadmissibility of the prosecution . The circumstances are thereto of insufficient weight .", "Ad g. In the light of the following decision of the court , this < point > does not warrant examination . \u201d", "ORG based the applicant \u2019s conviction on , inter alia , his evidence to the trial courts , statements made by the witness PERSON to the police and the court , and on police and forensic reports . On the basis of the cruelty of the facts , the applicant \u2019s diminished responsibility at the time of the offence and the high risk that the applicant would repeat aggressive behaviour towards women and girls , ORG decided to impose not only a criminal sanction but also a post - sentence confinement order with compulsory treatment at public expense .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had unjustly held that there had been a fair trial and equality of arms between the public prosecution and the defence , ORG held that ORG had correctly found that the use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d was incompatible with the requirements of a fair trial . It further accepted as correct ORG findings as to the question whether there were sufficient suspicions against the applicant to justify further investigatory measures .", "As regards the manner in which the applicant had been interrogated by the police , ORG did not exclude that , under certain circumstances , unlawful activities of the criminal investigation and prosecution authorities could result in such a serious violation of the principles of a fair trial that these should lead to the inadmissibility of the prosecution . However , such a far reaching sanction could only follow where it would concern serious violations of those principles by , deliberately or with gross negligence , disrespecting the suspect \u2019s interests in his right to a fair hearing of his case . In the impossibility to give a general rule on this point , this question needed to be examined on a case to case basis .", "After having noted ORG findings in the present case as to the interrogations at issue and in particular the specific part which ORG had correctly found to be in violation of the requirements of a fair trial , ORG accepted ORG conclusion that these interrogations were not of such a nature that it should result in the inadmissibility of the prosecution .", "ORG further considered the applicant \u2019s complaint that the defence had not sufficiently been enabled to avail itself of investigatory possibilities in that ORG had rejected his request to make funds available to him in order to allow him to take initiatives aimed at obtaining a counter - expertise whereas he did not have any funds himself to do so . He explained that he had wished to submit counter - expert evidence in relation to the investigation made of his personality , on some material evidence and on the interrogation method used by the police .", "ORG noted that the applicant had had several possibilities during the pre - trial stage of the proceedings to obtain , at the ORG \u2019s expense , further investigations and further counter - expert evidence . ORG further noted that the experts , who had carried out an examination of the applicant \u2019s personality or the material evidence , had been heard before the trial court and that the defence had been able to put questions to them . As regards the interrogation technique used by the police , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s statements used in evidence were statements given either before the investigating judge or before the trial court .", "ORG held that , in these circumstances , ORG rejection of the applicant \u2019s requests for further expert evidence on the basis of a finding that the investigation had been sufficient could not be regarded as unreasonable . It further considered that ORG had correctly held that the applicant \u2019s contention that the ORG has to bear the costs of any investigation requested by the defence , in its generality , is not supported by the law and that this is not in conflict with LAW .", "The ORG court also considered that ORG had rejected on correct grounds the arguments raised by the defence about withholding information to the defence and the compilation of the case - file .", "B.

Before the hearing the suspect is informed that he is not obliged to answer .", "\u2026 \u201d", "On DATE , following the national broadcast of a television programme in which the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d was discussed , a Member of ORG put questions about this interrogation technique to the Minister of ORG , who decided to seek the views of ORG ( PERSON ; hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) as to the lawfulness and functionality of this method .", "On DATE , the Minister of Justice informed ORG that , once she would have taken notice of the final outcome of CARDINAL trials in which the lawfulness of this method had been raised as well as the ORG advice , she would take a final decision as to the acceptability of this interrogation technique . In the meantime , she had instructed the public prosecution department to suspend the use of this technique . In DATE , in conformity with the advice contained in the ORG report of DATE , the Minister of ORG decided to prohibit the use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d .", "The PERSON report describes the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d as an interrogation technique based on the so - called CASE CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) communication method . The method was developed by a communication expert and was further elaborated for police practices .", "CASE DATE is described in the report as a communication method focussing in particular on the way in which a person internally perceives the outside world . The application of the CASE CARDINAL technique allows to obtain a very accurate picture of the behaviour of a person and the internal processes on which this behaviour is based , thus enabling to communicate effectively ( a correct statement by the suspect ) and efficiently ( within a short time ) .", "The CASE CARDINAL technique is based on ORG ( ORG ) ; originally a form of psychotherapy . ORG has been defined as \u201c the study of the structure of subjective experience \u201d . ORG provides a model of human behaviour and communication which answers questions like \u201c How does a person behave in relation to his environment , how does he take in information and how does he process this information ? \u201d An interrogation according to the CASE CARDINAL communication method is aimed at the creation of a tie between the suspect and interrogators through which an optimal communication must become possible and thus to attain the truth via communication .", "The actual interrogation is prepared by planning certain steps to be taken during the interrogation . This planning includes , amongst other things , the allocation of individual roles ( father figure , specialist , analyst , person of confidence ) to each member of the interrogation team . Furthermore , a preliminary meeting with the suspect takes place in order to find out which pattern of thought ( in detail or global ) he uses and what his \u201c focal points \u201d are , i.e. to what points he looks when he is not specifically asked to look at something . A determination of \u201c focal points \u201d is relevant for the making of \u201c visual chronological lines \u201d .", "In having the suspect draw ( visual ) chronological lines during the interrogation , it is attempted to verify when what has taken place . This takes place , inter alia , by making a suspect relive an experience in his mind . If a suspect has a auditive preference , there is a bigger chance of communication and a reliving when he is made to listen to recordings , like telephone conversations . Has the suspect a sensory preference , the chance of communication is bigger when having him touch an object found at the crime scene , whereas in case of a visual preference , he can be shown photographs of the crime scene .", "In case a suspect has a \u201c focal point \u201d on a particular spot on a wall , it is possible to place photographs there . He will unconsciously look at them after which , as the intention is , he will remember facts insofar as he has been responsible for them . The showing of photographs includes both photographs connected to the offence and photographs linked to the suspect \u2019s person , like photographs of his spouse or children . These CARDINAL kinds of photographs are either shown separately or combined with each other .", "The interrogation team leader and the external communication expert watch and listen to the interrogation in another room . There are CARDINAL hidden cameras covering the entire interrogation room and CARDINAL hidden camera aimed at the suspect \u2019s face . The suspect is informed that the interrogations are recorded but does not know where the cameras are . The interrogators receive instructions via earphones from the team leader or the external communication expert during the interrogation . The interrogation is constantly adapted to the suspect \u2019s behaviour . The suspect \u2019s non - verbal communication is followed and whether his behaviour is congruent , i.e. whether his body language is in conformity with his verbal expressions . Other features of this interrogation technique are the copying of a suspect \u2019s physical behaviour which is intended to reassure the suspect and the so - called \u201c pushing in \u201d , i.e. to push CARDINAL by CARDINAL and at a deliberate moment the chairs of each interrogator close to the suspect until in the end all interrogators sit intimately around the suspect .", "The interrogations are conducted within DATE , lasting on average TIME per day depending on how the interrogation proceeds .", "", "Under Article CARDINAL - e of LAW , a trial court may - in addition to a criminal sanction and if the protection of public order so requires - issue a confinement order ( ORG order ) in respect of a perpetrator of an offence , who has been found guilty and who has been found to have a mental disorder and to be dangerous .
