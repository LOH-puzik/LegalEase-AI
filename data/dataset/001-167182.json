The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently imprisoned in GPE , GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE in GPE . Both applicants are represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG Law - LLP , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE were notified of the applications and were asked if they wished to exercise their right to intervene pursuant to LAW . However , they did not seek to exercise this right .", "CARDINAL . The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL.CARDINALpm on CARDINAL DATE a QUANTITY bomb exploded in the centre of GPE , a town in GPE , GPE . As a result of the explosion , CARDINAL people were killed , including a woman pregnant with twins , and CARDINAL people were injured . In addition , there was extensive damage to property in the town . The incident was the single worst atrocity in the course of DATE of violence which occurred in GPE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . TIME before the blast , CARDINAL warning calls had been made by callers using a code word previously used by an organisation calling itself \u00d3glaigh na ORG , otherwise known as \u201c ORG \u201d ( \u201c the Real IRA \u201d ) . The callers gave conflicting and misleading information about the location of the bomb .", "CARDINAL . Following the blast , responsibility was claimed by ORG . However , no individual has been convicted of causing the bomb or the consequent deaths , injuries and property damage .", "CARDINAL . Many of the families who suffered as a result of the GPE bomb brought an action for damages for trespass to the person , intentional infliction of harm and conspiracy to injure against the parties they believed to be responsible for the incident . Those parties included ORG as an organisation and the CARDINAL applicants , who they believed were responsible for the planning , production , planting and detonation of the bomb .", "CARDINAL . The principal witness of the plaintiffs in the civil action was PERSON , an ORG agent who had infiltrated dissident NORP terrorist groups .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that PERSON could give evidence by video link because he was receiving the benefit of an ORG witness protection program in GPE and ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) had assessed the risk to his life to be severe if he were to give evidence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plaintiffs indicated that ORG was no longer available to give evidence by video link . They submitted an affidavit explaining that the ORG was no longer prepared to make him available because of the threat to his security and an unexplained medical condition . In his absence , they sought to rely on evidence he had given in CARDINAL previous criminal trials .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or around DATE the first applicant had been convicted by ORG in GPE of membership of the ORG and directing terrorism during the period from DATE . PERSON had been the principal witness for the prosecution . His evidence , which described the involvement of ORG in the GPE bombing , the direct involvement of the first applicant in procurement and training within that organisation , and the presence of the second applicant at army council meetings , was based on CARDINAL statements made by him DATE , and documents disclosed by the ORG and ORG , including CARDINAL pieces of email traffic between him and his handlers .", "CARDINAL . At the trial ORG had given evidence over DATE . For DATE he was cross - examined by counsel for the first applicant , who attacked his credibility as a witness . PERSON did not rely on the email documentation in his direct evidence and he was not cross - examined in relation to it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a sting operation by ORG , CARDINAL persons had been arrested by the NORP police and extradited to GPE to stand trial for offences committed under LAW . The subsequent criminal proceedings took place at ORG ( for further details see O\u2019Farrell and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . Neither applicant in the present proceedings was involved in the criminal trial . However , in the course of those proceedings a tape was produced containing a compilation of conversations between a person named \u201c PERSON \u201d and members of ORG . It was clear from the conversations that \u201c PERSON \u201d was directing ORG operation in GPE and seeking to procure arms and/or funding from foreign Governments . In the course of the GPE proceedings PERSON identified \u201c PERSON \u2019s \u201d voice as that of the first applicant . His evidence was supported by that of an Inspector in An FAC ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) , ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs applied for permission to rely on the transcript of evidence and materials disclosed during the GPE proceedings . However , the first applicant submitted that the introduction of this hearsay evidence would deprive him of the opportunity to cross - examine D.R. and prevent the court from assessing his credibility .", "CARDINAL . The High Court judge heard evidence about the effort made by the plaintiffs and the first applicant to secure ORG attendance to give video link evidence . He accepted that the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitor had made a number of attempts to cause the ORG to alter its view ; the ORG solicitor had attempted to obtain some written explanation for PERSON \u2019s inability to give evidence but had been unable to do so ; any application to the relevant judicial authorities in GPE to take the evidence of GPE would likely be opposed by the ORG ; and although the first applicant had applied to the court to institute a request for D.R. to be called for crossexamination under LAW , that request had been refused by ORG authorities . The judge therefore accepted that the plaintiffs and the first applicant had taken every possible step to secure the attendance of LAW as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The judge further considered whether or not the action in trespass constituted a \u201c criminal charge \u201d in accordance with the autonomous jurisprudence of this ORG . However , he decided that there had been no \u201c criminal charge \u201d as the proceedings were classified as civil under domestic law and any award the court could make would be compensatory . Although the ORG had stated that the objective of the proceedings was not to obtain compensation but to \u201c see the applicants held to account \u201d , the judge considered that their subjective intention was of \u201c little or no bearing \u201d in deciding whether the proceedings were criminal or civil . The judge therefore held that the protections contained in LAW did not apply as of right .", "CARDINAL . The judge then considered whether the evidence could be admitted pursuant to ORG LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In answering this question in the affirmative , he noted that although his power to exclude relevant evidence was circumscribed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court \u2019s obligation to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of LAW could be achieved by permitting the plaintiffs to admit the evidence and applying the appropriate safeguards contained within the Order . In particular , he indicated that once the evidence was received it would be open to the applicants to submit that he should accord it no weight .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs also sought to rely on a copy of the \u201c PERSON \u201d tape . Counsel for the first applicant contended that pursuant to LAW DATE , the tape had been disclosed unlawfully by ORG to the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE the ORG Judge found that the tape had been lawfully disclosed to the plaintiffs and could therefore be admitted in evidence , although the weight to be given to it would be \u201c a matter for submissions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , the first applicant chose not to give evidence in answer to this case against him . The second applicant had initially entered a defence to the claim but subsequently instructed his solicitors to come off record .", "CARDINAL . The High Court judge first considered the appropriate standard of proof and concluded that it should be the balance of probabilities since the seriousness of the allegation against the applicants alone was not a reason for departing from the civil standard .", "CARDINAL . The judge accepted that the GPE bombing was part of a campaign of terror involving the use of explosive devices in locations where there was a large number of members of the public . In view of the fact that the warnings were specifically designed to prevent detection of the location of the bomb car before the explosion , the judge was satisfied that those involved in the planning , production , planting and detonation of the bomb recognised the likelihood of serious injury or death from its detonation but had decided to take that risk .", "CARDINAL . NORP The plaintiffs sought to adduce evidence of the first applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG in GPE for directing terrorism . The judge held that the conviction could not be admitted as evidence that the first applicant had committed the acts which grounded the conviction . However , he found that the conviction could be admitted at common law as evidence of bad character , if probative and relevant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant mounted an attack on the character of GPE based in substantial part on answers he gave during cross - examination in the GPE proceedings . In particular , in one email PERSON had suggested an intention to perjure himself in unrelated proceedings ; he had once described himself as a \u201c whore \u201d and a \u201c mercenary \u201d ; he had been charged with passing bad cheques ; there was evidence to suggest that he had been prepared to facilitate criminal activity as long as there was a suitable financial reward for him ; he was paid for the information provided to the ORG and ORG ; and he had had a reputation as a smuggler , drug dealer and \u201c bad guy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the weight to be attached to the evidence of GPE , the judge identified CARDINAL separate questions : whether the email material represented a fair and accurate account of the actual traffic that passed between PERSON and his handlers , and whether the statements and emails represented a fair and accurate account of the exchanges between PERSON and the first applicant . Both of those questions required consideration of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the first question , the judge made the following observations :", "The statements which were prepared for the purpose of giving evidence in the GPE proceedings were not prepared contemporaneously , but the emails represented actual traffic between PERSON and his handlers . In virtually all cases the emails were generated within TIME of the end of lengthy meetings , but caution had to be exercised in relation to isolated comments in response to queries raised by handlers where there may have been failures of recollection or misinterpretation .", "ORG motivation for embarking on his activity was the prospect of financial reward . He had been dishonest in his dealings with money and in representation of circumstances , particularly where his financial interests and reputation were involved .", "ORG was engaged under a financial contract with his handlers . Since he had a financial interest in producing material that was likely to be considered significant , care had to be exercised in assessing the material .", "The extraordinary level of detail , which included identification by name of a significant number of people whom it was highly unlikely that ORG would previously have known was compelling evidence of an attempt to provide an accurate and comprehensive record of actual meetings .", "The materials were generated for the purpose of enabling handlers to assess intelligence and there was no reason to think that the content had been manipulated in any particular way .", "The hearsay evidence of PERSON was decisive in the sense that without it the plaintiffs could not succeed against the first applicant .", "The applicant had a proper opportunity to investigate the credibility of GPE He had had the advantage of the disclosures which had been made for the purposes of the criminal trial , including the transcript of cross - examinations .", "It was recognised that some material might be missing and there was the possibility of human error , having regard to the limited interaction necessary to deal with the encryption of these materials .", "CARDINAL . In light of the above considerations , the judge was satisfied to a very high standard of probability that the exchanges set out in the emails represented actual traffic that occurred between PERSON and his handlers .", "CARDINAL . The judge further considered LAW and , in particular , the ORG judgment in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and ORG , DATE . Although he recognised that this was not a criminal case and the minimum rights set out in LAW were therefore not expressly engaged , he accepted that the entitlement to a fair hearing would often involve consideration of many of the issues identified as minimum rights within LAW and it was therefore necessary to examine whether the admission of the hearsay evidence and the giving of weight to it would render the hearing unfair . In this regard , the judge noted that the guarantee of a fair hearing required observance of the principle of equality of arms and the principle that proceedings as a whole should be adversarial ; in other words , each party had to be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis - \u00e0 - vis his opponent , and be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the evidence adduced by the other party . Nevertheless , the judge noted that in this case the material upon which the plaintiffs relied had long been known to all of the parties . Consequently , the defendants , who had available the disclosure which was made within the criminal trial and the transcript of the extensive cross - examination of D.R. at that trial , had had a proper opportunity to investigate PERSON \u2019s credibility .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the second question of whether the material was an accurate record of events and conversations , the judge made the following observations :", "There was evidence of dishonesty by LAW of financial matters and the fact that he was being paid for intelligence should properly cause the court to exercise caution in relation to the accuracy of this material .", "There was , however , overwhelming evidence that ORG account in relation to attendance at meetings and gatherings was accurate \u2013 including evidence from PERSON officers involved in surveillance of the first applicant DATE and he could be confident that the emails represented a reliable record of ORG activities .", "The PERSON evidence was strongly supportive of the content of the emails : taken together with the hearsay statement made in the GPE proceedings that the person identified as \u201c PERSON \u201d was in fact the first applicant , the PERSON evidence would appear to confirm that the first applicant had been actively involved in the procurement of terrorist materials , that he had a leadership role in relation to procurement and was a committed terrorist .", "CARDINAL . The judge was therefore satisfied that he should give considerable weight to the content of the email traffic without offending the first applicant \u2019s fair trial rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The principal evidence against the second applicant was also that of LAW , who had recorded his attendance at meetings of the army council where the second applicant appeared to be in charge . In addition , there was independent telephone evidence which indicated that the drivers on the \u201c bomb run \u201d had phoned the second applicant a number of times on TIME of the GPE bombing .", "CARDINAL . The judge , having already dealt with the weight to be given to the hearsay evidence of LAW in considering the position of the first applicant , was satisfied that there was also cogent evidence that the second applicant was a member of the army council of ORG at the time of the GPE bomb , and that he held an important leadership position in ORG both at that time and subsequently . He was further satisfied that there was cogent telephone evidence demonstrating that the second applicant had been involved in directing the operation and participating in it .", "CARDINAL . The judge therefore found both applicants liable in trespass to the plaintiffs . In reaching this conclusion , he described the applicants\u2019 failure to answer the case against them ( the first applicant having elected not to give evidence and the second applicant having not attended the hearing at all , either in person or through representatives \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as \u201c inexplicable \u201d and opined that these failures had made the case against them \u201c overwhelming \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The quantum of damages was assessed separately for each plaintiff depending on the losses suffered , and included financial awards to reflect dependency ( the loss of financial support from the deceased ) ; bereavement ( a fixed sum of GBP CARDINAL payable for grief and trauma following the death of certain specified family members ) ; psychiatric injury to the surviving relatives ; loss of earnings ; \u201c aggravated damages \u201d to compensate for the injury to feelings flowing from consequences such as the indignity , mental suffering , disgrace and humiliation which may be caused by tortious conduct ; and funeral costs .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judge \u2019s decision on the ground that he had been wrong to conclude that the appropriate standard of proof was the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities . However , ORG found that ORG judge had correctly analysed the authorities and was right to apply the civil standard . A tort was a claim for civil law remedies \u2013 the findings of the court gave rise to no criminal sanctions and would not in themselves assist in any prosecution \u2013 and did not cease to be such because the conduct giving rise to the tort was also criminal .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the first applicant also argued that ORG judge had been wrong to attach the weight he did to the evidence of GPE , since evidence had shown him to be a demonstrable confidence trickster who manipulated information at every turn ; that the evidence of the first applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG in GPE should not have been found to be admissible at common law ; and that the judge should not have drawn any adverse inference from the decision of the first applicant not to answer the case against him .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG observed that the fact that a witness had been demonstrated to be unreliable and , indeed , mendacious and dishonest on important occasions did not mean that everything he said should be discounted as valueless and unreliable . The judge had made it clear that ORG hearsay evidence had to be approached with care . Moreover , he was evidently alive both to the financial motive to lie and exaggerate and to the evidence from PERSON himself which indicated dishonesty in his own financial affairs . Therefore , on a fair reading of the judgment the judge was fully conscious of serious flaws in D.R. as a witness of truth on some issues .", "CARDINAL . Insofar as the judge had held that the evidence of the first applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG in GPE could be admitted at common law as evidence of bad character , ORG found that he had erred . However , this error did not affect the outcome of the proceedings , as the PERSON evidence had already established that the first applicant was a committed and active terrorist who was willing to participate in serious terrorist crime . The GPE conviction therefore added no material weight to the GPE case against him .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that in the circumstances of what was a relatively strong prima facie case the judge had been fully entitled to draw an adverse inference from the first applicant \u2019s failure to give evidence . The first applicant had clearly had access to material facts but gave no explanation for his failure to call any evidence or go in the witness box .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed on the grounds that the judge should have subjected the hearsay evidence to proper scrutiny in the context of the case against him instead of adopting the findings in relation to the case against the first applicant , especially as he had not been a party to the criminal proceedings in GPE and had not , therefore , had an opportunity to cross - examine D.R. ; that the judge had been wrong to make the evidential leap that his alleged use of a particular mobile telephone connected him to the bomb and placed him in a position of control and command ; and that it was wrong of the judge to draw inferences from his absence from the proceedings as he had been unrepresented ( his assets were frozen in GPE by ORG and his legal aid had been revoked ) .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG found that the judge had been entitled to reach the conclusion that he did in respect of the evidence of FAC While his analysis of the evidence in the context of the first applicant \u2019s case was not of itself determinative of the question whether it was reliable evidence against the second applicant , he had been aware of the relevant considerations in determining the strength and weaknesses of the evidence . Moreover , there was some corroboration as the PERSON had observed the second applicant and LAW together and the telephone evidence also connected him to the bombing . Linking the pieces of evidence together , the judge was justified in reaching the conclusion that he did .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that the fact the second applicant had declined to testify meant that he had nothing to contradict the evidence against him , which strengthened that evidence even in the absence of any inference which could be drawn .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE ORG dismissed the appeals of both applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were refused permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A claim for trespass to the person , which may be brought for a wilful or negligent act of direct force , is classified as a civil action under domestic law . It is tried before a civil court , which does not determine whether a criminal offence has been committed in order to assess liability .", "CARDINAL . Where liability for trespass to the person is established , the plaintiff is entitled to claim damages to compensate for his or her loss . The general principle underlying the award of damages for tortious acts is to seek to put the plaintiff in the financial position he or she would have been in had the tort not taken place .", "CARDINAL . The admissibility of hearsay evidence in civil proceedings in GPE is governed by ORG Order DATE . LAW provides that in civil proceedings evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL contain safeguards relating to the admission of hearsay evidence :", "\u201c CARDINAL . \u2014(CARDINAL ) Rules of court may provide that , where a party to civil proceedings adduces hearsay evidence of a statement made by a person and does not call that person as a witness , any other party to the proceedings may , with the leave of the court , call that person as a witness and cross - examine him on the statement as if he had been called by the first - mentioned party and as if the hearsay statement were his evidence in chief .", "( CARDINAL ) Without prejudice to any other power to adjourn proceedings , where , in accordance with rules of court made by virtue of paragraph ( CARDINAL ) , the court gives a party leave to call the maker of a statement as a witness , the court may adjourn the proceedings , on such terms as to costs or other matters as it thinks fit , for the purpose\u2014", "( a ) of enabling the witness to be brought before the court ; or", "( b ) of giving the party concerned a proper opportunity to investigate the statement or the credibility of the witness .", "CARDINAL .
