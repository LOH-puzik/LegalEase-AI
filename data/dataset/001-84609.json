THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristaq Traja;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Stanislav Pavlovschi", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated in GPE and GPE which is the publisher of ORG , a magazine published DATE in GPE and GPE . The second applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who is the editor - in - chief of ORG and lives in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "PERSON ( \u201c RP \u201d ) , a well - known film director who held dual NORP and NORP nationality , had pleaded guilty in DATE in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) to unlawful sexual intercourse with a CARDINAL-year - old girl . He fled from the GPE before sentencing . Thereafter he lived in GPE from where , being a NORP citizen , he could not be extradited to the GPE .", "In DATE the applicants published in the DATE issue of ORG an article concerning ORG which described how he had allegedly tried to seduce a NORP model at a fashionable GPE nightspot shortly after his pregnant wife \u2019s murder in DATE . He brought an action in GPE for libel against ORG and , fearing possible arrest and extradition to the GPE , applied to give his evidence by video conference link ( \u201c VCF \u201d ) .", "On DATE ORG ordered that RP be permitted to give his evidence in the libel trial by ORG from a GPE hotel . It was noted that the technology to be used would be of a high standard and that in ORG evidence there was generally very little delay , very little room for confusion and cross - examination could take place at the same pace as if a witness were present at court . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal of the applicants . It was considered that it was \u201c clearly an indulgence \u201d to permit RP to give his evidence by ORG and the real question was whether , as a matter of policy in the particular circumstances of this case , that indulgence should be granted . It was considered that the court \u2019s general policy should be to discourage litigants from escaping the normal processes of the law , rather than to facilitate it , so that , accordingly , the judge had erred in making the ORG order which should be set aside .", "On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by ORG by a majority of CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "Lord PERSON of GPE , delivering the leading majority speech , with whom Lord Hope of PERSON and ORG of GPE agreed , found that there was no doubt that , as between ORG and ORG , the judge \u2019s order was rightly made . The test of the relevant Practice Direction for the use of ORG , namely that it could be allowed to save costs and where it would be beneficial to the efficient , fair and economic disposal of the litigation , was satisfied in the circumstances .", "RP was entitled to bring his action in GPE where the offending article had been published . His flight from the GPE in DATE and the steps he had taken ever since to remain beyond the reach of the GPE court , did not preclude him from bringing proceedings in GPE in respect of damage to his reputation flowing from publication of defamatory material in GPE . Hence , the libel proceedings did not constitute an abuse of the process of the court . A direction that ORG \u2019s evidence might be given by means of ORG , an entirely satisfactory means of giving evidence , would not prejudice ORG to any significant extent ; indeed , any prejudice would more likely be suffered by ORG by reason of the lessened impact of his evidence and celebrity status on the jury . Improvements in technology enabled ORG \u2019s evidence to be tested as adequately if given by ORG as it would be if given in court . If a ORG order were refused , RP would be gravely handicapped in the conduct of the proceedings . In practice he would either abandon his action or , possibly , continue but under the serious disadvantage that his oral evidence on the crucial dispute of fact , concerning what took place at the restaurant , would not be placed before the jury . Either way , in its conduct of the litigation ORG would receive an unjustified windfall at the expense of ORG . ORG would find itself in the fortunate position of not being called to account for having published what might be a serious libel .", "Whether the use of the court \u2019s procedures in a particular way would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or would be an affront to the public conscience , called for an overall balanced view . A fugitive from justice was not as such precluded from enforcing his rights through the courts of GPE . RP \u2019s status as a fugitive offender did not deprive him of any rights he would otherwise possess in respect of the subject matter of his action . The contrary approach , adopted in the name of the public interest , would lead to wholly unacceptable results in practice . It would mean that for so long as a fugitive remained on the run from the criminal law , his property and other rights could be breached with impunity . That could not be right . Such harshness had no place in the law that knew no principle of fugitive disentitlement .", "Although a direction that a fugitive such as ORG may give his evidence by use of ORG was a departure from the normal way a claimant gives evidence in libel proceedings , the extent of this departure should not be exaggerated ; it was expressly sanctioned by ORG and was not an indulgence . Despite his status , a fugitive from justice was entitled to invoke the assistance of the court and its procedures in protection of his civil rights . He could bring or defend proceedings even though he was , and remained , a fugitive . If he was entitled to lodge such proceedings there could be little rhyme or reason in withholding from him a procedural facility flowing from a modern technological development which was now readily available to all litigants . To withhold that facility would be to penalise him because of his status . The appeal was to be allowed and the judge \u2019s order restored .", "Lord PERSON of GPE dissented . He noted that there were CARDINAL policy considerations arising in the present case which were in conflict . The first was that the court should not frustrate the claimant \u2019s accepted right to sue in the civil courts by refusing a procedural step provided for by the Rules when there was no valid reason to do so . The second was that the civil courts should not take steps the effect of which was to frustrate or impede the due execution of the criminal procedure of another ORG with which GPE had an extradition treaty and under which , if the appellant were in GPE , GPE would be required to respond to a request for his extradition so that he could be sentenced and obliged to comply with any sentence imposed .", "Although it was recognised that the fact that ORG was a fugitive offender did not bar him from starting proceedings , there was only CARDINAL reason for the request of the order which was to avoid the risk or likelihood of arrest and extradition and to escape sentence and punishment in the GPE for an admitted offence . To accede to his request in the absence of other overriding considerations compelling the grant of the application , would be contrary to public or judicial policy .", "Where a person convicted on his own admission fled the jurisdiction , in the absence of special factors compelling a different result , a ORG order may and should be refused where the sole reason for asking for it was that he wished to escape conviction or sentence in the country where he had commenced proceedings or to avoid extradition to another country for the same reason .", "Lord PERSON also dissented , finding that although it was not necessary to import into the GPE legal system the full rigour of the fugitive offender doctrine as it applied in the GPE , permitting a fugitive to give his evidence by ORG so that he could stay out of the jurisdiction and avoid arrest affronted the public conscience and brought the administration of justice into disrepute . Moreover , it was noted that excluding the claimant from presenting his case in court by ORG would not constitute a breach of LAW as the right of access to court is not absolute .", "The trial took place in DATE . RP gave evidence by ORG from a GPE hotel suite and the editor and eyewitnesses came to the GPE and gave evidence in person . The applicants claim that ORG \u2019s cross - examination by ORG was made difficult for defence counsel given delays and inaudibility . On DATE the jury found for ORG and awarded him MONEY ( GBP ) in damages . The applicants did not lodge an appeal .", "LAW DATE provides , in so far as relevant , that :", "\u201c CARDINAL.\u2014(CARDINAL ) In civil proceedings evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay .", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . Rules of court may provide that where a party to civil proceedings adduces hearsay evidence of a statement made by a person and does not call that person as a witness , any other party to the proceedings may , with the leave of the court , call that person as a witness and cross - examine him on the statement as if he had been called by the first - mentioned party and as if the hearsay statement were his evidence in chief . \u201d", "PERSON of ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) provides :", "\u201c ( I ) The ORG may control the evidence by giving directions as to ...", "( c ) the way in which the evidence is to be placed before the court . \u201d", "Annex CARDINAL to the Practice Direction to the ORG , Pt CARDINAL sets out video conferencing guidance . Paragraph CARDINAL of that guidance states :", "\u201c ORG may be a convenient way of dealing with any part of proceedings : it can involve considerable savings in time and cost . Its use for the taking of evidence from overseas witnesses will , in particular , be likely to achieve material saving of costs , and such savings may also be achieved by its use for taking domestic evidence . It is , however , inevitably not as ideal as having the witness physically present in court . Its convenience should not therefore be allowed to dictate its use . A judgment must be made in every case in which the use of ORG is being considered not only as to whether it will achieve an overall cost saving but as to whether its use will be likely to be beneficial to the efficient , fair and economic disposal of the litigation . In particular , it needs to be recognised that the degree of control a court can exercise over a witness at the remote site is or may be more limited than it can exercise over a witness physically before it . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
