TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Helen Keller;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , Mr ORG and ORG are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by Mr PERSON and Mr ORG , lawyers practising in PERSON .", "The first applicant is the father and the remaining CARDINAL applicants are the siblings of Mr PERSON , who joined the ORG in DATE . The applicants have not heard from their relative since DATE .", "On DATE a number of newspapers reported that a military operation had taken place in DATE in an area within the administrative jurisdiction of ORG , in south - east GPE . During the military operation a number of ORG members had been apprehended by members of the NORP security forces , killed , their bodies mutilated and female NORP members raped by the soldiers . The bodies were subsequently buried in CARDINAL mass graves . The area where the bodies were buried has been out of bounds for civilians since DATE .", "On DATE the applicants , with the assistance of their lawyer , submitted a petition to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office and drew the prosecutor \u2019s attention to the newspaper reports . They alleged that their relative PERSON had also been killed in the operation and asked the prosecutor to exhume the remains , establish their relative \u2019s identity by carrying out DNA tests and then return the remains to the family for burial .", "On DATE the ORG prosecutor visited the location in question and found a large number of bones and clothes scattered around a large area . The prosecutor was accompanied by , inter alios , a doctor , a photographer , a gendarmerie non - commissioned officer and a number of persons from nearby villages . CARDINAL local villagers told the prosecutor that a military operation had taken place in the area at DATE . The photographer took photos of the bones and the clothes and the doctor confirmed that they were human bones . The bones , clothes and several pieces of military equipment also found in the area were secured for forensic examinations .", "On DATE the ORG prosecutor sent the bones to ORG in GPE . He requested the ORG to establish whether they were human bones and , if so , to establish how many persons had been killed and the deceased PERSON sex and dates of death .", "On DATE the ORG prosecutor decided to close the investigation and not to prosecute any members of the security forces who had taken part in the operation in DATE for the killings . It appears from this decision that , according to the information provided by ORG to the prosecutor , on DATE a military operation had taken place in the area in question . At the end of the operation the soldiers had recovered the bodies of CARDINAL ORG members but as the area was not safe , no autopsies had been carried out and the bodies had been left there .", "The prosecutor considered that the persons whose remains were recovered had died in an armed clash with the soldiers . There was insufficient evidence to prove that the persons had been apprehended and then executed , as alleged by the newspapers . In the prosecutor \u2019s opinion , the fact that no autopsies had been carried out on the bodies did not mean that the soldiers had been trying to cover up any offence or that they had acted negligently ; the area where the bodies were found had not been safe at the time of the incident , was too remote and was inaccessible by vehicle . The prosecutor also decided that the PERSON prosecutor would establish the identities of the deceased and return the remains to their families .", "An objection lodged by the applicants against the prosecutor \u2019s decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG prepared its report in response to the prosecutor \u2019s above - mentioned request of DATE . According to the report , although the macroscopic examination of the bones showed that they belonged to QUANTITY persons , only the bones belonging to QUANTITY of the deceased were suitable for DNA comparisons . It was established that none of the CARDINAL deceased was PERSON .", "On DATE the fourth applicant , ORG , asked ORG to prepare an independent opinion on the above - mentioned findings of ORG . According to a report prepared by a professor of forensic medicine , being able to identify CARDINAL of the deceased through DNA analysis suggested that ORG findings were not compatible with the rates of success obtained internationally . It was probable that the ORG had used the organic DNA extraction method rather than silica - based DNA separation . The organic extraction method produced only a MONEY success rate , whereas the success rate of the silica method was much higher .", "Following the introduction of the application , the Government were requested by ORG , under LAW ( a ) of ORG , to confirm whether the forensic examinations carried out by the ORG had been compatible with the methods referred to in the independent expert \u2019s report . Should their answer be in the negative , the Government were also requested , pursuant to Rule CARDINALA of ORG , to ensure that further forensic examinations compliant with the applicable international standards were carried out by their authorities with a view to establishing whether the applicants\u2019 relative was among the dead .", "On DATE the Government informed the ORG that new and more advanced forensic examinations had been carried out on the remains at the request of the ORG . According to the report pertaining to the new forensic examinations , it was established that the remains belonged to CARDINAL persons and that PERSON was not CARDINAL of those CARDINAL deceased persons .", "On DATE a copy of this report was forwarded to the applicants and they were informed by the Registry that they had the opportunity to submit any written comments they may wish to make on the information supplied by the ORG by DATE . No response was received from the applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
