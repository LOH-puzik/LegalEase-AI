He was represented before the ORG by Mr U. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG opened preliminary investigations against the applicant suspected of intentional homicide ( Totschlag ) and murder ( PERSON ) . At that time the applicant had already been held in pre - trial detention in GPE on other grounds .", "On DATE the GPE ORG issued a search warrant in respect of the applicant \u2019s person , vehicle and LOC . The GPE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against that warrant .", "In the course of the investigation rogatory letters ( PERSON ) and a request for the applicant \u2019s questioning were lodged . The ORG decided that the detained applicant could be handed over for questioning by the investigating authorities .", "On DATE Mr. B. , the applicant \u2019s lawyer , appointed himself counsel chosen by the applicant ( Wahlverteidiger ) and requested that the proceedings be discontinued . Mr. B. lodged an appeal against the ORG decision and consulted the case files . He then informed ORG that the applicant would refuse to give evidence and ORG abstained from questioning .", "On DATE Mr. B. lodged a request to be appointed as the applicant \u2019s official defence counsel ( Pflichtverteidiger ) . He relied on section CARDINAL \u00a7 ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL and \u00a7 ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and held that there was a legal obligation to appoint an official defence counsel in the applicant \u2019s case and that ORG was obliged to make the corresponding request with the competent court .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s representative that it did not intend to request that he be appointed official defence counsel during the preliminary investigation proceedings . It underlined that he had already been appointed by the applicant as his defence counsel . There were no grounds at this stage requiring him to be appointed officially .", "On DATE the Cologne ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s representative \u2019s complaint against this decision , holding that the fact that legal representation was compulsory during later trial proceedings did not entail an obligation to appoint an official defence counsel for the whole preliminary investigation nor for certain investigation measures . Moreover , LAW benefitted from a certain margin of appreciation when appointing defence counsel . The appointment of defence counsel during preliminary investigations was necessary only if there were concrete grounds requiring legal assistance at an early stage , which was not the case at present .", "On DATE the ORG refused to admit his constitutional complaint for adjudication . It held that it was inadmissible with regard to the principle of subsidiarity . The alleged violation of constitutional law by ORG refusal to officially appoint defence counsel could still be challenged in the main proceedings , notably by virtue of an appeal on points of law , without the applicant incurring any major disadvantages .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) If the accused does not yet have defence counsel , he shall be assigned defence counsel for the duration of his pre - trial detention , if its execution has lasted for DATE and the public prosecutor \u2019s office or the accused or his statutory representative has requested it .
