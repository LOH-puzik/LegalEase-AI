The donor of the first plot of land gave it to him by way of remuneration for having helped her to complete the formalities to obtain restitution of her CARDINAL properties located throughout GPE . The donor of the second plot had apparently been a longstanding friend of the second applicant , whilst the other CARDINAL plots were given to him as a token of gratitude because he had covered the cost of expensive heart surgery for the donor .

The contracting parties thus valued each plot of land at CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG ; CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) , except for that of CARDINAL sq.m . , which was valued at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .

By Regulation no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , which was adopted in the context of delegated legislative authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and which entered into force on DATE , ORG ordered the expropriation of all the land in question for the benefit of the ORG .

On DATE ORG of ORG partly upheld his claim , awarding the applicant the sum of ORG ( about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) on that basis , as the rent represented PERCENT of the current cadastral value of the land . In fixing that amount ORG particularly took into account the fact that the second applicant had not invested in any development of the land in question . It further indicated that the applicant \u2019s title to the property had ceased on DATE , when the expropriation had become effective . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG of ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , PERSON , brought similar proceedings .

NORP In support of that claim , the applicants alleged that LAW provided for a uniform procedure : after the enactment of the special law of DATE , ORG was required first to start negotiations with them with a view to reaching a friendly settlement as to the amount of the compensation ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) ; if those negotiations failed , ORG would have to refer the matter to the court of competent jurisdiction for settlement of the dispute ( section CARDINAL ) . That procedure had not been followed in the present case . The applicants particularly emphasised the fact that they were not satisfied about the sums paid by way of compensation and that they were deprived of their right to challenge those sums before a court . In this connection , the applicants pointed out that the orders of ORG had been made in the absence of any prior final judgment concerning the amount of the compensation ; they thus argued that the orders did not comply with CARDINAL of LAW . The applicants submitted that the expropriation in general and the transfer of title in particular had been carried out in breach of that LAW , thus directly entailing a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims . According to the judgment , the expropriation was not based on LAW , as the applicants had claimed : since the measure in question had been decreed in the context of the NORP land reform , the special law of DATE was to be applied . Section CARDINAL of that special law provided for CARDINAL elements \u2013 the law itself and the payment of the compensation \u2013 which , taken together , formed a statutory basis for the transfer of title to the ORG . As the corresponding sums had been paid into the applicants\u2019 accounts , both of those elements were present , and by registering the ORG as the new owner of the land in question , ORG had acted in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG pointed out that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE on the calculation of compensation referred to LAW decision on the arrangements for the entry into force of LAW ; that decision had been declared compliant with LAW No . CARDINAL by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed before ORG of ORG . In their appeal , they emphasised at the outset that they did not object to the expropriation as such , provided that the statutory formalities were observed and the amount of the compensation was reasonable . This had not been the case , however ; in particular , no expert \u2019s report had been ordered for the purpose of determining the actual value of the disputed land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The applicants did not challenge ORG finding that the PERSON of DATE constituted a lex specialis in relation to the general law ; they argued , however , that the said law could not be interpreted as derogating from the normal expropriation procedure . Consequently , by recognising the ORG \u2019s title without having received a copy of a judgment determining the amount of the compensation , ORG had acted illegally .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , essentially endorsing the reasoning and findings of the judgment appealed against . Since the applicants had criticised the compensation awarded , it pointed out that the sums had been determined in accordance with LAW above - mentioned ORG decision . If the applicants had considered that the calculation by the ORG \u2019s ORG had been erroneous and that the relevant coefficients had been incorrectly applied , they could have challenged the calculation in separate proceedings , but had not done so .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a cassation appeal before the ORG of ORG . In their appeal , they submitted that the direct and immediate object of their claim was not to challenge the calculation of the compensation as such , but rather the fact that they had not been able to have the sum fixed through fair judicial proceedings , as required by LAW . If such proceedings had taken place , they would have been able to provide the court with evidence of their investments in respect of the land in question . Moreover , the applicants pointed out that they were not entitled to initiate such proceedings themselves , as section LAW reserved that right for the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the same grounds as ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG had granted the use of all the plots of land in question to a private transport company , B. , from which it has been receiving rent to date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG notified the first applicant of a tax re - assessment , requesting him to pay the sum of ORG CARDINAL in land tax in respect of the land in question , plus penalties , for the period from DATE to DATE , the date of the expropriation . The first applicant challenged this before ORG for the district of GPE , which upheld his claim and annulled the re - assessment . ORG appealed before ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the annulment of the re - assessment . According to that judgment , the land tax was attached to a plot of land and not to a specific individual ; therefore , it could be paid by someone other than the owner . In that case , to the extent that it was the first applicant \u2019s land , the tax had already been paid by the public corporation that was responsible for the port \u2019s management and was using the land on the basis of a servitude . ORG lodged a cassation appeal with the ORG of ORG , which dismissed it in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the second applicant , on DATE ORG of ORG notified him of a tax re - assessment for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , penalties included , for DATE . The applicant brought annulment proceedings before the court of competent jurisdiction , which upheld his claim . ORG appealed and on DATE ORG annulled the judgment of ORG , finding that the second applicant \u2019s land was not part of that for which the public corporation had paid land tax . That judgment was upheld at cassation level . However , in DATE the ORG of ORG re - opened the proceedings on account of newly discovered facts . The case file was sent to ORG , which , in a judgment of DATE , upheld the second applicant \u2019s claim and annulled the disputed re - assessment on the ground that the port management company had already paid land tax for the land in question . On DATE the ORG of ORG , ruling on a cassation appeal , upheld that judgment . The second applicant was therefore not obliged to pay any supplementary tax on his land .", "CARDINAL .
