The police found out that he was a practising NORP and that he regularly went to the mosque .", "CARDINAL . The imam of the local mosque was arrested , tortured and forced to disclose the names of all those visiting the mosque . In particular , he named PERSON , who taught the Koran . PERSON was also arrested and tortured . He gave the police the names of his pupils , including the applicant \u2019s name .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to the local police station , where he was beaten with the aim of extracting a confession to his involvement in extremist activities . He was , however , released after his relatives had bribed the police . He was then fined for participating in unlawful religious gatherings and for praying outside the mosque .", "CARDINAL .

He firstly went to the city of GPE where another of his brothers lived and then , on DATE , took a train to GPE . He intended to travel onward to GPE , where he wanted to apply for refugee status .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest . On DATE his name was put on the list of wanted persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the charges against the applicant . He was charged with participating in an extremist organisation of a religious , separatist or fundamentalist nature ; smuggling of extremist materials ; storing and distributing materials containing religious extremist , separatist and fundamentalist ideas ; using religion with the aim of disturbing the public peace and order ; disseminating slanderous and damaging insinuations and committing other acts against the established rules of conduct and national security ; and calling for the overthrow of the constitutional order of GPE , the usurpation of power and breach of the territorial integrity of GPE ( the offences contained in ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .

The members of that organisation were claimed to hold regular religious gatherings and to collect money . The applicant was also accused of smuggling religious books authored by PERSON and PERSON , which allegedly \u201c encouraged unconstitutional and anti - government sentiments \u201d and contained \u201c slanderous insinuations alien to traditional NORP \u201d . ORG concluded from the above that , by being a member of a banned religious organisation and by smuggling extremist religious books , the applicant had disseminated the ideas of Wahhabism , called for the establishment of an NORP Caliphate based on LAW , and \u201c slandered the democratic system established in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed LOC that , according to their information , the applicant would arrive in GPE DATE . In reply , ORG confirmed that the applicant was wanted by the NORP authorities on the charge of membership of an extremist organisation of a religious , separatist or fundamentalist nature and that an arrest warrant had been issued in respect of him . It asked ORG to keep the applicant in custody pending an extradition request , which would be sent without delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately after his arrival in GPE , the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE received a request for the applicant \u2019s extradition from ORG .

On CARDINAL DATE further assurances were given by a Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE . He gave an undertaking that the applicant would not be subjected to torture , violence or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment and that the rights of the defence would be respected . He also gave an assurance that the NORP authorities had no intention of persecuting the applicant for political motives or on account of his race or religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s detention . He referred to the arrest warrant issued by ORG , to LAW and to LAW ( \u201c CCrP \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE on the grounds that the extradition proceedings against him were still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged appeal submissions . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the extension order on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release subject to his lawyer providing a personal guarantee . Relying on Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he found that the maximum detention period permitted under NORP law had expired and that it was not possible to extradite the applicant for the time being due to the indication of an interim measure by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for refugee status . In particular , he submitted that he was being persecuted in GPE for his religious beliefs . He feared being tortured with the aim of obtaining a confession to offences he had not committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Town Department of the ORG rejected his application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that decision was confirmed by a deputy head of the ORG . He found that , given that a majority of the population of GPE was NORP , the applicant \u2019s persecution for his adherence to ORG was unlikely . Although , according to the information provided by ORG , the NORP authorities exercised close control over the religious life of the population , that was justified by their legitimate intention to limit the influence of radical NORP organisations , such as ORG . The ORG had no competence to verify whether the charges brought against the applicant in GPE were well - founded . It therefore appeared that the application for refugee status had been motivated by the applicant \u2019s wish to avoid criminal liability . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations of a risk of ill - treatment in GPE , they could not serve as a basis for granting refugee status . The existence of such a risk , if substantiated , might , however , serve as a basis for granting temporary asylum .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that refusal before ORG of GPE . He complained that the ORG had presumed him guilty of the offences imputed to him and had disregarded his argument that he was being persecuted for his religious beliefs . He submitted that he had been tortured and fined for praying outside the mosque and that criminal proceedings had been opened against him after a religious book , which had never been declared extremist or banned by the authorities , had been found in his house . He also referred to the case - law of the ORG , in particular the cases of GPE v. GPE ( no . DATE , DATE ) , PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) in which the ORG had found , in similar circumstances , that the ORG forced return to GPE would give rise to a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the decision of DATE . It found that the reasons for the refusal of refugee status advanced by the ORG had been convincing and that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegation that he had been persecuted for his religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He repeated his arguments advanced before the ORG and ORG . He also referred to ORG reports describing persecution and ill - treatment of members of minority religious NORP groups .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG for temporary asylum , referring to the risks of his ill - treatment and persecution for his religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Town Department of the ORG rejected his application . It found that the applicant could not be persecuted for his religious beliefs because he belonged to the NORP branch of ORG , which was the religion followed by PERCENT of the population of GPE . The charges brought against him appeared to be well - founded . It was also relevant that the applicant had never applied for a residence or work permit in GPE . There were therefore no grounds for granting temporary asylum to him .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE a deputy head of the ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the application for temporary asylum for fresh examination before ORG of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the temporary asylum proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the office of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) informed counsel for the applicant that the applicant had been granted mandate refugee status . The ORG found that he had a well - founded fear of being persecuted and ill - treated in GPE for reasons of his religion and imputed political opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy Prosecutor General decided to extradite the applicant to GPE . The prosecutor enumerated the charges against the applicant and found that his actions were punishable under NORP criminal law . An extradition order was granted in respect of attempted overthrow of the constitutional order of GPE and dissemination of materials presenting a danger to national security and public order . The prosecutor found that the above offences corresponded to the offences of attempted violent overthrow of the government and constitutional order and public incitement to extremist activities , which were proscribed by NORP criminal law . However , the prosecutor refused to extradite the applicant for smuggling of extremist materials because this was not an offence under NORP criminal law and for membership of \u201c NORP \u201d because that organisation had never been declared extremist or terrorist in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the extradition order before ORG . He submitted that the accusations against him were unfounded and he was in fact being persecuted by the NORP authorities on account of his religious beliefs . He faced torture and other forms of ill - treatment if extradited to GPE . It transpired from the reports by the ORG agencies and by respected international NGOs that torture was widespread in GPE and confessions were often extracted from defendants under duress . He also referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) concerning extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing , PERSON , an expert in refugees from LOC , testified that charges under LAW ( attempted overthrow of the constitutional order of GPE , usurpation of power and breach of the territorial integrity of GPE ) were in most cases politically motivated . Charges under LAW were often brought against individuals criticising the authorities or following religious practices not approved by the ORG . Such individuals were at a substantially higher risk of ill - treatment . In her opinion , the applicant was being persecuted for his religious beliefs and practices . She had drawn that conclusion , in particular , from the fact that he was being prosecuted for possessing a religious book by PERSON , a respected imam whose followers were often targeted by the NORP authorities . It was significant that the books authored by him were not banned in GPE or any other country . She also referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law establishing that diplomatic assurances were not sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . A witness for the applicant , Mr N. , a former investigator in GPE , testified that ill - treatment was wide - spread in GPE . Suspects were tortured to obtain confessions and those confessions were subsequently used against them at trial . He also confirmed PERSON statement that charges under LAW were often brought against believers who attended a mosque , prayed or wore a beard . All persons charged under LAW were tortured .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the court to examine the reports about the situation in GPE by the ORG agencies and human rights NGOs and the judgments of the ORG . His request was rejected .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the applicant also disputed the prosecutor \u2019s finding that the actions imputable to him were punishable under NORP criminal law . He argued that under NORP law only the attempted violent overthrow of the government and the constitutional order was prosecutable , while he had never been accused of resorting to violence . Nor could possession of religious books be characterised as public incitement to extremist activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the extradition order . It held that the NORP and NORP authorities had followed the extradition procedure set out in applicable international and domestic law . The applicant was charged with offences punishable under NORP and NORP criminal law and there was no evidence that he was being persecuted for his political opinions or religious beliefs . ORG found that the international reports , expert opinions and the ORG \u2019s case - law relied upon by the applicant were irrelevant because they described the general situation in GPE rather than the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances . Mr ORG testimony was also irrelevant because it referred to the situation from DATE to DATE . The NORP authorities had given assurances that the applicant would not be tortured . There was no reason to question the validity of those assurances , which had been given by a competent ORG authority , ORG office of GPE . ORG therefore considered that the assurances were sufficient to exclude any risk of ill - treatment . It further held that the issue of the applicant \u2019s guilt or innocence was not within the scope of the review undertaken by the extraditing authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He reiterated his arguments advanced before ORG and relied on LAW . He further submitted that the diplomatic assurances against ill - treatment were unreliable due to the absence of any mechanism of compliance monitoring or any accountability for a breach of such assurances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected his appeal and upheld the decision of DATE , finding that it had been lawful and justified . It endorsed ORG finding that the international reports on the situation in GPE were irrelevant because they were not based on \u201c real evidence \u201d . It also found that the diplomatic assurances given by the NORP authorities were sufficient to ensure adequate protection against eventual ill - treatment of the applicant because if the assurances in respect of the applicant were breached , GPE would refuse to extradite other people . Moreover , the applicant had not submitted any evidence that such assurances had been breached in previous cases .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in TIME CARDINAL DATE he met CARDINAL acquaintances , PERSON , in the centre of GPE . They were stopped by a policeman who checked their identity documents .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately after that CARDINAL or QUANTITY people in plain clothes grabbed them by the arms and forced them into a van . The abductors put black plastic bags on their heads and laid them on the floor of the van .", "CARDINAL . By TIME they arrived at a forest outside GPE . They were then beaten and threatened with a gun . Their hands were burnt using a lighter .", "CARDINAL . At sunset they were handcuffed , forced into the van and brought to an airport by TIME on DATE . They drove directly into the airfield and parked near an airplane . They were then placed onboard the airplane , accompanied by CARDINAL guards . The passengers boarded afterwards . The airplane took off at TIME and landed in the city of GPE in GPE CARDINAL - and - a - half hours later .", "CARDINAL . At FAC the applicant , PERSON and A. were handed over to NORP policemen . Black plastic bags were again put on their heads and they were then separated and placed in different cars .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken to a police station in GPE , where he remained for DATE . He was ill - treated and required to give evidence against PERSON The police officers threatened to tie him up and throw him into a river , stating that nobody knew that he was in NORP because he had not been checked in for the flight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to GPE . He was taken to a police station , where he was questioned .

The applicant has been in hiding ever since . Intending to return to GPE , he asked the ORG to assist him with recovering his national passport , which had been retained by the ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date an investigator of ORG opened an inquiry into the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s abduction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator refused to open criminal proceedings into the incident .", "DATE . On DATE the acting head of ORG quashed the decision of DATE and ordered an additional inquiry . He found that it was necessary to question counsel for the applicant and to obtain information about the applicant \u2019s crossing of the NORP border .", "CARDINAL . The inquiry was resumed . On unspecified dates DATE and DATE the investigator ordered that the local police should search for witnesses to the applicant \u2019s abduction . In the same period he also sent inquiries for information about the applicant to ORG , the local office of ORG of ORG , the ORG , ORG in FAC , and other state agencies .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the inquiry is pending .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c CCrP \u201d ) of DATE governs the procedure to be followed in the event of extradition .", "CARDINAL . An extradition decision made by ORG may be challenged before a court ( LAW ) . In that case the extradition order should not be enforced until a final judgment is delivered ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

Extradition could also be refused if exceptional circumstances disclosed that it might entail a danger to the person \u2019s life and health on account of , among other things , his or her age or physical condition . NORP authorities dealing with an extradition case should examine whether there were reasons to believe that the person concerned might be sentenced to the death penalty , subjected to ill - treatment or persecuted because of his or her race , religious beliefs , nationality , ethnic or social origin or political opinions .

Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty , the copious testimonies gathered are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process can not be denied .
