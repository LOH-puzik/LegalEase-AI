It is represented before the ORG by Mr A. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE . The other applicants are CARDINAL students and teachers listed in the annex ( the \u201c other applicants \u201d , the \u201c students \u201d or the \u201c teachers \u201d ) . They have joined the application of the University without filing separate submissions with the ORG .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG , as a result of a private initiative , granted the ORG the status of higher education institution .", "On DATE a new LAW was adopted , which introduced a new statutory framework within which higher education institutions were required to function .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG proposed to ORG to revoke the status of a higher education institution of the University . As grounds for its proposal , ORG indicated that , inter alia , ( CARDINAL ) ORG operated without internal rules and regulations , as well as without management bodies , elected in accordance with the law ; ( CARDINAL ) all its general assemblies had not been conducted in conformity with the statutory requirements ; ( CARDINAL ) it had been accepting students in violation of the ORG 's university admission criteria , which were more than the maximum permissible number and for courses which had not been approved by the ORG ; ( CARDINAL ) ORG had been appointing academic staff in violation of the applicable rules ; ( CARDINAL ) it had not had an approved budget prior to DATE and after that had CARDINAL budgets approved by CARDINAL separate and competing administrative bodies ; ( CARDINAL ) it had been operating in violation of LAW as it lacked a balance sheet for DATE and did not have any accounting documents for DATE and DATE . Allegedly the applicants were not officially informed of the procedure undertaken by ORG .", "On DATE the ORG appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused to examine the appeal . It found that the proposal by ORG had no direct effect on the rights of the University as it was only a proposal to ORG , was not therefore an individual administrative act and was not subject to judicial review . Upon further appeal , the extended panel of ORG , on an unspecified date , refused to examine the appeal on similar grounds .", "By decision of DATE ORG revoked the status of ORG as a higher education institution . It authorised ORG to deal with all matters in connection with the revocation of the status of ORG . It expressly addressed the option for the students to continue their studies at other universities , which subsequently led to the adoption by ORG on DATE of a special regulation which specified the procedures related thereto . No reasons for the decision of ORG were given and the applicants were allegedly not informed of the procedure . The decision was promulgated on DATE .", "On an unspecified date the ORG appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG , arguing that it was an individual administrative act which was subject to judicial review . On DATE ORG refused to examine the appeal on the basis that acts of ORG were not subject to judicial review . Upon further appeal , on CARDINAL DATE the extended panel of ORG also refused to examine the appeal on similar grounds .", "ORG decision of DATE was challenged before ORG by CARDINAL members of parliament . They argued that the decision was unconstitutional , that at the time it was adopted the University had corrected the alleged violations and that its operations had been in compliance with the statutory requirements . On DATE CARDINAL judges from ORG voted in favour of declaring the decision of DATE unconstitutional , whereas CARDINAL judges voted against . Accordingly , as ORG failed to obtain the CARDINAL votes required for a majority decision , the court rejected the challenge by judgment of DATE .", "The LAW provides , inter alia , that citizens and organizations shall have the right to set up higher education institutions in accordance with the conditions and procedures established by statute and demands that the education they provide must comply with the requirements set by ORG LAW ) . It also provides that the ORG shall exercise control over all forms and levels of education , including higher education institutions ( LAW ) .", "LAW of DATE ( the \u201c DATE Act \u201d ) , which was in force at the time the University was established , regulated the establishment and functioning of higher education institutions . It did not differentiate between public and private institutions . The LAW provided that higher education institutions were set up by ORG . It also detailed the different grades of academic staff , determined their hierarchy and their relationship with the institutions . The status of students and their relationship with the higher education institutions was also regulated . LAW was repealed by LAW of DATE .", "LAW of DATE ( the \u201c CARDINAL LAW ) regulates the establishment , functions , management and financing of higher education institutions , which could be public or private .", "LAW , as in force during the relevant period , envisaged special control , supervisory and decisionmaking functions for the legislature and the Government . For example , ( CARDINAL ) ORG created , transformed and closed higher education institutions ; ( CARDINAL ) ORG developed and supervised implementation of Government policy in the sphere of higher education ; approved academic qualification grades and the requirements towards all courses ; determined the maximum number of undergraduates and postgraduates taught by each higher education institution and approved the rules for providing students with housing and other social benefits ; ( CARDINAL ) ORG facilitated communication between the ORG and the higher education institutions and maintained the register of approved academic qualifications ; ( CARDINAL ) ORG , a special administrative body created LAW , was designated to monitor , assess and determine whether a particular higher education institution complied with the ORG 's requirements . A lack of an accreditation or receipt of CARDINAL negative assessments from this body was a basis for closing a higher education institution .", "LAW , as in force during the relevant period , also regulated the management structure of ORG higher educational institutions , their hierarchy , procedures for appointment , term of office and powers . It also determined the conditions and requirements towards the teaching provided by higher educational institutions . LAW further provided that higher education institutions enjoy academic autonomy , which consisted of academic freedoms , academic self - government and sanctity of the territory of the institutions . Within this context , higher education institutions were required to adopt internal rules and regulations , which would include , inter alia , procedures for internal conflict resolution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
