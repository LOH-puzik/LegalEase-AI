In DATE she moved to GPE to join her husband .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s wife and son spent DATE in GPE . They were supposed to return to GPE on DATE . Instead , the applicant \u2019s wife sent him an e - mail , informing him that she and their son were to remain in GPE and that she had brought a civil action against him there , seeking a divorce ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s legal representative sent an e - mail to ORG ( ORG zdravstva i socijalne skrbi , hereafter \u201c the relevant Ministry \u201d ) , as ORG within the meaning of the DATE LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( \u201c the Hague Convention \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She asked the Ministry to urgently contact the applicant \u2019s wife and take other appropriate measures to seek the voluntary return of the child until the receipt of the official request under LAW from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry forwarded the applicant \u2019s request to the competent local social welfare centre with a view to establishing his wife \u2019s intentions regarding their son and the possibility of a voluntary return to GPE . The centre immediately invited her for an interview . During the interview of DATE she stated that while living in GPE she had been subjected to constant psychological abuse by the applicant . She did not oppose the applicant \u2019s having contact with their son , but insisted that any contact take place under the supervision of a child welfare professional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received an official request from ORG under LAW for the return of the applicant \u2019s son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG forwarded the request for return to ORG ( Op\u0107inski gra\u0111anski sud u GPE ) and thus instituted non - contentious proceedings for the return of the applicant \u2019s son . The court received the request DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited the local social welfare centre to submit a report on the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s social and financial situation , the reasons for her taking the child to GPE , the child \u2019s general and psychological condition , and the potential effects on his mental development of any decision to return him to GPE . On DATE the court also invited the applicant \u2019s wife to respond to her husband \u2019s request for the boy to be returned .", "CARDINAL . In her response of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s wife opposed his request for the return of their child , with or without her . She submitted in particular that the applicant had agreed to her trip to GPE and that his consent was not time - limited . She also stated that the applicant had expressly forbidden her to return to their flat in GPE , that he had been abusing her , and that there , unlike in GPE , she had been completely dependent on him in every way ( financially , economically , and in terms of accommodation ) . Lastly , she claimed that no significant changes had occurred in the care the child was receiving , given that she had been the CARDINAL taking care of their son thus far , which was the reason why the child was very emotionally attached to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court reiterated its request of CARDINAL DATE to the local social welfare centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local social welfare centre submitted its report and supplemented it , at the court \u2019s request , DATE . The report stated that the applicant \u2019s wife was taking adequate care of their son and recognised his needs , that she was emotionally positively focused on him and that he was affectionate towards her . The report also stated that she did not undermine the applicant \u2019s role as a father , and that she encouraged the child to have contact with him , but that she felt the need to protect him from the applicant \u2019s possible irrational behaviour , which concern the centre considered credible . The child was mentally stable , showed no signs of trauma due to the separation from his father , and had adapted well to the new situation . The report noted that the child was emotionally attached to his mother , with whom he had spent DATE since birth , and that separation from her and returning him to his father would be traumatic . The centre therefore considered that returning the child to GPE would not be in his best interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to the court a certified copy of the decision of a court in GPE of CARDINAL DATE granting him interim custody of his son .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions of CARDINAL DATE his wife argued that the report of the social welfare centre suggested that returning her son to GPE would expose him to psychological harm or place him in an intolerable situation within the meaning of LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She therefore invited the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request for return on that ground .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the relevant Ministry asked the court to inform it of developments in the case . The court delivered the requested information on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited the applicant \u2019s representative to submit rectified translations of the documents submitted on DATE , given that certain dates had been wrongly translated . The applicant did so on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant argued that the report and recommendation of the local social welfare centre did not correspond to the objectives , spirit and purpose of LAW . He explained that the purpose of LAW was the prompt return of the child , and not an assessment of the child \u2019s adaptation to a new environment . The applicant further argued that his wife had not presented any evidence for her allegations of abuse , and that she had never intended to establish a permanent relationship with him . He averred that tolerating his wife \u2019s conduct in the proceedings constituted a violation of LAW , LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s wife replied by contesting all the applicant \u2019s arguments , and submitted evidence in support of her allegations of abuse . In particular , she submitted a letter from the president and founder of the association for the protection of victims of domestic violence WISH , based in GPE , where she had sought help while living in GPE . She also stated that the applicant no longer lived in their matrimonial home in GPE and wondered where the child was supposed to return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the return of the child . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ... having regard to the fact that the separation of ORG from his mother and from a safe environment would without a doubt have harmful and traumatic consequences for his psychological development , and that granting the applicant \u2019s request might cause psychological trauma to the child and place him in an unfavourable position within the meaning of LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of the [ LAW , and having regard to the mother \u2019s fear that the child would , upon his return to GPE , be subject to psychological and verbal abuse , which fear was deemed justified by the psychologist and the social worker of the social welfare centre ... and having regard to the fact that on DATE proceedings for divorce of the parties were instituted , in which proceedings the court should decide on custody of the child and on the other parent \u2019s contact rights , the petitioner \u2019s request must be dismissed , without violating LAW , it was decided as in the operative part of this decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision , alleging procedural errors , incomplete findings of fact , and misapplication of substantive law as grounds for appeal . In particular , the applicant argued that his wife \u2019s submissions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE had been served on him together with the contested first - instance decision and thus in breach of the principle of equality of arms , that the court had not held a single hearing in the case , and that it had wrongly applied LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the first - instance decision and remitted the case . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ... the first - instance court based [ its ] decision in part on undisputed facts , and in the relevant part on the arguments and the evidence submitted by the counterparty ... even though it failed to give an opportunity to the petitioner to comment on them ... [ T]herefore the petitioner \u2019s appeal had to be allowed , the first - instance decision quashed and the case remitted ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of ORG was served on ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant sought the withdrawal of Judge PERSON , the first - instance court judge sitting in the case , for alleged bias on her part in favour of his wife . On DATE the President of ORG granted the application for the judge \u2019s withdrawal , and on DATE assigned the case to another judge .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant invited the court to review recordings of his conversations with his son via ORG , and asked for a provisional measure ordering the seizure of his son \u2019s passport with a view to preventing his wife from removing him from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited the applicant to submit certificates from the relevant GPE authorities on his son \u2019s habitual residence in that country and the social background of the child within the meaning of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the applicant submitted documents on his permanent residence and his son \u2019s habitual residence in GPE , and on DATE he submitted information on the social background of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant urged the court to schedule a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered the local social welfare centre to promptly assess whether the child was settled in his new environment in terms of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In submissions she made on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife reiterated that she believed that the evidence showed that the applicant was abusive , and in that respect pointed to the opinion of the psychologist from the local social welfare centre , who had indicated that the applicant \u2019s communication with his son via ORG constituted emotional blackmail and amounted to emotional abuse . She emphasised that she could not return to GPE , because her green card had expired and she did not have any means of supporting herself there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local social welfare centre submitted the opinion of its psychologist prepared on the basis of interviews with the applicant \u2019s wife and son . The psychologist stated that the child \u2019s physical and mental development was normal and that he had adapted well . She emphasised that owing to his age and his mother \u2019s constant care for him since birth the child was emotionally primarily attached to her ; separating them would therefore be traumatising for him .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of DATE the applicant argued that the psychologist \u2019s opinion was flawed , unprofessional and arbitrary . He therefore proposed that his son be examined by independent experts , namely an institution with no role in the proceedings . The court eventually agreed to the applicant \u2019s proposal , and on DATE and DATE decided to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . In submissions made on CARDINAL and DATE the applicant \u2019s wife commented on the documents on the child \u2019s social background submitted by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She stated that those documents were not relevant , because they had not been provided by the competent authorities of GPE but by a private law firm lacking in professional competencies and jurisdiction for issuing such documents . She stated , inter alia , that the lawyer who had compiled the report did not speak NORP and thus could not possibly have understood the applicant \u2019s conversations with his son and make an assessment .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant argued that his wife \u2019s conduct in the proceedings amounted to abuse of process and warned the court that the resultant delay was operating in her favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited the applicant to submit evidence that his wife , as his son \u2019s mother , could return to GPE , in particular that she would be provided with a visa , accommodation and a work permit . The applicant did so on DATE ; his wife made further comments on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated that the way the court had conducted the proceedings was unacceptable in view of their nature and the ORG \u2019s obligation under LAW . He further submitted that his rights under LAW had also been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife responded to his submission , also citing LAW . She also reiterated that she could no longer return to GPE , because her green card had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic expert in psychiatry ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) submitted her expert opinion and report on whether the return to GPE would expose the child to psychological harm . The opinion and report were prepared after conducting CARDINAL interviews with the applicant \u2019s son on DATE , the first in the presence of the mother and the second in her absence . She stated that : ( a ) the child was well adapted to his new environment , ( b ) he was showing no signs of trauma , ( c ) the applicant \u2019s wife did not have a negative influence on the child regarding his relationship with the applicant as his father , ( d ) the separation from his mother as primary caregiver and \u201c safe base \u201d would traumatise him , ( e ) transferring the child into a different environment would also constitute a trauma , but that he would be able to overcome it if his mother lived with him and if he lived in a harmonious environment , ( f ) the relationship between the child and his mother was positive , enabling him to develop a \u201c secure attachment \u201d to her , ( g ) the relationship between the child and his father could not be assessed , as the father had not been subjected to an expert assessment . As regards this last point the expert nevertheless made the following observations :", "\u201c ORG is a boy who is securely attached to his mother but also has a positive attitude towards his father , which means that the mother did not influence him [ in that regard ] by expressing negative views , stories , and so on ... CARDINAL important factor is that the boy talks with his father , which he mentioned during the assessment , and in this way forms an opinion about him . What is most important however is that the parents coordinate their [ behaviour ] towards the child in order not to confuse him , which could jeopardise his normal mental development . During the assessment of the boy I did not find that such an issue was present ... [ The child ] does not object to going to GPE , but accepts it only if it is temporary and his mother can come along ... He does not show , verbally or non - verbally , any aversion to his father . It is therefore assumed that the mother influences him positively in that regard . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the relevant Ministry invited ORG to speed up the proceedings and again submit a progress report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court submitted the requested report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant commented on the expert report and opinion . He argued that the report suggested that his son had good memories of him and a positive attitude towards him , and that it was therefore evident that his return to GPE would not expose him to the risk envisaged in LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW . As regards the expert \u2019s finding that the child \u2019s return would be a traumatic experience for him , the applicant submitted that this would not have been the case had the domestic courts ordered his return within the time - limit set forth in LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . In any event , the evidence he submitted had suggested that his wife could accompany his son on his return to GPE , which according to the expert would have eliminated the risk of trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife commented on the expert report and opinion by endorsing it . She argued that they , together with the previous opinions and reports of the local social welfare centre , suggested that it was evident the child should not be returned , as he would thereby suffer psychological trauma . The conditions set forth in LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) had therefore been met .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for his son to be returned . It first held that the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s removal of their son from GPE to GPE was \u201c wrongful \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It then held , relying exclusively on the opinion and report of the local social welfare centre of DATE and the opinion of the forensic expert in psychiatry of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , that the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s return to GPE would expose him to risk envisaged in LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of the said Convention , but only if he returned without his mother . However , since the applicant had not proved that she could freely return to GPE and get a job there , the court concluded that the conditions for refusing the return of the child set forth in that Article had been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision . He referred to procedural errors , incomplete findings of facts , and misapplication of the substantive law as grounds for appeal . In particular , the applicant submitted that the first - instance court had , in breach of the principle of adversarial hearing , not held a single hearing in the case , and that it had not informed him of its decision to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry , thus preventing him from objecting to the choice of the expert . He further complained that he had not been involved in the expert \u2019s assessment , even though he had previously expressed willingness to make himself available for such an assessment . The applicant also stated that the court had required him to prove that his wife could return to GPE and find a job there , instead of asking her to prove that she could not . It had thereby unjustifiably shifted the burden of proof to him as regards those matters . Moreover , as regards those matters the court had drawn the wrong conclusions from the evidence presented , and had embarked on an interpretation of foreign law it was not familiar with . Lastly , the applicant argued that the first - instance court had wrongly applied LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance decision . It would appear that the proceedings are currently pending before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant lodged a request for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time ( zahtjev za za\u0161titu prava na su\u0111enje u razumnom roku ) with ORG about the length of the above proceedings . He argued that the proceedings had lasted for DATE and DATE without a scheduled hearing or a decision rendered , contrary to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It held that the proceedings complained of had thus far lasted DATE and DATE , which could not be considered excessive , especially as there had been no substantial periods of inactivity .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant \u2019s wife brought a civil action against the applicant in ORG seeking a divorce and custody of their son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she asked the court to issue a provisional measure granting her interim custody of ORG until delivery of the final judgment in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions of DATE the applicant argued that the NORP courts lacked international jurisdiction in the case , and submitted a certified translation of the decision of a court in GPE of DATE granting him sole custody of his son .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection regarding lack of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court issued the provisional measure requested by the applicant \u2019s wife and awarded her interim custody of their son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court returned the case file to ORG , warning it that under LAW the judicial or administrative authorities of the ORG to which the child had been removed were not entitled to decide on the right of custody of the child until it had been determined under LAW that the child was not to be returned ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , it instructed ORG to ascertain whether a final decision had been given in the proceedings for the return of the child .
