The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG were arrested by police officers GPE and GPE in the act of committing a theft . The applicant had a hammer in his hand at the time of arrest . Later he was charged with attempted theft and violent resistance to a public official ( virkamiehen v\u00e4kivaltainen vastustaminen , v\u00e5ldsamt motst\u00e5nd mot tj\u00e4nsteman ) .", "CARDINAL . At the trial hearing before the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) the applicant admitted the attempted theft but denied the charge of violent resistance to a public official . Both the applicant and police officer GPE were heard . GPE testified , inter alia , that the applicant had threatened him and his colleague PERSON with a hammer by waving it above his head when the police officers had interrupted the attempted theft . The applicant , for his part , said that he had seen the police arrive and that he had raised the hammer above his head while leaving the building , before the police officers had ordered him to drop it . He denied any intention to threaten the police officers . ORG testified that the applicant had tried to escape . ORG was not heard as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted theft and violent resistance to a public official , finding GPE \u2019s statement reliable . The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate punishment of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) requesting an oral hearing in which he , ORG , GPE and ORG should be heard in order to clarify his behaviour outside the building where he was arrested and the alleged threatening of the police officers . He did not specify why NORP in particular should be called as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction , reducing the sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It found an oral hearing manifestly unnecessary , holding that the applicant \u2019s account before ORG - which he had not contested - and his writ of appeal indisputably proved that he had seen the police officers outside the building . He had then left the building with a hammer raised in the air and had taken some steps towards the police officers . His intention had been to escape . Having seen one of the police officers draw a handgun , he obeyed their orders to drop the hammer when QUANTITY away from them . ORG held that the question whether the applicant had violently resisted a public official could be reliably resolved on the basis of these undisputed facts without hearing witnesses .", "As to the merits , it ruled that \u201c the applicant must have understood that he had threatened the police officer with violence by , as he had stated himself , stepping towards him with a hammer in the air . The intention to escape mentioned by the applicant proves that he also intended to threaten the police officer with violence in order to escape from the scene of the crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) . He claimed that according to the domestic legislation ( LAW , sections DATE of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) ORG should have held an oral hearing and heard the witnesses . He stressed that the matter turned on the credibility of the oral evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; Act no . PERSON ) provides that ORG shall hold an oral hearing if the defendant in a criminal case so requests . An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if the appeal is manifestly ill - founded or if a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary for another reason .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the Code , ORG shall hold an oral hearing regardless of whether one has been requested , if the decision on the matter turns on the credibility of the testimony admitted in ORG or on new testimony to be admitted in ORG . In that event , the evidence admitted in the ORG shall be readmitted at the hearing before ORG unless there is an impediment to doing so .", "CARDINAL .
