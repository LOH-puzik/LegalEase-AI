De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE and DATE the local tax authorities carried out a tax inspection concerning DATE in CARDINAL limited liability companies . According to the trade registry , the applicant was the managing director of CARDINAL of the companies between DATE and CARDINAL DATE but had no formal position in the other company . Nor did he own any shares in either of the companies .", "On the basis of the tax inspection , the tax authorities found on DATE and DATE that the applicant had evaded taxes for DATE as he had been the real actor and authority in both of the companies and had received benefits from them which had not been declared . These benefits were to be considered as disguised dividends given to the applicant by the companies . An additional tax and a tax surcharge ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) , amounting in total to MONEY , were imposed on the applicant .", "The applicant sought rectification from ORG ( verotuksen oikaisulautakunta , pr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden i beskattnings\u00e4renden ) . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s applications .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , claiming that the taxation decisions should be quashed as he could not be held responsible for tax evasion .", "On DATE ORG quashed the previous taxation decisions . It found that no additional tax or tax surcharge could be imposed on the applicant as he had not owned any shares in either of the companies . No tax could be levied on the disguised dividends solely on the ground that a person had been a real actor and authority in a company . This decision became final and the taxation for DATE was rectified accordingly on DATE .", "On DATE , while the taxation proceedings were still pending , the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for , inter alia , aggravated tax fraud . The applicant was accused of having failed to supply complete information in his tax returns for DATE with the intent of evading the tax due , amounting in total to MONEY . The public prosecutor considered that the applicant had sought considerable financial benefit , that the offence was committed in a particularly methodical manner and that the tax fraud was also aggravated when assessed as a whole . The tax authorities concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor and pursued also a compensation claim , which was joined to the criminal charges .", "On DATE the Helsinki ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) found the applicant guilty of aggravated tax fraud and sentenced him to a DATE prison sentence . He was also banned from business operations for DATE and was ordered to pay compensation to the tax authorities in the amount of the evaded taxes , that is , MONEY plus interest , together with costs and expenses . The court found that the applicant had not contested his failure to supply complete information in his tax returns . As the applicant had sought considerable financial benefit , the offence had been committed in a methodical manner over DATE and the tax fraud had also been aggravated when assessed as a whole , the applicant was found guilty of aggravated tax fraud .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that his conviction be quashed . He referred to the decision of DATE by ORG , in which the court had quashed the previous taxation decisions . He claimed that there had been no obligation to declare the benefits allegedly received , as such benefits had not existed . In any event , the element of intent was missing .", "On DATE the ORG upheld , after having held an oral hearing and having voted ( DATE ) , ORG judgment in this respect . It found that , according to LAW , the general courts , when judging criminal cases , were not bound by the interpretation given by the administrative bodies . Criminal and taxation proceedings were different in nature . In the present case , the decision of ORG , which had been solely based on tax inspection reports , was not binding on ORG but the case was to be judged only on the basis of the evidence gathered during the oral hearing . On the basis of this evidence the court found that the applicant had evaded taxes in the amount of CARDINAL euros when failing to declare the received benefits . By this tax evasion the applicant had sought considerable financial benefit , the offence had been committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud had also been aggravated when assessed as a whole . No reduction of the sentence was made on the basis of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "The dissenting judge considered that the evidence presented in ORG was based in most parts on the tax inspection reports which had been confirmed by a witness . The evidence was therefore mainly the same as that relied on by ORG . Moreover , ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) had confirmed in its case - law ( PERSON CARDINAL-B-CARDINAL ) that no tax could be levied on a person for disguised dividends if the person had not owned any shares in the company in question . According to the practice of ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , a conviction for tax fraud would require that a tax be levied in the administrative procedure ( see PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . In these circumstances the dissenting judge considered that the applicant should have been acquitted on the basis of the principle of in dubio pro reo .", "By a letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He claimed that he could not be convicted for tax fraud as he had not been ordered to pay any taxes for the same acts of which he had been accused . There was no duty to pay compensation to the tax authorities as , according to ORG , there was not even any taxable income .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( laki verotusmenettelyst\u00e4 , lagen om beskattningsf\u00f6rfarande , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given false information to taxation authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied , the tax payer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with an additional tax and a tax surcharge .", "According to LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen ; as amended by Act no . DATE ) , a person who ( CARDINAL ) gives a taxation authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax , ( CARDINAL ) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax , ( CARDINAL ) for the purpose of avoiding tax , fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation , influencing the assessment of tax , or ( CARDINAL ) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed , or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded , shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of DATE . If by the tax fraud ( CARDINAL ) considerable financial benefit is sought or ( CARDINAL ) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole , the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period DATE .", "In the case ORG CARDINAL-B-CARDINAL ORG found that no tax could be levied on a person for disguised dividends if the person did not own any shares in the company in question .", "In the case ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ORG found that a conviction for tax fraud would require that , in any event , a tax be levied . It stated the following :", "\u201c According to [ LAW , LAW , subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW ] , a conviction for tax fraud requires that the offender has caused or attempted to cause that , in general , a tax shall not be levied . It does not require that the amount of the said tax would have to be confirmed finally by a tax decision or otherwise . In its decision , a general court is also not bound by decisions rendered in taxation or administrative law proceedings although it is natural that the said kind of decision has cogent significance in the discretion . Ultimately , a court shall consider itself the amount of tax at issue . Therefore , the fact that a dispute exists regarding the fiscal sanction does not mean that the essential elements of tax fraud could not be considered to have been fulfilled . The requirement is , however , that a tax shall be ordered in the matter . In such a situation , a taxpayer can not , either , hinder or try to hinder a tax to be levied without the threat of a sanction by not filing an appropriate notification only on the grounds that the question of determination of tax is in his or her opinion not clear . \u201d", "ORG has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its recent precedent case ORG which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud . In that case it found , inter alia , that , in addition to res judicata force , traditionally pending criminal charges already prevent in GPE the bringing of another set of criminal proceedings brought in the same matter ( lis pendens ) . Both principles apply only within the limits of criminal proceedings , not in cases crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa . It is the duty of the public prosecutor to make sure ex officio before pressing charges that there are no other pending criminal cases on the same matter against the accused . Such a duty does not exist in relation to cases which cross over the limits of criminal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
