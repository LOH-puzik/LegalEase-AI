He also reserved the right to contest both the admissibility of the case brought against him and its merits . In additional submissions made at the hearing he requested that \" the proceedings be stayed ... until the appeal [ he ] intend[ed ] to lodge against the council \u2019s decision had been heard \" . Finally , he refused to present argument on the merits , despite having been invited to do so by the council , and withdrew from the hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG The council gave its decision on DATE .

It then noted that none of the members of the ORG whom he had accused of having a \" negative attitude towards him \" sat on the council to which it fell to determine the disciplinary proceedings . Lastly , it pointed out that CARDINAL of the council members whom the applicant had challenged had not heard the case in question and that the fifth had only been present in an advisory capacity and had not taken part in the deliberations . It accordingly dismissed the application challenging the council en bloc and ruled that the application concerning the CARDINAL medical practitioners was inadmissible and ill - founded .", "The council gave its decision on the request for a stay of the proceedings in the following terms :", "\" ... quite apart from the inappropriate references to legislation which has no bearing on the case ... , [ the additional ] submissions state in a curiously implausible and contradictory manner that \u2018 by refusing to give a decision on the challenges , the council dismissed them\u2019 ;", "... at no time did the council refuse to give a decision on the challenges ; ... it merely informed PERSON and his lawyers that it would rule on the challenges and the merits in a single decision ; ... during the hearing it did not take any decision whatsoever on the challenges and ...

On DATE he requested a DATE adjournment to enable his new lawyers to prepare his defence . After deliberating , ORG apparently allowed him an adjournment until DATE .", "On DATE he laid a complaint for falsification and use of falsified documents against the members of the bureau of the council of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins ( Dr Remion , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) . He disputed certain entries in the TIME of meetings held on DATE and CARDINAL DATE to consider the complaints against him .

ORG In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE Dr PERSON applied to ORG for a transfer of jurisdiction , claiming that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting ORG of bias ( suspicion l\u00e9gitime ) . He called into question the impartiality of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL full members , PERSON and PERSON , and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL substitute members , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who were or had been officials of the medical unions .", "He first alleged \" in general terms \" that the medical unions had gradually taken control of the various institutions of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins with the result that the policy pursued by the association in fact simply reflected the ORG policies , which were designed purely to safeguard the interests of union members . Consequently , those who opposed this policy through the way in which they practised and the opinions they expressed had good reason to fear that , when hearing a case that concerned them , the union members would not show the impartiality to which everyone was entitled . He maintained , in addition , that the members of ORG bore a grudge against him personally because of the views he had expressed . In DATE he had denounced the collusion between the ORG and the unions and he had joined the \" call of the CARDINAL \" medical practitioners angered by the ORG \u2019s backing of a health care strike organised by the unions . Lastly , he pointed out that the capacity of the disciplinary bodies of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins to conduct proceedings in an objective and impartial manner had been questioned on many occasions by the press , among others , especially in so far as it was possible to be a member of those bodies and a member of the ORG organs at the same time .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled inadmissible the application for a transfer of jurisdiction . It held that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW of DATE on the Ordre des m\u00e9decins ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had set up CARDINAL LANGUAGE - language ORG and that therefore , as a matter of law , it would be impossible to transfer jurisdiction to another NORP - speaking ORG . Removing the case from the board without remitting it to another tribunal would , moreover , be tantamount to a denial of justice .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL on the Ordre des m\u00e9decins ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW no . CARDINAL on the medical profession , the practice of related professions and the medical committees were manifestly unlawful because certain essential procedural requirements had not been complied with prior to their adoption .

He likewise challenged Judge PERSON on the ground that his son was CARDINAL of the medical ORG lawyers . After hearing PERSON , ORG withdrew to deliberate . It then decided to adjourn the proceedings until DATE in order to enable it to \" reconstitute a full board \" in the meantime .", "CARDINAL .
