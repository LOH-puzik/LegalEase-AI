He was represented before ORG , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a qualified electrical engineer and worked as a self - employed ORG ( \u201c IT \u201d ) consultant . The end users of his services were based in GPE . He would ordinarily account for income tax on the taxable profits of his trade or profession in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant became a client of ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) . GPE provided advice to the applicant with respect to a marketed tax avoidance scheme ( \u201c the scheme \u201d ) centred on LOC seeking advantage of GPE DATE ( \u201c the DTA \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the scheme , the applicant no longer supplied his IT consultancy services directly to his end - user clients based in GPE . Instead , an intermediary , ORG ( \u201c the Partnership \u201d ) , which was constituted by CARDINAL companies incorporated and resident in LOC , contracted , directly or indirectly with the end - users to provide the applicant \u2019s services . The intermediary received full payment for such services and the applicant received an DATE fee of GBP CARDINAL ( or less ) from the intermediary . The rest of his reward for his services was received only in his capacity as the owner of a life interest in a Trust established in LOC and of which CARDINAL of the Partnership companies was the trustee .", "CARDINAL . NORP Until the relevant legislation was amended with retrospective effect , the applicant contended that , as a result of the ORG and the legislation then applicable , the income channelled through the trust was not subject to GPE income tax . Nor , apparently , was it subject to NORP tax , since the beneficiary ( the applicant ) , unlike the trustee , was not resident in GPE . The effect of the use of the ORG meant that the applicant was able to reduce his effective income tax rate to an average of PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his tax return for the period CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the applicant claimed relief from income tax in the sum of GBP QUANTITY representing trust income . Relying on domestic jurisprudence , the applicant \u2019s case was that the profits received by the trustee as a partner were not treated as belonging to the trustee but to the beneficiary with an interest in possession under the trust , with the consequence that the income arising from his beneficial interest in possession under the trust could not be assessed to GPE tax .", "CARDINAL . Her Majesty \u2019s Revenue and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) first wrote to the applicant regarding his use of the tax avoidance scheme on DATE . In that letter he was informed that ORG was likely to challenge the validity of the claim . No basis for the challenge was mentioned . The applicant was advised to make payment on account in respect of the disputed sum , so as to avoid the accrual of interest and the incurrence of a possible penalty . It appears that he chose not to do so .", "CARDINAL . Similar correspondence followed in respect of tax years DATE , for which the applicant claimed relief of GBP CARDINAL ; DATE , for which he claimed relief of ORG CARDINAL , and DATE , for which he claimed relief of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG set out reasons for the challenges to the claims of relief , and on DATE it informed the applicant that it was preparing a number of lead cases to take to the Special Commissioners regarding the validity of the claims to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , before the cases were listed , ORG announced , in its ORG of DATE , proposals to introduce what became section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) , which came into force on DATE . LAW of ORG of DATE amended with retrospective effect the existing legislation in section CARDINAL of ORG and Other Income ) Act DATE . Any assessment to income tax ( in the absence of fraud or negligence ) was limited to DATE , so that the retrospective effect of section DATE extended no further back than to DATE . The effect of this change of legislation was to render the scheme ineffectual and to impose on the applicant and others in a similar position liability to pay GPE income tax on trust income received in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG revised the applicant \u2019s tax assessments accordingly . The revisions and the validity of the legal basis on which they were made were challenged by the applicant by way of legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought judicial review proceedings in ORG against ORG on DATE . At this stage his outstanding tax liability was MONEY . He sought to challenge sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW under LAW DATE . His ground of challenge was that these sections of LAW changed fiscal legislation regarding double taxation relief with retrospective effect and that such retrospective amendment did not strike a fair balance as required by LAW and the jurisprudence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON dismissed the claim , finding that the challenged legislation , although having retrospective effect was , in the relevant circumstances , proportionate and compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which heard the matter over DATE in DATE , and judgment was delivered on DATE . Lord Justice Mummery giving the lead judgment dismissed the appeal , finding that the High Court judge had not been wrong to conclude that the retrospective provisions of the CARDINAL Act were proportionate and compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL . Mummery LJ noted that the applicant had taken advantage of a marketed tax avoidance scheme for no other purpose than the avoidance of GPE income tax . According to him , the retrospective amendments were enacted pursuant to a justified fiscal policy that was within the ORG \u2019s area of appreciation and discretionary judgment in economic and social matters . The legislation achieved a fair balance between the interests of the general body of taxpayers and the right of the applicant to the enjoyment of his possessions , without imposing an unreasonable economic burden on him . Moreover , the legislation prevented the ORG tax relief provisions from being misused for a purpose different from their originally intended use . On the issue of prior test litigation , ORG upheld PERSON finding that there was no legal obligation on the ORG to test the matter of the efficacy of the scheme in the courts before enacting legislation . Moreover , taxpayers were not powerless to bring the issue to a head themselves ( under provisions in s.CARDINALA of ORG ) without waiting for ORG to bring proceedings in respect of the arrangements . They did not pursue such a course . Concerning a possible pre - legislation assessment of the impact of retrospectivity on the taxpayers concerned , ORG found in the circumstances such an assessment would not have yielded any relevant information which ORG did not already know .", "CARDINAL . At this stage , the figure of the tax relief the applicant was ultimately deprived of was in the region of GBP CARDINAL . According to ORG , this liability was no more an unjustified interference with his enjoyment of his possessions than the ordinary liability that his fellow residents in GPE were under a duty to contribute , by way of GPE tax on their income , towards the costs of providing community and other benefits for the purposes of life in a civil society .", "CARDINAL .
