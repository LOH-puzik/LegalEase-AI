The applicant was born in DATE and lives in FAC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE a new concept called \u201c tax asset stripping cases \u201d ( selskabst\u00f8mmersager ) came into existence in GPE . It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive , solvent private limited companies within a short period and , for the sake of their own profit , \u201c stripping \u201d the companies of assets , including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax . The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities , which concerned very large amounts of money . According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities , CARDINAL companies with a total tax debt exceeding MONEY ( ORG ) were stripped in the period from DATE until DATE . Following a number of legislative amendments , the trade in inactive , solvent companies largely ceased in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant learnt via a local newspaper that he was the subject of an investigation , as was a private limited stockbrokers company , of which he was part owner .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE he informed the police that he was available for an interview , if required . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the police confirmed that they were in the process of investigation and informed the applicant that they would talk to him at a later stage .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE , CARDINAL discovery orders were issued against CARDINAL banks , CARDINAL search warrants were issued and numerous interviews were held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and charged , inter alia , with aggravated debtor fraud . On DATE he was detained in solitary confinement , which was prolonged at regular intervals until he was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an oral hearing took place before ORG ( PERSON ORG - hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , during which the prosecution stated that the investigation was concluded and that the indictment could be expected at DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE various investigative steps were taken , notably relating to CARDINAL co - accused in the case , for example searches in GPE , GPE and GPE , numerous interviews in GPE and abroad , international letters of request , a request to ORG , CARDINAL discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant \u2019s name . Moreover , on DATE a request for an accountant \u2019s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained , including statements of account , cheque vouchers and so on .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the indictment was submitted to ORG according to which the applicant ( and CARDINAL co - accused : A , B , N , M and R ) were charged of \u201c tax asset stripping \u201d committed jointly . The applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts out of a total of CARDINAL committed DATE and DATE . His responsibility related to an amount of DKK CARDINAL ( approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) out of the total amount of tax evaded in the case which came to approximately ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , CARDINAL pre - trial hearings were held and the draft of the accountant \u2019s reports was submitted . On the former date , the case was set down for trial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , a total of CARDINAL hearings were held . The applicant , the CARDINAL co - accused and CARDINAL witnesses were heard , including state - registered public accountants . Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced . The court records comprised CARDINAL pages . The closing speeches were held over DATE in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment , but on CARDINAL count he was acquitted . The co - accused were also convicted . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In addition , an amount of DKK CARDINAL was seized , and he was deprived for an indefinite period of his right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval , or to become a manager and/or member of a director \u2019s board of such companies .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with LAW , stating the following :", "\u201c ORG finds no reason to criticise the prosecution \u2019s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [ applicant and the CARDINAL coaccused ] . Accordingly , and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character , ORG finds no violation of LAW , although there were longer periods of inactivity during CARDINAL part of the case , while investigation was going on in another part of the case . In this connection [ ORG ] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [ the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused ] partly when buying and \u201c stripping \u201d the companies for assets , partly when writing off projects abroad , necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope . In ORG opinion there were no longer periods , whether before the police , the prosecution or ORG , during which no part of the case proceeded . It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges , the cases against [ M ] and [ the co - accused B and R ] could not proceed before the cases against [ the applicant , N and A ] [ had been heard ] . [ Finally ] , in view of the character and complexity of the case , [ ORG ] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused appealed against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON - \u201c the High Court \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , CARDINAL preparatory hearings were held , including CARDINAL on DATE during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on DATE . Counsel for the applicant and the co - defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during the DATE .", "CARDINAL . Thus , although the trial commenced on DATE , most of the hearings took place in DATE and DATE . A total of CARDINAL hearings were held in the case . In DATE the appeal hearings had to be postponed because the applicant fell ill . For the same reason ORG changed the order of some of the hearings . ORG records comprised CARDINAL pages . The closing speeches were held over DATE in DATE , DATE , and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . As regards the length of the proceedings , it stated :", "\u201c In the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time , the starting point ... concerning the [ applicant ] was on DATE , when he was charged ...", "[ ORG ] upholds ORG judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether LAW has been violated ...", "The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay . On DATE the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from CARDINAL DATE . A number of hearing dates in DATE and DATE had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [ with other cases ] , for which reason the [ present ] case was delayed . To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear , the trial , which commenced on DATE , proceeded in a proper , but not completely suitable order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE , the applicant and the codefendants requested that the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) grant them leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . CARDINAL of the defendants stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments , which were received on DATE . In DATE the cases were sent to the prosecution , which gave its opinion on DATE . The applicant and the codefendants gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on CARDINAL DATE the Leave to ORG decided to refuse the requests . Letters of refusal were not sent out , however , as on DATE counsel for CARDINAL of the co - defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , due to an error , nothing happened in the case until DATE , when the police telephoned the Leave to Appeal Board and drew attention to the case . Subsequently , on his request , counsel for the relevant co - defendant who had wanted to submit supplementary comments did so on DATE . The applicant and the co - defendant were informed on DATE that their requests for leave to appeal to ORG had been refused ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
