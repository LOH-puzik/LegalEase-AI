By being a member of the party and carrying out activities on its behalf she had availed herself of the right of all citizens to engage in political activity . She had always carried out such activity within the law and within the limits laid down in the LAW . Her action to promote peace within GPE and in its external relations and her combat against neo - fascism were in no way indicative of an anti - constitutional stance . The ORG , whose aims had always been wrongly alleged ( but never proven ) to be anti - constitutional , took part lawfully in the process of forming political opinion in GPE . Lastly , according to a report issued by ORG on DATE , the institution of disciplinary proceedings against civil servants on account of their political activities on behalf of a party that had not been banned breached ORG ( ILO ) Convention No . CARDINAL concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation . It also violated Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On the merits , ORG held that the applicant had failed to comply with her duty of political loyalty and ordered her dismissal as a disciplinary measure . It granted her a sum equivalent to MONEY of her pension entitlement at that date , to be paid for a DATE period .", "The division found in the first place that neither ORG . CARDINAL nor the recommendations made in ORG report of CARDINAL DATE constituted a bar to the opening of disciplinary proceedings .", "It considered that active membership of a political party that pursued anti - constitutional aims was incompatible with a civil servant 's duty of political loyalty . The ORG 's aims , as described in the GPE programme of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were clearly opposed to the free democratic constitutional system of GPE . A party could be held to be anti - constitutional even if it had not been banned by ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Through the active role which she played within the ORG the applicant had therefore clearly supported aims that were contrary to LAW .", "ORG added that the rule , laid down in the first sentence of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , according to which no one may be prevented from taking office as a member of parliament , could not justify the applicant 's standing as the ORG candidate in regional elections . This rule did not apply to measures , such as disciplinary proceedings , which initially had a different purpose and restricted the freedom to stand for election to , and to sit as a member of , parliament only as an indirect and unavoidable consequence of their implementation .", "The duty of political loyalty , which admittedly restricted civil servants ' fundamental rights , was one of the traditional principles of the civil service and had constitutional status by virtue of LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It followed that this duty took precedence over the provisions of international instruments such as LAW .", "The applicant had moreover carried out her political activities despite being familiar with the case - law establishing that active membership of the ORG was incompatible with the duty of political loyalty . She must have been aware , at the latest once ORG PERSON ) had delivered its judgment of DATE , which was published in an official education - authority circular and was brought to the attention of the applicant in person , that her conduct was in breach of her duties ( pflichtwidriges PERSON ) . PERSON had accordingly to be dismissed for having betrayed the relationship of trust between herself and her employer . Throughout the disciplinary proceedings she had moreover repeatedly indicated that she intended to continue her political activities for the ORG despite the warnings she had received . The fact that she had done her work satisfactorily for DATE and that she had been held in high regard by her pupils and their parents alike was immaterial .", "ORG finally ordered that PERSON should be paid MONEY of her pension allowance for DATE . It did so in recognition of the fact that apart from her breach of the duty of loyalty PERSON had always performed her duties unexceptionably and enthusiastically and needed some income to be protected from immediate hardship .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the above judgment with ORG , reiterating her previous arguments ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed PERSON appeal and upheld ORG judgment in all respects .", "It pointed out that , by carrying out activities on behalf of the ORG , the applicant had breached the duty of political loyalty that she owed in accordance with LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW , taken together with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . Under those provisions , civil servants must at all times bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of LAW and uphold that system . They must unequivocally dissociate themselves from groups who criticise , campaign against and cast aspersions on the State , its institutions and the existing constitutional system . As a result of her activities as a member of the ORG the applicant had failed to satisfy these requirements . The ORG 's political aims were incompatible with that system .", "The fact that ORG had not banned the ORG did not prevent other courts from finding that the party was anti - constitutional , as ORG and ORG itself had done convincingly in judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . An analysis of the still current GPE programme made by ORG in their book on the ORG 's methods and objectives ( PERSON , CARDINALnd edition , DATE ) showed that the party , which aimed to establish a regime similar to that existing in the communist countries around DATE , continued to be guided by the principles of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and the corresponding legislation of ORG securing the right to take office as a member of parliament did not set limits on the duty of political loyalty , since those provisions were not applicable to impediments resulting from disciplinary proceedings . The court held that the applicant 's reference to LAW CARDINAL of LAW , which secured the right to freedom of expression , was not relevant as the provisions governing the civil service mentioned in LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW had to be regarded as general laws within the meaning of LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Similarly , ORG had ruled that a decision by a competent authority relating to admission to the civil service did not amount to an interference with freedom of expression . The same approach applied in cases where a person had already been appointed to a permanent civil service post .", "PERSON conduct had been unlawful . By holding such a senior political post within the ORG , she necessarily espoused anti - constitutional aims and had therefore to be considered to be opposed to LAW herself , although she proclaimed her attachment to LAW . It was not possible to support both systems at the same time .", "Even though PERSON sought above all to achieve some of the ORG 's short - term objectives such as reducing unemployment , promoting peace and eliminating so - called ORG ( prohibitions on pursuing various occupations ) , this did not mean that her conduct was not culpable . The ORG 's aims were admittedly not all anti - constitutional ; some of them were compatible with LAW . However , civil servants could not , as a means of furthering their own political objectives , make use of a party with anti - constitutional aims and help it to come to power . In this connection ORG referred to the following observations made by ORG ) in a judgment of DATE , adding that it adopted them as it was convinced that exactly the same reasoning applied to the case before it :", "\" It is admittedly possible to accept the view of ORG [ ORG ] that the official in question does not seek to change the system of government of ORG by the use of force and that this declaration can not be dismissed as mere ' lip - service ' . It is also possible to accept his claim that he is mainly concerned with correcting what he perceives to be a discrepancy between the principles laid down in the LAW and their application in practice in GPE and that he is profoundly sincere in his wish to establish a society that is more just , particularly in the economic sphere . However , contrary to the view taken by ORG , this does not mean that he is entitled to see in the ORG the political grouping through which he believes he can achieve his ideal political order . It appears doubtful whether the view of the LAW espoused by the official and described above reflects accurately the principles enshrined in LAW . It is not necessary to resolve that question here . In its judgment banning the former ORG ( ORG ) ( BVerfGE CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that not only the ' tactics of conflict ' employed by the former ORG but also the different phases of the process leading to attainment of its final objective of ' socialist rule ' [ sozialistische Herrschaft ] , namely proletarian revolution by peaceful or violent means and the triumph of the working class ... , were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system . [ It ] also stated that intensive propaganda and persistent unrest aimed at establishing - even if this was not to be achieved in the near future - a political regime that was clearly contrary to the free democratic constitutional system inevitably caused direct and immediate harm to that system ... ORG thus also unquestionably held that the transitional stages of this process , which were of indefinite duration [ and which the party sought to impose ] through intensive propaganda and persistent unrest were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system ( BVerwGE CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Hence , contrary to the view taken by ORG , the civil servant 's assertion that he did not intend to change ORG political system by violent means , which is moreover consistent with many statements made by his party , is of no legal significance ( BVerwGE DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . \"", "The court also considered that the applicant 's commitment to changing the ORG 's policies could not exculpate her . The political loyalty owed by civil servants entailed a duty for them to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups which criticised or cast aspersions on the ORG and the existing constitutional system . The attitude of civil servants who , even if they campaigned within the ORG for the renunciation of aims that were contrary to LAW , showed outside the party , through the political offices they held , that they unreservedly supported its programme and policy , was incompatible with such a duty . For as long as the ORG had not abandoned its anti - constitutional aims , civil servants ' duty of political loyalty prevented them from actively working for it . This remained valid even where it was their intention to bring the party closer to democratic values . Moreover , during the disciplinary proceedings the applicant had declared her unconditional support for the ORG 's aims , as set out in the GPE programme .", "Like ORG , ORG found that PERSON had knowingly breached her professional obligations . Although she was aware of the case - law and her superiors ' views on the subject , she had continued and even stepped up her activities on behalf of the ORG . Her dismissal had therefore been justified , since a civil servant who thus persisted in breaching her duties and refusing to see reason ( unbelehrbar ) was no longer capable of serving the ORG , which must be able to rely on its servants ' loyalty to LAW . The court added that such a breach of duty was especially serious in the case of a teacher , who was supposed to teach the children entrusted to her care the fundamental values of the LAW . Parents , who because of compulsory education had to send their children to ORG schools , were entitled to expect the ORG to employ only those teachers who unreservedly supported the free democratic constitutional system . The ORG was under a duty to dismiss teachers who played an active role in an anti - constitutional organisation .", "The court added that a radical change in a civil servant 's attitude could affect its assessment of the seriousness of professional misconduct . However , throughout the disciplinary proceedings , far from cutting down on her activities on behalf of the ORG , the applicant had in fact increased them . It followed that a more lenient disciplinary measure , aimed at persuading her to abandon her political activities within the ORG , was bound to fail . Accordingly , it was impossible to continue to employ her as a civil servant and her dismissal was inevitable . Her otherwise blameless conduct in carrying out her teaching tasks did not change the situation in any way , since the basis of trust that was essential for her to continue as a civil servant was lacking .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint ( ORG ) with ORG .", "Sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , the court decided on DATE not to entertain the constitutional complaint , on the ground that it had insufficient prospects of success .", "In ORG view , the competent courts ' analysis was based on the conviction that , by her membership of the ORG and her active role within that party , the applicant had breached her duties as a civil servant . This conclusion was well - founded and in no way arbitrary . After the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings , PERSON had herself stated that there was no point , section or part of the ORG 's programme of which she disapproved , thus endorsing unconditionally the party 's aims set out in the GPE programme . The disciplinary tribunals had been entitled to find that the ORG 's aims were anti - constitutional , notwithstanding the provisions of LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW . Regard being had to the applicant 's intractability in respect of her political loyalty , the disciplinary courts had rightly considered that the basis of trust necessary for PERSON to continue to work as a civil servant was lacking , despite the fact that she had declared herself to be in favour of a change in the party 's policy and had otherwise carried out her teaching tasks in a way that was irreproachable . The applicant 's dismissal had therefore not amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality as regards her constitutional rights . Accordingly , there had been no violation of LAW paras . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
