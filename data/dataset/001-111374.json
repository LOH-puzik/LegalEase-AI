GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a national of GPE and GPE who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . His application was lodged on DATE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON O.Wallasch , lawyers practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that there was a strong suspicion that he had offered to instigate a third person to commit a murder of a public prosecutor and that he had agreed with a third person to commit a further murder . The warrant was further based on the strong suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL offences under LAW . The court found that the applicant was likely to abscond as he had to expect a severe sentence and had family ties in LOC .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested .", "On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was to continue .", "On DATE ORG extended the facts of the warrant of arrest to the suspicion that the applicant had been dealing with drugs ( QUANTITY of cannabis ) to a considerable extent ( ORG in nicht geringer ORG .", "On DATE ORG charged the applicant with attempting to instigate a third person to commit a murder and with conspiracy to commit a murder ( Verabredung eines Mordes ) . He was further accused of dealing with drugs to a considerable extent and with CARDINAL offences under LAW . Moreover , he was charged with CARDINAL offences under LAW and CARDINAL counts of human trafficking committed by a gang . Finally he was charged with CARDINAL counts of forging official documents . The bill of indictment consisted of CARDINAL pages and named CARDINAL witnesses living in CARDINAL different countries .", "On DATE ORG admitted the indictment without modifications and decided to open the trial against the applicant and CARDINAL other accused . The trial started on DATE .", "On DATE ORG adapted the warrant of arrest . It found that the applicant was likely to abscond as his son and partner had moved to GPE and as he had to expect a severe prison sentence .", "On DATE , after the trial had taken place on DATE , ORG and the applicant came to an agreement . They agreed on a minimum sentence of DATE and DATE ORG imprisonment and that all other pending criminal proceedings against the applicant were to be terminated . Further , the ORG agreed to apply for the conditional release of the applicant when he would have served CARDINAL of his sentence provided that the applicant \u2019s conduct during the detention would be without reproach and that he would not commit any further offences . The agreement was noted in the minutes .", "On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and DATE ORG imprisonment for conspiracy to commit a murder , for drug trafficking with a considerable amount of drugs and for CARDINAL offences under LAW . ORG took into consideration the length of the criminal proceedings as well as the length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand as mitigating factors . The applicant was acquitted of the remaining offences he had been accused of . Simultaneously , ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was to continue .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law against ORG judgment .", "On DATE the complete reasoning of the judgment was taken to the file . On DATE the minutes were completed and taken to the file .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the arrest warrant . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal against the arrest warrant . On DATE ORG confirmed this decision . On DATE the applicant filed a request for reconsideration ( NORP ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the request . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decision of ORG , finding it inadmissible due to the applicant \u2019s failure to submit all court decisions .", "On DATE the applicant applied again to ORG and requested to lift the warrant of arrest or to suspend its execution .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was to continue .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG and remitted the case to that court . It stated that the detention on remand violated the applicant \u2019s constitutional right to liberty as the courts had failed to adhere to the principle to hear cases more speedily in which the accused is detained ( Beschleunigungsgebot in Haftsachen ) . ORG scrutinized the various stages of the applicant \u2019s trial that had taken place so far . It had regard to the fixing of the hearing schedule by ORG and found that the conduct of CARDINAL hearing per week only contradicted the case - law of ORG in similar voluminous cases which disclosed that CARDINAL hearings per week had to be conducted . ORG found that the scheduling of the trial alone was likely to constitute a violation of the constitutional principle to have one \u2019s case heard more speedily . ORG evaluated the further delays that had occurred after the pronouncement of the verdict as a whole . It noted , inter alia , that ORG had taken the reasoning of its judgment to the case file only after DATE had passed since its pronunciation . It attributed a further delay of DATE to the judicial authorities as the applicant was notified of the judgment only after this period . ORG stated that ORG had therefore failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant \u2019s right to liberty under LAW second sentence of the NORP Basic PERSON on the one hand and the state \u2019s duty to prosecute crimes on the other hand . Referring to the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ( extracts ) ) ORG argued that the more the detention on remand lasted the more reasoning it required . It stressed , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand had lasted already CARDINAL of the sentence imposed on him and that ORG had agreed to favour his release when CARDINAL of the sentence had been executed . It further ordered ORG to reconsider the applicant \u2019s appeal . Simultaneously it stressed that the established breaches of the principle to more speedily hear cases in which the accused is detained did not justify a further detention on remand .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG dated DATE . The applicant was released .", "On DATE counsel filed the reasons for the applicant \u2019s appeal . On CARDINAL DATE ORG sent the case file to ORG . However , some parts of the case file had not been attached by mistake and were sent later on demand of ORG . On DATE ORG received the missing parts of the case file . On DATE ORG finished his observations on the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( Revisionsgegenerkl\u00e4rung ) . On DATE the case file was sent to ORG . On DATE the case file was sent to ORG in order to rectify errors in TIME . ORG returned the case file on DATE .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the judgment of ORG as to the conviction . Simultaneously , it reduced the cumulative sentence imposed on the applicant from DATE and DATE and DATE of imprisonment . The remainder of the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed", "ORG found that the law enforcement authorities had violated LAW by unreasonably delaying the criminal proceedings against the applicant . It referred in so far to the judgment of ORG dated DATE . ORG also stressed that the main proceedings before ORG had lasted very long . It noted that although ORG had taken account of the length in its fixing of the sentence it could not have considered any delays which had occurred after the pronouncement of the verdict . In order to compensate for the delay in the proceedings , ORG reduced each separate sentence imposed on the applicant for DATE and the cumulative sentence for DATE .", "The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of ORG . On DATE ORG found that the constitutional complaint was inadmissible and refused to admit it for consideration . ORG found that the applicant had failed to challenge the length of the proceedings before ORG in a sufficient manner ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
