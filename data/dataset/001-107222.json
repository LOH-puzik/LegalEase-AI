ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "According to the applicant , on DATE he was arrested by police officers in connection with crimes he had committed in DATE . Before that date , the applicant had been hiding from investigators .", "On DATE the ORG established that the applicant had committed murder , theft and CARDINAL serious assaults . The applicant had committed some of those crimes as part of an organised group . On the basis of a forensic expert examination of DATE the court found , however , that when breaching the law the applicant had been suffering from a chronic mental illness ( paranoid schizophrenia ) and could not understand his actions . Instead of a prison sentence , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s confinement in a psychiatric institution under strict observation ( grie\u017eto steb\u0117jimo s\u0105lygomis ) .", "On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG . The doctors prescribed him compulsory medical treatment and administered various neuroleptics used for treating schizophrenia ( PERSON , PERSON , ORG ) . To counteract the undesirable side effects of those drugs , the doctors also prescribed the applicant PERSON .", "In DATE the commission of psychiatrists concluded that the applicant \u2019s mental state had improved in the course of the treatment and that he showed no aggressiveness towards others . On that ground , in DATE ORG ordered the implementation of the recommendation by a doctor at ORG that the applicant \u2019s compulsory treatment under strict observation be replaced by a milder regime DATE he was placed under \u201c intensive observation \u201d in the psychiatric hospital ( sustiprinto steb\u0117jimo s\u0105lygomis ) .", "On DATE the applicant attacked the head of the hospital unit with a knife .

As a result , by a decision of ORG on DATE , the regime of strict observation was re - imposed .", "The treatment regimes applied to the applicant during the period relevant to the case were reviewed by ORG on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; CARDINAL DATE and DATE ; and CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE a panel of doctors again diagnosed the applicant with paranoid schizophrenia . The applicant was characterised as aggressive , and uncritical of his crimes or the attack on the doctor .", "On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s confinement in the psychiatric hospital under strict observation . The court observed that , according to the conclusions of the panel of doctors , the applicant \u2019s mental condition was unstable , he was aggressive towards the medical staff and was uncritical of his behaviour . The court concluded that the applicant was still a danger to society .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . The court stated that the applicant was still dangerous and that the doctors had concluded that his mental condition was still unstable . It appears from this decision that both courts based their decisions on the psychiatric expert report of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s confinement in the psychiatric hospital under strict observation , based on the conclusions by the panel of doctors of DATE that the applicant was still a danger to society and that his mental state was still unstable .", "In DATE the treating doctor noted in the applicant \u2019s medical file that she was continuing to treat the applicant with ORG injections once DATE . At the same time she was reducing the dosage of PERSON , because of an absence of any clear side effects .", "In reply to the ORG \u2019s request to provide an independent expert report as to the appropriateness of the treatment the applicant received in DATE and DATE , the ORG submitted a report by ORG , dated DATE .", "The report reads that from DATE the applicant was treated with the long - acting neuroleptic ORG , administered once DATE . Given that the applicant showed no contraindications and had no complaints about the treatment , on DATE the doctor decided to stop administering PERSON . After being injected with PERSON on DATE , the applicant expressed a concern that he felt stiffness ( pacientas i\u0161reisk\u0117 nuog\u0105stavim\u0105 , kad j\u012f gali \u201c sukaustyti \u201d ) . The doctor then prescribed him CARDINAL mg of PERSON , to be administered once a day . Afterwards the applicant felt well again and the doctor noticed no side effects of the neuroleptics . On CARDINAL DATE the doctor stopped administering PERSON , on the ground that patients could get used to it and abuse it . The applicant did not receive PERSON until DATE , when he complained of having felt a slight tremor in his fingers as a side effect of ORG . Since that date the applicant has been receiving PERSON .", "On DATE the ORG approved the applicant \u2019s continued confinement in the psychiatric hospital under strict observation . The court stated that the decision was based on the conclusions of the panel of doctors .", "On DATE the ORG once again approved the applicant \u2019s continued confinement in the psychiatric hospital under strict observation . Based on an examination by doctors on DATE , the court concluded that the applicant was still a danger to society . The court also noted that on DATE , after a visit from relatives , the applicant had tried to bring his own psychotropic medication into the hospital ward .", "By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG maintained its decision that the applicant should be kept in the psychiatric hospital under strict observation . The court based its decision on the ORG conclusion that the applicant was still a danger to society , his mental state was not stable and he was not critical of the crimes he had committed .", "According to the aforementioned report by ORG , GPE , a professor and the director of the psychiatric clinic of ORG , had evaluated the applicant \u2019s treatment as an expert and concluded that from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant had been properly diagnosed and appropriate psychotropic medication had been prescribed to him . Moreover , on DATE the doctor had correctly decided to stop administering PERSON to the applicant . The treatment with PERSON had been temporarily resumed , after the applicant had informed the doctors of side effects . However , as the side effects did not materialise , DATE the doctor again decided to stop administering PERSON . The psychiatrist also pointed out that PERSON , besides being able to correct the side effects of neuroleptics , was a drug capable of causing psychological and physical dependency in patients . Therefore PERSON was to be prescribed only if clear side effects were visible .", "ORG concluded that the treatment the applicant had received in ORG in DATE had been appropriate and not in breach of the applicable legislation . The inspectorate also noted that there had been no other health - care related violations at the institution , unrelated to the services provided to the applicant .", "At the time relevant to this case , LAW provided that a person who , owing to chronic mental illness or temporary mental incapacity , could not understand or control his or her actions when committing a crime could not be held criminally liable . Pursuant to LAW , the court would take a decision to place a person in a psychiatric institution under general , intensive or strict observation , depending on the danger posed by the person to society and the likelihood that he or she might commit a fresh crime . The person would stay in a psychiatric institution until he or she regained a normal mental state or until he or she ceased to be a danger to society . The court was to review the imposed measure DATE .", "A patient \u2019s right to appropriate treatment is provided for in LAW on the Rights of Patients and Compensation for Damage to Their Health . The same provision is envisaged in LAW . Both of these legal acts provide that where a person considers that his or her rights as a patient have been violated , he or she may complain in writing to the treating medical institution , and , if not satisfied with the answer received , to a court ( Articles DATE and CARDINAL respectively ) .", "The Civil Code provides that civil liability may arise from non - performance of a duty established by law or a contract or from violation of the general duty to behave with care ( Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . When a person \u2019s health is impaired , the person liable for the damage shall be bound to compensate the aggrieved person for all his suffering , including non - pecuniary damage ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "According to the Regulations of the State Medical Audit Inspectorate at ORG , ORG task is to carry out ORG control and expertise of the accessibility and quality ( adequacy ) of personal health - care services provided by health - care institutions . It may review ORG requests , applications and complaints .", "The Government submitted details of domestic case - law as regards domestic remedies in cases of medical malpractice .", "They referred , first , to the ruling of DATE in case no . ORG , where ORG pronounced on certain aspects of the legal classification of actions by doctors . With regard to the admissibility of the appeal on points of law , ORG noted that establishment of circumstances proving guilt of a person was a question of fact . However , the legal classification and assessment of such facts constituted a question of law , examining whether or not certain actions of doctors should be found at fault . The court noted that a doctor could not normally guarantee to achieve particular results , that is , that a patient would be cured . Consequently , a patient and a doctor ( or the health - care institution ) were bound by an obligation which encompassed the doctor \u2019s obligations to do his utmost , namely , to ensure the maximum degree of diligence , care , caution and competence . Moreover , the health - care institutions were liable under the rules of delictual liability if damage was caused by the actions of the institution staff . In that particular case ORG found that a doctor had not been sufficiently diligent , given that he had failed to provide the patient with extensive information about additional risks of complications . In reaching that conclusion the court relied , among other evidence , on a report by ORG .", "In the decision of DATE in case no . ORG has examined the legal acts regulating health care and diagnostics for haemothorax . In this case the court also relied on a report by ORG as evidence .", "In the decision of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ORG examined whether a proper care regime had been assigned to a patient hospitalised owing to a poorly plastered broken hand . The court emphasised that patients should be accorded high quality health care , treated in such manner that assured a respectful attitude towards their diagnosis , and that the selected treatment should be justified from a medical point of view . To substantiate its conclusions , the appellate court relied upon expert findings and , among other pieces of evidence , on a report by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
