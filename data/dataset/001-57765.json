He was subsequently detained on remand .", "On the conclusion of the investigations , in which several suspects were involved , he was summoned , on DATE , to appear for trial before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . On DATE he was convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment less the time already spent in police custody and in detention on remand .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE it upheld ORG decision .", "The applicant then , within the time - limit of DATE prescribed by GPE law ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) below ) , introduced an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) by means of a statement made at the registry of ORG . The documents of the case were sent by the registry of that court to the registry of ORG and received there on DATE . PERSON in his advisory opinion proposed its dismissal . However , by judgment of DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment on technical grounds and referred the case to ORG . The registry of ORG sent the documents to the registry of ORG on DATE ; they were received on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney - General at ORG issued a summons against the applicant . ORG heard the case on DATE .", "During the hearing the applicant requested a suspension of his detention on remand and also an adjournment of the hearing in order to have examined CARDINAL witnesses who had been summoned at the request of the defence but who had failed to appear . ORG refused the first request . However , with the agreement of counsel for the defence it adjourned the hearing until DATE ; the reason given for a delay of that length ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) below ) was that the court \u2019s calendar for the intervening period did not permit an earlier date .", "ORG resumed its hearing on DATE , at which point the witnesses who had failed to appear on DATE were examined . It refused a new request by the applicant for suspension of his detention on remand .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment less the time already spent in police custody and detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . Within the time - limit of DATE prescribed by GPE law , Mr PERSON introduced a second appeal on points of law to ORG by means of a statement made at the registry of ORG .", "Pending the hearing of that appeal the applicant made a number of requests to ORG concerning his detention on remand . It suspended the measure for DATE in DATE and again for DATE in DATE . However , on DATE it rejected a request , based inter alia on Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW , for the detention to be terminated or else suspended .", "In DATE ORG again granted CARDINAL GPE leave , but refused to terminate or otherwise suspend the detention .", "CARDINAL . The documents of the case were sent by the registry of ORG to the registry of ORG , which received them on DATE . On a date in DATE , the President of ORG set the hearing for DATE . The applicant , through his counsel , subsequently filed his grounds of appeal .", "Counsel for the defence proposed CARDINAL grounds of appeal . The first of these , the CARDINAL which raised points with which this ORG is concerned , was a complaint about violation of , inter alia , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) and LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c , article DATE ) of the LAW . The explanatory note emphasised that the applicant had been in police custody and detention on remand since DATE and that , as a consequence , both he and his family had developed psychiatric problems . Detention on remand had only been suspended twice on this ground , in each case for DATE , the last such occasion having been in DATE . Although the case was not complex , it had already taken DATE , so that the \" reasonable time \" laid down by LAW had been exceeded . A separate assessment of the various phases of the proceedings led to the same conclusion : in particular , the lapses of time involved in the first appeal on points of law , that involved in the procedure before ORG and the treatment of the second appeal on points of law were such that the said provisions had not been complied with .", "In accordance with the advisory opinion filed on CARDINAL DATE by ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal by judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It held , inter alia , that it had to be assumed that neither the applicant nor his counsel had raised the issue of the length of the proceedings at ORG hearings on DATE and DATE ; that the mere circumstance that the preparation of the case and its examination by ORG and ORG of GPE and ORG had taken DATE ( DATE ) did not in itself oblige ORG to address explicitly the question whether or not the case had been decided within a reasonable time ; and that in addition , taking into account the time that had elapsed between ORG judgment of DATE and ORG DATE hearing , no violation of Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW had taken place . The personal circumstances of the applicant did not warrant any other conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON submitted a request for a pardon .

The registrar of the court which delivered the judgment shall send the documents of the case to the registrar of ORG within DATE after the time - limit for the prosecution to file its written statement has expired or after it has filed a written statement earlier .", "CARDINAL . ... \"", "In practice it was generally assumed that the time - limit according to paragraph CARDINAL of this article was DATE after the date of pronouncement of ORG judgment , irrespective of whether or not the prosecution had lodged an appeal on points of law .", "Before the LAW of DATE ( Staatsblad ( Official Gazette ) CARDINAL ) , which altered ( inter alia ) Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , this provision , like LAW , provided only that the documents were to be sent in \" as soon as possible \" . The time - limit of DATE was introduced \" with a view to expediting the transmission of the file \" .", "By the LAW of DATE ( Staatsblad CARDINAL ) , which came into force on DATE , the time - limit of DATE incorporated in the third paragraph of Article CARDINAL in DATE was removed ; that paragraph now once more provides that the documents are to be sent in \" as soon as possible \" . The reasons given therefor were firstly that , according to the case - law of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , non - compliance with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL did not entail nullity and the rights of the accused in case of unreasonable delay in the proceedings before ORG were in any case protected by Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . Secondly , it was pointed out that in practice this time - limit was only rarely met and that it appeared inappropriate to maintain a provision which \" in relation to the - speedy - pursuit of the proceedings before ORG creates expectations which in practice can hardly if at all be fulfilled \" .", "\" CARDINAL . After the documents have been at the registry for DATE , they shall be taken by the Procurator - General against receipt and forwarded to ORG along with his proposal for fixing a hearing date .", "CARDINAL . The president shall fix the date for the hearing and shall appoint a rapporteur to report at the hearing . \"", "CARDINAL . After referral by ORG , the documents of the case must be sent by its registry to the registry of the court which is to retry the case . However , due to the fact that LAW contains no provisions at all relating to proceedings after referral , a provision comparable to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL and applicable in these cases does not exist .", "CARDINAL . Non - compliance with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL or Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW does not , according to the case - law of ORG , entail nullity : that sanction is not expressly provided for ; neither are these provisions so essential that non - compliance should ipso facto lead to nullity . However , non - compliance is relevant in connection with the question whether the requirement of trial \" within a reasonable time \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW has been complied with ( see , for instance , the judgments of ORG of DATE , GPE ( PERSON ) DATE , CARDINAL , and DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The case - law of ORG relating to the requirement of \" trial within a reasonable time \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW in general , and more especially in relation to the question of the consequences of non - compliance with Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) If the court decides to impose a more lenient sentence , it must take into account the extent of the violation and also indicate the reduction which it has thought fit to apply ( see , for instance , ORG judgments of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "( b ) In order to determine whether or not a \" reasonable time \" has been exceeded , the court must consider both the various phases of criminal proceedings and their overall time - span and take into account all appropriate circumstances in reaching its decision , such as the complexity of the case , the conduct of the accused and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities ( see , for instance , the judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) As the decision as to whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded is thus partly dependent on the assessment of factual circumstances , ORG , which essentially has competence only as regards points of law , can examine the validity of the decision of the judge of fact only to a limited degree ; thus a judgment can only be quashed if it reveals an incorrect view of the concept of trial within a reasonable time or of the standards set out in the preceding paragraph , or if the grounds given for its decision are insufficient ( see , for instance , the judgments of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "Although ORG has held that delaying criminal proceedings for DATE does not in itself warrant the conclusion that a \" reasonable time \" has been exceeded ( see its judgment of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) , it is commonly assumed that in its above - mentioned limited assessment it applies , as a general guideline , a rule presumed to have been derived from the report of ORG in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( Marijnissen ) ( Decisions and Reports CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) endorsed by ORG in its resolution of DATE ( DH ( CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) . This rule may be summarised as follows : in principle , a \" reasonable time \" has been exceeded if the proceedings in CARDINAL of their phases have not been pursued for DATE due to circumstances for which the accused is not responsible ; if such an eventuality occurs and is pleaded by the defence , then a rejection of that plea must be particularly well reasoned . The character of this rule as a general guideline implies , on the one hand , that under certain circumstances stagnation for a shorter period may be a reason for applying such strict requirements to the grounds given for rejecting the defence \u2019s plea that a reasonable time has been exceeded and , on the other hand , apparently , that exceeding the time - limit of DATE may sometimes , perhaps also depending on the further circumstances of the particular case , be allowed to pass .", "( d ) The courts must also address ex officio the question whether a reasonable time has been exceeded . However , it must only appear from the judgment that this has been done if there are special circumstances .", "In considering whether or not such special circumstances are present , ORG uses the general guideline , mutatis mutandis , indicated in sub - paragraph ( c ) . This means that , as a rule , it only holds the lower courts bound to address ex officio the question whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded if it appears from the documents that the proceedings have been held up for DATE due to reasons for which the defence can not be held accountable . However , if there are special circumstances , the courts are obliged to address the question ex officio even if the period of inactivity is shorter ( see , for instance , ORG judgments of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "( e ) The ORG applies these rules itself in the procedure of appeal on points of law and thus addresses , ex officio if need be , the question whether it must be assumed that the duration of proceedings in this phase has led to excessive length of the proceedings . In this connection , it appears from its abundant case - law that the time elapsed between the filing of the appeal on points of law and the sending in of the documents to the registry of ORG has some significance : if this causes such a delay that the case comes up before ORG for the first time DATE after the appeal on points of law was filed , then as a rule the judgment will be quashed and the case will be referred for retrial , at which point the judge of fact will have the options indicated in sub - paragraph ( a ) above of declaring the prosecution inadmissible or of reducing the sentence . However , ORG may itself reach the opinion that no other decision is possible than to declare the prosecution inadmissible , which it may then do of its own motion ( see , for instance , its judgments of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) . On the other hand , if the period of inactivity is shorter , ORG will merely state that the delay is longer than is desirable but that judgment of the case can not be held not to have taken place within a reasonable time ; it will then determine , applying the rule set forth in the preceding sub - paragraph , whether or not special circumstances warrant any different decision ( see , for instance , its judgments of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
