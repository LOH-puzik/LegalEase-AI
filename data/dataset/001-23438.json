The amendment provides for a preliminary examination of cassation appeals . A single judge sitting in camera as ORG may refuse to entertain a cassation appeal if that appeal is manifestly ill - founded .

However , the relevant transitional rules did not explain clearly whether the new procedure should also apply to cassation appeals lodged before DATE . On DATE ORG adopted a resolution ( no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and answered this question in affirmative . The court stressed , inter alia , that the amendments to LAW made it possible to deal with enormous backlog of trivial or manifestly ill - founded cassation appeals .", "Under Section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , a court which has given the contested decision is competent to decide whether all formal requirements for a cassation appeal have been complied with . If an appeal has complied with the formal requirements , the case shall be transferred to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
