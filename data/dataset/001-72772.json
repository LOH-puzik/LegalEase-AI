He claimed that he used to be a member of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the party \u201d ) , an opposition left - wing party . He further claimed that , due to his political involvement , he had been arrested and jailed in DATE and subjected to repeated torture . He had been released after DATE . On DATE the Dhaka Judge Court had sentenced him to life imprisonment with hard labour for illegal possession of arms . However , the verdict had allegedly been an attempt to put an end to his political activity .", "His application was rejected by ORG ) on DATE and by ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) on DATE , which concluded that the applicant would have the opportunity to receive a fair trial upon return to GPE , and that political activity did not , as such , entail persecution by the authorities in GPE . The applicant was sent back to GPE in DATE .", "The applicant returned to GPE on DATE , again applying for asylum . He claimed that , upon arrival in GPE in DATE , he had been arrested by the military and brought to a police station where he had been questioned . Before the questioning , a member of the military had made the secret sign of the Sharbahara party . During the questioning , the soldiers had said that they had been looking for him and that they wanted to know whether he was PERSON , member of the PERSON party . He was then tortured badly and transferred to a prison from which he had escaped in DATE , with the help of a party friend . In spite of the torture he had not revealed his identity , which was , the applicant claimed , probably why the sentence of life imprisonment had not been executed . After having escaped , he had lived in hiding for DATE but had continued to work for the party .", "The applicant further stated that he had been arrested at a party conference in GPE in DATE , after which he had been jailed and repeatedly tortured . After CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment a party friend had helped him escape . Following his escape he had found out that he had been charged with the murder of another prisoner .", "He had again lived in hiding , but had continued to work for the party . He had distributed leaflets and had been able to work quite freely . However , during a demonstration in DATE , he had been arrested and tortured anew . CARDINAL party members had been killed during the demonstration and he had been accused of the killings . Proceedings had been instituted against him in PERSON . He believed that he had escaped sometime in DATE or DATE . This time too , he had received help from a party member . He had subsequently found out that a court in GPE had sentenced him to death in absentia on DATE for the murder of his cell - mate of which he had been accused in DATE .", "In a letter to ORG in DATE the applicant submitted that after his escape in DATE his political party had helped him to contact \u2018 ORG , a nursing home in GPE where he had been treated DATE for his torture injuries . After his escape in DATE , he had returned to ORG and had been treated there DATE between DATE and DATE . Following his escape in DATE , he had received treatment in a nursing home in GPE .", "The party had helped him leave GPE . He submitted before ORG that he risked being killed by his own party , because members who had been jailed were regarded as a security risk since they could reveal secret information concerning the party . His life was also threatened by NORP fundamentalists since he was a NORP . He had once been taken captive by such people and was to be killed . He had , however , managed to scare off his captors . Besides the death sentences against him , the Government had ordered the police to shoot members of the PERSON party .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum . It made the following observations : The applicant had travelled to GPE with a false passport and had not applied for asylum until this had been discovered . He had also submitted unclear information regarding the details of his journey and had thus tried to hide information relevant to the investigation . Considering his submissions that he had on numerous occasions been arrested and tortured , that a life sentence had not been executed because the authorities had not been able to identify him , that he had in the meantime continued to work for the party , that he was persecuted by NORP fundamentalists , and that he risked being executed by his party despite having been continuously helped by the party to escape and in the end to leave the country , ORG concluded that the applicant was not credible . It also remarked that he had not been able to submit any documentation regarding his allegations .", "Upon appeal , ORG , by a decision of DATE , granted the applicant a permanent residence permit . It reiterated that the applicant had been committed under LAW DATE , having been suicidal and diagnosed with potential post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , which had however not been confirmed . The applicant had also submitted a medical certificate concluding that it was probable that he had been subjected to torture as alleged . ORG deferred to the conclusions of ORG with regard to his credibility . However , due to his medical condition , the applicant was entitled to stay in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s wife joined him in GPE in DATE together with their daughter PERSON , born in DATE . PERSON is physically handicapped and dumb . The applicant also has a DATE son in GPE with whom he has no contact . On DATE the applicant was charged with aggravated assault against a woman ( grov kvinnofridskr\u00e4nkning ) , it being alleged , inter alia , that on several occasions he had beaten his wife when she had refused to have sex with other men who had promised the applicant money , and had otherwise systematically abused her . The applicant had replied that , due to the torture he had become impotent and for this reason his wife had met another man . It was the applicant \u2019s understanding that they had conspired to put him in jail .", "On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE convicted the applicant as charged . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and subsequent expulsion from GPE , being forbidden to return before DATE , in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , in conjunction with the relevant provisions of LAW .", "Subsequent to the applicant \u2019s conviction , divorce proceedings between the applicant and his wife had been initiated at ORG . The same court had also awarded the applicant \u2019s former wife custody of their daughter . The applicant had appealed this latter decision .", "Concerning the issue of the applicant \u2019s expulsion , ORG ( Migrationsverket ) submitted to ORG that there was no obstacle to expelling the applicant to GPE . The court did not make any separate assessment in this respect , but deferred to the conclusion of ORG . It further noted that , ever since the applicant had been granted a permanent residence permit in GPE , he had received a social security allowance and had been on sick - leave due to psychiatric problems until DATE . It therefore questioned to what extent he had acquired a real connection to NORP society . Moreover , the violence of which he had been convicted had been aimed at CARDINAL of his CARDINAL family members , his only relatives in GPE . The court held that , considering the nature of the violence and the applicant \u2019s ruthlessness , it could not be excluded that he would again commit a crime in GPE . Having regard to his weak links with GPE , as well as to the fact that he had had a residence permit for DATE , the ORG held that he could be expelled .", "Both the prosecutor and the applicant appealed against the sentence , and the applicant also appealed against the expulsion order . On DATE ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) raised the sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , but otherwise confirmed the verdict and agreed with the assessment of ORG . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta Domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "The applicant \u2019s expulsion was to be enforced on DATE . On DATE the police authority decided that he should be taken into custody upon his release from prison on DATE , to await the execution of his expulsion order .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a petition to ORG , asking that the ORG stay or quash the planned expulsion . No information has been submitted as to the outcome . In support of the petition , the application claimed that proceedings had been initiated against him in GPE for the alleged killing of a Mr PERSON which had supposedly taken place in DATE . A group of investigators had found the applicant guilty of the killing . On CARDINAL and DATE a court had issued an arrest warrant for the applicant , referring to a provision in the NORP penal code under which the penalty , according to the applicant , was death or life imprisonment .", "The applicant has submitted copies of NORP documents and translations thereof . CARDINAL of the documents is a \u201c charge sheet \u201d , dated DATE , according to which the injured party is the widow of the above - mentioned Mr PERSON . The applicant is mentioned as the \u201c hidden guilty person \u201d , apparently registered in an area called LOC within the district of GPE . It follows from the document , without further clarification , that a \u201c preliminary report \u201d had been issued on CARDINAL DATE . The charge sheet refers to the applicant as CARDINAL of the CARDINAL perpetrators of the alleged crime , the effect of which appears to have been the death of Mr PERSON . It states that a body was found covered in blood and that all the evidence was sent to the court . The second document is a ORG \u2019s \u201c court order \u201d , dated CARDINAL and DATE . It refers to a provision in GPE Code under which , according to the applicant , the penalty is death or life imprisonment . The document states that , on DATE , the investigation group found the applicant , who was in hiding , to be guilty as charged . Upon the request of the prosecutor , a warrant for his arrest was issued . The document states at the end \u201c Accused has been accepted \u201d . The copies of the NORP documents are accompanied by a statement from a Mr PERSON , senior advocate in the GPE and ORG . The letter in LANGUAGE is dated DATE , addressed to the applicant and reads , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The punishment of the case might be either death sentence or life imprisonment and the facts of your absconding from the prosecution will contribute and confirm such depth of punishment . I understand quite well that a great unavoidable circumstances like torture and persecution which has been used for you in jail and the possibility of killing by the members of your [ Sharbahara party ] compelled you to leave the country but the nature of the case is ignoring such facts of circumstances . By the fact in issue , you are the master mind and the authority of the event and the possibility of escaping is less as the procedural materials developed in the case . \u201d", "The applicant has also submitted transcripts from his medical journal and some medical certificates . In a transcript dated DATE from ORG f\u00f6r tortyrskadade ) at ORG ( \u201c FAC ) , the doctor concluded that the applicant had many scars and other marks on his body which could very well be the result of certain of the alleged acts of torture . A new transcript from his medical journal at FAC is dated DATE and states that , after his visit in DATE , the applicant submitted that he had been beaten , subjected to electric shocks , burned with cigarettes , drenched with hot water , suffocated , had needles put under his fingernails and his fingernails pulled out , and subjected to strong light and high volume noise . In a certificate dated DATE , also from the Centre , Dr PERSON , specialist in forensic medicine , noted that the applicant had acquired new injuries , many of which were consistent with scarring from cigarette burns . It could not be excluded that some of the marks had been contracted due to disease , but it was less probable that the scars would have arisen due to accidents or that they had been self - inflicted . He concluded that it was probable that the applicant had been tortured or beaten as alleged , and that many of the torture methods mentioned would only occasionally leave any lasting marks . The torture described was furthermore to a great extent compatible with the ORG \u2019s previous experience of torture in GPE .", "In a certificate from the ORG dated DATE , Dr PERSON , chief physician and specialist in general psychiatry , noted that the applicant had urgent thoughts of suicide and was completely absorbed by the memories of traumatic experiences . He had severe sleeping problems and difficulties to eat .
