The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was called up for military service . However , because of his father \u2019s opposition to the collectivisation of farmland , he was not allowed to undergo military training . Instead , he was assigned to a number of military units , including the ORG unit , as a building worker . His military service ended in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG , an administrative body grouping together the military units specially created for conscripts who were barred from military training , was abolished .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c Law no . DATE \u201d ) recognised as forced labour the work performed in the military units coming under the authority of ORG , and provided for compensatory measures including a DATE allowance , free medical treatment and exemption from the television licence fee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the county pensions and social insurance fund ( \u201c the county fund \u201d ) , claiming the benefits available under PERSON no . DATE . In a decision of DATE the county fund refused the application on the ground that the applicant had not performed his military service in a military unit coming under the authority of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against the county fund before ORG , seeking to have the decision of DATE set aside and to be recognised as having performed forced labour during his military service .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found in the applicant \u2019s favour and ordered the county fund to issue a new decision awarding him the benefits provided for by PERSON no . DATE . On the basis of the entries in the applicant \u2019s military service record book , ORG concluded that he had worked on various building projects with the ORG military unit and had been discharged from service as an \u201c untrained combat soldier \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The county fund appealed to ORG and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request , the ORG referred to ORG an objection raised by the applicant as to the constitutionality of LAW no . DATE . The applicant alleged that , in making a distinction between persons who had performed the same kind of forced labour during their military service , the provision in question was in breach of LAW and of LAW . He considered this difference in treatment to be unjustified since it was based solely on the hierarchical structure to which the conscript \u2019s military unit had belonged .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the objection in a judgment of DATE , which included the following passage :", "\u201c The definition of the categories of persons who are eligible for certain measures in compensation for the duress and hardship they underwent in the past ... is a matter for the legislature alone , provided that no privileges or discrimination are engendered between persons belonging to the same category and in identical situations . LAW no . DATE does not give rise to any privileges or discrimination contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE in which it found in favour of the county fund , the ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and remitted the case for further preparation , with a view to determining whether the ORG military unit had been attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE in reply to a request for information made by ORG , the PERSON military unit , which kept the army archives , stated that the ORG military unit did not feature on the list of units attached to ORG . It added that , in accordance with the rules on the implementation of PERSON no . DATE , the list had been drawn up by ORG , which had made it available to the military unit as a \u201c working tool \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the national archives of ORG informed ORG that the ORG military unit had not been attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the information provided by the PERSON military unit and the national archives , and taking the view that PERSON no . DATE applied only to conscripts who had worked in military units coming under the authority of ORG , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the ORG . In his submission , the PERSON military unit , by confining itself to reproducing the information contained in the list drawn up by ORG and omitting to check the recruitment file , which contained proof of the work carried out , had not adequately replied to the request for information from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further contested the distinction made by the PERSON between those conscripts who had performed forced labour in military units answerable to ORG and other conscripts who , although they had performed the same kind of work , were not entitled to benefits under the PERSON solely because their military units had not come under the authority of ORG . He argued that , in any event , the ORG , in a judgment of DATE , had recognised a former conscript in a similar situation to his own as being covered by the provisions of Law no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of ORG on the following grounds :", "\u201c In accordance with PERSON no . DATE , persons who performed their military service DATE in the work brigades under the authority of ORG are covered by the provisions of that PERSON .", "It follows that the decisive criterion for eligibility under the PERSON is not the kind of work performed within the military unit , for example building work , but whether or not the unit in question came under the authority of ORG , within which work brigades were established .", "As a result , given the information provided by the PERSON military unit in its letter stating that the unit to which the applicant belonged was not on the list of units answerable to ORG , ORG was correct in ruling that the conditions for application of the PERSON were not met in the instant case and in dismissing the appeal accordingly . \u201d", "\u201c Any NORP citizen who performed military service DATE in the work brigades coming under the authority of ORG shall be covered by the provisions of this PERSON . \u201d", "\u201c The persons referred to in LAW shall be entitled to a DATE allowance ... \u201d", "\u201c The persons referred to in LAW ... shall also be entitled to ... :", "\u2013 free medical treatment and medicines ... ;", "\u2013 exemption from the television licence fee ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The benefits referred to in the preceding sections shall be awarded on request , regard being had to the entries in the individual \u2019s military service record book or certificates issued by the county military headquarters or the PERSON military unit .", "( CARDINAL ) Requests for these benefits shall be addressed to the county pensions and social insurance funds . \u201d", "\u201c For the purposes of the award of the benefits provided for by this PERSON , the National Pensions and ORG may request the national archives ... to compile , on the basis of the documents at its disposal , a list of the work brigades under the authority of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a case similar to the present one , a former conscript who had performed forced labour in a military unit which did not come under the authority of ORG claimed eligibility under the provisions of PERSON no . DATE . When the county pension fund dismissed his claim on the ground that the PERSON applied only to conscripts in the work brigades , he appealed to ORG , which found in his favour .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the county fund , the ORG upheld ORG judgment on the following grounds :", "\u201c As the fact that the claimant was subjected to forced labour is not in dispute ... , there is no justification for withholding the benefits in question . To do so would be to create an inequitable situation , denying compensation to persons who performed military service in identical conditions and who , for purely formal reasons relating solely to the hierarchical structure to which their military units belonged , would thus be subjected to different treatment of a clearly discriminatory nature . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
