In the meantime , on DATE , before the broadcast of the second programme , the taxi driver had again been interviewed by the police , at the request of ORG \u2019s new counsel . She stated that on DATE she had attended her grandmother \u2019s funeral at TIME and that on her way there , CARDINAL or TIME , she had driven behind X and his son . She had arrived at the funeral just before TIME She also explained that she had told the police about this when first interviewed in DATE . Later on DATE the police carried out a check which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver \u2019s grandmother had indeed taken place on DATE , but at TIME", "Subsequently , the police held CARDINAL interviews with the taxi driver , during which she changed her explanation , in particular as follows .", "On DATE she maintained having seen X shortly after TIME but agreed that the funeral had taken place at TIME On her way there she realised she had forgotten a wreath . She had had to return home and had consequently arrived at the funeral just before TIME", "On DATE she stated that she was not sure about the date or the time she had seen X and his son . Moreover , she was uncertain whether , shortly after the murder , she had told the police about having seen X.

Later during the interview she maintained that she had seen X and his son on DATE , but at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief superintendent reported the applicants and the television station to the police for defamation . It appears , however , that the prosecution \u2019s decision as to whether or not to charge the applicants was adjourned pending the decision whether to reopen X \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . This was decided in the affirmative by ORG on DATE after CARDINAL hearings and the examination of CARDINAL witnesses , including the taxi driver . CARDINAL judges ( out of CARDINAL ) in GPE found that new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted , had it been available at the trial . CARDINAL other judges found that no new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted , had it been available at the trial . The fifth judge agreed with the latter , but found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been judged correctly . Accordingly , the court granted a retrial .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , following the television programmes , an inquiry had commenced into the police investigation of ORG \u2019s case . The inquiry resulted in a report of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , according to which the police in GPE had not complied with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) . This provision , introduced on DATE , provides that a witness must be given the opportunity to read through his or her statement . The non - compliance had not been limited to the investigation in GPE \u2019s case . Instead , allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings , the police in GPE usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of QUANTITY police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible . In this connection , ORG noted that ORG , before which ORG had been convicted in DATE , had not made any comments on the failure to comply with section CARDINAL ) of ORG with regard to the witnesses who were heard before it in DATE . Finally , ORG noted that the GPE district police were apparently not the only district police failing to comply with the said provision . ORG considered it unjustified to maintain that the taxi driver , when interviewed in DATE , had stated that she had seen X on DATE of the murder . During the inquiry this had been contradicted by the CARDINAL police officers who had interviewed her in DATE . Moreover , the inquiry did not indicate that anyone within the GPE police had suppressed any evidence in GPE \u2019s case , or in any other criminal case for that matter .", "Consequently , on DATE , ORG PERSON ) stated in a letter to ORG that it was unfortunate and open to criticism that the police in GPE had not implemented the above provision as part of their usual routine , and informed the Ministry that he had agreed with ORG that he would produce a wider set of guidelines concerning the questioning of witnesses , which could be integrated into ORG educational material .", "CARDINAL . X \u2019s retrial ended with his acquittal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , sitting with a jury .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter of DATE , the lawyer requested that the Prosecutor General state whether the applicants had been charged , and if so with what offence . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , he was told that no charge had been brought against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Constable in GPE informed the applicants that they were charged with defaming the chief superintendent . On DATE the applicants were questioned by the police in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A request of CARDINAL DATE by the prosecution to seize the ORG research material was examined at a hearing in ORG ( Retten i Gladsaxe ) on DATE , during which the ORG counsel , claiming that the case concerned a political offence , requested that a jury in ORG \u2013 instead of ORG \u2013 try the case . Both requests were refused by ORG on DATE . In DATE the prosecution appealed against the decision on seizure and the applicants appealed against the decision on venue .

On DATE ORG delivered a QUANTITY - page judgment , finding that the questions put in the television programme concerning the named chief superintendent amounted to defamatory allegations , which should be declared null and void . However , the court did not impose any sentence on the applicants as it found that they had had reason to believe that the allegations were true . The court also ruled in favour of the applicants regarding a compensation claim by the widow of the named chief superintendent , who had died before the trial . The judgment was appealed against by the applicants immediately , and by the prosecution on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG gave judgment convicting the applicants of tarnishing the honour of the chief superintendent by making and spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the eyes of his fellow citizens , under LAW .

On DATE , DATE and DATE the applicants sought leave from the Leave - to - Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) to appeal to ORG . Before deciding , the ORG requested an opinion from the prosecuting authorities , namely the Chief of ORG , ORG and ORG . On DATE they submitted a joint opinion opposing leave to appeal . However , in the meantime , it appears that a lawyer representing the television station ORG had contacted ORG , proposing that the public prosecution assist in bringing the case before ORG as , according to the television station , ORG judgment was incompatible with LAW ( PERSON ) . Consequently , the public prosecutors initiated a new round of consultation on this question , and their joint opinion was forwarded to ORG . On DATE , having heard the applicants\u2019 counsel on the prosecution \u2019s submissions , ORG granted the applicants leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL .

By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment , but increased the compensation payable to the estate to DKK CARDINAL . The majority of judges ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL ) held :", "\u201c In the programme \u2018 The Blind Eye of the Police\u2019 , [ the applicants ] not only repeated a statement by the taxi driver that she had already explained to the police during their inquiries in DATE that shortly after TIME on DATE she had driven behind X for QUANTITY , but also , in accordance with the common premise for the programmes \u2018 Convicted of Murder\u2019 and \u2018 The Blind Eye of the Police\u2019 , took a stand on the truth of the taxi driver \u2019s statement and presented matters in such a way that viewers , even before the final sequence of questions , were given the impression that it was a fact that the taxi driver had given the explanation as she alleged she had done in DATE and that the police were therefore in possession of this statement in DATE . This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions : \u2018 ... why did the vital part of the taxi driver \u2019s explanation disappear and who , in the police or public prosecutor \u2019s office , should bear the responsibility for this?\u2019 . In connection with the scenes about the QUANTITY police officers [ the applicants ] include CARDINAL questions in the commentator \u2019s narrative , to which the indictment relates ; irrespective of the fact that they were phrased as questions , viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver \u2019s statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on DATE ; that this report had subsequently been suppressed ; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of ORG jointly . The subsequent questions in the commentator \u2019s narrative do not weaken this impression , and neither does the question whether the Chief Constable or the public prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver \u2019s statement . On this basis we find that in the programme \u2018 ORG of the Police\u2019 [ the applicants ] made allegations against the named superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers , within the meaning of LAW [ PERSON ] . We find further that it must have been clear to [ the applicants ] that they were , by way of their presentation , making such allegations .", "[ The applicants ] have not endeavoured to provide any justification but have claimed that there is no cause of action by virtue of LAW \u2013 [ which protects ] a party who in good faith justifiably makes an allegation which is clearly in the general public interest or in the interest of other parties ...", "As laid down in PERSON GPE ( judgment of DATE ) , there is a very extensive right to public criticism of the police . As in that decision there is , however , a difference between passing on and making allegations , just as there is a difference between criticism being directed at the police as such and at individual named officers in the police force . Even though being in the public eye is a natural part of a police officer \u2019s duties , consideration should also be given to his good name and reputation .", "As stated , [ the applicants ] did not limit themselves in the programme to referring to the taxi driver \u2019s statement or to making value judgments on this basis about the quality of the police investigations and the chief superintendent \u2019s leadership thereof . Nor did [ the applicants ] limit themselves to making allegations against the police as such for having suppressed the taxi driver \u2019s explanation ; they alleged that the named chief superintendent had committed a criminal offence by suppressing a vital fact .", "When [ the applicants ] were producing the programme , they knew that an application had been made to ORG for the case against X to be reopened and that , as part of ORG proceedings in dealing with the said application , the taxi driver had been interviewed by the police on DATE at the request of ORG \u2019s defence as part of the proceedings to reopen the case . In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case , [ the applicants ] could not count on the chief superintendent and the QUANTITY police officers who had interviewed the taxi driver in DATE being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in ORG . Making the allegations can not accordingly be justified by lack of police participation in the programme .", "[ The applicants\u2019 ] intention , in the programme , of undertaking a critical assessment of the police investigation was legitimate in relation to the role of the media as public watchdog , but this does not apply to every allegation . [ The applicants ] had no basis for making such a serious allegation against a named police officer , and [ the applicants\u2019 ] opportunities for achieving the aims of the programme in no way required the questions upon which the charges are based to be included .", "On this basis , and even though the exemptions provided in LAW must be narrowly interpreted and LAW protects not only the content of utterances but also the manner in which they are made , we agree that the allegation made was not caught by the exemption in LAW . Indeed , as a result of the seriousness of the allegation , we agree that there is no basis for the punishment to be remitted in accordance with LAW . We agree further that there are no grounds for a remittal of penalty under LAW .", "We also concur with the findings on defamation .", "We agree with ORG that the fact that the allegation was made in a programme on the national television station ORG and hence could be expected to get widespread publicity \u2013 as indeed it did \u2013 must be regarded as an aggravating factor for the purposes of LAW . Considering that it is DATE since the programme was shown , we do not find , however , that there are sufficient grounds for increasing the sentence .", "For the reasons given by ORG , we find that [ the applicants ] must pay damages to the heirs of the chief superintendent . In this connection , it should be noted that it can not be regarded as crucial that the nature of the claim for damages was not stated in the writ of CARDINAL DATE , since the chief superintendent \u2019s claim for financial compensation could not relate to anything other than damages . Due to the seriousness of the allegation and the manner of its presentation , we find that the compensation should be increased to DKK CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
