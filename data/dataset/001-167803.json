The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were employees of ORG ( \u201c the Embassy \u201d ) in GPE . The first applicant worked as a protocol specialist / translator , and the second and third applicants as security guards . All the applicants were local staff .", "CARDINAL . NORP The employment contract between the locally employed staff and the Embassy provided , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Services to be Performed . The employee agrees to perform all the duties set forth in FAC in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . Disputes . All disputes between the employee and the Government arising out of this agreement shall be decided by ORG or , in the absence thereof , the designee of ORG , provided that the employee shall have the right to appeal in writing within DATE of receipt of notice of any such decision to the Chief of Mission [ at ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s main duties and responsibilities were related to assisting in organising official receptions , lunches and dinners ; questions relevant to protocol and local practices and customs ; maintaining a contact database ; drafting correspondence in LANGUAGE and PERSON ; interpreting and translating documents , articles and incoming correspondence ; arranging official calls ; ensuring press coverage of ceremonial events ; organising official visits and serving as a contact person between the front desk and the host country officials .", "CARDINAL . The second and third applicants\u2019 main duties and responsibilities were continuous surveillance of an area around their fixed posts for security hazards ; checking ID cards , screening visitors and vehicles , and controlling parking ; recognising emergencies and unusual incidents , and acting accordingly . They could occasionally be required to work at other locations and for special functions such as VIP visits , receptions and dinners at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE the applicants were informed by the ORG that they were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE , apparently upon the third applicant \u2019s claim to that effect , quashed the decision on his dismissal and ordered his reinstatement . It would appear that on an unspecified date thereafter this decision became final .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants instituted separate civil proceedings against ORG . All the applicants claimed compensation : the first applicant sought compensation for non - pecuniary damage caused by the wrongful dismissal , and the second and third applicants claimed compensation for loss of earnings . The first and second applicants , in addition , sought reinstatement .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG in GPE declared that it lacked competence to deal with the first applicant \u2019s claim and rejected it ( tu\u017eba [ se ] odbacuje ) , which decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG quashed these decisions . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and section CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE below ) , ORG considered that the LOC courts had jurisdiction to examine the merits of the first applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE ORG in GPE declared that it lacked competence to deal with the ORG claims ( in a re - trial in respect of the first applicant ) and rejected them . In substance , the court considered that the respondent ORG had immunity provided for by international law , and therefore could not be subjected to the jurisdiction of another ORG \u2019s court . In rejecting the first applicant \u2019s claim the court further held that granting immunity to the respondent ORG could not be considered a restriction on access to court , as provided in LAW . While the court acknowledged that in international and comparative law there were restrictions on ORG immunity in respect of employment - related disputes , it also held that recruitment ( pitanja u vezi sa zapo\u0161ljavanjem ) in a foreign diplomatic mission or an embassy was an issue which could be \u201c very sensitive or of a confidential nature \u201d and might relate to the diplomatic and organisational policy of a foreign ORG . In ruling upon the second and third applicants\u2019 claims , ORG relied also on LAW , which provided that the function of Embassies was to represent foreign GPE , and held that therefore the jurisdiction of the domestic courts was excluded . The court also relied on LAW , which provided for the inviolability of the premises of Embassies .", "CARDINAL . On various dates thereafter the applicants appealed . The first applicant submitted , inter alia , that by examining the merits of her claim the courts would not interfere with the other party \u2019s sovereignty . She also submitted that ORG had to examine the claim on the merits pursuant to the decision of ORG of DATE and relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decisions , in substance endorsing their reasoning . ORG further held , upon the first applicant \u2019s appeal , that a violation of sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) by the first - instance court did not render the first - instance decision unlawful , in particular as it was undisputed that the respondent party had its seat in another ORG and only a diplomatic representation in GPE . In ruling upon the second applicant \u2019s claim it held that the jurisdiction of the domestic courts was not explicitly provided for either by the law or an international agreement .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , ruling upon the applicants\u2019 appeals on points of law , ORG upheld the previous decisions on the grounds that the respondent party was a foreign ORG with its own legal personality and the domestic courts had no competence to rule upon the ORG claims . The court relied on LAW of LAW , section CARDINAL of ORG , and LAW . In ruling upon the third applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ORG also held , inter alia , that granting immunity to a foreign ORG in civil proceedings pursued a legitimate aim of complying with international law and encouraging good diplomatic relations between GPE , and that it could not be considered as a restriction on access to court in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicants lodged separate constitutional appeals . On DATE ORG dismissed the first and third applicants\u2019 constitutional appeals , while the second applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal would appear to be still pending . ORG held that there had been no violation of LAW as the decisions had been issued by tribunals established by law , which had acted within their competence , and which had given clear reasons for their decisions . There was therefore no arbitrariness in the ORG rulings . In ruling upon the third applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal ORG in addition held that pursuant to the case - law of the ORG and the Constitutional Court \u201c it [ was ] not the task of these courts to examine the conclusions of the regular courts in respect of the substantive law application , except in cases where [ ... ] procedural rights were violated ( [ such as ... ] , the right of access to court ) [ ... ] \u201d .
