{"ITEMID": "001-5720", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "P.R. v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a Cape Verdean and NORP national , born in DATE and living in the GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Ms Y.M. Schrevelius , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant moved from the LOC to the GPE where she married a NORP man . On the basis of the marriage she obtained a residence permit .", "", "At the time the applicant came to the GPE she had CARDINAL minor children , PERSON and GPE , who stayed behind in LOC in the care of their grandmother .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband passed away . The applicant \u2019s residence permit was subsequently withdrawn . She remained in the GPE , however , and in DATE she obtained NORP citizenship .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request to the head of police ( korpschef ) of the PERSON region for a provisional entry visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) for her CARDINAL children . The request was forwarded for consideration on the merits to ORG ( ORG ) of ORG . At the time of the request the children were CARDINAL , DATE of age respectively .", "On DATE ORG , on behalf of ORG , rejected the applicant \u2019s request . ORG concluded that the family ties had been broken since , after the applicant had left , the children had been living with the grandmother and were being brought up by her . There was no indication that this situation could not be maintained . Moreover , the applicant had not shown that she had been involved with the upbringing and care of the children . The fact that the applicant had regularly transferred money to LOC was insufficient to assume that family ties had continued to exist .", "The decision further stated , in accordance with national aliens policy , that , apart from international obligations , aliens could only be allowed for residence in the GPE if this served \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d ( wezenlijk Nederlands belang ) or in case of cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature ( klemmende PERSON aard ) . Neither of these conditions was met in the case of the applicant \u2019s children .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) through her counsel to the head of ORG with respect to her CARDINAL youngest children , PERSON and DATE .. On DATE she filed additional grounds for her request which emphasised the applicant \u2019s special and emotional ties with her children . The explanation given for the time elapsed between the applicant \u2019s departure from the LOC and the request for entry of her children ( DATE ) was that the applicant had waited for naturalisation before applying for family reunification . The applicant submitted that she had been back to the LOC twice , in DATE , to visit her children , that she made DATE phone calls to her children , that she received child benefits in the GPE and had made CARDINAL money transfers for her children DATE and DATE . She moreover held that her mother , who was DATE and suffering from a nervous disease - for which the applicant submitted a medical certificate - was unable to provide further care for the children .", "On DATE an inquiry commission ( hoorcommissie ) of ORG of ORG ( ORG en GPE van het ministerie PERSON ) held a hearing with the applicant with a view to her objection .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection concluding that , other than mere kinship , no special relationship could be distinguished between the applicant and the children . Furthermore , as regards the care of the children in LOC , the applicant had not sufficiently shown why her mother , in spite of her disease , would not be able to continue taking care of the children . Moreover , the Minister established that a brother and sister of the applicant \u2019s children who were of age were living with the applicant \u2019s minor children at the same address and they could contribute to their care .", "The applicant lodged an appeal on behalf of her children with ORG of the Hague ORG sitting in GPE ( Arrondissementsrechtbank te \u2018 s - Gravenhage zittinghoudende in GPE , PERSON ) . She invoked , among others , LAW in support of her claim .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as unsubstantiated . It held that the children in fact did no longer belong to the applicant \u2019s family . It dismissed the argument of the applicant \u2019s uncertain status in the GPE before her naturalisation , with a reference to the fact that she had not tried to get her children to come to the GPE when her NORP husband was still alive . ORG further held that the financial contributions made by the applicant could not be considered as a real contribution to the care and upbringing of the children . It stated that no evidence had been produced as to the mentioned phone calls from the applicant to the children and also that the applicant had only visited the children twice after her departure . ORG assessed that the applicant had brought the family \u2019s living as a unit to an end when she decided to leave LOC and come to the GPE . ORG concluded that no other special relation had further been established between the applicant and her children and that therefore the family ties between applicant and her children should be considered to have ceased to exist . It found no grounds therefore to grant admission for family reunification .", "ORG dismissed the claim for admission of the children on humanitarian grounds since it had not been shown that care for the children could not be continued in LOC .", "When assessing whether the ORG \u2019s actions had been in compliance with the requirements of LAW firstly acknowledged that there was \u201c family life \u201d in terms of that provision . It reasoned , with reference to the G\u00fcl v. GPE judgement of DATE and the PERSON v. the GPE judgement of DATE , that its task was to strike a balance between the interests of the applicant and those of the society as a whole ( the latter interest being the necessity of a restrictive immigration policy ) . ORG finally concluded in the light of the ORG \u2019s jurisprudence that the applicant \u2019s choice of family life had been one of not being with her children and that if the applicant wished to re - establish direct family life with her children , this would also be possible in LOC .", "The Regional Court decision was final and not subject to appeal .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) provides that the Minister of Justice ( Minister PERSON ) decides on requests lodged by aliens for admission to and residence in the GPE . The Minister may refuse access and residence on general interest grounds ( gronden aan het algemeen belang ontleend ) .", "In view of the situation in the GPE as regards population size and employment , Government immigration policy - defined in LOC ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) of DATE - is aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if : ( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so ; ( b ) this serves \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; ( c ) there are \u201c cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d ( LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of FAC ) .", "", "The policy for admission for family reunification purposes is laid down in LAW PERSON of the Aliens Circular . This provides , insofar as relevant , that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted to a parent of NORP nationality with minor children , when the children factually belong to his / her family and family ties with one of the parents already existed abroad . Family ties are considered to have definitely ceased to exist in case of long - term integration of the child into another family while the parent(s ) no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the costs of upbringing and care of the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
