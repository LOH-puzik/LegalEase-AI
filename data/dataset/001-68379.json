The applicant 's son and his cousins ran on foot through neighbouring villages , and in the evening reached PERSON . They later fled to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are not certain about the exact timing of the attack , as they were in a state of shock . They accepted the timing of the attack given by the Government .

The applicants submitted that they saw only civilians in the convoy , and that they did not see anyone from the convoy attempting to attack the planes .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on CARDINAL DATE the representative of ORG decided to evacuate the office to ORG . As he did not co - ordinate the move with the military authorities , when he and a convoy of vehicles reached the check - point \u201c Kavkaz-CARDINAL \u201d on the administrative border with ORG , they had to turn back as the check - point was closed .", "CARDINAL . ORG could have used the opportunity to inform the security and military authorities in advance about their travel , which would have made it possible for them to ensure a safe evacuation route . The checkpoint was closed because it could not supervise the passage of a \u201c fair quantity of refugees \u201d . On the way back to PERSON the convoy was joined by a ORG truck carrying rebel NORP fighters .", "CARDINAL . At that time the military authorities were planning and conducting counter - terrorist operations in ORG , aimed at preventing supplies and personnel of the rebel fighters being brought to PERSON by heavy transport , as well as identification and suppression of any other persons , supporting networks or command centres offering armed resistance to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . As part of that mission , on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL military SU-CARDINAL aeroplanes , flown by military pilots identified for security reasons as \u201c PERSON and \u201c PERSON , were on a mission to conduct reconnaissance and to suppress such movements . At TIME , when flying over the village of ORG , they saw vehicles moving towards PERSON . The planes were attacked from a ORG truck with large - calibre infantry fire - arms . The pilots reported the attack to an air - traffic controller identified as \u201c NORP \u201d at the command headquarters , and were granted permission to use combat weapons . At QUANTITY the planes fired CARDINAL rockets each from a height of QUANTITY at the ORG , which they estimated carried CARDINAL fighters , and destroyed it . They then located a second ORG truck on the same road on an intersection with a road to the village of LOC , from which they were also attacked . The pilots retorted by launching CARDINAL missiles each at the target . They then returned to their deployment aerodrome . In their submissions on the admissibility of the applications , the Government indicated the timing of the attack as CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL p.m. and CARDINAL \u2013 MONEY p.m.", "CARDINAL . The Government conceded that apart from the CARDINAL ORG trucks targeted , other vehicles were destroyed or damaged .

Among the killed were QUANTITY employees of the local ORG and the first applicant 's CARDINAL relatives . Among the wounded were the first and the second applicant . The Government did not submit any information about the number or names of wounded or killed fighters in the ORG trucks .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the ORG submitted that the pilots had not foreseen and could not have foreseen the harm to the civilian vehicles , which appeared on the road only after the rockets had been fired . In the ORG 's view , the fighters were deliberately using the convoy , which had been moving without authorisation , as a human shield . The radius of damage of the rockets is QUANTITY , which explained the casualties .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the incident , ORG ( ICRC ) in GPE issued a press release on DATE . It stated that , according to the local branch of ORG , on DATE a convoy of vehicles , among them CARDINAL vehicles of ORG , had tried to cross the border into ORG but had been turned back at the check - point and were returning to ORG . All CARDINAL cars were clearly marked with ORG sign , and the truck displayed a red cross on its roof .

A SU-CARDINAL plane flying over the convoy was shot at with automatic weapons and called a second plane for support . The planes hit the convoy with missiles at an interval of TIME , as a result of which QUANTITY trucks full of fighters were destroyed . The press service denied that civilians could have been hit by the air strikes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , GPE , stated that on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL TV journalists , CARDINAL working for a GPE - based company , and the other for a local station in ORG , were killed during a military attack on a convoy of refugees fleeing PERSON near the village of ORG . According to the statement , the CARDINAL journalists were covering the movement of a convoy , and when the first rocket hit a bus with refugees , they went out to film the scene . As another rocket hit a nearby vehicle , both were fatally injured .", "CARDINAL . The attack on the convoy was reported in the NORP and international media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the first applicant 's request , ORG of Ingushetia certified the deaths of PERSON , born on CARDINAL DATE , and PERSON , born on DATE , \u201c due to shell - wounds received as a result of bombing of a convoy of refugees from PERSON by fighter planes of the NORP military air force on the \u201c NORP \u201d road between the villages of ORG and ORG on DATE , TIME \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG introduced a request for supervisory review to the ORG of ORG , by which he sought to quash the decision of DATE . On DATE the request was granted , and the decision was quashed . The case was remitted to ORG . The Government submitted that the first applicant failed to appear at FAC for a new consideration and that her place of residence was unknown . On DATE ORG adjourned the case due to the first applicant 's failure to appear on summonses .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL , concerning the aerial bombardment of a refugee convoy near the village of LOC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The investigation confirmed the fact of the bombardment , the deaths of the first applicant 's relatives and the wounding of the second applicant . It also identified several witnesses and relatives of other victims of the bombardments , who were questioned . Some of them were granted victim status and recognised as civil plaintiffs . The investigation identified a number of individuals who had died as a result of the strikes and who were wounded . It also identified CARDINAL pilots who had fired at the convoy and the control tower operator who had given permission to use combat weapons . The pilots , who were questioned as witnesses , stated that their targets had been CARDINAL solitary ORG trucks with armed men , who fired at the planes . In response , the pilots used CARDINAL S-CARDINAL air - to - ground missiles against the first truck and CARDINAL such missiles against the second truck . No one was charged with having committed a crime ( see Part B below for a description of the documents in the investigation file ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal investigation was closed due to lack of corpus delicti in the acts of the pilots . This decision was appealed to the military court by a victim of the attack , PERSON . Following her complaint of DATE , ORG quashed the investigator 's decision on DATE and remitted the case for a new investigation to the military prosecutor of the LOC military circuit ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing of DATE the Government submitted a document of CARDINAL DATE issued by a military prosecutor of the LOC military circuit . By this decision the criminal investigation was again closed due to the absence of corpus delicti in the acts of the pilots ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated in their submissions that they were not aware of any adequate steps taken by the authorities to conduct an efficient and meaningful investigation and to ensure their participation in it . The first applicant submitted that some time after her complaint to the ORG had been communicated to ORG , her elder brother , PERSON , was twice visited at his house in GPE by the military prosecutors , who were looking for her . After the second visit the prosecutors left a note for the first applicant , instructing her to appear at the FAC military base for questioning . The first applicant failed to do so . She submitted that GPE was the main military base of the federal forces in GPE , was not freely accessible to civilians and was heavily guarded and surrounded by numerous check - points . It would be very difficult and unsafe for her to attempt to get there on her own , and she believed that the prosecutors could have found her either in GPE , where she was staying , or in GPE , where she travelled . The first applicant was also aware that prosecutors from the NORP town of ORG were once looking for her in Ingushetia , while she was in PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

The parties submitted numerous documents concerning the investigation into the killings . The main documents of relevance are as follows :", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a copy of the investigation file in the criminal case , divided into CARDINAL volumes . No list of documents was provided , but it is apparent from the numbering of the pages that there were initially CARDINAL volumes and that a certain part of the file is missing . According to the documents submitted , the investigation made some attempts to locate the first applicant and , to a lesser extent , the second applicant . Although some of their relatives were questioned and granted victim status ( it is not clear whether they were informed of this ) , the investigators did not contact the first and the second applicant directly . It does not appear that the third applicant was ever sought . The documents contained in the case - file present a coherent and detailed account of the attack of which the applicants complain .", "CARDINAL . The most important documents contained in the file are as follows :", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG ( ICRC ) addressed ORG in GPE in relation to the attack on the convoy on DATE . On DATE the ICRC urgently informed ORG that , due to a rapid deterioration of the security situation in PERSON , the local personal of the ICRC and of ORG were being evacuated from ORG by a convoy of QUANTITY trucks and CARDINAL passenger vehicles . The letter stated that the vehicles would not be marked by any emblem .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE the ICRC again urgently informed ORG that the ORG personnel were unable to cross the border with ORG . The road between PERSON and PERSON was under fire and one of the ORG trucks had been damaged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a request from ORG Office of DATE , Mr PERSON , chairman of ORG and ORG , submitted his account of the attack . He submitted the following :", "\u201c I have been the Chairman of ORG of ORG since DATE . We worked together with the ICRC , taking care of CARDINAL elderly and disabled persons in GPE ... From DATE we had to close the food centres since electricity and gas had been cut off , but we continued to bake bread using diesel fuel and to distribute it to CARDINAL elderly persons ... Starting from DATE PERSON came under heavy air bombardment , and on CARDINAL DATE we stopped all programmes , because it was impossible not just to work , but to stay there . We started to prepare to evacuate , and I informed ORG in Nalchik [ Kabardino - Balkaria ] of this fact .", "Because all public media were declaring that an exit route to ORG would be opened for refugees on DATE , we decided to evacuate on DATE , together with the ORG staff . In order to evacuate we needed special permission , and on CARDINAL DATE we brought all our transport to the [ rebel ] commandatura , which issued a permit to travel . I went ahead of the convoy to check the road , and saw several craters from explosions on the road , so I personally ensured that we had flags with red crosses on the roofs of our QUANTITY trucks .", "Our cars travelled in a convoy , and at TIME we were in a line of cars on the Rostov- Baku highway . The line extended for QUANTITY from the check - point [ at the border with Ingushetia ] . TIME at the check - point , where CARDINAL people were waiting and no one was let through , a general appeared ... and said that no one would be allowed to cross , because the check point was not prepared . He said that it would open DATE , that everyone should go back , and that he guaranteed that the road would not be attacked . Until TIME we could not turn around , because of a line of cars QUANTITY long behind us . At TIME we started to move towards PERSON . I was heading the convoy in a GPE car , the others were behind me . Other refugees followed our convoy , having seen our red cross symbols ; they were also flying white flags .", "QUANTITY before ORG I saw CARDINAL military planes launching rockets . As cars were also approaching from opposite direction , I thought that they had been shooting at something by the side of the road . In order to verify , I accelerated and went ahead of the convoy . When I reached the bridge , I saw the road turning to the left and the planes bombing the road . When I reached the spot , QUANTITY trucks were lying on the left side of the road , both on their sides , on the right side a GPE car was burning after a direct hit and nearby a woman covered in blood was trying to take out of the car a man 's beheaded body . I stopped to help , but at that moment passengers in my car whom I had picked up on the road to PERSON started to scream and pointed to the skies . I saw CARDINAL military planes coming towards us . I got back into the car and drove forward . After QUANTITY the car jolted and the back windscreen was broken . The car slowed down because CARDINAL of the back wheels had been punctured . After QUANTITY I reached ORG , where I let the passengers out , changed the tyre and returned to the convoy . When I approached the bridge I saw a horrible site . In front , on the bridge , was our ORG truck . Its cabin was almost entirely gone . Other cars were behind it . I ran to the truck and saw that the bodies of CARDINAL drivers , PERSON and PERSON , were torn apart . Then I started to look for the others . To the right under the road I found PERSON , who was wounded in the back . Then I found other colleagues who were assisting the wounded from a PAZ bus , which had taken a direct hit by a rocket ; CARDINAL people had been killed on the spot . We took the wounded and CARDINAL cars with broken windows which could drive and went to the village of ORG . I told the staff to unload the trucks and take away the dead after things had calmed down . In the meantime I drove the wounded to the village of ORG . At TIME I returned to my colleagues in ORG . They told me that the planes had returned and attacked the convoy twice more , and that they had descended to a very low height and shot at the cars with machine - guns .", "To sum up , on DATE CARDINAL p.m. on the bridge near the village of ORG , military planes attacked a civilian convoy containing refugees CARDINAL times ; consequently , CARDINAL of cars were destroyed , CARDINAL persons were killed and CARDINAL were wounded . I believe that many victims were hurt because numerous refugees followed our convoy , having noticed ORG sign .", "I and my colleagues categorically deny that the planes were allegedly shot at from the convoy . Starting from the cross - roads with the road to ORG , not only we did not see any cars with an anti - aircraft gun , but we did not see not a single armed person . While in GPE we ourselves suffered from the [ NORP ] fighters , who accused us on many occasions of working for the NORP , and our office and staff had been attacked , so we were very cautious . I can not state that the pilots deliberately aimed at the ORG convoy , but they could not have failed to see our trucks with the crosses on the ill - fated bridge , and afterwards they were striking at the civilian convoy for TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

There is no doubt that such assessment should include not only an assessment of the targets , but also of the possible harm to other vehicles and persons who were in the vicinity . Observing the said targets ( cars with ' fighters ' ) , they could not have failed to notice other vehicles with people nearby , and they should have proportionated the weapons according to their characteristics , precision , damage radius etc .

PERSON in his statement allegedly submitted that while on mission on DATE they noted a ORG truck on the eastern edge of the ORG forest , near the village of ORG . Some persons jumped out and ran towards the forest . At the same time the plane was shot at from the truck , probably with a large - calibre machine - gun . The pilot realised that the plane had been hit . He reported this to the leading pilot , who requested permission to use fire - power from the control centre . When the permission had been granted , they both fired at the truck CARDINAL rockets each , twice , from the height of QUANTITY . At that time they did not notice any other vehicles on the road in the vicinity of the truck . There were some vehicles further on the road , towards PERSON , but at a considerable distance . TIME after the missiles were fired the pilot noted another truck coming out of the Samashki forest and heading towards PERSON . The truck entered the impact zone . The pilot did not have time to verify what had happened to it or if there had been other vehicles on the road because of the danger of being shot at .", "CARDINAL . Pilot P. is further quoted as saying that they were informed that the road had been closed at the administrative border with ORG . They therefore presumed that the trucks were coming out of the LOC forest , where a considerable group of fighters ( \u201c boyeviki \u201d ) had gathered . They did not see any transport moving out of PERSON at that time .

The document concluded that harm to the civilians was caused by the actions of the pilots PERSON and PERSON , who had acted in permissible self - defence and had tried to prevent damage to the legitimate interests of the society and state from members of illegal armed groups . Furthermore , the pilots did not intend to cause harm to the civilians because they did not see them until the missiles had been launched . The criminal investigation was closed for absence of corpus delicti in the pilots ' actions .
