At the time of the events in question , both applicants were serving in the army and were tried by district courts - martial convened pursuant to LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON pleaded guilty to the armed forces\u2019 disciplinary offence of absence without leave ( contrary to section CARDINAL(a ) of the Army Act DATE ) . Although ORG upheld his petition against the custodial part of his sentence , the charge for which he was convicted carried a potential sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON pleaded guilty to CARDINAL charges of possession of controlled drugs contrary to ORG DATE , these being civilian criminal offences . ORG reduced the custodial element of his sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the Army Act DATE are set out in the judgment of ORG in the PERSON case ( PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Central to the system under LAW was the role of the \u201c convening officer \u201d . This officer ( who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving ) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court - martial . He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court - martial required , and was responsible for convening the court - martial .", "CARDINAL . The convening officer would draw up a convening order , which would specify , inter alia , the date , place and time of the trial , the name of the president and the details of the other members , all of whom he could appoint . Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General \u2019s Office , the convening officer could appoint CARDINAL . He also appointed , or directed a commanding officer to appoint , the prosecuting officer .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the hearing , the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate , and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible . He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution . When charges were withdrawn , the convening officer \u2019s consent was normally obtained , although it was not necessary in all cases , and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it . He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence , legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses , and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201c reasonably requested \u201d by the defence .", "CARDINAL . The convening officer could dissolve the court - martial either before or during the trial , when required in the interests of the administration of justice . In addition , he could comment on the proceedings of a court - martial . Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court , although in an exceptional case , where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline , they could be made known in the orders of the command .", "CARDINAL . The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also . A court - martial \u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer , who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute , postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicants\u2019 trials , the law has been amended by LAW ( see the above - mentioned GPE v. the GPE judgment , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A person convicted of absence without leave shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE ( section CARDINAL(a ) of the DATE Act ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
