Although her asylum claim was refused , she was granted exceptional leave to remain and then , in DATE , indefinite leave to remain . After she obtained indefinite leave to remain , she applied to have her son PERSON , a ORG national born in DATE , join her in GPE . Her son arrived in DATE , with conditional leave to remain in GPE , the condition being that he must not have recourse to public funds . He is considered as being \u201c subject to immigration control \u201d within the meaning of ORG , as is the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time of her son \u2019s arrival in GPE , the applicant was renting a room in a private home . However , her landlord was unwilling to accommodate her son as well , and informed the applicant shortly after her son \u2019s arrival that they would have to move out by DATE . The applicant applied to ORG for assistance on DATE , on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless . An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and would thus be provided with suitable housing , usually within the locality . Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing . As there is a significant shortage of social housing in GPE , those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available . In the case of the applicant , however , as her son was subject to immigration control , he was disregarded by the ORG in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need , in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of LAW . On DATE the ORG decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested a review of this decision , which was carried out by a senior officer , who reiterated that persons subject to immigration control are not eligible for housing assistance and that persons who are not eligible for housing assistance shall be disregarded when determining whether another person has a priority need for accommodation . As the applicant \u2019s son was not eligible , the applicant did not have a priority need . Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason ; however , it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person . There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability . On CARDINAL DATE the original decision was upheld .", "CARDINAL . The ORG assisted the applicant to find a private - sector tenancy in DATE , which she accepted . The applicant and her son were not therefore at any point actually homeless . However , the private tenancy was more expensive than a social tenancy would have been , and was outside GPE and therefore far from the applicant \u2019s previous employment and her son \u2019s school . The applicant claimed that she had to give up her job after DATE of commuting as she was unable to cope with the travel required , and that her son spent TIME per day travelling to and from school .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who had remained on the waiting list for social housing in GPE , obtained an offer of a social tenancy of a CARDINAL - bedroom flat in DATE . She and her son therefore moved back to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in this case , which involved a woman who was a NORP citizen and her daughter who was subject to immigration control . The local authority had refused to treat mother and daughter as being in priority need of homelessness assistance when they became unintentionally homeless , due to the daughter \u2019s immigration status . ORG held that Part VII of LAW and specifically sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL were designed to protect the family lives of the homeless by ensuring that families who became unintentionally homeless were accommodated together . It therefore fell within the ambit of LAW . A majority of ORG found that the basis of distinction between PERSON , on the one hand , and the parent of a child who was not subject to immigration control , on the other , was either the national origin of the child , or a combination of statuses including nationality , immigration status , settled residence and social welfare . It was not considered necessary to decide finally whether there was CARDINAL sole factor on which the distinction was based ; the important point was that nationality was among the factors . As such , very weighty or solid justification was required if the distinction was to be found to be compatible with the Convention . ORG found that , regardless of the precise basis of the differential treatment , the justification offered by the Government \u2013 the need to preserve immigration control and to prevent \u201c benefits tourism \u201d \u2013 was not sufficiently weighty , nor was it a proportionate and reasonable response to the perceived problem . The discouraging of \u201c benefits tourism \u201d or the \u201c over - staying \u201d of dependent relatives was an intelligible policy goal , but was not served by legislative measures which discouraged NORP citizens or those with a right of abode from coming to or remaining in GPE , because they could not accommodate their dependent relatives who were also lawfully permitted to be in GPE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was found not to be a proportionate or even logical response to the perceived problem . ORG observed that it was not apparent that the ORG or ORG had considered the potentially discriminatory impact of the legislation ; however , even if such impact had been considered , it could not be considered to fall within even the very wide margin of appreciation that the ORG enjoyed with regard to such matters .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore made a declaration of incompatibility in the following terms :", "\u201c That [ section ] CARDINAL ) of LAW is incompatible with [ LAW to the extent that it requires a dependent child of a NORP citizen , if both are habitually resident in GPE , to be disregarded when determining when a NORP citizen has a priority need for accommodation when that child is subject to immigration control . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case of PERSON was considered by ORG alongside that of PERSON , who had indefinite leave to remain in GPE but was considered by the court to have \u201c equivalent status \u201d to NORP citizenship ( see paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . He too was excluded by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) from establishing a priority need for housing assistance because his child was subject to immigration control . Unlike PERSON , however , at the time of ORG judgment , he had an ongoing need for assistance , being still prospectively homeless . This situation would not be alleviated by the declaration of incompatibility , since the impugned provision would remain in force until changed by ORG . PERSON case was therefore remitted by ORG to the relevant local authority for reconsideration , with specific regard to whether he could be provided with accommodation under powers conferred upon the authority by other legislation .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the declaration of incompatibility in ORG v. PERSON , the ORG amended LAW by means of Schedule DATE , as noted above . The changes addressed the incompatibility in so far as NORP citizens are concerned but meant that a person such as Mr PERSON or indeed the applicant in this case , with indefinite leave to remain , would still not be considered to be in priority need of housing assistance if his or her eligibility was dependent on another person who was from abroad and subject to immigration control , such as the applicant \u2019s son . Moreover , in the case of a NORP citizen like PERSON or ORG ( ORG ) or NORP national , where the priority need resulted from a dependent child who was subject to immigration control , the local authority \u2019s duty to provide accommodation would be satisfied by the local authority procuring an offer of a tenancy from a private landlord , whether or not the applicant chose to accept such an offer . In cases where there was a dependent child who was not subject to immigration control , by contrast , the local authority \u2019s duty would not be discharged by procuring such an offer if the applicant chose not to accept it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
