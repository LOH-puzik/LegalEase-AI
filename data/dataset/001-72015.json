According to the preparatory notes , incorporation of the LAW was not intended to change the existing balance between the NORP parliament and the NORP courts . Thus , in the view of ORG , while taking into account the rights and obligations that may be inferred from LAW , ORG still has considerable discretion when laying down NORP law .

Traditionally , the NORP legislature plays a minor role as regards the conditions governing wages , salaries and employment . Therefore , only to a certain extent does the NORP labour market have legislation which does not emanate from ORG directives , examples being the Salaried Employees ' Act ( GPE ) and LAW ( Ferieloven ) . Accordingly , rights imposed by statute in other countries have in GPE been obtained by means of agreements between the labour - market partners . It is thus a characteristic feature of NORP law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements ( collective and individual ) , labour - law principles , general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes . PERCENT of all employees in GPE are trade union members .", "From figures provided by ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG ( Besk\u00e6ftigelsesministeriet ) , in DATE the NORP workforce consisted of CARDINAL persons ( inclusive of the unemployed ) . Of these , CARDINAL were employed within the private sector and CARDINAL within the public sector .", "The Government estimate that PERCENT of all employees are covered by collective agreements . It appears that the applicants disagree with this estimation .", "The institution of closed - shop agreements is a long - standing practice in GPE . Typically , a closed - shop agreement states that an employer has undertaken to hire and employ only members of the trade union that is party to the collective agreement concluded by the employer . Closed - shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market as they would be in conflict with the principle of equality under NORP administrative law . Also , they are not concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and PERSON , because ORG considers the use of closed - shop provisions to be an interference with employers ' managerial rights . Thus , closed - shop agreements are mainly of importance in collective agreements concluded with employers not affiliated to an employers ' organisation .", "The precise number of employees covered by closed - shop agreements is unknown . However , from figures provided by ORG and ORG , the Government estimate that CARDINAL wage earners are affected in some way by closed - shop agreements \u2013 that is , PERCENT of all NORP employees on the labour market . The applicants submit that this estimation is probably somewhat below the actual figure .", "Closed - shop clauses are primarily found in certain sectors such as building and construction and horticulture .", "CARDINAL . After the general election in GPE on DATE , the new government decided to set up a committee to look into closed - shop agreements . The mandate of the committee was to examine the scope of such clauses and other circumstances which required membership of specific associations as a precondition for access to certain professions , and also to assess the compliance of such clauses with GPE 's international commitments . The committee was also asked to draw up recommendations and proposals for initiatives which afforded greater protection of the negative right to freedom of association . The committee submitted a report in DATE ( PERSON . DATE , GPE om eksklusivbestemmelser ) which proposed changes to the law concerning closed - shop agreements between employees ' organisations and employers . The committee pointed out that general developments in society and the labour market could no longer justify , to the same extent as before , the need for closed - shop agreements , since strong and representative trade unions and organisations had now been established on the labour market . The committee further stated that the advantages relating to membership of a trade union should in themselves be strong enough reasons to be a member of a trade union . The committee considered that as closed - shop agreements only existed for a small part of the labour market , a change in the law would have only a marginal impact upon union density rates . The committee further stated that closed - shop agreements could have the effect of reducing the supply of labour , that freedom of contract on the labour market was not an immutable concept , and that restrictions existed in several fields as to the agreements that management and labour could lawfully conclude .", "CARDINAL . Beforehand , the committee had consulted numerous institutions , organisations and associations , among those ORG , which classified closedshop agreements into the following categories :", "I. Agreements concluded by an employers ' association which is a ( direct or indirect ) member of DA .", "II . Agreements concluded by an employers ' association which is not affiliated to ORG .", "III . Agreements concluded directly between an employer and a trade union .", "The classification was explained in Report no . CARDINAL as follows :", "\u201c DATE ORG ) made a conservative estimate that CARDINAL employees were covered by closedshop provisions . This figure was calculated as follows :", "In businesses organised in member organisations of ORG , it was estimated that CARDINAL employees were covered by closedshop provisions . ( However , this figure has diminished since the original estimate was made , so the present estimate is that CARDINAL employees within the scope of DA are covered by closedshop provisions ) .", "In organised businesses outside the scope of ORG , CARDINAL employees were estimated to be covered by closedshop provisions .", "In non - organised businesses , it was estimated that CARDINAL employees were covered by closedshop provisions in agreements adhering to collectivebargaining agreements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The distinction between I and II is related to the fact that ORG , as stated above , has a policy of not entering into ( or allowing its member organisations to enter into ) closed - shop agreements . Therefore , within the scope of ORG , closed - shop provisions only apply when a member organisation of ORG entered into a closed - shop agreement prior to becoming a member of ORG . This was explained in the report as follows :", "\u201c In principle , closedshop provisions are not entered into by the part of the private labour market which is covered by the main agreement between ORG and ORG . Under ORG , the use of exclusivity clauses is not recognised , because such clauses are deemed to interfere with employers ' managerial rights . However , this does not mean that no business within the scope of ORG has any collectivebargaining agreement containing closedshop provisions . Thus , it is estimated by ORG that CARDINAL employees working in businesses organised in member organisations of DA are covered by closedshop provisions .", "When a member organisation enters into a collectivebargaining agreement , this must be subject to the approval of ORG . The same principle applies when members of the member organisations enter into collectivebargaining agreements themselves . If a member organisation or the members of a member organisation intend to enter into negotiations for collectivebargaining agreements which include closedshop provisions , this requires the prior consent of the board of ORG . DA does not approve of collectivebargaining agreements which contain exclusivity clauses .", "However , if , at the time of applying for admission to one of ORG 's member organisations , a business is party to a collectivebargaining agreement which includes closedshop provisions , this does not debar the business from membership of the organisation . In such cases the organisation will subsequently try to release the business from the exclusivity clause . The same applies if an organisation seeks admission to DA . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The committee 's consultation with ORG ( ORG ) was described as follows in Report no . CARDINAL :", "\u201c ORG stated that , in general , it would like to see exclusivity agreements abolished , and that such agreements are felt to be constrictive even though it acknowledges the value of having large organisations to negotiate with . ORG said that , while the industrial part of the organisation is more or less exempt from exclusivity agreements , these agreements are a large problem for the areas of agriculture , forestry , market gardening and horticulture . ORG said that the whole market garden area is covered by closedshop provisions , and argued for changes in all negotiations for collective - bargaining agreements . PERSON consistently states that there is no price at which the clauses could be eliminated from collectivebargaining agreements , so the question is not open to negotiation . In the market garden area the exclusivity agreements result in a decrease in the number of applicants for apprenticeships , recruitment problems and problems in hiring seasonal workers . In other areas within agriculture and forestry it is also the case that exclusivity agreements are not ' for sale ' .", "ORG said that it has CARDINAL collectivebargaining agreements which include exclusivity clauses ; however , the agreement covering golf courses only includes a preference clause . Despite the fact that the employers recognise the interest in having properly regulated labour relations , exclusivity agreements cause recruitment problems and have a side effect of leading to other forms of provision of services , for example , by sub - contractor arrangements and the like ...", "In reply to a question of the committee , it was stated that the number of employees covered by exclusivity agreements in ORG 's area is CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , a bill ( no . DATE - CARDINAL-LCARDINAL ) to amend LAW due to LAW was tabled in ORG by ORG . The bill was aimed at ensuring , among other things , that in the future no agreements could be lawfully concluded which imposed a duty on an employer to employ exclusively or , preferably , persons who were members of an association or a specific association .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory memorandum on the bill stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Closed - shop agreements are obsolete and out of step with the wishes of many employees . The government consider that there should be freedom for an employee to decide whether to become a member of an association \u2013 just as there should be freedom to choose not to become a member of an association \u2013 without this leading to a risk of not being recruited or of being dismissed . The government do not consider it reasonable that an employer may lay down requirements as to the candidate 's membership or non - membership of an association as a condition for obtaining or keeping a job . Furthermore , the government find it unreasonable that a clause in a collective agreement may prevent an employee who does not wish to be a member of an association or a specific association from obtaining or keeping employment with an employer or may prevent an employer from considering the candidate 's qualifications alone . ...", "The bill does not entail any economic or administrative consequences for public authorities ... the bill does not lead to any financial and administrative consequences of any major significance for enterprises . The proposal could even lead to an easing of procedures for the recruitment of labour as employers will no longer have to take candidates ' union affiliation into account after the commencement of the LAW ... the bill has no consequences for gender equality on the labour market ... the bill does not contain any Community law aspects ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , a bill is read CARDINAL times before it is adopted . At the first reading , the bill is discussed in general and thereafter , normally , the bill is referred to a committee , which examines the proposal and is free to put questions to the relevant minister . With regard to the bill in question , on DATE ORG ( ORG ) submitted various questions to the Minister for Employment . As regards CARDINAL questions ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL) the latter replied as follows :", "\u201c The Minister is requested to explain the impact of the proposed bill in relation to the scope for trade unions to enforce collectivebargaining agreements , especially in relation to non - organised employers . It appears from the DATE reports of ORG for DATE that during DATE in question , CARDINAL and CARDINAL cases respectively were conducted against non - organised employers , which correspond to PERCENT and PERCENT respectively of the cases in ORG instigated by employees in DATE . All these cases were instigated by PERSON ... It is the opinion of ORG that the removal of closed - shop provisions will to a large extent make the efficient enforcement of collectivebargaining agreements against such employers more difficult . \u201d", "\u201c I find it difficult to see how the annulment of closed - shop provisions in collectivebargaining agreements with non - organised employers , which is estimated to cover CARDINAL employees , should make it more difficult for the organisations to secure the efficient enforcement of collectivebargaining agreements . First and foremost the annulment of a closed - shop provision in a collectivebargaining agreement with a non - organised employer would not change the fact that the collectivebargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with . That means that the employees or their representatives would still have the possibility of bringing to the attention of the union in question any problems in getting the agreement complied with . The possibilities for the trade union to take action in such a case would therefore be unaffected . If there is a problem in having the terms in a collectivebargaining agreement complied with in a business , due to the fact that the trade union does not have any members in that business , that should be reason enough for the employees to join the trade union and get the trade union to complain of the lack of compliance .", "I do not believe that a trade union will get much help in enforcing a collectivebargaining agreement from employees whose membership is not voluntary .", "I do believe that if a trade union makes an effort and spreads the message to all the employees in a business covered by a collectivebargaining agreement that it is due to its efforts that there are orderly conditions in the business , some of those employees that are involuntary members DATE could become voluntary members , and all employees could then stand together to secure compliance with the collective - bargaining agreement . \u201d", "\u201c Under NORP collective - labour law , an employer must comply with the terms of a collective agreement in respect of all employees doing work within the field of the collective - bargaining agreement . Does the Minister believe that it is fair that nonorganised employees should , in this way , enjoy benefits to which they have not contributed , and which have been obtained for them by the trade unions ? \u201d", "\u201c The principle that a collectivebargaining agreement also applies in relation to the work performed by non - organised employees in a business covered by a collectivebargaining agreement , is a principle which also applies to areas without closedshop provisions . It is a principle which follows from collectivebargaining agreements themselves , and it is only the organisation which is a party to the collectivebargaining agreement which may raise a claim , not the individual ( non - organised ) employee .", "Furthermore , there is nothing to prevent a collectivebargaining agreement only covering the members of the organisation which is a party to the agreement . I must therefore note that it is the trade unions themselves that have elected to follow this principle both in fields with and without closed - shop provisions . Whether this is fair or not , I will leave to the trade unions in question and to their members to consider . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before ORG on DATE , ORG in Gardening ( that is to say , the employers ' association which has a closedshop agreement with ORG affecting the applicant PERSON ) and ORG made the following joint submission :", "\u201c Both ORG in GPE and NORP Landscape Gardeners are parties to collective agreements with ORG , pursuant to which the employers agree only to employ members of ORG .", "This provision was agreed DATE and it is not clear why this was done . Thus , it is not apparent whether it was a mutual deal or whether it was the result of a strong trade union imposing the provision on a group of small employers .", "Briefly , the provision entails a number of drawbacks for NORP gardening of which the following may be mentioned :", "\u25cf It is difficult to get an inflow of apprentices to the trade . We need around CARDINAL apprentices per year , but can only attract around CARDINAL . The closed - shop provision scares away young people . At the same time we have difficulty in securing qualified labour , since many capable employees do not want to work under an exclusivity agreement . Some of these may then try to circumvent the provision by establishing a relationship as a sub - contractor instead of as an actual employee .", "\u25cf The business of market gardening is characterised by seasonal work . DATE we need DATE casual workers , workers to pick vegetables , workers for DATE production and the like . Typically , we are speaking of young students who would like to work for DATE until the closedshop provision is mentioned .", "\u25cf NORP market gardens are in a very tough competitive situation in ORG . No other country in the ORG has closed - shop provisions similar to those for NORP gardeners . Therefore , there is unequal competition at ORG level .", "\u25cf ORG provisions may be an instrument for securing wages and employment terms in small , non - organised businesses . NORP market gardens are very large businesses ( CARDINAL employees per business ) and PERCENT are organised . The closed - shop provision has therefore been overtaken by the structural development of the business . In relation to businesses DATE , the trade union movement accepts that the closedshop provisions are unnecessary ; see the article in ORG 's periodical .", "\u25cf NORP market gardens are organised , from a business point of view , in the same way as NORP agriculture . The businesses in agriculture are not covered by closedshop provisions , and NORP market gardens should not be either .", "\u25cf The closedshop agreement with ORG causes DATE problems with employees who are members of other trade unions or who wish to join other unions . For example , it frustrates the desire of employees to be transferred to ORG , to an organisation of artisans or to another unemployment fund .", "\u25cf As a labour - intensive export and home market business we need to attract the most competent workforce to NORP market gardens to maintain and expand our markets . The maintenance of the closedshop provision will inhibit our development , and the most competent employees elect for other professions .", "\u25cf The collectivebargaining agreements between ORG in GPE and NORP ORG respectively and PERSON will continue to apply for our employees ( and be complied with ) , even if the closedshop provision is removed by law . The removal of the closed - shop provision would therefore not cause wage - dumping .", "\u25cf The introduction of closedshop provisions was not put in place as an equal deal , where both parties gained something . It does not appear anywhere that NORP market gardeners have received any compensation from PERSON for agreeing in the past to the closedshop provision . On the contrary , it is our opinion that the employers were forced to enter into the exclusivity agreement under strong pressure and the threat of industrial action .", "\u25cf In the last many negotiations for collectivebargaining agreements we have tried to persuade PERSON to drop the exclusivity agreements . In these negotiations it has not been possible to buy ourselves out of the exclusivity agreement . ORG has not even wanted to discuss the problem seriously .", "ORG agreements do not belong in a modern society . The individual citizen wants to make his own decisions about his relationship to the trade union movement , and must be expected to be able to do so rationally .", "ORG provisions arose at DATE in a period when industrial action was the order of DATE .", "Circumstances are now quite different , so closedshop provisions should be removed by law . This would not be State interference with the right of free negotiation on the labour market , but the necessary safeguarding of freedom of association .", "We therefore strongly recommend that the closedshop provisions be removed by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At DATE it became clear that the bill had failed to secure the necessary majority in ORG and it was withdrawn . It was tabled anew ( no . DATE - CARDINAL-LCARDINAL ) in DATE and dealt with by ORG in DATE ( before the general election on DATE ) , again with the result that the majority was not in favour of changing the law .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before the ORG , the parties have submitted further information about the extension of closed - shop agreements in the gardening and horticultural sector .", "The Government noted by way of introduction that no single source of statistical information was able to provide a complete picture and the various statistical sources were not immediately comparable . On the basis of the material available , however , the ORG estimated that the total number of employed in the gardening and horticultural sector amounted to CARDINAL persons . The relevant employers ' organisations in the private sector had reported that CARDINAL persons were covered by closed - shop agreements , whereas the relevant trade unions had reported that CARDINAL persons were covered . Thus , the Government estimated that PERCENT but PERCENT of persons were covered by closedshop agreements .", "The applicant PERSON submitted that the ORG 's calculation was misleading and irrelevant to an assessment of the possibility of him finding a job which was not covered by a closedshop agreement . He stressed that there were CARDINAL different kinds of gardeners : landscape gardeners ; greenhouse gardeners ; and production gardeners . It was crucial to distinguish among the CARDINAL kinds of gardening because job opportunities in the public sector almost exclusively related to landscape gardeners . Moreover , although the applicant PERSON possessed the qualifications to obtain a job at a nursery , this did not imply that he would be qualified to work in landscape gardening DATE be it in the public or private sector . A calculation should be made in respect of each of the CARDINAL kinds of gardening . The percentages for greenhouse gardening and production gardening would then be seen to be higher , probably PERCENT ( CARDINAL employees covered by closed - shop provisions out of CARDINAL in the CARDINAL kinds of gardening in the private sector ) . Consequently , the percentage would be lower in respect of landscape gardeners .
