An intracranial examination revealed a subdural haematoma in the left frontoparietal lobe , multiple areas of brain - tissue degeneration at the base of the left hemisphere , severe cerebral oedema and a swollen cerebellum .", "According to the forensic medical examiner , a blow sustained \u201c DATE \u201d could well have been the cause of death .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the applicant 's lawyer contacted the public prosecutor 's office at ORG , seeking to have Officer PERSON placed under arrest in order to prevent him from putting pressure on witnesses and disposing of incriminating evidence .", "On DATE the military prosecutor 's office indicated that it was not empowered to take the action requested , as offences committed by members of the armed forces against civilians came under the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor interviewed NCOs A.B. and GPE", "PERSON explained that their commanding officer had been annoyed to see customers in a shop open at TIME and had asked them to leave the LOC immediately . He stated that the victim and some young people had been in the shop , and added :", "\u201c It must nevertheless be admitted that when we went to the scene we were stressed because of the shooting ; under pressure , we could certainly have hit someone , even without really intending to ; however , if it had come to that , we would have gone for the young men as they are more dynamic and likely to commit offences . \u201d", "ORG stated that on DATE of the incident he had not gone into the shop and had consequently not seen what had happened there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor sent a summary report on his inquiry to ORG and asked for permission to place Officer PERSON under investigation under LAW .

On DATE the public prosecutor questioned Officer PERSON , who denied that he had beaten the applicant 's father , claiming that he was the victim of a plot hatched by members of terrorist organisations or other underground groups to hinder the gendarmerie 's work in fighting terrorism . According to Officer PERSON , PERSON had complained to the district governor that he had been verbally abused ; as a result , he had gone to the district governor 's office himself to meet PERSON and had apologised for having lost his temper . PERSON had accepted his apology without ever claiming that he had been beaten . Officer PERSON was dismayed that anyone might think that an officer of his rank who had served his homeland for DATE could have gratuitously set about an elderly man and gone so far as to beat him up .", "He further challenged the competence of the forensic medical examiner who had conducted the autopsy of the body in the absence of a pathologist .

The eyewitnesses GPE , ORG retracted their statements a further time and confirmed the truth of their initial accusations against Officer PERSON .", "GPE explained that he had been forced by Officer PERSON to retract his initial statement if he did not want to end up like PERSON .

After ORG had collapsed on the ground , Officer PERSON had carried on kicking him in the head .", "ORG maintained that the reason why he had given evidence in favour of Officer PERSON was that he too had been threatened by him . He explained that the officer had in fact kicked PERSON in the head and abdomen and had banged his head against the walls until he could no longer stand .", "ORG likewise retracted his second statement , explaining that he had made it out of fear that Officer PERSON might take it out on him during his military service .", "CARDINAL .

He added that during their meeting in the district governor 's office , Officer PERSON had also said that he had had too much to drink on TIME of the incident and that he was aware that he had acted wrongly .", "ORG stated that he had gone to the scene with his colleague after hearing shots being fired . He added that from outside the shop they had heard Officer PERSON reprimanding the victim but had not seen him beat him .", "ORG PERSON accused PERSON of having twice attempted to put pressure on him to give evidence against his commanding officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Officer PERSON produced to ORG a letter dated CARDINAL DATE containing death threats against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the gendarmerie general command informed the judges of the trial court that Officer PERSON had been relieved of his duties with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE \u00d6.Y. , who was performing military service at the time , informed ORG that Officer PERSON had compelled him to retract his original statement and subsequently , shortly before the trial , had offered him free air tickets to travel to the courthouse and testify in his favour . He stated that Officer PERSON had in fact grabbed PERSON by the neck and had repeatedly banged his head against the walls . He added that ORG had collapsed to the ground and had hit his head on the floor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Officer PERSON requested that ORG ( \u201c the Institute \u201d ) produce a further expert opinion in response to the autopsy report . He again alleged that he had been the victim of a plot , this time orchestrated by PERSON , the former mayor of \u00c7ermik , on account of the latter 's defeat in the elections .", "For his part , the district governor PERSON explained that on DATE after the incident Mr PERSON had indeed come to see him with a written complaint . He stated , however , that the complaint was much briefer than the document allegedly found in the victim 's pockets and contained no allegations of assault . The district governor stated that he had summoned the protagonists to his office as the deceased had feared that he might be accused of involvement in the unresolved incident of the shots fired on DATE . PERSON stated that during the meeting Officer PERSON had apologised for uttering insults and that PERSON had never claimed that he had been beaten . He added that after the meeting he had torn up the deceased 's complaint , believing that matters had been settled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer warned the ORG 's forensic experts that Officer PERSON might attempt to intimidate them into producing an opinion that was favourable to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to obtain additional medical evidence concerning the precise circumstances of the death and instructed the ORG to draw up a full report as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG refused applications for Officer PERSON to be detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE ORG heard evidence from a colleague of ORG , a neurologist , GPE , who gave his opinion on the basis of ORG medical records . He stated that the haematoma was located between the dura mater and the skull , and not in the actual brain . A subdural haematoma of that kind was more likely to result from cranial trauma . It was therefore improbable in his view that the haematoma had been caused by hypertension , especially as the patient 's blood pressure had been recorded as normal at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the neurological surgeon ORG gave evidence . He stated that he did not agree with the note attached to the back of the scan image that the haematoma was \u201c chronic \u201d , which meant that it had formed very gradually . He added that he did not know who could have attached the note but that he was convinced , having himself operated on ORG , that the haemorrhage was \u201c sub - acute \u201d and that it could thus have been caused by a second blow , occurring in DATE before the death . He further noted that the patient had been admitted to hospital in a coma , a symptom not associated with cases of chronic haemorrhages , and explained that while PERSON", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing , some CARDINAL inhabitants of the deceased 's native village stated that he had told them that he had been beaten by Officer PERSON and was suffering from pains in the head , stomach and feet but that , as a matter of pride , he had not wanted to see a doctor .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE ORG heard evidence from a radiologist , PERSON , who stated that according to standard medical practice , the results of the scan performed on PERSON should have been analysed by a radiologist ; at the relevant time , however , he had been the only radiologist employed at the general hospital and he could not imagine who else could have attached the note indicating the presence of a chronic haemorrhage .", "Counsel for the applicant accordingly demanded that the ORG clarify the contradictions between the various medical opinions .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG submitted its report . It found that it could not be concluded with any certainty that Mr PERSON had died as a result of an injury sustained on DATE , particularly as no scan images had revealed any traces of ecchymotic lesions to the bone . The report concluded that the haemorrhage observed during the autopsy could have developed after the operation .", "On DATE the applicant 's lawyer challenged that conclusion and asked for the case to be reviewed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its opinion on DATE , after studying the CARDINAL different medical opinions in the file . It concluded that the causes of death could not be determined with any certainty and that no causal link could be sufficiently established between the alleged acts of violence and the deceased 's clinical presentation .", "Having inspected the deceased 's medical records , ORG nevertheless noted certain shortcomings which made it impossible to determine the exact process by which the death had occurred . The autopsy report gave no indication of the colour , density , quantity and extent of the intracranial haematoma and there had been no histological examination of blood samples or of the area described as having been affected by diffuse degeneration of the brain tissue .", "At the hearing on DATE counsel for the applicant also challenged these conclusions , arguing that they had no scientific basis .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG endorsed the public prosecutor 's opinion that the charge of unintentional homicide should be dismissed as there was no clear causal link between the death and the alleged blows .", "However , ORG found Officer PERSON guilty of ill - treatment in the performance of official duties , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW . It sentenced him to the minimum penalty of DATE imprisonment and suspended him from duty for DATE .", "The court considered that what constituted ill - treatment on Officer PERSON 's part was that he had \u201c made remarks that were likely to offend the victim and engender feelings of distress and anxiety in him \u201d and not that he had beaten him . It found that , even assuming that Officer PERSON had hit the victim as well , such an act would at most have also fallen within the scope of LAW , which prohibited all forms of ill - treatment of others , including physical violence , in the performance of duties involving the preservation of order in a region affected by terrorism .", "CARDINAL . As to the length of the sentence , the judges pointed out that the accused deserved a favourable assessment on account of the socio - economic conditions in the region where he was serving and his various personal qualities . They thus decided to reduce his prison sentence to DATE and DATE in view of his \u201c good conduct \u201d . The sentence was subsequently commuted to a fine of CARDINAL old NORP liras , which at the relevant time was equivalent to MONEY or QUANTITY .", "Lastly , ORG decided to suspend the enforcement of the fine , being persuaded that Officer PERSON would not reoffend .", "CARDINAL . In his capacity as an intervening party , the applicant appealed to ORG , arguing in particular that insufficient consideration had been given to the evidence for the prosecution , that the accused had never been placed in pre - trial detention and that , in view of his status as a high - ranking officer , he had remained free to exert pressure on the witnesses and forensic experts .", "On DATE ORG upheld the impugned judgment .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Any law - enforcement officer ... who , in the course of duty ... and in circumstances other than those prescribed by law ... , ill - treats , injures or strikes or does bodily harm to another person shall be sentenced to DATE imprisonment and temporarily barred from public service . ... \u201d", "\u201c Where death results from an act of violence ... inflicted without the intention to kill the victim , ... a sentence of DATE imprisonment shall be imposed on the offender ...", "If the death occurs as a result of the offender 's act combined with circumstances which had existed prior to the act and had not been known by the offender or as a result of fortuitous circumstances that the offender could not anticipate , ... a sentence of a minimum of DATE imprisonment shall be imposed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
