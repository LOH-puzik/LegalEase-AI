RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON GPE , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . The first applicant is the father and legal representative of the second applicant . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON , Representative of GPE at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Both applicants live , together with the second applicant \u2019s mother and his elder brother PERSON ( born in DATE ) , in a flat in GPE which is not the subject of the present application ( \u201c the old flat \u201d ) . Under the terms of a private ownership certificate dated DATE , the second applicant is the sole legal owner of the old flat .", "In DATE the first applicant invested money in the construction of a block of flats in GPE . Once the work was completed , the first applicant registered title to a flat in that block ( \u201c the new flat \u201d ) in his own name and those of his CARDINAL sons , PERSON ( the second applicant ) and PERSON , in equal shares .", "In DATE the applicant decided to sell the new flat and applied for clearance of the transaction to the guardianship and wardship department of ORG in south - eastern GPE ( \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043e\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b \u00ab PERSON \u0433. GPE , \u201c the guardianship authority \u201d ) .", "On DATE a deputy head of ORG informed the applicant that clearance would not be given because the sale \u201c would result in a reduction of your underage son \u2019s property \u201d and it would therefore be \u201c not in the interests of the minor \u201d . The applicant appealed to a court .", "On DATE ORG of GPE gave judgment . It found that LAW of LAW did not apply because the new flat had not been ( formally ) donated to the second applicant , nor had it been inherited by him or acquired at his expense . The new flat had been purchased by the first applicant , who had invested his and his wife \u2019s savings . Having regard to the fact that the second applicant was also the legal owner of the flat where the applicants\u2019 family lived , the court found that the refusal by the guardianship authority had not been justified .", "On DATE ORG , on an appeal by the guardianship authority , quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG . It pointed out that an interest in the new flat had been duly registered in the second applicant \u2019s name and that ORG had failed to verify what compensation would be made available to the second applicant following the sale of his share .", "On DATE ORG of GPE delivered a new judgment and dismissed the complaint on the following grounds :", "\u201c [ The first applicant ] confirmed before the court that onethird of [ the new flat ] had been transferred to [ the second applicant ] voluntarily . Accordingly , the sale of the flat , including [ the second applicant \u2019s share ] , would result in a reduction of his property .", "The court can not take into account the [ first applicant \u2019s ] argument that the sale of [ the new flat ] would not impair the minor \u2019s rights because the minor is the legal owner of the [ old flat ] . The minor had acquired the right of ownership over the [ old flat ] in DATE , and in DATE he acquired the right of ownership to onethird of the [ new flat ] . As by that time he already had title to the [ old flat ] , the sale of onethird of the [ new flat ] would entail a reduction of the minor \u2019s property , which is not permitted under the applicable legislation . Pursuant to LAW and LAW , the underage child \u2019s property may be disposed of only in his interests .", "Pursuant to letter no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL sent by ORG ( on DATE ) , the sale of residential LOC must in all cases be accompanied by the purchase of residential LOC in the minor \u2019s name , if he is to lose his share of the property . [ The first applicant ] did not produce any evidence showing how [ the second applicant ] would be compensated for the loss of onethird of the [ new flat ] . \u201d", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . It endorsed the same line of reasoning : the transaction would result in a reduction in the minor \u2019s property and was therefore not in the minor \u2019s interests .", "Article CARDINAL provides that a child acquires title to , inter alia , the property donated to him , inherited by him or acquired at his expense . The child \u2019s rights to dispose of his property are governed by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The parents may dispose of the child \u2019s property in accordance with the rules set out in LAW .", "LAW provides that the child \u2019s parents have no title to the child \u2019s property .", "Article CARDINAL provides that , with certain exceptions concerning smallscale , routine transactions , transactions entered into by minors aged DATE are valid only if approved by their legal representatives , in other words their parents , adoptive parents or guardians .", "Article CARDINAL provides that transactions on behalf of a minor DATE must be carried out by his or her parents , adoptive parents or guardians . Transactions carried out by legal representatives of the minor in respect of the minor \u2019s property are governed by LAW and CARDINAL .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that a guardian may not alienate his charge \u2019s property or perform any transaction resulting in a reduction of the charge \u2019s property without obtaining preliminary clearance of the planned transaction from the guardianship and wardship authority . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL designates the local self - government bodies which are responsible for guardianship and wardship matters .", "On DATE ORG of ORG sent a letter ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) entitled \u201c On additional measures for the protection of ORG right to housing \u201d to all guardianship and wardship departments . The relevant part of the letter reads as follows :", "\u201c If a guardianship and wardship authority issues advance clearance of a transaction which involves the sale of a flat followed by the subsequent purchase of a flat , the operative part of the clearance ( resolution ) must either specify that the transaction is to be carried out subject to the condition that the new flat will be purchased in the minor \u2019s name if the minor loses his interest in the [ sold ] property , or indicate the address where the minor is to live if the minor is simply a member of the legal owner \u2019s family . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
