The first applicant owned a CARDINAL share of a house constructed DATE ( her share amounting to QUANTITY . m , of which CARDINAL sq . m was living space ) , and QUANTITY . m of land . The property had been her registered address since DATE . It appears that her title originated in the inheritance she had received after her late mother \u2019s death in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant owned a CARDINAL share in the same house ( amounting to some CARDINAL sq . m ) and QUANTITY . m of the same plot of land . It appears that he had first had a right of use ( as part of inheritance after another person ) in respect of the land and had then acquired title to it in DATE ; that he had inherited his share in the house after another person in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The remainder of the house and plot of land were owned by the first applicant \u2019s brother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG LOC issued a decision to \u201c adopt \u201d the general plan of LOC town , \u201c to invite the PERSON municipality to continue co - operating with the authors of the general plan when preparing future projects , bearing in mind that the plan is the main legal document in relation to town planning \u201d .

In DATE the LOC municipality ( \u201c the municipality \u201d ) adopted a programme aimed at demolishing dilapidated housing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the local authorities adopted draft construction guidelines for the Oktyabrskiy Proezdy district where the applicants\u2019 house was situated . The draft guidelines were published in a local newspaper on DATE . It appears that they were eventually adopted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A committee composed of officials attached to various public authorities was asked to make a proposal regarding a plot of land for constructing blocks of flats . The committee considered that it would be appropriate to construct blocks of flats at FAC . It does not transpire from the committee \u2019s deliberations that they considered any other plots of land . On CARDINAL DATE the municipality issued a decision by which it agreed to the construction of several blocks of flats ( including CARDINAL on the LOC land ) and authorised a specialised ORG enterprise to start the compiling of the necessary technical documents .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the regional administration , the PERSON town administration and a ORG enterprise signed an investment contract for the construction of multi - storey blocks of flats in the area , including the ORG land . Under the terms of the contract , the enterprise would arrange to buy the land from private owners and the municipality would acquire title to it . The investor would also take measures to resettle any inhabitants and provide them with compensation . The municipality and the investor would own PERCENT and PERCENT of the newly built housing space respectively . The estimated preliminary cost of the project amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As transpires from the available information , the block of flats to be built on the applicants\u2019 land comprised CARDINAL floors , CARDINAL flats with the total space of QUANTITY . m. Under the investment contract , the municipality was to receive title to CARDINAL flats for the overall space of QUANTITY m.", "CARDINAL .

The above investment project was CARDINAL of the measures by which the municipality intended to achieve those aims . In total , the order concerned some CARDINAL investment contracts in relation to over CARDINAL dwellings , of which CARDINAL properties were privately owned and the remainder was owned by the municipality .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the municipality ordered the expropriation of the applicants\u2019 house and land for municipal needs , namely the construction of a block of flats under the investment contract .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE the second applicant received notice of the planned expropriation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality amended the expropriation order , indicating that pursuant to the investment contract the investor had to provide funds for paying compensation for the land being expropriated and provide inhabitants with comparable alternative housing . The investor was required to request expert valuations to determine the market value of the properties being expropriated ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) and then buy those properties .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on CARDINAL DATE the investor obtained a valuation report regarding the applicants\u2019 house and land to determine their market value . The company used was PERSON , a private company licensed by the ORG to carry out valuation assessments ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG was not provided with a copy of this valuation report .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was served with notice of the planned expropriation . In DATE both applicants were informed that the amended expropriation order had been officially registered .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE there was a meeting between FAC residents and , apparently , a representative of the local authorities or the private company . The ORG stated that the residents had been given access to a construction planning document for the area , documents concerning the choice of plots for such construction , the town plan and some other documents .", "CARDINAL . As no comparable plots of land were available in the area , having regard to the valuation report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the first applicant was offered several options of \u201c compensation in kind \u201d , namely CARDINAL or CARDINAL - room flats in GPE or GPE with market values of MONEY ( ORG ) , apparently with ownership title . She was also offered monetary compensation for the land and her part of the house of up to ORG CARDINAL . However , she turned down these offers , considering them insufficient or the location of the alternative housing unsuitable . The second applicant appears to have turned down offers of plots of land in nearby areas ranging MONEY in value . The second applicant also turned down another offer : ownership title to CARDINAL flats measuring CARDINAL sq . m and QUANTITY . m each together with ORG CARDINAL . The second applicant stated that he was entitled to compensation amounting to ORG CARDINAL . The investor then made a new offer of ORG CARDINAL as compensation for his part of the house and land . The second applicant did not accept it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investor requested another valuation report regarding the applicants\u2019 house and land from ORG . On DATE it issued a report indicating that the overall market value of the first and second applicant \u2019s shares of the house and land were ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL respectively . ORG was provided with part of that report , which reads :", "\u201c [ Description ] of the assessment object : a residential house ( a single - storey building made of wood , [ measuring ] CARDINAL [ sq . m ] , of which CARDINAL [ sq . m is ] living space ) and annexes ; a plot of land [ measuring ] CARDINAL [ sq . m ] ...", "[ Location ] of the assessment object : ...", "The assessment object is situated in the centre of the old town of LOC .

GPE metro station is within a TIME ride by public transport ...", "Description of the house : ... the main building was first constructed in DATE ; the remaining buildings later , until DATE ... The house is habitable , although it requires some superficial repairs ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the district chief architect and the local land authority informed the municipal administration that the town \u2019s general plan of DATE made no provision for the construction of individual housing . On DATE , in reply to an enquiry raised by the investor company , the municipality announced that it had no available plots of land that would be equivalent to the land to be expropriated from the applicants , namely those assigned for the construction of individual housing .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the town administration brought proceedings in ORG of LOC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) seeking judicial authorisation for the expropriation of the applicants\u2019 house and land . In DATE the first applicant lodged a separate claim against the municipality , arguing that the expropriation orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE were ultra vires and otherwise unlawful and disproportionate . On DATE ORG held a hearing . After hearing evidence from a representative of the municipality , it decided to join the cases . An appeal brought by the first applicant was not processed since the procedural order was not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG replied to a request for information from the second applicant , informing him that the regional ministry had acted ultra vires in taking a decision on the general plan in DATE and that no copy of it existed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants informed the court examining their case accordingly .", "CARDINAL . The court held several hearings in the expropriation case . It appears that on DATE the court ordered a new report from ORG . The applicants did not oppose the choice of company and did not ask for any particular questions to be put to its experts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a group of CARDINAL experts compiled a report indicating ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL as the market values of the first applicant \u2019s land and part of the house respectively , and FAC CARDINAL and CARDINAL as the second applicant \u2019s ( compare the earlier assessment in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The land and house were therefore valued at ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL per sq . m respectively .", "CARDINAL . In reply to the second applicant \u2019s complaint , on DATE the ORG provided the following reply ( see also DATE and DATE below ) :", "\u201c Regarding your complaint about unlawfulness relating to the adoption of LOC town plan :", "I inform you that ORG DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the old LAW provided for a procedure relating to consultation with the local population in relation to the documents relating to town planning . At the same time , the Code did not specify any particular manner for obtaining the population \u2019s view , and thus consultations could be done in any form . It has been established that LOC town plan was adopted on DATE by ORG of the Moscow Region and not by a municipality , in breach of LAW . Moreover , there is a breach of the same provision due to the fact that there is currently no Lyubetsy town plan . The municipality will be ordered to remedy the violation of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality \u2019s mayor wrote to ORG asking to speed up the court proceedings , arguing that some of the flats were to be given to the people waiting for social housing and that the procrastination of the proceedings was also prejudicial to the people who had invested in the construction project .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment , stating as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They contended , inter alia , that the expert report relied on by the first - instance court had in fact been requested by the municipality and was thus biased and based on the material provided by them ; no court - requested report had been prepared . The first applicant also argued that the expert report had failed to take into account the scarcity of land in LOC for individual housing ; the commercially attractive location of the land , which bordered the city of GPE ; the proximity of a metro station under construction ( or planned ) ; and the intended use of the land being expropriated for commercial gain arising from the construction of blocks of flats . The applicant also contested the expert assessment regarding the value of the house to be demolished pursuant to the expropriation decision . The expert had not used the \u201c method of prospective use \u201d for determining the value of the house and land . The expert valuation was based on the premise that the land \u2019s use was for a DATE cottage use rather than for the use relating to multi - storey blocks of flat ; this premise was inappropriate , given that the property was already surrounded by similar blocks of flats . With reference to the above considerations , the applicant \u2019s own calculations amounted to ORG CARDINAL for her part of the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for supervisory review of the court decisions of DATE and DATE , requesting that the enforcement proceedings be suspended .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the applicants were evicted and had their belongings removed from the house . According to the Government , the first applicant \u2019s belongings were then delivered to the social housing flat where they were then stored , under the supervision of a local public official , until DATE when she received the keys .", "CARDINAL . A bank account was opened for the first applicant , and the expropriation compensation was credited into it on DATE . The bank issued a certificate allowing the accountholder to use the money . On CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was informed of the above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s application for supervisory review . The reviewing judge held that the municipality had had competence to issue the expropriation decision , referring to the available general plan and all the other necessary documents .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant lodged a further application for review before the President of ORG . On DATE the application was examined and rejected by another judge of ORG . In DATE the first applicant again applied for review before the President of ORG . In a letter of DATE the President of ORG dismissed her application , upholding the earlier refusals .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged an application for supervisory review with ORG . On DATE it was dismissed . The applicant challenged that decision before the Deputy President of ORG . In a letter of DATE he agreed with the lower courts\u2019 decisions . In DATE , in reply to a new application , ORG informed the first applicant that she could lodge no further supervisory review applications in respect of the court decisions .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , until DATE the first applicant refused to accept the keys to the flat and the bank certificate relating to the account into which the expropriation compensation had been credited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received the keys for the flat , the bank certificate and her belongings that had been in safekeeping .", "CARDINAL . According to the second applicant , in DATE the municipality resold the properties it had acquired under the investment project to the investor .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant brought separate proceedings challenging the orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG took a final decision rejecting his claim , primarily because it was time - barred but also because the main arguments had already been dealt with in the final judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant brought separate proceedings in ORG ( i ) alleging that the bailiffs had acted unlawfully in the enforcement proceedings , and ( ii ) claiming compensation in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . Her claim was turned down on several occasions because she had failed to comply with the required formalities . It appears that the relevant procedural orders were annulled because they reached the applicant after the respective time limits for complying with them had expired . Several hearings were scheduled in DATE . Sometime during DATE ORG decided that the claims for compensation should be processed separately .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant resubmitted her claim for compensation . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the case because she had failed to comply with its instructions to specify the amount of the claim , to submit calculations concerning the loss and to pay a court fee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the first claim in part , considering that the applicant had not been informed in good time of the order launching the enforcement proceedings in DATE . She had thus been deprived of the right to contest the documents relating to the enforcement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sued the municipality , complaining of losses she had suffered because of inflation arising from the delay in enforcement of the judgment of DATE in the part relating to the expropriation compensation . On DATE ORG awarded her CARDINAL MONEY ( RUB ) in pecuniary damages arising from the fact that the judgment had actually been enforced on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed that judgment on appeal and instead awarded the applicant RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL , considering that the judgment had been enforced on DATE when the expropriation compensation had been credited into the bank account opened for her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the bailiff service , requesting compensation for belongings that had either been lost or damaged during or following demolition of the house . On DATE ORG replied that an inventory of her belongings had been compiled before the demolition . They had all been transferred to her social housing flat and entrusted to a public official for safekeeping ; she had had DATE to reclaim them . In DATE a new complaint by her was dismissed by ORG , which noted that the notices dated CARDINAL , DATE , and DATE of the impending demolition of the house had not been served on her personally as she had been away from her temporary address .
