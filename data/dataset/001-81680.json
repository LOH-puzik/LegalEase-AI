The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . F and M are the father and the mother of D , a girl born on DATE . On DATE she was admitted to the child psychiatric department of a hospital for a DATE period for observation . During the observation she mentioned that she had played \u201c finger games \u201d with her father . According to the parents , D had referred to hobby crafts . It appears that the psychologist and the social welfare authorities interpreted this as sexual petting .", "CARDINAL . D received treatment at the hospital from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE , following which she went to live in a substitute family . The applicants were allegedly refused access to D during her hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ( sosiaalilautakunta , socialn\u00e4mnden ) decided to place D in public care on account of a suspicion that she had been sexually abused . The applicants unsuccessfully challenged the public care decision in the administrative courts . It appears that ORG rendered its decision in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social welfare officials allegedly told the applicants that the girl would return to live with them if they assumed responsibility for the situation and acknowledged the abuse . Although the applicant father was allegedly not guilty of any abuse , on DATE , he admitted the abuse to the social welfare officials and a psychiatrist in order to have D return home . He did not describe the nature of the abuse . On DATE he withdrew his admission as he felt that he could not bear having this lie on his conscience for the rest of his life .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants lodged an application with a view to having the public care terminated . In the course of those proceedings , on DATE , ORG reported to the police the alleged sexual abuse committed in DATE . As to the fact that DATE had passed since the initial suspicion had arisen , the ORG explained that it had refrained from taking criminal action in order to afford the applicants an opportunity to seek therapy . If the therapy had proved successful , the public care could have been terminated and D could have returned to live with the applicants . ORG apparently considered that the applicants ' therapy had proved unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . As noted above , the alleged sexual abuse was reported on DATE . On DATE the applicant father was questioned by the police . He denied any abuse . D , now aged CARDINAL , was not questioned during the pre - trial investigation . Nor was the father asked whether he wished to have questions put to the girl . The investigation was completed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the father for sexual abuse of a minor and for sexual intercourse with a descendant ( lapseen kohdistuva haureus ja sukurutsa j\u00e4lkel\u00e4isen kanssa , otukt med barn och blodskam med avkomling ) .", "CARDINAL . In its written submission of CARDINAL DATE to ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) ORG claimed compensation on behalf of NORP It also submitted a written medical opinion by PERSON , a psychiatrist , according to which the hearing of NORP before the court would harm her development . It appears that PERSON had not seen D since DATE or DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant father was summoned to ORG hearing . On DATE he submitted his written submission , denying the charges . He criticised ORG for not having reported the alleged abuse sooner , given the fact that the report had been based on a suspicion which had first arisen in DATE . Further , he requested that D , now aged DATE , be heard before the court .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE he denied the charges and maintained that D should be heard either before the court or elsewhere . The court refused the request , considering that the hearing of the girl before the court would not be in her best interests having regard to the time that had passed since the alleged offences and the therapy that she had received . The court made reference to the above written medical opinion prepared by ORG", "CARDINAL . The court received oral evidence from the social welfare director PERSON , the applicant mother , PERSON , ORG , a psychologist , PERSON , a psychiatrist , GPE , a social worker , D 's substitute mother and D 's teacher . PERSON gave evidence to the effect that she had heard about the events from D herself . D had said that her father had tickled her genital area and that she had tickled his penis which had risen following which he had urinated on her hand . She had also said that he had put his penis in her mouth and kept it there for a long time until he had urinated into her mouth . D had also lain on top of her father and his penis had been on her genital area . PERSON , GPE and GPE testified to having been present when the applicant father had admitted the alleged abuse . None of the witnesses had made any observations on the alleged acts .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the evidence produced before it was based on D 's statements to the medical personnel of the institution in which she had been treated , and on circumstances that had been observed during the observation . There was no forensic evidence as to the alleged abuse . On the other hand , there was the admission by the applicant father which had seemed authentic and true to the above witnesses . The court concluded that the statements of Dr GPE and GPE proved that the applicant father was guilty of the alleged offences . Having regard to the seriousness of the charges , his admission alone did not suffice to prove his guilt . However , it did not lack significance since according to GPE and PERSON it had been made voluntarily without any pressure having been exercised on him ; nor had he been misled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant father as charged and sentenced him to a suspended term of DATE and DATE imprisonment . He was ordered to pay compensation plus the legal costs of D 's representation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant father appealed , maintaining that D should be heard .

ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) refused the requests . It however held an oral hearing and received the same oral evidence as had been presented to the lower court . PERSON now testified to having met D some DATE before ORG hearing and to having asked her about the alleged abuse . D had replied that her father had not abused her sexually in any way . ORG also received oral evidence from the applicant father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended ORG judgment in that it rejected the charge of sexual intercourse with a descendant . It upheld the rest of the lower court 's judgment , endorsing its reasoning . It did not comment separately on the testimony of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant father appealed further , maintaining that D should be heard in particular as she had denied the sexual abuse to ORG DATE before ORG hearing . He repeated his request that ORG be invited to interview the girl . He also submitted a letter from D in which she stated that nothing improper had taken place between her and her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) granted leave to appeal insofar as the compensation claims were concerned and received ORG reply to the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited an expert opinion from ORG on , inter alia , whether D could be heard before the court . On DATE the ORG received an expert statement running to CARDINAL pages from its standing expert , Dr GPE It also invited an opinion by the psychiatrist who had treated PERSON It was received on DATE . As these opinions were partly contradictory in respect of the question whether D could be heard before the court , the ORG requested , on DATE , Dr GPE 's comment on the opinion of Dr GPE It was received on DATE . The ORG submitted its opinion to ORG on DATE following which it was communicated to the parties for comment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal insofar as the criminal aspects of the case were concerned . As to the compensation claims , it quashed the lower courts ' judgments and remitted the case to ORG as ORG had lacked competence to represent D in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was restored to ORG case - list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , having held an oral hearing at which it heard D , among others , ordered the applicant father to pay compensation to D in the amount of CARDINAL plus interest from CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that questioning and other investigation measures requested by a party must be carried out , if that party shows that there is a possibility that these measures could have an effect on the case , provided that the expenses so incurred are not disproportionate to the nature of the case ( section CARDINAL ) . The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre - trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . A pre - trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience . Nor must the rights of those concerned be infringed more than is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the investigation ( section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . The investigator may permit a party and his counsel to be present during the questioning of another party or witness , provided this does not hinder the investigation of the offence ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .
