POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and subsequently by Mr. PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON and subsequently by PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant and other suspects were arrested on suspicion of assault . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG , the applicant was remanded in custody . His detention was ordered for DATE , i.e. until DATE CARDINAL.The prosecutor referred to the strong probability of the applicant \u2019s guilt , the gravity of the charges against him and the high risk of his hindering the proper conduct of the proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses .", "On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court noted that the investigation had not yet been completed since CARDINAL of the co - accused had lodged a complaint concerning an anonymous witness and , in addition , some of the witnesses whose whereabouts were unknown had still to be heard . The court further noted that , in spite of the fact that the victims of the assault had changed their initial testimony , there were still serious grounds for believing that the applicant had committed the offences in question . The court also observed that the law did not require that the evidence in support of detention had to be such as to justify a conviction .", "On DATE the bill of indictment was lodged with ORG .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that he could not intervene in the pending proceedings because this might constitute an interference with judicial independence .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion , requesting suspension of the criminal proceedings due to the fact that the whereabouts of the victims of the alleged assault were unknown and he was unable to put questions to them . The applicant relied on his right to be given an opportunity to question witnesses on his behalf on the same conditions as those against him , as guaranteed by ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , observing that he had failed to indicate any new circumstances justifying his request .", "By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for the suspension of the proceedings , finding that LAW allowed for a possibility of using indirect testimony in case the witnesses could not be examined at a hearing .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . On DATE the court decided to uphold the applicant \u2019s and other GPE detention , finding that all of them had been sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and that the grounds for release provided by LAW were insufficient .", "In a letter of DATE to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , ORG observed that the appeal against the first - instance judgment submitted by him was not entirely consistent with the appeal prepared by his client and asked him to respond to the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had failed in his duties as a legal counsel by not discussing with him the issue of the appeal .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and referred the case back to ORG , concluding that the reasoning of the first - instance court , which had led to the applicant \u2019s conviction , contained a number of flaws regarding both fact and law and was thus not entirely satisfactory . The court also expressed its concern that the rights of the defence had been violated . On DATE the court decided to uphold the applicant \u2019s detention on remand , considering that there was still a strong probability of his guilt and that it was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The court found no circumstances justifying the applicant \u2019s release under LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , considering that his detention was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings and finding no particular family circumstances requiring his release . The court observed that burdensome effects on a detainee \u2019s family were inherent in detention . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , invoking the same arguments as above .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG confirmed the view expressed in his letter of DATE to the applicant concerning the question of determining the period of detention on remand once a first - instance judgment had been rendered . The fact that the first - instance judgment had been quashed did not affect his opinion . He further stated that it was not his function to assess the evidence gathered in the proceedings . Concerning the complaint about the excessive length of the proceedings , the President noted that the case file had been transferred back to ORG and that the case would be allocated to a judge rapporteur after he was back from holidays .", "On DATE ORG , referring to the resolution I KPZ CARDINAL of DATE by ORG , informed the applicant that the period of detention on remand was limited only until the delivery of the first - instance judgment even though it was to be quashed by the second - instance court .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it examined complaints concerning detention on remand only in accordance with the procedure prescribed under LAW", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release . The court expressed the opinion that the applicant \u2019s concerns as regards his family \u2019s situation were premature .", "On DATE , in reply to the applicant \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG observed that all the applicant \u2019s motions with regard to quashing his detention on remand could be only examined by the court at the disposal of which he was placed .", "On DATE the President of ORG sent an explanatory letter to ORG . It transpires from this report that the courts refused to quash the applicant \u2019s detention on remand on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , on CARDINAL and DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , on DATE and DATE and on DATE . The President admitted that the problem of the indefinite time - limit of the detention on remand after the delivery of the first - instance judgment , until it was decided by ORG , might be a controversial one . In his view , the notion of \u201c the judgment \u201d under LAW of LAW covered the notion of \u201c the judgment quashed by a second - instance court \u201d since \u201c lege non distinguente nec nostrum est distinguere \u201d . The phrase \u201c delivery of the first - instance judgment \u201d must have been used by the legislator knowingly and clearly indicated the date until which the court was obliged to determine the time - limit of the detention on remand .", "At the hearing of DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , considering that in view of the seriousness of the charges , his detention was warranted . The court also noted that the time - limits for detention on remand set out in LAW procedure did not apply to the applicant \u2019s case . As regards the applicant \u2019s family \u2019s situation , difficult as it might be , it was not so critical as to justify his release .", "On the same date the president of ORG informed the applicant that the detention order given by the prosecutor was in compliance with the then ( i.e. in DATE ) applicable provisions of procedural law . The entry into force of the new provisions on DATE did not result in the unlawfulness of the detention orders issued prior to that date . In addition , the preventive measure imposed on the applicant had been repeatedly examined by the courts , i.e. on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE . He further stated that he was not in a position to interfere with the decisions of independent courts , including those concerning the imposition of preventive measures and determining the time - limit of the detention on remand . He finally observed that the applicant could at any time apply to the court to be released .", "On DATE the Chancellery of the President explained to the applicant that the President could not interfere with court proceedings since , in accordance with the constitutional principle of division of powers , the judicial authorities were independent of the executive organs .", "At a hearing of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , considering that his detention was justified by the strong evidence of his guilt . The court reiterated that the obligation to determine the period for which detention could be prolonged existed only until the judgment of the first - instance had been given .", "In a letter of DATE the Minister of Justice shared the view put forward by the President of ORG in his letter of DATE , as regards the interpretation of the notion of \u201c the judgment \u201d in the phrase : \u201c until the date of the delivery of the first - instance judgment \u201d , arguing that it also referred to \u201c the judgment quashed by a higher instance \u201d . He further stated that he was not empowered to review the grounds on which the courts ordered detention on remand and that the applicant could at any time file a request for release .", "In a letter of DATE the applicant complained about the refusal of ORG at the hearing on DATE to allow his request for his release and the suspension of the proceedings . He observed that the alleged victims had given contradictory testimony and had left GPE . Further , the applicant stated that the proceedings served mainly the purpose of establishing the truth and therefore , reading out the indirect evidence at the hearing would be in breach of his defence rights and contrary to the requirements of a fair trial . The applicant relied on his rights guaranteed by LAW and LAW .", "At the hearing of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , which had been submitted by his lawyer , reiterating its position as regards the time - limits for the detention on remand after the delivery of the first - instance judgment . The court invoked the resolution no . I KPZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL OSNKW of DATE of ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , considering that he had failed to indicate any new circumstances justifying his request .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that on DATE ORG had quashed the first - instance judgment of DATE and upheld the applicant \u2019s detention without fixing the date up until which the detention was to last . On DATE the applicant had been in detention for DATE . The case had been referred to ORG for re - examination . ORG had not found it necessary to determine the point until which the detention should last or to file a request with ORG to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention on remand , considering that there were no time - limits for the detention on remand after the delivery of the first - instance judgment . The court admitted that there was a legal problem as regards the interpretation of LAW of LAW , which should be resolved by ORG in order to establish common practice . The court maintained its position on this matter , declaring that the period of detention on remand was limited only until the delivery of the first - instance judgment even though it was quashed by the second - instance court .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release , relying on the grounds invoked in the previous decisions .", "By a judgment of DATE of ORG , the applicant was found guilty of the charges against him and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE the court decided to release the applicant , observing that the judgment had been pronounced and there was no further need for the applicant \u2019s continuing detention . The court observed that the family situation of the applicant and the co - accused was difficult and that they had been already detained for DATE .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that the stance on the issue of time - limits for detention on remand taken by the President of ORG as well as ORG was in line with the jurisprudence of ORG at that time . As regards the preventive measure imposed on the applicant , he did not consider it contrary to LAW . In addition , LAW , the applicant could at any time apply to have a preventive measure quashed or altered . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint relating to the length of the proceedings , the ORG had requested ORG to inform him about the state of the proceedings .", "Apparently on DATE the applicant was again detained on remand in connection with certain investigative proceedings concerning unspecified charges .", "On DATE ORG , having examined the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE acquitted him of all charges . The prosecutor filed a cassation appeal against this judgment .", "At the hearing of DATE ORG decided not to examine the cassation appeal due to the fact that the public prosecutor had withdrawn it .", "At the material time the domestic provisions governing detention on remand were contained in LAW of DATE , which is no longer in force as it was repealed and replaced by LAW DATE ( currently referred to as the \u201c GPE Procedure \u201d ) .", "The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE listed detention among the so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( those measures were , inter alia , detention on remand , bail and police supervision ) . Until DATE ( i.e. the date on which the PERSON of DATE on LAW to LAW and Other Criminal Statutes came into force ) a prosecutor was empowered to order all preventive measures as long as the investigation lasted . Also , at the material time the national law did not set out any statutory time - limits concerning the length of detention on remand in court proceedings ; however , under LAW a prosecutor was obliged to determine in his decision the period for which detention was ordered .", "That Article stated ( in the version applicable at the material time ) :", "\u201c Preventive measures shall be ordered by the court ; before a bill of indictment has been lodged with the competent court , those measures shall be ordered by the prosecutor . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( in the version applicable until DATE ) , insofar as relevant , stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

If they refused to prolong detention or if the prosecutor failed to submit a request for a further prolongation before or on the expiry of the last detention order ( regardless of whether it had been made by him or by a court ) , the detainee had to be released immediately .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

If there is such a review at the investigation stage ( LAW and CARDINAL ) , there is no reason why there should not be one at the stage of the court proceedings ... \u201d", "Also , at the time , the code set out CARDINAL different legal avenues whereby a detainee could challenge the lawfulness of his detention : an appeal to a court against a detention order made by a prosecutor ; proceedings in which courts examined requests for prolongation of detention submitted by a prosecutor ; and proceedings relating to a detainee \u2019s application for release .", "On DATE LAW replaced the DATE Code .", "Article CARDINAL of the DATE Code , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL .
