GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in FAC .", "The applicant had worked intermittently as a composition floor layer and construction worker in GPE since DATE .", "On DATE the Employer \u2019s ORG for the Engineering and ORG ( Maschinenbau- und ORG ) received medical notification that the applicant was suffering from lumbar spine problems . It was further notified on DATE by the applicant \u2019s employer at the time that the applicant had given up work in DATE due to these problems . ORG therefore initiated a procedure to determine whether the applicant \u2019s lumbar spine problems constituted an occupational disease .", "Following consultation of ORG , the relevant health insurance funds , other insurance associations and the competent medical adviser at ORG , ORG found on DATE that the applicant \u2019s disease was not work - related and that the applicant was thus not entitled to the payment of benefits . Pursuant to No . CARDINAL of Annex CARDINAL to the Guidelines pertaining to occupational diseases ( ORG ) , lumbar spine problems can only be recognised as an occupational disease if the worker has been regularly lifting or carrying heavy loads or has had to work in an extremely bent position over a long period of time . In line with the outcome of its investigations , ORG held that the technical conditions of the applicant \u2019s occupation did not meet those criteria .", "An administrative appeal by the applicant , referring to a medical certificate according to which it was likely that the applicant \u2019s spine problems were related to his former occupation , was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "The applicant then referred the case to the social courts and was represented by counsel throughout the subsequent proceedings .", "The case was rejected by ORG ( ORG ) on DATE following a hearing of the applicant and examination of CARDINAL expert witness opinions that were collected in separate court proceedings dealing with a comparable case . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s occupation and the conditions in which it was carried out were in general not capable of causing the alleged occupational disease and that it had therefore not been established that the applicant \u2019s disease was work - related . ORG held that it was thus not decisive whether the applicant did in fact suffer from the alleged health problems and accordingly dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a further medical expert opinion .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , following a hearing of the applicant and further consultation of ORG , rejected an appeal by the applicant . It held that even when taking into account all of the applicant \u2019s submissions as to the nature and duration of his previous employment , the conditions of his occupation did not justify the recognition of his spine problems as an occupational disease . ORG therefore upheld the decision of ORG that it was not necessary to grant the applicant \u2019s request for a further medical expert opinion and , further , rejected his newly introduced alternative application to hear evidence from a medical expert on the technical conditions of his work .", "On DATE a complaint by the applicant against ORG refusal to grant him leave to appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) was rejected as inadmissible . ORG found that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegation that the proceedings had been flawed by procedural shortcomings that might have affected the decision of ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant .", "Section CARDINAL of the Social Court Act stipulates that the court has to investigate the facts of a case of its own motion and in consultation with the parties to the proceedings .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , the President must endeavour to ensure the elimination of procedural shortcomings , clarification of unclear applications , submission of relevant applications , completion of the statement of facts of a case and submission of all declarations necessary for the assessment of the facts .", "Section CARDINAL of the Social Court Act provides that , upon the request of the insured person , a particular medical expert has to be heard by the social courts unless the admission of such evidence would delay the proceedings or the court is convinced that the request was submitted in an attempt to delay the proceedings or that the request was not submitted earlier due to gross negligence .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that an appeal against the decision of ORG may only be admitted if it refers to procedural shortcomings that might affect the decision being appealed . A violation of section CARDINAL can not be considered as a procedural shortcoming for this purpose and a violation of section CARDINAL can only be considered as such in the event that a refusal to accept an application to take evidence has not been sufficiently reasoned by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
