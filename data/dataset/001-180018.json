SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Morocco)", "JUDGES": "Alena Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1;Branko Lubarda;Georgios A. Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he was granted a temporary residence permit in GPE which was made permanent in DATE . Both permits were based on the applicant \u2019s family ties , but he was not granted NORP citizenship . In DATE he married a non - NORP national who held a permanent residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( S\u00e4kerhetspolisen ) applied to ORG ( PERSON ) requesting the applicant \u2019s expulsion . During ORG examination of the request , the applicant applied for asylum , claiming that he was in need of international protection . He further contested ORG request alleging that , since ORG had branded him a terrorist , he would risk torture and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in GPE . He submitted that he would be forced to confess to an act of terrorism that he had not committed . The applicant stated that his parents lived in GPE and he had visited them DATE . During the visit , police officers had approached him and informed him that they were monitoring him and advised him to \u201c listen to our friends in GPE or stay away from GPE forever \u201d . He acknowledged that he had left GPE legally with his own passport , that he had not been wanted in GPE , that there were no legal proceedings pending against him and that he had never published anything on , for example , religion or politics . Moreover , to his knowledge , his parents had never been approached by the authorities because of him and the NORP authorities had never contacted him in GPE . However , he claimed that ORG would inform the NORP authorities of the reasons for his arrest and expulsion and other NORP in GPE might also submit such information . He was not aware if his situation had been noted in GPE . The applicant referred to country information about GPE according to which physical ill - treatment and arbitrary detention occurred , in particular of suspected terrorists . Such persons had been tortured into confession and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment . He also referred to the ORG \u2019s case law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the Security Services\u2019 request to expel the applicant and , at the same time , rejected the applicant \u2019s demand for asylum and international protection . It noted that the human rights situation in GPE had improved significantly . Violence at police stations and prisons had decreased . Imprisonment was common in terror - related cases and persons affiliated with NORP movements ran a higher risk of being subjected to violence . Older reports contained accounts of torture and illtreatment in cases concerning national security and terrorism . However , the NORP authorities had publicly stated that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for depriving people of their rights . Torture was illegal and efforts to curb the use of torture had been successful . In terror - related cases , arrested suspects were examined by doctors before and after interrogation to prevent the use of violence by the interrogators .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the applicant \u2019s situation , ORG found no reasons to question ORG assessment of the applicant . In this regard , it found that the applicant lacked credibility since his submissions relating to his background and previous activities were contradicted by the information submitted by ORG . Moreover , the ORG considered that he had not made out that the NORP authorities had previously showed an interest in him . It took into account that he had lived outside GPE for DATE and that , as he said himself , he had lived an inconspicuous life in GPE without political or religious activities . Furthermore , after his last visit to GPE , he had left the country legally using his passport . His parents in GPE had not reported any visits from the authorities enquiring about him and the NORP authorities had never contacted him in GPE . They had never requested his extradition either , or informed him that he was suspected of terrorism or any other kind of criminality . He had never been convicted of any terrorrelated crimes in GPE . The ORG observed that the applicant had submitted that he was not sought in GPE , that he had not been involved in any legal proceedings there and that the NORP authorities had never subjected him to any acts of persecution in the past . As late as towards DATE , the applicant had travelled internationally using his passport , without being stopped . Even though older \u201c country of origin \u201d reports included accounts of ill - treatment , the most recent reports instead spoke of measures taken by the NORP authorities aimed at reinforcing the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the risk upon return because it was ORG which had requested the expulsion , ORG found that the applicant had not made out that he risked persecution upon return on this ground . It took into account that no objective evidence suggested that the NORP authorities were aware of his case and that the legislation had regard to the possible risks of being labelled a terrorist and had been designed to avoid such risks .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that , even taking into account the applicant \u2019s submissions , it shared ORG assessment and considered that there were grounds to expel the applicant with reference to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of GPE ( lagen [ CARDINAL:CARDINAL ] om s\u00e4rskild utl\u00e4nningskontroll ) . It thus rejected his request for asylum and international protection , revoked his permanent residence permit and ordered his expulsion to either GPE or another specified country . It also decided on a lifelong ban on returning to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the Government , submitting that ORG assessment had been accepted by ORG without a careful examination , rendering the proceedings unfair and partial . He maintained his claims and stressed that the use of torture was frequent in GPE , in particular in relation to suspected terrorists .", "CARDINAL . ORG forwarded the appeal to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) in accordance with LAW . The ORG maintained its stance and stated , inter alia , that the applicant had not made it probable that he was of interest to the NORP authorities and there was no concrete information indicating that they should be aware of what had happened to him in GPE . ORG stated that it was as transparent as possible but , for reasons of confidentiality , could not reveal its working methods and sources . It added that it was continually assessing whether it was possible to enforce the expulsion . If information were to emerge which raised the issue of impediments to the expulsion , the Government would be informed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , the appellate court shared the reasoning of ORG and decided to recommend that the Government uphold the ORG \u2019s decision . It found , inter alia , that there was nothing to support that the applicant at that point in time was known by the NORP authorities and of interest to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government upheld ORG decision in full . The Government noted ORG submissions concerning the applicant \u2019s background and connections and found that there were no grounds for questioning these submissions . In view of what was known about the applicant \u2019s former activities and other circumstances , the Government concluded that it was reasonable to fear that the applicant would commit or participate in committing a terrorist offence which warranted his expulsion in accordance with GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the interim measure indicated by ORG , the Government decided to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order until further notice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
