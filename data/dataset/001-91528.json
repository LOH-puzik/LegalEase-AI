He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was a citizen of the former GPE ( GPE ) who absconded to GPE in DATE . His real property was subsequently placed under ORG guardianship and sold to members of the GPE nomenclature ( hereinafter the \u201c occupiers \u201d ) in DATE . The occupiers were registered as owners of the property on DATE and lived in the house built on the property .", "On DATE the applicant applied for the restitution of the property . On DATE the Hellersdorf - Hohensch\u00f6nhausen - Marzahn Office for the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues ( Amt zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) decided , inter alia , that the occupiers had not acquired the property in good faith and ordered that the property be returned . The occupiers appealed against that decision . On DATE ORG ordered the return of the property to the applicant , and from that date the applicant was the owner of the property . The occupiers withdrew their application for leave to appeal on points of law on an unspecified date and subsequently vacated the property in DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant legal aid for a claim against the occupiers to obtain compensation for use of the property as regards the period from DATE to DATE on the ground that his application had no prospect of success . As to the period from DATE to DATE , and relying on a leading judgment of ORG of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , the court noted that section CARDINAL ) of the Act on the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues / Property Act ( Gesetz zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen/ Verm\u00f6gensgesetz \u2013 hereinafter the \u201c LAW \u201d , see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) excluded compensation for the remaining period when the occupiers were registered as owners and had used the property solely as a dwelling . Any claim for compensation for use of property for DATE and DATE could only be raised before a district court in view of the value of the claim .", "On DATE ORG upheld that decision .", "On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint for examination .", "On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , an owner is not entitled to claim compensation for use of property from the tenants unless otherwise agreed or in respect of rent obtained after DATE .", "On DATE ORG held in a leading judgment ( published in that court \u2019s official reports [ ORG ] volume CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) that there were no lacunae in section GPE ) of LAW and hence no justification for its analogous application to claims for compensation for use of property other than those concerning rent obtained by the tenant after DATE . The court noted that the tenant was fully entitled to enjoy the property and its fruits prior to restitution . Citing the relevant legislative materials , the court further noted that the legislature had provided for the exception only to urge occupiers to use the rent to maintain the property prior to restitution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
