SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["The first and second applicants are a married couple of NORP nationality and originating from GPE . They were born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The third and fourth applicants are their children , born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The family is currently in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the first and second applicants applied for asylum and residence permits in GPE . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , they submitted the following . The first applicant had performed his military service in DATE , and had been suspected by NORP of having taken part in a massacre where GPE NORP had been killed . Although he had not been present , the couple had been harassed and threatened by NORP where they lived . People had thrown rocks at them and , during her pregnancy , the second applicant had received numerous death threats and had been beaten on several occasions . They had turned to the local police several times , but had not received any help . In DATE a neighbour had warned them that their house would be attacked and later they had been visited by ORG or UNMIK police , who had told them to flee . They had stayed with the UNMIK police for DATE before leaving the country .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the application . ORG found that the applicants had a well - founded fear of persecution in GPE and thus could not be expected to return there . However , it considered that they could relocate to another area within GPE and GPE since they were ethnic NORP . The fact that they did not have any connection to another area was not sufficient to grant them leave to remain in GPE .", "The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) and added that the first applicant had witnessed a massacre . Pictures of him in his military uniform had been published by ORG and the ORG in DATE and his name had been published in the local newspapers in connection with the massacre . He was therefore known as a traitor throughout GPE and GPE . Moreover , the family lacked a social network outside GPE .", "On DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision in full .", "Following the enactment of an interim amendment to LAW , the applicants requested to have their case reviewed and referred mainly to discrimination against NORP in GPE . On DATE , ORG decided not to grant them residence permits in GPE on the basis of the interim amendment .", "In DATE and DATE , the applicants twice applied for re - examination of their case , claiming that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation order . On each occasion , ORG rejected the applications .", "On DATE , the deportation order against the applicants became time - barred and they lodged a new application for asylum and residence permits . They stated that their only connection to GPE was their ethnicity and that they had integrated into NORP society . They submitted documents from the third applicant \u2019s school , stating that he was insecure but developing well , and that he was learning NORP .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the application . Through contacts with ORG , ORG had been informed that the first and the second applicants were registered as NORP nationals and as residents in PERSON in GPE . In relation to GPE , ORG found that there were no longer any threats against the applicants there and thus no risk if they returned . As concerned GPE , it noted that the applicants had not invoked any individual grounds for fear . Since they were nationals of GPE and residents there , there were no grounds for them not to return . Moreover , the ORG noted that the applicants had remained in ORG . In reaching this decision , it considered it to be in the best interests of the children to accompany their parents to a country where they had relatives and spoke the language .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining their claims and adding that they had lived in GPE but the only reason they had been registered in GPE was to obtain financial aid from the government . Moreover , it would be very difficult for them to settle in GPE . The second applicant also suffered from poor mental health and was scheduled to receive psychiatric care after she had given birth to a stillborn child . They wanted to be near the child \u2019s grave .", "On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . It agreed with ORG that the applicants were not in need of protection in relation to either GPE or GPE . Moreover , it found that the second applicant \u2019s state of health was not so serious that she could be granted a residence permit on that ground . In conclusion , there were no reasons to grant the family leave to remain , even considering that the case involved children .", "Upon further appeal , on DATE , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals .", "By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , a permit may nevertheless be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s state of health . In the preparatory works to this provision ( travaux pr\u00e9paratoires CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for granting a residence permit .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
