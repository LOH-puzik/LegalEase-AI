On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , complaining about the way in which his pension had been calculated with effect from DATE . He stated that it had been calculated by multiplying the DATE average point level ( punctajul mediu anual ) determined for each retired person by the pension point ( punct de pensie ) which had been set by governmental decision . He relied on the following CARDINAL arguments : firstly that the average point level used for calculating his pension with effect from DATE had been progressively lowered since it had first been determined on DATE , and secondly that there had been errors in the calculation of his pension , meaning that the sums which had actually been paid in the periods from DATE , DATE and DATE to DATE had been lower than the sums obtained by multiplying the CARDINAL relevant figures together , even taking the value set by ORG . He also contended that the lowering of the DATE average point level was discriminatory as it only affected people who had retired DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a first - instance judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed his complaint , holding that even though the average point level had been lowered in DATE , this had caused no difference in the actual pension paid DATE and DATE , and that his claims were therefore ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal , arguing that his claims had not been properly examined . He claimed that ORG had not considered his allegation that the lowering of the average point level had been discriminatory and had failed to address his allegation that the pension that he had actually been paid for some periods had not corresponded to the sums produced by multiplying the CARDINAL relevant figures together , even taking the value set by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , namely GPE , ORG and ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .

It held that the applicant \u2019s pension had been correctly calculated in accordance with the applicable law . It stated that the applicant \u2019s pension rights had not been affected after the recalculation of the DATE average point level . The appellate court also noted that the applicant had brought parallel proceedings for the calculation of his pension rights and the amount of his pension had therefore already been established by a final decision of ORG delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged another extraordinary appeal , arguing that CARDINAL of the judges considering his appeal had lacked impartiality , as they had ruled on the case on a previous occasion , and that the new decision of DATE had contradicted the final decision of DATE , which had found that there was in fact a discrepancy between the pension which was actually paid to him and the one that would have resulted from a proper calculation .
