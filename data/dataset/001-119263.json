Shortly afterwards , PERSON , using forged documents , sold the seeds on to other people , who in turn sold the seeds to A. , a private company . The latter then consigned the seeds to ORG , a private company owning a silo .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG police that PERSON had failed to pay her for the seeds . On an unspecified date the police opened a criminal case against him for defrauding the applicant .", "On DATE the police declared the seeds to be physical evidence and ordered them to be seized and left for storage at the premises of company ORG", "On DATE the applicant lodged a civil claim with the police in the context of the criminal proceedings against PERSON seeking CARDINAL hryvnias ( ORG ) in compensation for pecuniary damage and ORG CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage .", "On DATE the police lifted the order for the seizure of the seeds and ordered them to be transferred to the applicant , but on DATE the director of ORG refused to return them , asserting that they belonged to company A.", "On DATE the police rejected the applicant \u2019s request to institute criminal proceedings against the director of ORG for his failure to transfer the seeds as they believed that the determination of the ownership dispute over the seeds was within the competence of the courts . The applicant challenged that decision before the courts ; however , on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively ORG and ORG ruled against her .", "On DATE the applicant was given permission to participate in the criminal proceedings against PERSON as a civil claimant .", "On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office quashed the police \u2019s order of DATE in its entirety .

On the same date the trial court , relying in particular on LAW ( \u201c Code of Criminal Procedure \u201d , as in force at the material time ) , declared the appeal inadmissible , on the grounds that company ORG had not been a party to the proceedings before the first - instance court and thus had no right to lodge an appeal .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and ruled that the appeal was to be examined on its merits . It held that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was in the interests of company A. and concerned the protection of property for the purposes of LAW . The inadmissibility decision had deprived the company of access to a court , which was contrary to LAW . The appellate court did not specify the procedural status of company A. The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation .", "On DATE ORG left the applicant \u2019s appeal unexamined , noting that only decisions on the merits were subject to its review .", "On DATE the appellate court quashed the part of the judgment of DATE concerning the return of the seeds , which it found to be \u201c insufficiently reasoned , contradictory , ambiguous and unlawful \u201d .

The court also noted that company A. could claim ownership of the seeds by means of civil proceedings .", "On DATE the appellate court quashed that decision , finding that the trial court had acknowledged that ownership of the seeds was in dispute and had actually determined who owned them . However , the decision in question was contrary to the second paragraph of LAW , which provided that any disputes over the ownership of physical evidence should be resolved in civil proceedings . The appellate court subsequently discontinued its consideration of the matter , explaining that it should be dealt with by means of civil proceedings .", "The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing in particular that company ORG had not been a party to the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG upheld the ruling of the appellate court although it did not specify the procedural status of company A.", "The applicant did not institute civil proceedings for the return of the seeds , which remained in the possession of company A.", "On DATE bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the part of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerning the return of the seeds to the applicant .", "On DATE ORG suspended the enforcement proceedings following a request submitted by company A.", "On DATE the same court rejected the bailiffs\u2019 request of DATE , stating that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was not final and that ownership of the seeds was to be determined in civil proceedings .
