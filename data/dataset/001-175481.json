The case file material indicates that the applicant saw the children on several occasions at their school DATE and DATE when he taught LANGUAGE there on a voluntary basis .", "CARDINAL . He also saw the children in the short period which followed ORG decisions to grant his application for a temporary contact arrangement pending a decision in the proceedings in GPE to determine the children \u2019s place of residence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to the children \u2019s school to meet his younger son . The boy did not want to see him , he was pushing the applicant away and yelling . After failed attempts to calm the boy down , the applicant picked him up against his will , held him in both hands and carried him to an office allocated by the school administration for the applicant \u2019s meetings with the children . The boy started screaming , crying and fighting the applicant off . In the meantime , the applicant \u2019s daughter had telephoned ORG , who came to the school shortly afterwards and took the children home .", "CARDINAL . M.G. sought the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant for having allegedly inflicted bodily harm on the children in the course of the above incident . On several occasions ORG of GPE Central District Office of ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant , owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions . The most recent decision was on DATE . The regional prosecutor \u2019s office found the above decision lawful .", "CARDINAL . Following the incident of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE the temporary contact arrangement for the applicant and his children was cancelled ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . While exercising his contact rights in accordance with a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE the applicant took his second - born son and left GPE for GPE . He never returned the child to the mother and has not seen his other children since .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant \u2019s eldest son has been living in GPE . The applicant \u2019s daughter and youngest son continue to live with their mother in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that , while the divorce proceedings were ongoing , the CARDINAL children should be placed in the care of social services , the children should reside with their mother , and the applicant should pay her child maintenance . The court further determined a schedule for the applicant \u2019s contact sessions with the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG varied the arrangements relating to residence and who had care of the children . Relying on an expert report by a psychologist and psychoanalyst , PERSON , and noting PERSON \u2019s continued lack of income , it ordered that , while the divorce proceedings were ongoing , the applicant should have sole care of the CARDINAL children and the children should reside with him . It further ordered that the CARDINAL younger children were to spend DATE with their mother in the following manner : from DATE after school to DATE TIME , and DATE from DATE after school to DATE TIME . The eldest son , who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder , was to go to a day centre for children with special needs after school , and he was free to choose which parent he wanted to stay with at TIME . The court also ordered that during DATE the children were to spend DATE with their father and the following week with their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG entrusted Dr C. with carrying out a monitoring exercise in relation to compliance with the above court order . This exercise , carried out in the period DATE , showed that compliance with the court order of DATE was rather good . After certain difficulties initially , the CARDINAL younger children adapted quite well to their new schedule and accepted their new rhythm of life , which was more regular and settled . PERSON report further mentioned that the children continued to experience psychological discomfort , partly owing to the difficult family situation ( acute tensions and conflict between the parents ) , partly owing to their age ( QUANTITY children were approaching adolescence ) , and partly owing to ORG actions ( her continuing to \u201c use \u201d the children as \u201c instruments \u201d in her dispute with the applicant ) . Despite the remaining difficulties in the relationship between the children and their parents , the arrangement of the children \u2019s life at that stage was assessed by the expert as being the best possible from a psychological and material point of view . The main problems which came to light during the monitoring exercise were : the situation of the applicant \u2019s eldest son , who was not receiving therapy for his condition ; the behaviour of PERSON , who was unpredictable and eccentric and motivated by a paranoid delusion that she was a victim of plotting and persecution by the court and state institutions in general , and who gave the impression that she was suffering mentally ; and ORG relationship with the children , in particular , her attempts to involve the children in judicial proceedings and seek \u201c allies \u201d in them against the father , who she represented as cruel , dangerous and violent , all of which was harming the psychological well - being of the children . In the expert \u2019s opinion , in order to prevent further psychological trauma being inflicted on the children by the mother \u2019s behaviour , it was necessary not only to put a distance between her and the children , but also to have recourse to psychotherapy and improve the quality of the children \u2019s psychological environment at their father \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that ORG had not respected the previous court orders . In particular , it found that the eldest son had been living with her during DATE . As he had refused to see his father , she had been the only parent who had had effective access to him . However , she had refused to bring him to the monitoring meetings with social services or ensure his attendance at DATE centre for children with special needs , as ordered by the court . Moreover , she had sent the child to GPE in DATE without his father \u2019s permission and without notifying social services . Given that ORG had not respected the arrangements fixed by the court , it was necessary to modify them . Accordingly , the court confirmed the previous arrangements in respect of the younger children in relation to who had care of them , their place of residence and contact . It further confirmed that the applicant should have sole care of the eldest son , and that the eldest son should reside with him . The eldest son was no longer given the choice as to whether he wished to stay with his father or mother at TIME . The court further confirmed the order for the eldest son \u2019s attendance at DATE centre for children with special needs , and noted that if ORG continued to not comply with that order , the matter would be reported to ORG for the adoption of measures limiting parental authority . It also held that the children were not allowed to leave GPE without the consent of both parents . Lastly , it fixed the manner in which the children should spend the approaching DATE . In particular , it ordered that from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the CARDINAL children were to stay with ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and the children left GPE for GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG pronounced the divorce of the applicant and ORG with reference to section MONEY ) of ORG , which provides that an action for divorce may be maintained by a husband or wife to procure a judgment divorcing the parties and dissolving the marriage on the grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment of the plaintiff by the defendant such that the conduct of the defendant so endangers the physical or mental well - being of the plaintiff as renders it unsafe or improper for the plaintiff to cohabit with the defendant . ORG further ordered that the applicant should pay child maintenance to M.G. As regards who should have care of the children and where they should live , the court noted that ORG had taken the children to GPE in breach of a court order , and for DATE had thereby deprived the father of any possibility of seeing the children . ORG having sole care of the children , as requested by her , was therefore excluded as an option . The court ordered that the applicant and PERSON should have joint care of the children and that the children should reside with their father . After the children \u2019s return to GPE , ORG contact rights would be fixed by social services so as to prevent the children being wrested once again from the environment in which they lived . Lastly , the court ordered that the applicant should bear all financial expenses in respect of the children , except medical expenses not covered by medical insurance , which should be divided between the parents . The judgment was \u201c temporarily enforceable \u201d ( provvisoriamente esecutivo ) pending a decision in appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . M.G. appealed against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s petition for divorce under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG as not meeting the required conditions . The court further noted that it could not take measures in relation to the personal relationship between the applicant and PERSON or other issues concerning the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted PERSON in absentia of abducting the children . She was given a DATE prison sentence with suspension of her parental authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an action by the applicant to strip M.G. of her parental authority in respect of the children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for recognition and enforcement of ORG decision of DATE . He relied on both LAW DATE on ORG and the CARDINAL LAW between GPE and GPE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . It found that the decision of DATE was an interim decision pending a final decision in divorce proceedings . It could be modified by the judge who had made it at any time , as indeed it had been modified on DATE , and could not be appealed against . That decision was therefore not a decision rendered in civil matters within the meaning of LAW of LAW , and accordingly was not enforceable in GPE . The court further held that enforcement of the decision of DATE should be refused by reference to LAW . It found that the decision of DATE was manifestly incompatible with NORP public order because it ordered that the father should have sole care of the children . NORP law did not provide for CARDINAL parent to have sole care unless the other parent had been formally stripped of his or her parental authority . Given that ORG had not been stripped of her parental authority , the decision to award sole care to the applicant was incompatible with NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE mentioned that an appeal against it could be lodged with ORG within DATE . However , the applicant never availed himself of that remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for enforcement of ORG judgment of DATE . He relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . Referring to LAW , ORG found that the judgment of DATE was incompatible with the basic principles of NORP law and public order . The judgment read as follows :", "\u201c Established case - law shows that public order in GPE is the basis of ORG and social organisation of GPE , [ and ] the violation of public order is the incompatibility with existing legal norms , social order and fundamental principles of law . Foreign court judgments violating the fundamental rights of a defendant , preventing him or her from defending his or her rights , as well as foreign court judgments whose enforcement may be in conflict with the national law of the State where they have to be enforced , are considered incompatible with public order . Reference to public order is possible when the application of a foreign law may lead to a result incompatible with NORP legal thinking .", "In the present case , the enforcement of a foreign court decision may be in conflict with NORP national law .", "In accordance with LAW , if parents and children do not have a joint place of residence their rights and obligations shall be determined in accordance with the law of the State where the children have citizenship . At a plaintiff \u2019s request , child maintenance obligations and other relationships between parents and children may be determined in accordance with the law of the State where the children permanently reside .", "By the time the ORG delivered its decision of CARDINAL DATE the children had been permanently residing in GPE for DATE ( since CARDINAL DATE ) , they are NORP nationals and have no NORP nationality . These circumstances are not disputed by the parties .", "[ The proceedings concerning residence arrangements , child maintenance and parental authority in respect of the children are ongoing before the ORG of GPE . ]", "Under these circumstances , examination of the dispute by the ORG court is incompatible with NORP law .", "Besides , the relationship between parents and children is an ongoing process , objectively it can and does change over time . As was noted above , by the time the ORG court delivered its judgment the children had been living in GPE for a long time . During this time their relationship with their parents and their perception of the possibility of living with their father could have changed , which should have been taken into consideration by the [ NORP ] court . However , the judgment [ of DATE ] indicates that the [ NORP court ] did not take these circumstances into consideration , thereby violating the children \u2019s fundamental rights under LAW of LAW on the Rights of the Child ...", "The court also takes into account that the enforcement of the PERSON court judgment might be incompatible with NORP law .", "In particular , enforcement of the foreign court decision in the present case would involve the return of the children to GPE , [ a country ] of which they are not nationals , with them being handed over to [ the applicant ] , who also does not hold NORP nationality ...", "At the same time , under LAW of GPE a national of GPE may not be expelled from the territory of GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s argument to the effect that he did not intend to bring the children back to GPE immediately and that he first wished to restore his relationship with them can not serve as grounds for granting [ his ] application [ for recognition and enforcement of the judgment of DATE ] . The court proceeds on the understanding that enforcement of the PERSON court judgment would be impossible without the children \u2019s return to GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a private complaint . Referring to Article CARDINAL of the LAW , he submitted that international treaties took precedence over national law . Under LAW of LAW the NORP courts had jurisdiction over the case , because at the time when the proceedings had been instituted he , PERSON and the children had all been permanently residing in GPE . The fact that PERSON had then abducted the children and taken them to GPE had no bearing on the jurisdiction of the NORP courts to proceed with the case . Further , referring to decisions by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the applicant argued that ORG had not indicated what basic principles of the economic , social and legal organisation of NORP society had been infringed by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Moreover , the NORP courts had no competence in relation to verifying whether that judgment was lawful and justified . The applicant also submitted that ORG had taken into account the children \u2019s wishes , and proof of this had been produced before ORG . The applicant further argued that the prohibition on deporting NORP nationals was irrelevant to the present case , because the children were not to be deported or extradited from GPE . They were to be handed over to their legal guardian and would enjoy freedom of movement , including the freedom to leave GPE . Lastly , the applicant complained under LAW that the refusal to enforce the judgment of DATE violated his right to respect for his family life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG held an appeal hearing . The parties had not been notified about the date of the appeal hearing and were therefore absent . On DATE the court upheld the decision of DATE , finding that it was lawful , well reasoned and justified . It found , in particular , that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE by ORG was incompatible with NORP public order because it was in conflict with NORP family law provisions and unacceptable in relation to NORP legal thinking .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the ORG of ORG , repeating the argument set out in his appeal submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG refused to refer the case for consideration by the ORG of that court , finding no significant violations of substantive or procedural law which could influence the outcome of the proceedings . The first - instance and appeal courts had correctly applied domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG of GPE refused to refer the case for consideration by ORG of that ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the Deputy President of ORG of GPE informed the applicant that there were no grounds to disagree with the decision of DATE , refusing to refer the case for consideration by ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged an application with ORG of GPE . Claiming domestic violence and a lack of care and financial support , and referring to the children \u2019s wish to live with her , she asked for an order stripping the applicant of his parental authority in respect of the children and determining that the children should reside with her . She also asked for child maintenance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a counterclaim , asking for an order that the children should reside with him . He submitted that ORG had unlawfully abducted the children despite the decisions by ORG that they should reside with him . Their residence with PERSON was detrimental to their psychological health . In particular , by falsely accusing him of domestic violence , PERSON had caused the children to fear their father . Moreover , she had prevented him and his relatives from seeing the children or supporting them financially . She had not taken proper care of the eldest son , who suffered from a mental disorder and needed specialist care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE declared ORG \u2019s claims inadmissible . It noted that proceedings concerning the children \u2019s residence arrangements and child maintenance were ongoing before ORG . Given that the proceedings in GPE had been initiated before the present proceedings , it was the NORP courts which had jurisdiction over the case , in accordance with LAW . Accordingly , the NORP courts had no competence to examine the case between the same parties , which was based on the same facts and had the same purpose . As regards the claim to strip the applicant of his parental authority , that claim was not part of the proceedings before the NORP courts . However , given that the applicant was a national of GPE and permanently living in GPE , the NORP courts had no competence to examine the claims against him . PERSON should therefore submit her claims to the court with territorial jurisdiction over the applicant \u2019s place of residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case for fresh consideration before ORG . It found that the present proceedings were not identical to the proceedings ongoing in GPE . In particular , the claim to strip the applicant of his parental authority had only been made in the present proceedings . PERSON was entitled to lodge her claim with a court with territorial jurisdiction over her place of residence . Given that she lived in LOC of GPE , ORG had competence to examine the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having questioned the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL older children DATE , who had all expressed their wish to live with their mother and refused to have any contact with their father , ORG decided that , pending the resolution of the proceedings , the children should reside with their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the court to determine a temporary contact arrangement for him and the children .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s application , on CARDINAL DATE the ORG decided that , pending the resolution of the proceedings , the applicant should be able to have contact with the children at the schools they attended , in the presence of and with the active involvement of a psychologist , for TIME a week with each child : on DATE after classes from TIME with the elder son ; on DATE after classes from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. with the second son ; on DATE after classes from TIME with the daughter ; and on DATE after classes from TIME with the younger son .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by the applicant , on DATE the ORG modified the interim contact arrangement between him and the children . In particular , in addition to the previously established contact TIME , the applicant was allowed to : take his second son for a walk on DATE from TIME ; pick up his daughter from extracurricular activities on DATE at TIME , have lunch with her afterwards and return her to the mother by TIME ; and take his younger son to theatres , museums and for other extracurricular activities for children DATE , for a maximum of TIME starting from TIME The applicant was also allowed to accompany the CARDINAL older children to and from school if the children agreed .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE ORG cancelled the above interim contact arrangement on the grounds that it was not in the best interests of the children . In taking that decision , the district court relied on a letter from ORG of DATE to the effect that , in circumstances where there was bitter parental conflict , meetings between children and the parent from whom they were living apart were psychologically highly traumatic for the children . The court also took into consideration the fact that the school principal firmly objected to having the meetings between the applicant and the children take place on the school LOC . Reference was made to the incident of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected both ORG and the applicant \u2019s claims in full . It found no evidence of domestic violence in respect of ORG or the children . It further found it established that , despite the applicant \u2019s wish to take care of the children and support them financially , he was being prevented from doing so by ORG There were therefore no reasons to strip him of his parental authority in respect of the children . As regards residence arrangements , the court noted that ORG had already examined similar claims and had ordered by its judgment of DATE that the children were to live with the applicant . That judgment was final and enforceable and the procedure for its enforcement in GPE was established by LAW and Article CARDINAL of LAW . All the arguments raised by the parties in the present proceedings had already been examined by ORG . The parties had not produced any new evidence which could warrant changing the residence arrangements determined by ORG . Moreover , the court had been hampered in its examination of the issue by ORG refusal to have the children examined by court - appointed experts . In the absence of a psychological expert report it was impossible to ascertain effectively the children \u2019s attachment to each of the parents , the GPE moral character and other relevant qualities , and the relationships between the children and each of the parents . Lastly , the court rejected ORG claim for child maintenance . The parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered it necessary , among other things , to question the CARDINAL older children who had reached DATE about their attitude towards each of the parents and the prospect of their living with them , and to obtain the opinion of the youngest child with the involvement of a psychologist . The hearing of DATE was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an inspection of the children \u2019s living conditions with their mother was carried out , and there was also a discussion with the applicant \u2019s youngest child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that an expert examination should be carried out so as to determine which parent the children would be most comfortable living with from an emotional perspective , with regard to the individual psychological features of the children and the parents , the relationships between them and the existing circumstances . The examination was also to determine whether it would be possible for the children to live apart from each other with CARDINAL of the parents , taking into account their psychological attachment to each other . The proceedings were adjourned pending the results of the expert examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the forensic psychological examination should be carried out by GPE The Regional Family Centre \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the report of the forensic psychological examination was drawn up . It was based on an examination of the applicant and an analysis of the case file material , since ORG had refused to take part in the examination and had not let the children be examined either . The PERSON conclusion was that the applicant was polite , communicative , sincere , easy - going , in control of his emotions , sentimental , sensitive to emotional nuances , and that he wanted friendly harmonious relationships . He had broad interests . Rudeness , hostility and a dominating attitude were not part of his character . He could easily adapt to different environments . The experts did not have sufficient material to fully assess the individual psychological features of PERSON and the children . However , on the basis of an analysis of ORG behaviour and the reports by the NORP specialists , and taking into account the ongoing conflict and the children \u2019s being in a psychotraumatic situation for a very long time , the experts recommended that ORG underwent a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric expert examination . The experts further noted that , owing to the mother \u2019s behaviour , the children had a negative image of their father , which created a substantial risk for their normal mental development . In such a situation , determining the children \u2019s place of residence in accordance with their wishes could contradict their true interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were resumed . ORG considered it necessary that the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL older sons , aged DATE and DATE , join the proceedings as third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE . It took note of the fact that on DATE the judgment of ORG of DATE had been quashed on appeal . ORG granted ORG claims in part by ordering that the children were to live with her and that the applicant was to pay her child maintenance , and granted the applicant \u2019s claims in part by determining his contact rights in respect of the children . In particular , the applicant was allowed to spend time with the children on the second and DATE of DATE from TIME on a DATE to TIME on a DATE , for TIME on the dates of the children \u2019s birthdays , during CARDINAL of the public and school holidays , and for DATE during DATE . During DATE and school holidays the applicant was allowed to travel with the children both in GPE and abroad . The remaining claims by the applicant and PERSON were dismissed . In taking that decision ORG took into consideration that : the children had been living with their mother for DATE , and they had been cared for and raised by her during this time ; while living in GPE they had acquired a circle of friends and teachers ; the material in the case file proved ORG conscientious attitude towards her parental obligations ; and the children , questioned by both the court and the childcare authority , had expressed their wish to live with their mother .", "CARDINAL . DATE a number of internet news sites published ORG account of her relationship with the applicant , their divorce and their dispute over the children . In particular , the news sites reproduced ORG accusations against the applicant , describing his alleged acts of violence against her and the children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sued the news sites and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Petrogradskiy District Court of GPE allowed the applicant \u2019s claims against CARDINAL of the news sites . On DATE the ORG of GPE allowed his claims against ORG On CARDINAL DATE ORG of GPE allowed his claims against another news site . All the district courts found that ORG and the news sites had not proved the truth of their allegations against the applicant . They noted that the NORP authorities had conducted an inquiry into ORG allegations against the applicant and had found no evidence of domestic violence . The GPE police had also conducted an inquiry which had not revealed any evidence of violent acts by the applicant against ORG or the children .
