On DATE , ORG responded as follows :", "\u201c In answer to your question about the sentencing options for Rushing , once he \u2019s extradited , first , there is NO possibility of a mandatory life sentence . In addition , there is no \u201c CARDINAL strikes \u201d rule in the federal system . There is a statutory range of DATE to life in prison ( as stated in the extradition affidavit ) ; there are also federal sentencing guidelines . Below is a brief explanation of the statute and guidelines , which are advisory only .", "Statutory Penalty : The ORG charges the defendant , ORG , with conspiracy to import and distribute hashish in violation of LAW , LAW ( a)(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( b)(CARDINAL)(A ) , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( a ) , CARDINAL(b)(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL . These statutes provide for a penalty of not DATE and not more than life in prison .", "Sentencing Guidelines : In addition , there are non - mandatory sentencing guidelines that will be relevant to the defendant \u2019s sentence . In this case , the government would anticipate , based on the facts , that the following adjustments would apply :", "Base Offense Level : The base offense level would be CARDINAL under USSG [ United States Sentencing Guidelines ] CARDINALDCARDINAL , based on the quantity of hashish .", "Leadership : The defendant would likely receive an upward adjustment of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) levels under USSG CARDINAL ) , as the defendant was an organizer and leader of a criminal activity involving CARDINAL people .", "Acceptance of Responsibility .

If he has no criminal history , his advisory guideline range would be CARDINAL to DATE in prison . If the defendant has a criminal history , his guideline range may be higher . Again , this is only suggestive .", "Other statutory factors : Other statutory factors that the court should consider under LAW , LAW , Section CARDINAL(a ) are : ( CARDINAL ) the nature and circumstances of the offenses ; ( CARDINAL ) the history and characteristics of the defendant ; ( CARDINAL ) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offenses ; ( CARDINAL ) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct ; ( CARDINAL ) the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant ; ( CARDINAL ) the need to provide the defendant with educational and vocational training , medical care , or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner ; ( CARDINAL ) the kinds of sentences available ; ( CARDINAL) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct , and ( CARDINAL ) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , the Minister approved the extradition . In his decision the Minister considered that the applicant had not demonstrated that a mandatory life sentence would be imposed upon him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant took interlocutory civil proceedings ( kort geding ) against ORG seeking an injunction on his expulsion to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the context of the hearing in the interlocutory proceedings , which had been scheduled for DATE , the ORG put fresh questions to ORG , namely :", "\u201c Rushing has CARDINAL prior convictions to his name , ( ... ) . Supposedly all CARDINAL convictions are for felony drugs offenses .", "Questions likely to be raised in the forthcoming summary proceedings :", "CARDINAL . Will the prior convictions mentioned above ( if correct ) lead to the mandatory term of life imprisonment without release ?", "CARDINAL . NORP Is such a mandatory term of life imprisonment \u2018 de jure and de facto reducible\u2019 , does it leave \u2018 any prospects of release\u2019 or does it not ? ORG in GPE ( in its NORP ruling , DATE , no . CARDINAL ) has ruled that there may be issues under LAW in the case of an irreducible sentence of life imprisonment . NORP courts have to take such rulings into consideration .", "CARDINAL . NORP Is a mandatory minimum sentence of DATE de jure and de facto reducible or not ? Since Rushing is born on DATE and now DATE , such a minimum sentence could be considered a life sentence as well . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG , on DATE , answered as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The defendant is not facing a \u201c mandatory \u201d term of life imprisonment ; rather , that is the maximum term that the ORG may order . In order for the mandatory life term to be invoked , the GPE Attorney must file an enhancement information under LAW , LAW [ ORG ] , LAW , which provides as follows : \u2018 No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of CARDINAL or more prior convictions , unless before trial , or before entry of a plea of guilty , GPE attorney files an information with the court ( and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person ) stating in writing the previous conviction to be relied ORG , GPE Attorney in this district does not file enhancement information under CARDINAL unless GPE Attorney specifically finds , after a review of the defendant \u2019s conduct and criminal history , that the mandatory sentence is merited . The information is often not filed if the matter results in a plea agreement in which the defendant accepts responsibility for his actions .", "CARDINAL . Once the sentence is imposed , it is reducible under limited circumstances , including : a ) under LAW of LAW , if within DATE of sentencing , the government moves the ORG to reduce the defendant \u2019s sentence based on the defendant \u2019s substantial assistance to the government after sentencing ; and b ) if the President grants the defendant a pardon under LAW , LAW , of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The defendant faces a mandatory term of CARDINAL ( DATE , not CARDINAL ( DATE , LAW , GPE Code , LAW ) . ORG only has authority to sentence the defendant below the DATE term under the following limited circumstances : a ) if the defendant qualifies for safety valve under LAW ( f ) and ORG [ USSG ] PERSON ( which seems unlikely in this case given the defendant \u2019s leadership role and criminal history ) ; and b ) if the defendant provides substantial assistance to the government through cooperation prior to sentencing and the government moves for a sentence reduction under USSG CARDINAL and CARDINAL U.S.C. CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG , upon receipt of the above reply , immediately requested clarification regarding the possibility of a Presidential parole .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG replied as follows :", "\u201c [ ... ] the power of a President in federal criminal cases , and the Governor in state convictions , to pardon a person convicted of a crime , commute the sentence ( shorten it , often to time already served ) , or reduce it from death to another lesser sentence . There are many reasons for exercising this power , including real doubts about the guilt of the party , apparent excessive sentence , humanitarian concerns such as illness of an aged inmate , to clear the record of someone who has demonstrated rehabilitation or public service , or because the party is a political or personal friend of the Governor . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the judge in interlocutory proceedings ( kortgedingrechter ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to stay his extradition The judge held that the applicant had not established that a mandatory life sentence would be imposed on him or that a Presidential parole was not possible . Therefore , the extradition did not constitute a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Acting President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated decided , in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , to indicate to the Government of the GPE , under LAW , that the applicant should not be extradited to the GPE until DATE . The Acting President also decided to request ORG to inform the ORG on the scope and the legally binding nature of the information supplied by the GPE authorities . They were specifically asked if they could provide clarification concerning the applicant \u2019s sentence . The Acting President further decided to give priority to the application under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted the requested information . In reaction to the ORG \u2019s questions , they had contacted the GPE authorities once more . In its relevant part , the information they had received reads as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW , LAW , Section CARDINAL(a ) , the sentencing court must consider \u2018 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u2019 The highest sentence served to date in this case was DATE in prison and the lowest sentence was DATE in jail . In the case of the CARDINAL-year sentence , that sentence had originally been DATE , which was a mandatory sentence under LAW . By virtue of a ruling by ORG , however , the Sentencing Guidelines are now only advisory , which should ensure to Mr Rushing \u2019s benefit . Most recently , in DATE , the court sentenced co - defendant PERSON to DATE in prison . Mr PERSON \u2019s case had notable similarities to Mr Rushing \u2019s : both men were leaders and organizers in the same conspiracy and both men transferred large sums of money . In addition , both men were fugitives for DATE . Of course , the cases were also different in some respects . Nonetheless , as noted above , under CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL(a ) , the sentencing judge must consider sentencing disparity when sentencing Mr Rushing . Since the highest sentence to date was DATE in prison and the lowest was DATE in jail , a sentence of life in prison would be a significant leap for the court to make .", "Title CARDINAL , United States Code , Section CARDINAL(b)(CARDINAL)(A ) provides for a sentence of \u2018 not DATE or more than life\u2019 . The decision on the term of imprisonment is not within the government \u2019s discretion but rather with the court \u2019s discretion . ORG set the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for this offense and we are bound to follow the statute . In some circumstances , the parties may conclude a plea agreement under LAW ( C)(CARDINAL)(c ) in which the parties agree that \u2018 a particular sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition ... [and ] such a recommendation or request binds the court , once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u2019 In this instance , however , the court can not accept a plea agreement until the defendant is in the district , so this is not an option . Furthermore , there is nothing in the record to suggest that an CARDINAL(C)(CARDINAL)(c ) binding plea would be appropriate in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
