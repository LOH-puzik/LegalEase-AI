His relationship with his wife , whom he married in DATE , was turbulent and came under great strain in DATE when he became unemployed . In the early evening of DATE , she told him that for DATE she had been thinking of leaving him and that she regarded the marriage as over . Prior to that date they had been sleeping separately - according to the applicant , for TIME , or according to his wife , for DATE . The applicant did not accept that his wife meant what she said and they had a row following which he ejected her from the house , bruising her arm . She went to her next door neighbours and called the police , who subsequently visited and spoke to both the applicant and his wife separately . Later the same evening she re - entered the house and the applicant had sexual intercourse with her . Shortly afterwards she left the house , having first tried to take their child with her . She went to the neighbours crying and distressed , complaining to them and to the police , whom she telephoned , that she had been raped at knife - point .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant was charged with rape , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ; threatening to kill , contrary to section CARDINAL of the Offences against LAW ; and assault occasioning actual bodily harm , in breach of section CARDINAL of the latter Act .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the defendant in another case , NORP v. NORP , had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment by ORG for attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife . The trial judge , PERSON Justice PERSON , had rejected the defendant \u2019s submission that he could not be convicted in light of a common law principle stated by Sir PERSON in his History of the Pleas of the Crown published in DATE :", "\" But the husband can not be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife , for by their matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband , which she can not retract . \"", "In his judgment ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , CARDINAL ) Mr Justice PERSON noted that it was a statement made in general terms at a time when marriage was indissoluble . PERSON CJ had been expounding the common law as it seemed to him at that particular time and was doing it in a book and not with reference to a particular set of circumstances presented to him in a prosecution . The bald statement had been reproduced in the first edition of GPE on Criminal Pleadings , Evidence and Practice ( DATE , p. CARDINAL ) in the following terms : \" A husband also can not be guilty of rape upon his wife . \"", "Mr Justice PERSON further examined a series of court decisions ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG DATE ] All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; PERSON O\u2019Brien [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] Criminal Law Reports CARDINAL ; see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , recognising that a wife \u2019s consent to marital intercourse was impliedly given by her at the time of marriage and that the consent could be revoked on certain conditions . He added :", "\" I am asked to accept that there is a presumption or an implied consent by the wife to sexual intercourse with her husband ; with that , I do not find it difficult to agree . However , I find it hard to ... believe that it ever was the common law that a husband was in effect entitled to beat his wife into submission to sexual intercourse ...", "If it was , it is a very sad commentary on the law and a very sad commentary upon the judges in whose breasts the law is said to reside . However , I will nevertheless accept that there is such an implicit consent as to sexual intercourse which requires my consideration as to whether this accused may be convicted for rape . \"", "On the question of what circumstances would suffice in law to revoke the consent , PERSON Justice PERSON noted that it may be brought to an end , firstly , by a court order or equivalent . Secondly , he observed , it was apparent from ORG judgment in the case of PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties . Such an agreement could clearly be implicit ; there was nothing in the case - law to suggest the contrary . Thirdly , he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation , accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated , would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent . He concluded that both the second and third exceptions to the matrimonial immunity against prosecution for rape applied in the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG An appeal to ORG , was dismissed on DATE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Lord PERSON noted that the general proposition of Sir PERSON in his History of the Pleas of the Crown ( DATE ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that a man could not commit rape upon his wife was generally accepted as a correct statement of the common law at that epoch . Further , PERSON made an analysis of previous court decisions , from which it appears that in NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) , the first reported case of this nature , some judges of ORG for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle . In the next reported case , NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) , the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband \u2019s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him . Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG had accepted in PERSON ( DATE ) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement . This was confirmed by ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) , where it held that the lack of a non - molestation clause in a deed of separation , concluded on expiry of a non - molestation order , did not revive the consent to intercourse .", "Lord PERSON added the following observations :", "\" Ever since the decision of PERSON in NORP v. PERSON in DATE , courts have been paying lip - service to PERSON proposition , whilst at the same time increasing the number of exceptions , the number of situations to which it does not apply . This is a legitimate use of the flexibility of the common law which can and should adapt itself to changing social attitudes .", "There comes a time when the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting the effect of the proposition , a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded DATE as acceptable behaviour .", "...", "It seems to us that where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in DATE society , the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so in the light of any relevant parliamentary enactment . That in the end comes down to a consideration of the word \u2018 unlawful\u2019 in LAW . \"", "Lord PERSON then critically examined the different strands of interpretation of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in the case - law , including the argument that the term \" unlawful \" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape . He concluded :", "\" ... [ W]e do not consider that we are inhibited by LAW from declaring that the husband \u2019s immunity as expounded by PERSON no longer exists . We take the view that the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law , irrespective of his relationship with his victim .", "The remaining and no less difficult question is whether , despite that view , this is an area where the court should step aside to leave the matter to the parliamentary process . This is not the creation of a new offence , it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it .", "Had our decision been otherwise and had we been of the opinion that PERSON proposition was still effective , we would nevertheless have ruled that where , as in the instant case , a wife withdraws from cohabitation in such a way as to make it clear to the husband that so far as she is concerned the marriage is at an end , the husband \u2019s immunity is lost . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , on a further appeal by the appellant in the above case , ORG upheld ORG judgment , declaring , inter alia , that the general principle that a husband can not rape his wife no longer formed part of the law of GPE and GPE . It stressed that the common law was capable of evolving in the light of changing social , economic and cultural developments . Whilst Sir PERSON \u2019s proposition had reflected the state of affairs at the time it was enunciated , the status of women , and particularly of married women , had changed out of all recognition in various ways . Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies , CARDINAL of the most important changes had been that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals , and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband ( NORP v. NORP [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the above appellant NORP brought an application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to the GPE . The ORG referred his application ( GPE v. GPE ) to ORG on DATE as the present case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the commencement of his trial on DATE , the applicant submitted that there was no case to answer on the rape charge . In the first place , he argued that the trial judge , Mr Justice Rose , should follow ORG approach in the case of PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) and should not consider himself bound by the DATE judgment of that court in NORP v. NORP in so far as it purported to change the principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife . Secondly , he maintained that the retrospective effect of the change in the law effected by NORP v. NORP should be pronounced incompatible with LAW . He referred , inter alia , to the judgment by ORG of ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( ORG Reports [ DATE CARDINAL ) , dealing with a penal provision in relation to fishing , which was allegedly imposed retroactively .", "CARDINAL . ORG With regard to the applicant \u2019s first submission , Mr Justice PERSON held on DATE that he considered himself bound by ORG judgment in NORP v. NORP He was not persuaded that there was a conflict between the ratios of that decision and the judgment in NORP v. PERSON . Moreover , the decision in NORP v. NORP was not reached in ignorance of NORP v. PERSON but had regard to the latter .", "With regard to the applicant \u2019s second submission , Mr Justice PERSON observed :", "\" ... I shall assume for the purpose of the present argument that the effect of PERSON is via LAW and the decision of the [ Court of Justice of ORG ] to render Article CARDINAL para .

Non - consensual sexual intercourse is in LANGUAGE law , as no doubt it is in the legal systems of many civilised nations , ... a criminal offence . In so far as there was by DATE in LANGUAGE law ... a matrimonial exception , that matrimonial exception has , particularly over DATE , been whittled away by judicial decision to the extent that ... it no longer exists . It seems to me that to say that in these circumstances this defendant is in the terms of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) at risk of conviction in relation to conduct \u2018 which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was ORG is or would be an abuse of language . Accordingly , [ counsel for the applicant \u2019s ] second submission fails ... Having regard to the conclusions which I have reached ... there is , in my judgment , a case to answer . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant was found guilty by the jury of all CARDINAL offences ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . He was sentenced to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment : DATE for rape , DATE for making a threat to kill and DATE for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm - the sentences of DATE and DATE were expressed to run consecutively to each other but concurrently with the DATE sentence .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Until the case of NORP v. NORP the LANGUAGE courts , on the few occasions when they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly , had always recognised at least some form of immunity attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage . The proposition of Sir PERSON quoted above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) has been reaffirmed until recently , for example in the case of PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) , which concerned the question whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault . Mr Justice PERSON , giving the judgment of the court , stated , obiter :", "\" It is clear , well - settled and ancient law that a man can not , as actor , be guilty of rape upon his wife . \"", "And he went on to say that that principle was", "\" dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi , by a separation order or , in certain circumstances , by a separation agreement \" .", "In another example , Lord ORG O\u2019Connor in the NORP v. PERSON case ( [ DATE ] Criminal Law Reports CARDINAL ) held :", "\" The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she can not unilaterally withdraw it . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG However , on DATE , Mr Justice PERSON held in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) that the whole concept of marital exemption in rape was misconceived :", "\" Were it not for the deeply unsatisfactory consequence of reaching any other conclusion on the point , I would shrink , if sadly , from adopting this radical view of the true position in law . But adopt it I do . Logically , I regard it as the only defensible stance , certainly now as the law has developed and arrived in DATE . In my judgment , the position in law DATE is , as already declared in GPE , that there is no marital exemption to the law of rape . That is the ruling I give . \"", "On the other hand , on DATE , in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) Mr Justice PERSON upheld the general common law rule , considering that the effect of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW was that the marital exemption embodied in PERSON \u2019s proposition was preserved , subject to those exceptions established by cases decided before the LAW was passed . He further stated :", "\" ... there is an important general principle to be considered here , and that is that the law , especially the criminal law , should be clear so that a man may know where he stands in relation to it . I am not being so fanciful as to suppose that this defendant carefully considered the authorities and took Counsel \u2019s advice before behaving as alleged , but the basic principle extends a long way beyond the bounds of this case and should operate to prevent a man being convicted by means of decisions of the law ex post facto . \"", "On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON in NORP v. PERSON followed PERSON , though he considered that it was open to judges to define further exceptions . Both PERSON and PERSON stated that they regretted that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of the DATE Act precluded them from taking the same line as PERSON in NORP v. C.", "CARDINAL . ORG In its ORG within Marriage \" completed on CARDINAL DATE , ORG stated :", "\" CARDINAL.CARDINAL It is generally accepted that , subject to exceptions ( considered ... below ) , a husband can not be convicted of raping his wife ...

The limits of this law are difficult to state with certainty . Much of it rests on first instance decisions which have never been comprehensively reviewed at appellate level ... \"", "ORG identified the following exceptions to a husband \u2019s immunity :", "- where a court order has been made , in particular :", "( a ) where an order of the court has been made which provides that a wife should no longer be bound to cohabit with her husband ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) ;", "( b ) where there has been a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi of divorce on the ground that \" between the pronouncement of decree nisi and the obtaining of a decree absolute a marriage subsists as a mere technicality \" ( NORP v. O\u2019Brien [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) where a court has issued an injunction restraining the husband from molesting the wife or the husband has given an undertaking to the court that he will not molest her ( NORP v.

PERSON ( [ DATE ] Criminal Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG found that where a non - molestation order of DATE had been made in favour of the wife her deemed consent to intercourse did not revive on expiry of the order ;", "- where no court order has been made :", "( e ) Mr Justice PERSON observed , obiter , in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Division CARDINAL ) that a wife \u2019s consent would be revoked by an agreement to separate , particularly if it contained a non - molestation clause ;", "( f ) Lord Justice PERSON stated , obiter , in NORP v. PERSON that a separation agreement with a non - cohabitation clause would have that effect .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it was stated in PERSON and endorsed by ORG in PERSON that lodging a petition for divorce would not be sufficient .", "It referred also to the ruling by PERSON Justice PERSON in the case of NORP v. NORP where an implied agreement to separate was considered sufficient to revoke the immunity and that , even in the absence of agreement , the withdrawal from cohabitation by either party , accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated , would operate to exclude the immunity . It found this view difficult to reconcile with the approach in PERSON that filing a divorce petition was \" clearly \" not sufficient . The ruling in NORP v. NORP appeared substantially to extend what had previously been thought to be the law , although it emphasised that factual separation , and not mere revocation of consent to intercourse , was necessary to remove the immunity .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that its inquiry was unusual in CARDINAL important respect . It was usual practice , when considering the reform of common law rules , to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law , in order to analyse whether those grounds were well - founded . However , that step was of little assistance here , not only because there was little case - law on the subject but also , and in particular , because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported ( paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ) . The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife \u2019s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir PERSON in his dictum . This notion was not only quite artificial but , certainly in the modern context , was also quite anomalous . Indeed , it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable . The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The concept of deemed consent was artificial because the legal consequences of marriage were not the result of the parties\u2019 mutual agreement . Although the parties should have legal capacity to enter into the marriage contract and should observe the necessary formalities , they were not free to decide the terms of the contract ; marriage was rather a status from which flow certain rights or obligations , the contents of which were determined by the law from time to time . This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice PERSON in NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) when he said : \" The intercourse which takes place between husband and wife after marriage is not by virtue of any special consent on her part , but is mere submission to an obligation imposed on her by law \" ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "In this connection , ORG stressed that \" [ CARDINAL rights and duties arising from marriage have , however , changed over DATE as the law has adapted to changing social conditions and values . The more modern view of marriage is that it is a partnership of equals \" ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It then gave examples of such changes in the law and added :", "\" CARDINAL This gradual recognition of mutual rights and obligations within marriage , described in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL above , in our view demonstrates clearly that , whatever other arguments there may be in favour of the immunity , it can not be claimed to be in any way justified by the nature of , or by the law governing , modern marriage . \"", "CARDINAL .
