GPE ( decision of DATE ) , where the applicant had alleged that her common - law husband and father of her CARDINAL children had been physically abusing and threatening her from DATE onwards , ORG directed GPE to take measures \u201c to guarantee the physical and mental integrity of the applicant and her family \u201d , as well as to ensure that she was provided with a safe place of residence to live with her children , and that she received child support , legal assistance and compensation in proportion to the harm sustained and the violation of her rights . ORG also made several general recommendations to GPE on improving the protection of women against domestic violence , such as establishing effective investigative , legal and judicial processes , and increasing treatment and support resources .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. GPE ( decision of DATE ) , which concerned the killing of PERSON by her husband , ORG found that ORG had breached its due diligence obligation to protect PERSON . It therefore concluded that ORG had violated its obligations under LAW ) to ( f ) , and LAW read in conjunction with LAW PERSON and ORG . CARDINAL of ORG and the corresponding rights of the deceased PERSON to life and to physical and mental integrity .", "CARDINAL . ORG on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( DATE ) , in its LAW ) , urges GPE to \u201c exercise due diligence to prevent , investigate and , in accordance with national legislation , punish acts of violence against women , whether those acts are perpetrated by the ORG or private persons \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In his third report , of DATE , to ORG ( E / CN.CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the special rapporteur on violence against women considered that there is a rule of customary international law that \u201c obliges GPE to prevent and respond to acts of violence against women with due diligence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of DATE on the protection of women against violence , ORG stated , inter alia , that member GPE should introduce , develop and/or improve where necessary national policies against violence based on maximum safety and protection of victims , support and assistance , adjustment of the criminal and civil law , raising of public awareness , training for professionals confronted with violence against women , and prevention .", "CARDINAL . ORG recommended , in particular , that member States should penalise serious violence against women such as sexual violence and rape , abuse of the vulnerability of pregnant , defenceless , ill , disabled or dependent victims , as well as penalising abuse of position by the perpetrator . The Recommendation also stated that member States should ensure that all victims of violence are able to institute proceedings , make provisions to ensure that criminal proceedings can be initiated by the public prosecutor , encourage prosecutors to regard violence against women as an aggravating or decisive factor in deciding whether or not to prosecute in the public interest , ensure where necessary that measures are taken to protect victims effectively against threats and possible acts of revenge and take specific measures to ensure that children \u2019s rights are protected during proceedings .", "CARDINAL . With regard to violence within the family , ORG recommended that member States should classify all forms of violence within the family as criminal offences and envisage the possibility of taking measures in order , inter alia , to enable the judiciary to adopt interim measures aimed at protecting victims , to ban the perpetrator from contacting , communicating with or approaching the victim , or residing in or entering defined areas , to penalise all breaches of the measures imposed on the perpetrator and to establish a compulsory protocol for operation by the police , medical and social services .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. GPE , ORG stated :", "\u201c An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to a ORG ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the ORG , not because of an act itself , but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The legal basis for the ultimate attribution of responsibility to a ORG for private acts relies on ORG failure to comply with the duty to ensure human rights protection , as set out in LAW . ORG case - law reflects this principle by repeatedly holding States internationally responsible on account of their lack of due diligence to prevent human rights violations , to investigate and sanction perpetrators or to provide appropriate reparations to their families .", "CARDINAL . The Inter - American Convention on the Prevention , Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women DATE ( the GPE do NORP Convention ) sets out States\u2019 duties relating to the eradication of gender - based violence . It is the only multilateral human rights treaty to deal solely with violence against women .", "CARDINAL . ORG adopts ORG approach to the attribution of ORG responsibility for the acts and omissions of private individuals . In the case of PERSON v. GPE , the Commission found that the ORG \u2019s failure to exercise due diligence to prevent and investigate a domestic violence complaint warranted a finding of ORG responsibility under LAW and the GPE do NORP Convention . Furthermore , GPE had violated the rights of the applicant and failed to carry out its duty ( inter alia , under LAW , obliging GPE to condemn all forms of violence against women ) , as a result of its failure to act and its tolerance of the violence inflicted . Specifically , the Commission held that :", "\u201c ... tolerance by the State organs is not limited to this case ; rather , it is a pattern . The condoning of this situation by the entire system only serves to perpetuate the psychological , social , and historical roots and factors that sustain and encourage violence against women .", "Given the fact that the violence suffered by PERSON is part of a general pattern of negligence and lack of effective action by the ORG in prosecuting and convicting aggressors , it is the view of the ORG that this case involves not only failure to fulfil the obligation with respect to prosecute and convict , but also the obligation to prevent these degrading practices . That general and discriminatory judicial ineffectiveness also creates a climate that is conducive to domestic violence , since society sees no evidence of willingness by the ORG , as the representative of the society , to take effective action to sanction such acts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL member GPE of ORG , namely in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the authorities are required to continue criminal proceedings despite the victim \u2019s withdrawal of complaint in cases of domestic violence .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL member GPE , namely in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the authorities have a margin of discretion in deciding whether to pursue criminal proceedings against perpetrators of domestic violence . A significant number of legal systems make a distinction between crimes which are privately prosecutable ( and for which the victim \u2019s complaint is a prerequisite ) and those which are publicly prosecutable ( usually more serious offences for which prosecution is considered to be in the public interest ) .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the legislation and practice of the above - mentioned CARDINAL countries that the decision on whether to proceed where the victim withdraws his / her complaint lies within the discretion of the prosecuting authorities , which primarily take into account the public interest in continuing criminal proceedings . In some jurisdictions , such as GPE and GPE , in deciding whether to pursue criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of domestic violence the prosecuting authorities ( ORG ) are required to consider certain factors , including : the seriousness of the offence ; whether the victim \u2019s injuries are physical or psychological ; if the defendant used a weapon ; if the defendant has made any threats since the attack ; if the defendant planned the attack ; the effect ( including psychological ) on any children living in the household ; the chances of the defendant offending again ; the continuing threat to the health and safety of the victim or anyone else who was , or could become , involved ; the current state of the victim \u2019s relationship with the defendant ; the effect on that relationship of continuing with the prosecution against the victim \u2019s wishes ; the history of the relationship , particularly if there was any other violence in the past ; and the defendant \u2019s criminal history , particularly any previous violence . Direct reference is made to the need to strike a balance between the victim \u2019s and any children \u2019s LAW in deciding on a course of action .", "CARDINAL . GPE seems to be the only ORG which bases the continuance of criminal proceedings entirely , and in all circumstances , on the wishes / complaints of the victim .", "CARDINAL . According to this report , PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraph DATE above ) is not yet being fully implemented . In DATE there has been an increase in \u201c protection orders \u201d or injunctions issued by family courts . However , some courts , in response to applications made to them by women in mortal danger , are still setting hearings DATE . Under these circumstances , judges and prosecutors treat an action under PERSON no . CARDINAL as if it were a form of divorce action , whereas the point of the PERSON is to take urgent action on behalf of women who are seeking to protect their own lives . Once the injunction has been issued , women are confronted with a number of problems with its implementation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE before the report was released approximately CARDINAL women applied to ORG and made great efforts to use PERSON no . CARDINAL , but of this number CARDINAL succeeded . ORG has identified serious problems with the implementation of PERSON no . CARDINAL . In particular , it was observed that domestic violence is still treated with tolerance at police stations , and that some police officers try to act as arbitrators , or take the side of the male , or suggest that the woman drop her complaint . There are also serious problems in serving the injunction issued by a court under PERSON no . CARDINAL on the husband . In the case of a number of women wishing to work with ORG , injunctions were not implemented because their husbands were police officers or had friendly relations with officers at the police station in question .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , there are unreasonable delays in issuing injunctions by the courts . This results from the attitude of the courts in treating domestic violence complaints as a form of divorce action . It is considered that behind such delays lies a suspicion that women might be making such applications when they have not suffered violence . The allegations that women abuse PERSON no . CARDINAL are not correct . Since the economic burden of the home lies PERCENT with men , it would be impossible for women to request implementation of PERSON no . CARDINAL unless they were confronted with mortal danger . Finally , the injunctions at issue are generally narrow in scope or are not extended by the courts .", "CARDINAL . According to this report , a culture of violence has developed in GPE and violence is tolerated in many areas of life . A survey of legal actions at a magistrate \u2019s court dealing with civil matters ( sulh hukuk mahkemesi ) and CARDINAL civil courts ( asliye hukuk mahkemesi ) in ORG identified CARDINAL actions brought under PERSON no . CARDINAL from the date on which the PERSON entered into force in DATE until DATE . In CARDINAL of these cases , the court ordered various measures , while in the remaining CARDINAL actions the court held that there were no grounds for making an order , or dismissed the action , or ruled that it lacked jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Despite the importance of the problem of domestic violence , very few applications have been made under the said PERSON , because either the public is not generally aware of it or the level of confidence in the security forces is very low in the region . The most important problems were caused by the delay in issuing injunctions and the authorities\u2019 failure to monitor the implementation of injunctions .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the negative attitude of police officers at police stations towards victims of domestic violence is one of the obstacles preventing women from using this Law . Women who go to police stations because they are subjected to domestic violence are confronted with attitudes which tend to regard the problem as a private family matter into which the police are reluctant to interfere .", "CARDINAL . NORP This report makes recommendations to improve the implementation of Law no . CARDINAL and to enhance the protection of victims of domestic violence .", "CARDINAL . This statistical information report was prepared following interviews conducted with CARDINAL women . It appears that all of the complainants were subjected to psychological violence and PERCENT were subjected to physical violence . The highest number of victims is in the CARDINAL age group ( PERCENT ) . PERCENT of these women are married . The majority of victims are illiterate or of a low level of education . PERCENT of the women are of NORP origin . PERCENT of the victims who called the emergency helpline are from ORG . PERCENT of the victims have no independent source of income .", "CARDINAL . According to this report , statistical information about the extent of violence against women in GPE is limited and unreliable . Nonetheless , it appears that a culture of domestic violence has placed women in double jeopardy , both as victims of violence and because they are denied effective access to justice . Women from vulnerable groups , such as those from low - income families or who are fleeing conflict or natural disasters , are particularly at risk . In this connection , it was found that crimes against women in south - east GPE have gone largely unpunished .", "CARDINAL . It was noted that women \u2019s rights defenders struggle to combat community attitudes , which are tolerant of violence against women and are frequently shared by judges , senior government officials and opinion leaders in society . Even after legislative reforms have removed the legal authorisation for discriminatory treatment , attitudes that pressure women to conform to certain codes of behaviour restrict women \u2019s life choices .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report states that at every level of the criminal justice system the authorities fail to respond promptly or rigorously to women \u2019s complaints of rape , sexual assault or other violence within the family . The police are reluctant to prevent and investigate family violence , including the violent deaths of women . Prosecutors refuse to open investigations into cases involving domestic violence or to order protective measures for women at risk from their family or community . The police and courts do not ensure that men , who are served with court orders , including protection orders , comply with them . They accord them undue leniency in sentencing , on the grounds of \u201c provocation \u201d by their victim and on the flimsiest of evidence .", "CARDINAL . There are many barriers facing women who need access to justice and protection from violence . Police officers often believe that their duty is to encourage women to return home and \u201c make peace \u201d and fail to investigate the women \u2019s complaints . Many women , particularly in rural areas , are unable to make formal complaints , because leaving their neighbourhoods subjects them to intense scrutiny , criticism and , in some cases , violence .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , although some courts appear to have begun implementing the reforms , the discretion accorded to the courts continues to accord the perpetrators of domestic violence unwarranted leniency . Sentences in such cases are still frequently reduced at the discretion of the judges , who continue to take into account the \u201c severe provocation \u201d of the offence to custom , tradition or honour .", "CARDINAL . Finally , this report makes a number of recommendations to the NORP government and to community and religious authorities with a view to addressing the problem of domestic violence .", "CARDINAL . NORP This report was prepared in order to look into the judicial dimensions of the phenomenon of so - called \u201c honour crimes \u201d . A survey was carried out of judgments in cases before the FAC assize courts and children \u2019s courts . The purpose of the survey was to identify the proportion of such unlawful killings referred to the courts , the judiciary \u2019s attitude to them , the GPE lines of defence in these cases , the role of social structure ( that is , family councils and custom ) and the reasons for the murders . To that end , cases in the ORG assize courts and children \u2019s courts DATE were examined . In DATE , CARDINAL cases were identified in which a judgment was given . In these cases , there were CARDINAL victims / persons killed , and CARDINAL people were tried as defendants .", "CARDINAL . According to the researchers , in cases where the victim / person killed was male , it was observed that defendants claimed , in their defence , that the victim / person killed had raped , sexually assaulted , or abducted a relative of the defendant , or had attempted to draw a relative of the defendant into prostitution . In cases where the victim / person killed was a woman , defendants alleged , in their defence , that the victim / person killed had been talking to other men , had taken up prostitution , or had committed adultery . In CARDINAL of the judgments , mitigating provisions concerning unjustified provocation were applied .
