He claimed that , even before his CARDINALth birthday in DATE , he had incurred extra costs due to his illness , PERSON , from which he had suffered since the DATE 's and which had been diagnosed in DATE . In support of his claim , he submitted :", "A medical certificate dated DATE , produced by the applicant 's general practitioner , Doctor PERSON , at the applicant 's request , supporting his application for disability benefits . It stated that the doctor had known and treated the applicant since DATE , and that the PERSON - Marie - Tooth disease had started in DATE involving difficulties in walking , problems of balance , dragging of the feet and the patient tripping over and falling continuously . The muscles in the legs and feet had considerably withered . The illness had attacked even the hands and arms , with withered muscles and reduced strength in the fingers . Because of multiple inconveniences , the patient 's functional capacity had been strongly reduced ; he needed help for heavier household tasks , the preparation of meals , the purchase of household goods , carrying heavier objects , and for personal hygiene . The patient had incurred extra costs for medical treatment , foot rails , soft shoes , home assistance , and to some extent his food budget because of a limited ability to prepare meals ; he also had to pay for the transportation service for disabled persons , and extra travel by personal car , because of his considerably reduced ability to walk .", "A statement of DATE by Doctor PERSON , reproducing extracts from the applicant 's medical records for the period DATE , with a diagnosis of the PERSON disease in DATE ;", "A statement dated DATE by PERSON , Professor and Doctor of ORG , ORG , which concluded :", "\u201c I quite agree that the diagnosis here is PERSON disease . The clinical findings and the nerve conduction studies indicate that it can be classified as type II hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy . He does show some minor pyramidal signs in the legs , which may be associated . I have explained to PERSON that although his symptoms may continue slowly to deteriorate , this is unlikely ever to become a very serious incapacity so that he becomes unable to walk . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan -hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE rejected the application , finding that the applicant 's disability had not reached the level required under LAW , section CARDINAL before DATE . CARDINAL member reserved his position , considering that the applicant 's need for assistance before turning DATE should be investigated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by a lawyer , appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and requested that an oral hearing be held in his case because he wished to call as witnesses his personal doctor , the doctor appointed by the ORG and all the members of the ORG who had participated in the decision of his case .", "On DATE ORG refused the request with reference to section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL - hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Its decision contained the following reasoning :", "\u201c Written material , which includes inter alia medical certificates and extracts from [ the applicant 's ] medical journal , a multitude of submissions and other documents sent by [ the applicant ] as well as the diary notes made during the processing of the case before [ the ORG ] ... , are available in the case . There are no uncertainties as regards , at least , the basis for the medical assessment . The uncertainty regarding [ the applicant 's ] extra costs due to his disability at DATE can be clarified satisfactorily by [ him ] in writing . According to the documents , [ the applicant 's ] requests and reasons therefore are clearly defined , as are the submissions by the respondent . Nor has [ the applicant ] pointed to circumstances which would benefit from being orally presented by him . Thus , there is no reason to assume that an oral hearing could add anything meaningful . ORG therefore considers an oral hearing to be unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect . ... \u201d", "ORG invited the applicant to mention any further circumstances he wished to invoke and to submit his final written observations in the case within DATE . In response he reiterated his request for an oral hearing , relying on LAW . He argued that the medical certificates needed to be clarified and that a witness account by his personal doctor would be important in order to establish the exact level of support that he had required at DATE . He also submitted that the members of the ORG should have been asked to give evidence about their precise reasons for refusing his request .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal on the grounds that the medical and other evidence in the case showed that , even before he had reached DATE , he had for a considerable time been functionally impaired , but not to such a degree that , on an assessment of the overall need of assistance , he was entitled to disability benefit . The court noted that the applicant had \u201c commented \u201d ( yttrat sig ) on its rejection of his request for an oral hearing , but did not respond to his renewed request or his reasons invoked therein . In reaching this decision ORG took note of a breakdown of additional costs allegedly caused by his disability , QUANTITY , which the applicant had initially submitted to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the lower court 's judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) requesting it to quash the judgment and refer the case back for fresh examination . In the alternative , he requested the appellate court to find that he was entitled to disability benefits at a level corresponding to PERCENT of the basic amount as of DATE . He further requested that the court hold an oral hearing , on the same grounds as those he had presented to the lower court . He submitted that , by refusing to hold an oral hearing , the latter had breached LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected his request for an oral hearing , finding this unnecessary for determining whether to grant him leave to appeal , and gave him DATE to complete his submissions in writing . The applicant made further submissions and maintained his request for an oral hearing . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected his renewed request for an oral hearing and refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , observing that it did not normally hold oral hearings , rejected the applicant 's request for a hearing and gave him DATE within which to submit additional written observations . On DATE it refused him leave to appeal .", "In this connection the applicant was given a copy of an analysis presented to ORG by its legal secretary , which included an opinion to the effect that ORG refusal to hold a hearing was not deemed incompatible with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW ( as in force until DATE , when the DATE LAW ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force ) , a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses . The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to the guidelines of ORG ( Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket ; hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance . In DATE the basic amount was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . In DATE , when the applicant turned DATE , it was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( as in force at the material time ) , such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of PERCENT , PERCENT or PERCENT of the basic amount , depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability .", "CARDINAL . A decision by ORG under LAW could form the subject of an appeal to ORG , to ORG and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings shall be in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing ( I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas , om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det ) \u201d .", "Under those circumstances it was not possible for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . From the case - law of the national courts , it appears that the grounds stated in the third paragraph of section CARDINAL for refusing an oral hearing have been interpreted as being alternative rather than cumulative ( see PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the preparatory work to LAW , an oral hearing could be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and could benefit the examination of a case , in particular in CARDINAL situations : firstly , when it was necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it was difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case needed to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a supplement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party 's request for an oral hearing should be given close consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing was necessary was to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . However , other circumstances could be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party 's understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case was of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the value of what was at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p.
