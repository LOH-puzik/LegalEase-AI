The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He works for \u201c ORG \u201d , an organisation which provides legal help to persons in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant underwent an operation to drain fluid from his liver . He was released from hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested by ORG on suspicion of fraud and was placed in detention at the LOC police station . He alleged that he was suspended from an iron bar and beaten with machine guns and rubber truncheons and that the beating re - opened his surgical wound . He was placed in a small cell in the police station , without a bed , mattress or blankets and without access to a toilet or washing facilities , where he had to sleep on the concrete floor . He was seen by a doctor on DATE , who observed that the applicant 's surgical wound had reopened and recommended that he be admitted to hospital immediately . However , police officer ORG refused a transfer to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to prison no . CARDINAL , where he was placed into the medical treatment unit with the diagnosis \u201c post - surgery state \u201d ( see further GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . According to medical reports , on DATE the applicant swallowed a nail and was hospitalised in order to extract it . According to medical evidence , during DATE the applicant underwent CARDINAL operations made necessary by acts of self - harm , such as swallowing sharp objects and cutting himself ( see Ciorap v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a number of complaints in respect of his alleged ill - treatment by the police , the failure to give him medical treatment and the inhuman conditions of detention . The prosecutor opened a criminal investigation and interviewed the applicant , the police officers involved and their colleagues , as well as the medical personnel who had examined the applicant during his arrest . The doctors confirmed that they had been called twice to attend the applicant on TIME of his arrest but that this had been in connection with a post - surgery problem . The prosecutor found that the applicant had made no complaint of ill - treatment when examined by the doctors or by the superior police officers ( see GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . All the applicant 's complaints were dismissed as unfounded . This decision was confirmed by the investigating judge on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG found that on DATE and DATE the applicant had been informed of the prosecutor 's decision to reject his request for the initiation of a criminal investigation into his alleged torture in DATE . He was also informed of his right to challenge that decision in court within DATE of the date on which he was informed of it . However , the applicant did not challenge that decision until DATE , without having asked for an extension of the time - limit . The court therefore rejected his complaint for failure to challenge the prosecutor 's decision within the time - limit provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant initiated new court proceedings against the LOC police station , ORG and ORG , claiming compensation for the damage caused to him through his ill - treatment upon his arrest on DATE , the failure to give him medical treatment while in detention and the inhuman conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected his claims as unfounded . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and partly accepted the applicant 's claims . The court found that the documents in the file established that police officer PERSON had refused to allow the applicant to be treated in hospital even though an urgent examination by a surgeon had been recommended by the doctor who saw the applicant on DATE . The court also found that the applicant had been detained at LOC police station in conditions that breached the requirements of domestic law . In particular , the PERSON on preventive arrest ( no . CARDINAL-XIII , DATE ) required that individuals detained pre - trial had a minimum of QUANTITY of cell space , access to daylight and fresh air , access to a toilet in sanitary conditions not degrading human dignity , access to a shower once DATE and access to a bed with bed linen . The court referred to a letter from ORG which acknowledged that at the time of the applicant 's detention LOC police station had been insufficiently equipped to offer appropriate conditions of detention , including proper ventilation . The court awarded the applicant CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( QUANTITY ( ORG ) at the time ) for non - pecuniary damage caused . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the applicant 's appeal in cassation and partly quashed the lower court 's judgment . The court confirmed the findings of ORG concerning the failure to give the applicant required medical treatment and to provide the applicant with adequate conditions of detention . In reaching this conclusion , the court referred to LAW judgments such as GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . The court added that while there was no domestic legislation giving the applicant a right to compensation , the ORG should be applied directly as it was part of the domestic legal system and had precedence over domestic legislation by virtue of the express provisions of LAW . The same conclusion had been reached by ORG in a judgment of DATE . The court also relied on the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment made during its visits in DATE and DATE concerning the substandard conditions of detention in the LOC police station . The court held that the denial of medical treatment combined with the conditions of detention , which had aggravated the applicant 's medical condition , had amounted to inhuman treatment in breach of LAW . The court increased the award made to the applicant in compensation for non - pecuniary damage to MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL at the time ) and awarded him MDL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in compensation for pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again requested ORG to open a criminal investigation into his alleged ill - treatment by the police , but the prosecutor rejected the request . The applicant challenged this decision before the LOC investigating judge and subsequently ORG , which dismissed his appeal on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
