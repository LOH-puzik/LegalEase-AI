On DATE the applicant was put on a stop - list but it was noted that he was not to be deported until further instructions were received from ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , the Minister of ORG , following a meeting with ORG on DATE , decided to grant the applicant a temporary residence permit for DATE on the condition that he found a local employer who had authorisation to employ third country nationals .

His application was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE on the ground that he did not fulfil the requirements of LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In particular , ORG held that the mere fact that the applicant was an GPE from the LOC area did not mean that the applicant was in danger of persecution . In particular , ORG held that the applicant could not claim to be in danger of persecution and entitled to refugee status simply by reason of being an GPE from the LOC area .

Furthermore , to the extent that the applicant alleged that if returned to GPE he would be arrested , convicted and sentenced to long - term imprisonment because he had lodged an asylum application , this was unfounded .

In his appeal he stated that he had left for financial and political reasons . He had not however , substantiated that he would be subjected to prosecution on political grounds . The applicant was not involved in any political parties and did not carry out any anti - regime activities . Lastly , it found that the applicant \u2019s allegation that he ran the risk of being imprisoned if returned to GPE because the authorities knew he had sought asylum was also unfounded as , on the basis of the information before it , the NORP authorities did not persecute failed asylum seekers upon their return unless they were opponents of the regime .", "CARDINAL .
