In DATE the first applicant married Mr GPE , a GPE national , in GPE . Their daughter GPE was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a serious marital crisis , on an unknown date PERSON initiated divorce proceedings in the GPE , but she was unable to pursue them because , according to her , she could not afford to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , together with the second applicant , she went to stay with her parents in GPE for the holidays with her husband 's consent . She finally decided to remain there and did not return to the GPE , despite her husband 's repeated requests .", "CARDINAL . On a petition from Mr GPE dated DATE , ORG of the State of GPE , GPE , in an order of DATE , awarded temporary custody of GPE to her father , decided that she should live with him , and ordered the mother to return GPE immediately , requesting all competent bodies in GPE to assist the petitioner in repatriating the child to ORG . A hearing was scheduled for DATE for the purposes of examining the father 's petition for sole custody of his daughter and of hearing the mother 's reasons for her opposition to such a decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON 's father applied to ORG in order to secure the return of his child . In accordance with the DATE LAW on the Civil Aspects of ORG , ORG , on DATE , transmitted to ORG , ORG in civil and commercial matters , a request for GPE 's return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that request was forwarded to ORG at the Aix - en - ORG , on whose initiative the mother was summoned for interview by the gendarmerie . She stated that she refused to return the child to the father .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor at the NORP tribunal de grande instance , having been authorised by an order of DATE on his ex parte application , brought proceedings against the first applicant for the purposes of obtaining an order that the child be returned to her father on the basis of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Mr GPE intervened on a voluntary basis in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the court dismissed the claims of the public prosecutor and Mr GPE . It took the view that whilst GPE 's removal had not been in any way wrongful , since it was not disputed by Mr GPE that he had agreed to the child 's temporary removal to GPE , the fact that the child had been prevented from returning to her place of habitual residence , where Mr GPE exercised his rights of custody , was to be considered wrongful within the meaning of LAW , regardless of the reasons for which the applicant was opposed to her return . As to the risk for GPE in the event of her return , the court found as follows :", "\u201c In the present case , in the light of the various attestations produced in the proceedings , both by PERSON GPE and by [ the applicant ] , there is no evidence of harmful conduct [ on the part of the father ] towards the child ... .", "However , it has been established and is not disputed by Mr GPE that the child GPE , who was born on DATE [ sic ] and who is therefore aged DATE and DATE , has lived throughout her infancy mainly in the company of her mother , especially as the latter was not employed while in GPE . PERSON , who was PERSON 's doctor from her birth until DATE , has moreover certified that the applicant herself brought the child to most of the consultations and did not miss any appointments .", "The attestations produced in the proceedings in respect of GPE 's life in GPE show that the mother / daughter relationship is extremely sound , as pointed out by Dr T. , who reports that the child is not suffering from any psychological disturbance and has adapted well , particularly in her school life , as indicated by the attestation from the headmistress of the nursery school that [ she ] attends .", "The applicant arranged for the child to undergo a psychological examination by Dr V. Concerning the relations that the child had developed emotionally with her parental figures , this clinical psychologist noted the very strong predominance of the mother figure :", "The child 's psychological , psycho - affective and cognitive development is healthy , and there is an excellent relationship , with sound emotional ties , between GPE and her mother , and also between the child and her maternal grandparents . It also appears that she refers to the father figure , that she may mention when prompted by the therapist , without expressing any affect .", "GPE seems to be developing harmoniously , having found a balanced life with her mother and maternal grandparents , and does not seem to have been affected mentally by her separation from her father or her departure from GPE , where she was born . It would thus be harmful for this child if her points of reference were changed and she was placed in a situation where she became separated from her mother and her mother 's family out of a concern for effective restoration of the father 's role .", "It transpires from the foregoing that , in view of GPE 's infancy and her close relationship with her mother , in whose company she has always lived , both in GPE and since her arrival in GPE , her return would place her in an intolerable situation on account of the resulting separation from her mother , but also because of her removal from the environment to which she has adapted and her transfer to a new environment with her father in the State of her habitual residence , no concrete information having been forthcoming in this connection .", "In these circumstances , and in accordance with LAW b ) of LAW , it is not appropriate to order GPE 's return to GPE ... on account of a grave risk that she would be placed in an intolerable situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor appealed against the decision of the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "CARDINAL . In parallel to the NORP proceedings , by an order of DATE delivered on DATE , ORG of the State of GPE , ruling on the merits of the father 's petition , in the absence of the mother \u2013 who had failed to appear despite having been served notice of the hearing DATE , awarded the father sole custody of the child , ordered that the child be returned and held that the court retained jurisdiction to reconsider the child 's best interests as well as the court 's directions in the case if requested by either party .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , served on DATE , the Aix - en - ORG of Appeal set aside the judgment of DATE and ordered GPE 's prompt return to the place of her habitual residence in GPE . The judgment gave the following reasons :", "\u201c ... [ the first applicant ] requested the benefit of the exception provided for in LAW ( b ) of LAW ...", "It is not for the ORG to assess the educative and affective capacities of each parent but to ascertain whether the parent who retains the child has adduced evidence to show that if returned the child would be exposed to real and immediate physical or psychological harm and would be placed in an intolerable situation before a decision on the merits is taken by the court of the place of habitual residence , it being understood that , in accordance with LAW , a decision under that Convention concerning the return of the child will not be a determination on the merits of any custody issue .", "PERSON has argued that the child should not be returned to GPE on child protection grounds , on account of the violent and alcoholic behaviour of Mr GPE who , she has also alleged , took drugs .", "The attestations produced by PERSON , issued by her parents , PERSON and PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , mainly relate to her own allegations , which she had imparted to them , about her husband 's behaviour towards her . None of them provide evidence of any harmful attitude on the part of Mr GPE towards his daughter . He has himself produced various affidavits from work colleagues , friends of the couple and neighbours , testifying that he is a caring father , is not an alcoholic and does not take drugs . He has also produced the results of tests dated DATE showing the absence of any trace of drugs .", "The domestic incident report of DATE from GPE , the medical certificates of DATE and DATE issued by PERSON , that of DATE by PERSON , and the complaint for violence filed on DATE , do not relate to GPE at all .", "The only document concerning GPE is a child protection report filed on DATE by the social services of GPE , which noted a lack of supervision imputable to the child 's mother following a fall by the child in the fire - escape stairwell . This incident shows that the GPE services are protective of the child 's interests .", "PERSON has not shown that the child 's return would be harmful for her on account of the father 's behaviour . In fact , she had herself written to him on CARDINAL DATE requesting that he send various belongings and objects for GPE and adding : \u201c we hope you will come and see us soon and live with us \u201d .", "PERSON argues that the child 's return would place her daughter in an intolerable psychological situation on account of being separated from her mother after having adapted to her new life .", "GPE , now DATE , has been living with her mother and maternal grandparents for DATE . She has settled well in the village life , has been attending nursery school since DATE and takes gymnastics lessons .", "The headmistress of the nursery school describes her as a well - behaved child who works well , plays with all her classmates , speaks fluent NORP , understands everything she is told and makes herself understood , has adapted perfectly to school , and shows much self - fulfilment and contentment .", "PERSON , a psychiatrist , certified on DATE that she was a smiling and lively child with a very satisfactory psychomotor and intellectual development for her age and that she showed no signs of psychological disorder . He also pointed out that the mother - child relationship was very sound .", "PERSON , a clinical psychologist , certified that he had seen the child at the request of PERSON and had drawn up an examination report dated DATE .", "He noted the child 's very strong emotional relationship with her mother and maternal grandparents , a very strong predominance of the mother figure reflected in her imaginative creations and in symbolic games , and her reference to the father figure without expressing any affect .", "He concluded his report by stating that the child was in good psychological , psycho - affective and cognitive health , which was apparently developing harmoniously , that she seemed to have found a balanced life with her mother and maternal grandparents , and did not seem to have been affected mentally by her separation from her father or her departure from GPE , where she was born . He added that ' [ PERSON would thus be harmful for this child if her points of reference were changed and she was placed in a situation where she became separated from her mother and her mother 's family out of a concern for effective restoration of the father 's role ' .", "The harm referred to in LAW ( b ) of LAW can not be constituted solely by separation from the parent who acted unlawfully and created the risk .", "The observations of the psychiatrist , psychologist and headmistress show that the child has the capacity to adapt to new circumstances .", "Mr GPE has been employed by the company ORG , as a consultant since DATE , and as a video specialist since DATE . In DATE his DATE salary amount to QUANTITY .", "He has been a tenant in the same residence since DATE , i.e. before GPE was born , renting a CARDINAL - room apartment for a DATE rent of MONEY that he pays regularly .", "His employer wrote to him on DATE that he agreed to adapt his working hours so that he could work DATE when necessary , as the nature of his work allowed him to work outside the company 's LOC , whether at home or elsewhere .", "PERSON , a graduate of a nursing school and a neighbour of Mr GPE , informed him in a letter of DATE that she agreed to look after GPE , DATE or TIME , as required .", "The head of the nursery section of a children 's day care and learning centre in GPE confirmed by a letter of DATE that GPE had been admitted to it .", "The affidavits and photographs produced by Mr GPE further show that he has the support of his family and friends .", "The environment that Mr GPE would provide on his daughter 's return , being the environment in which she lived from DATE until her removal on DATE , does not indicate a risk of any harm that would place the child in an intolerable situation .", "PERSON alleged that there was a risk that she would no longer be allowed to travel freely to GPE .", "She produced the form for entry into GPE that has to be filled in by non - immigrant visitors without a visa , showing that entry into the country may be refused to a person who has prevented a GPE citizen from exercising his or her custody rights .", "A permanent resident card , valid from DATE to DATE , was granted to PERSON n\u00e9e ORG on DATE , further to her application of CARDINAL DATE .", "As a result , the GPE authorities can not prevent her from returning to GPE where the family 's habitual residence is located and where she will be able to assert her rights in the context of adversarial proceedings . The decisions concerning the exercise of parental authority are essentially temporary and may be modified to take the child 's interest into account . The judge of ORG , GPE , moreover stipulates in his order of DATE that ' the court reserves the right and retains jurisdiction to decide on the child 's interest and will consider any new measures that may be taken by the CARDINAL parties in accordance with this decree [ sic ] ' .", "Having regard to all of the foregoing elements , which are sufficient for adjudication without it being necessary to order any investigation , PERSON n\u00e9e ORG has not shown that there is a grave risk that GPE 's return would expose her to physical or psychological harm or place her in an intolerable situation .", "Consequently , it is appropriate to set aside the judgment appealed against and to order the child 's prompt return to the place of her habitual residence , in accordance with LAW DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG claiming a violation of LAW ( b ) of LAW and of LAW , and a failure to take into account the child 's \u201c best interests \u201d as guaranteed by LAW of ORG on the Rights of the Child ( the \u201c GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was interviewed by the police with a view to the voluntary return of the child , who had been taken into hiding . On DATE the mother was questioned by the public prosecutor for the same purpose . On those latter occasions she took note of the fact that she was committing a criminal offence by keeping her daughter in the current situation and refused to enforce the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor of GPE , assisted by QUANTITY police officers , entered GPE 's nursery school seeking to enforce the judgment of ORG . It can be seen from the various press articles in the file that the first applicant , the child 's grandparents and school staff physically opposed the police intervention by forming a protective barrier around the child , helped by the prompt arrival of several villagers and the village mayor himself . Faced with this resistance , in the course of which blows and insults were apparently exchanged , the public prosecutor provisionally discontinued the enforcement of the decision . The operation attracted widespread media attention , nationally as well as locally . The then Minister of ORG announced that he would request ORG to study the means of intervention best adapted to this type of dispute ; however , no such report has ever been filed or published .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the first applicant had applied to ORG seeking a measure of \u201c educational assistance \u201d for her daughter . In a decision of DATE ORG ordered a measure of investigation and educational guidance and prescribed a psychiatric examination as follows :", "\u201c It appears that GPE , who is DATE , is embroiled in a relentless conflict between her parents , before the courts and in the media , and this must be upsetting or disturbing for her . GPE may also feel and apprehend fear about the prospect of being separated for good from her father or mother . These conditions may particularly give rise to anxiety , suffering and worry for a little girl . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an educational assistance order of DATE ORG decided on the placement of the second applicant for DATE in specialist family care with the ADSEA for the d\u00e9partement of Var , with a right of access for both parents , on the following grounds :", "\u201c It transpires from the interim report issued by the department responsible for the investigation and educational guidance , from the representations of the parents and the child 's ad hoc administrator , from the submissions of the parties and the public prosecutor , from the press articles in the case file , from correspondence and from judicial decisions , that the conflict between the parents reached a climax on DATE in PERSON , inevitably causing this little girl psychological distress , fear , anxiety , terrors and confusion .", "GPE was at the heart of a situation of severe and active physical and mental violence and witnessed serious clashes between adults of which she was the subject .", "These circumstances have entail for this child a strong emotional condition that endangers her health and security .", "The idea , for GPE , of being constantly reminded that she risks being permanently separated from her father or mother must inevitably have been strengthened on that occasion ...", "GPE is living DATE in semi - clandestine conditions , deprived of contact with her father , the subject of concern among members of her family , and a hostage in the conflict between her parents , as enshrined in various decisions .", "In order to give her some respite , some time to catch her breath and get on with her childhood , to distance her from the competition of which she is the target , with the risk of a psychological breakdown , it is appropriate to order that she be placed for DATE in specialist family care with the ADSEA for the d\u00e9partement of Var . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE the ORG - en - ORG endorsed the child 's temporary placement in care but , when ruling on the merits , ordered that she be removed from care and returned to her father in accordance with the GPE court 's decision and its own decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE left GPE for the GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the discontinuance of the educational assistance measure :", "\u201c The conflict over this child must have placed GPE in a situation of uncertainty , anxiety and suffering .", "The present outcome of this conflict , namely GPE 's separation from her mother , must have been very psychologically harmful for this DATE child who until then had benefited from the warm and orderly environment provided by the mother .", "A whole sphere of her past life has thus disappeared \u2013 left behind in TIME on the plane .", "This wrench will take a long time to heal .", "In this sense , GPE remains in a situation of danger in terms of her health , within the meaning of LAW .", "The fact that GPE lives with her father in the GPE nevertheless precludes the continuation of any measure of support for the girl or her parents .", "On that ground alone it is ordered that the educational assistance measure be discontinued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the first applicant in spite of the advocate - general 's submissions to the contrary . The judgment is reasoned as follows :", "\u201c It is apparent from LAW ( b ) of LAW DATE that an exception to the child 's prompt return may be allowed only if there is a grave risk of harm or of an intolerable situation . Under LAW of FAC on the Rights of the Child \u2013 a provision which is directly applicable in the NORP courts \u2013 the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in the assessment of the relevant circumstances .", "Without having to deal with a mere argument , ORG noted , in its discretion , after referring to the conditions of the child 's life with her mother , that there was no evidence that the father had displayed a dangerous attitude towards his daughter , that it had been established that he was neither an alcoholic nor a drug addict , that the child 's psychological condition was satisfactory , and that her father would offer her favourable living conditions in GPE , with the assistance of a nursing school graduate . These findings show that the child 's best interests were taken into consideration by ORG , which rightly concluded , without laying itself open to the complaints in the present appeal , that it was appropriate to order the child 's prompt return in accordance with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In parallel to the various sets of proceedings mentioned above , the first applicant initiated divorce proceedings in GPE on DATE , when she filed a petition for divorce , on the grounds of fault , with the PERSON family - affairs judge . In a decision of DATE , a hearing for an attempt at reconciliation was scheduled for DATE . At that hearing , Mr GPE claimed that the NORP family - affairs judge should decline jurisdiction in favour of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the judge upheld the objection to jurisdiction . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Aix - en - ORG of Appeal set aside that decision and held that the NORP court had jurisdiction to rule on the divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant filed an updated petition for divorce . In a decision of DATE , a hearing for an attempt at reconciliation was scheduled for DATE . In connection with that hearing , Mr GPE filed pleadings seeking an order that he be examined before ORG of the State of GPE , and in the alternative the postponement of the hearing so that he would be able to attend . The proceedings were adjourned until a hearing of DATE . Mr. GPE failed to appear and did not give reasons for this . The reconciliation hearing was thus held in his absence .", "CARDINAL . In a non - reconciliation decision of CARDINAL DATE , and after pointing out that a decision on the child 's return given in the context of LAW did not determine the merits of any custody issue ( LAW , the family - affairs judge ruled that parental authority would be exercised jointly by both parents , that the child would habitually reside in GPE at her mother 's house , and that the father would have rights of visiting and staying contact for CARDINAL of DATE , and DATE , alternately with the mother , for the whole of DATE . The decision states as follows :", "\u201c The petitioner 's claims , in the light of the evidence concerning the living conditions offered to the child , as noted by the judges of the Aix - en - Provence Court of Appeal , do not appear to be contrary to the child 's interests . They must therefore be granted as to their principle . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance granted the parties ' divorce and held that the second applicant should live with her mother , with her father being granted a right of contact .", "CARDINAL . The Government indicated that subsequent to the enforcement of the decision concerning the child 's return , ORG had received requests from the first applicant 's lawyer for the purpose of transmitting to ORG a request for GPE 's return on the basis of the non - reconciliation decision holding that the child should live with her mother . No action had been taken in response to these requests on the ground that LAW was not applicable as the child 's habitual residence had been in GPE at the time of the NORP decision . Lastly , during the public hearing before ORG , the Government explained that on DATE the first applicant had summoned Mr GPE to appear before ORG , for the offence of failing to hand over a child to the person having custody , in breach of the decision of DATE , and that the court , having found that it was not established that the summons had been served on its addressee , had invited her to serve a new summons for a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the orders of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) , ORG of the State of GPE made a new order ( \u201c order to show cause \u201d ) on DATE in which the first applicant was summoned to a hearing scheduled for DATE for the purpose of submitting the reasons why an order should not be made , upon a petition from Mr GPE , to the effect that her visits to GPE would be restricted to the courthouse under the supervision of the child 's paternal grandmother and an officer of the court and that she would have to surrender the child 's NORP passport prior to the first visit and refrain from applying for a new one . She was moreover ordered to post with the court a bond in the amount of MONEY which would be subject to forfeiture in the event she removed the child from the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant received a letter from ORG which stated as follows :", "\u201c In your interview of DATE you expressed your fear that you would not be given leave to enter GPE and thus would not be able to visit your daughter GPE , since , on the GPE immigration questionnaire that you would have to complete , you would be asked expressly if you had committed a wrongful child abduction .", "ORG is not in a position to give you an assurance that GPE authorities would allow you to enter their country .", "I am able to inform you , however , that a representative of ORG in GPE , who was asked about this matter on the telephone , indicated that as you would be coming from a ORG which is a co - signatory with GPE of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of DATE , you should not be prevented from entering GPE territory . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant 's representative in GPE requested an adjournment of her court appearance until DATE and filed an \u201c affirmation in support of request for adjournment \u201d stating that she had been informed of the court 's objection to her contacting her daughter before that appearance .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE representations were heard from the parties . The first applicant requested the court , among other things , to dismiss the father 's application and to register the non - reconciliation decision of CARDINAL DATE of the GPE tribunal de grande instance granting her custody of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , delivered on DATE , the judge of ORG granted Mr GPE 's application to restrict the mother 's right of visitation . The court found first that GPE alone had the authority and jurisdiction to rule on issues of custody relating to the child , that it would not relinquish jurisdiction , that no NORP law or ruling could change the domestic law and that it would not recognise the orders of any other court which purported to exercise jurisdiction which was not in conformity with the applicable laws of GPE and international treaties which governed such issues . As regards the non - reconciliation decision of CARDINAL DATE granting custody of GPE to the mother , it refused to recognise it as binding on that court . The court found that the father 's request was justified by the mother 's conduct and by the attitude of the NORP courts and authorities , which had for DATE aided the mother in her appropriate actions . Observing that immediately after the child had returned to GPE a NORP court had determined that the mother should have custody , the judge was of the opinion that if the child were to return to GPE the likelihood for the father of having that most recent ruling overturned would be remote . The judge concluded as follows :", "\u201c Based on the foregoing , this ORG will not consider granting the mother unsupervised visitation and will conduct no further hearings on the issues of custody and visitation unless and until all of the following things have taken place :", "CARDINAL . The mother must apply to the appropriate NORP courts and obtain the following results :", "a. An order which vacates any orders which purport to grant custody of this child to the mother .", "b. An order which unequivocally and irrevocably acknowledges that GPE alone has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the issue of custody of this child so long as the father continues to be a resident of GPE .", "c. An order registering and recognizing the GPE order , granting the father full custody of the subject child , as the only valid order relating to the custody of this child .", "d. ...", "CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL . Before any unsupervised visitation is granted , the mother must post a cash or surety bond in the amount of $ MONEY ...", "CARDINAL . Any time the mother is exercising any form of visitation with the child , she must surrender her passport to the child 's law guardian ...", "CARDINAL . ... , all visitation with the child shall be supervised and shall be confined to the area of GPE , GPE , unless prior court approval has been granted .", "I realize these may seem like harsh conditions and restrictions . However , these conditions and restrictions are born of the extremely inappropriate conduct of the mother and the clear attitude and intentions of the NORP courts and authorities to favor the mother , ignoring applicable laws and international protocols relating to the issues involved in this case .", "The mother shall have the right to apply to this court for a relaxation of the conditions outlined above upon notice to this court that the NORP order purporting to grant her custody of the child has been vacated and the order of this court has been registered and recognized in GPE as the only valid order ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The order was followed by the usual indications about the possibility of lodging an appeal before ORG , ORG , DATE after receipt of the order . The first applicant did not exercise her right of appeal .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , there is evidence that on DATE ORG sent a letter to counsel for the first applicant , beginning as follows :", "\u201c Dear Madam ,", "I have been informed by my counterpart in GPE that Mr GPE does not accept the offer of mediation that was made to him , since he can not be certain of the mother 's intentions , and this perhaps explains why you decided , at the same time as he was approached about a friendly settlement , to reactivate the criminal proceedings , of which I have been informed by the public prosecutor of Aix - en - GPE .", "The terms of the GPE judgment being unequivocal , it seems pointless to bring any proceedings in GPE with a view to extending the contact between GPE and her mother before securing a change in the NORP decision concerning parental authority .", "It is up to your client to lodge an application for that purpose with the family - affairs judge .
