On DATE the national authorities issued a decision to restore the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s property rights in respect of a plot of land measuring CARDINAL hectares . His property rights were registered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following their father \u2019s death on DATE , the applicants were issued with a certificate of inheritance on DATE and inherited his property in equal parts . CARDINAL plots of land measuring CARDINAL hectares and QUANTITY respectively were returned to them in natura . These plots were marked out in DATE , but an engineer did not indicate in the plan that there was a house situated on the plot of land of QUANTITY that did not belong to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG bought a house and a storehouse . The cadastral measurements of the house were taken in DATE , and the building was classified as residential . The plot of land under the house and for residential purposes measured QUANTITY , and although ORG did not buy the land on which the house stood , he used it . On DATE ORG , who was PERSON \u2019s mother , had her property rights restored , and transferred her plot of land of QUANTITY to the place where ORG house was located . PERSON , as ORG \u2019s heir , asked for the plot of land of QUANTITY to be entered into the land registry in his name . However , his request was refused by the national authorities , because that plot overlapped the applicants\u2019 land .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) stated that the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s rights had been restored in respect of the land under the buildings that did not belong to him . The ORG also explained that , if there was no dispute , the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could be amended and the borders of CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 plots of land could be changed as well ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . If there was a dispute , the ORG would initiate court proceedings in order to annul part of the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicants were given until DATE to reply in writing to the ORG \u2019s proposal . The applicants did not agree with the ORG \u2019s proposal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG held that domestic law did not allow the restoration of property rights to land under buildings owned by third parties . As a result , the documents restoring the property rights of the applicants\u2019 father had to be amended .", "CARDINAL . As there was a dispute , the ORG asked a prosecutor to start court proceedings . In DATE the prosecutor lodged a claim with ORG and asked it to annul part of the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) restoring the property rights of the applicants\u2019 father in respect of QUANTITY of land , and the relevant part of the succession document issued to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s application , indicated that the part of the decision of DATE regarding the CARDINAL hectares had to be annulled , and held that a plot of land of QUANTITY had to be demarcated for ORG The applicants\u2019 property rights would be protected by giving them an equivalent plot of land in another area . It appears that the court suggested several times that the parties conclude a friendly settlement agreement , but the applicants refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They claimed , among other things , that the prosecutor had missed the DATE time - limit for lodging a claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the court of first instance . The court held that the prosecutor had only found out about the situation at issue on DATE , and had lodged the complaint on DATE , thus the time - limit for lodging a claim had not been missed . The court further held that the plot of land that ORG had been using had been formed back in DATE when the buildings had belonged to ORG , and that the applicants had signed the documents and agreed with the borders of the plot under the buildings . The court also held that the restitution of property was a matter of public interest , because it not only related to specific individuals , but to public opinion in general ( formuoja visos visuomen\u0117s nuomon\u0119 ) . The property rights of land owners were not absolute , and in the case at issue the lawful interests of CARDINAL party had to be protected .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted an appeal on points of law , and on DATE ORG sent the case back to ORG for fresh examination , stating that the lower courts had not examined the factual circumstances regarding how big the plot of land had to be in order for the buildings to be used . ORG also held that ORG should assess the fact that no plot of land under the buildings had been demarcated at the time the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s property rights had been restored .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the case back to the court of first instance for fresh examination , stating that the substance of the case had not been examined thoroughly . The court held that CARDINAL of the buildings belonging to ORG had previously been a school building , but since DATE it had been registered in the register of immovable property as a residential building . The court observed that some mistakes had been made in the process of restoring both PERSON \u2019s mother \u2019s and the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s property rights . The court further held that the conclusion of ORG that PERSON was entitled to a plot of land measuring QUANTITY was unfounded . Although there were some buildings on the land that had been returned to the applicants\u2019 father , the exact size of the plot necessary in order for the buildings to be used had not been determined . Moreover , although the applicants and ORG had provided some evidence , this was insufficient to prove that the size of the plot of land under the buildings had to be QUANTITY . Lastly , ORG obliged the parties to the proceedings to provide documents proving how big the plot of land had to be in order for ORG \u2019s buildings to be used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established that ORG \u2019s buildings were on the plot of land measuring QUANTITY . The court also held that ORG was using the exact plot which had been marked out for ORG , and the plan of the land had been signed by the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court considered that the person who had measured the land for the applicants had not marked the house in that area , and had not taken any actions to find out who the owner of the house was ; therefore , he was the person who had made a mistake . The court noted that in fact QUANTITY overlapped the applicants\u2019 land , but as PERSON was not asking for this , QUANTITY of land had to be taken from the applicants . Lastly , although the QUANTITY of land had to be taken away from the applicants , their property rights had to be protected by providing them with a new plot of land of equivalent value in another place .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , and on DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE . The court held that , although the applicants claimed that ORG house was not a residential building and thus no land for residential purposes could exist , the data from the register of immovable property and the purchase agreements showed that the building was a residential building . The court also held that the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s property rights to the land under the buildings at issue could not have been restored , as those were not his buildings . In fact , since DATE the relevant documents had referred to there being a plot of land of QUANTITY near the buildings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted numerous appeals on points of law , but they were dismissed by ORG on DATE , CARDINAL and DATE and DATE as either not raising important legal issues or being repetitive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to the applicants explaining that the legal registration in respect of their plot of land of CARDINAL hectares had been annulled following the decisions of the domestic courts , and asked them to choose the means by which they wanted their property rights in respect of the plot of land of QUANTITY to be restored . ORG noted that the restoration of property rights in natura was not possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL of the applicants wrote to ORG and asked for the return of the plot of CARDINAL hectares in natura . She also claimed that PERSON was using the plot of land for residential purposes unlawfully and that she had sustained damage .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG informed the applicant that she could start court proceedings for damages . ORG also explained that the purchase agreement in respect of ORG \u2019s buildings was valid , and that , in accordance with the decisions of the domestic courts , PERSON was entitled to use the plot of land under the buildings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG replied to a request by CARDINAL of the applicants in DATE for an explanation of the actions of ORG of ORG and compensation in respect of pecuniary damage . ORG stated that the applicants were aware of the court proceedings regarding the decision of CARDINAL DATE to restore their father \u2019s property rights . It also held that PERSON was entitled to buy the plot of land for residential purposes located under the buildings from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON was included into the list of candidates to buy a plot of land of QUANTITY and on DATE , after some measurements had been carried out , the plot of land of QUANTITY was sold to ORG", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG replied to a complaint by CARDINAL of the applicants about the restoration of her father \u2019s property rights . Among many other things , the applicant asked for : the process of amending the borders of their plot of land to be terminated ; ORG to be prohibited from constructing buildings and growing plants ; his property to be kept on the plot of land at issue ; an opportunity to buy the plot of land that had been taken from them ; and an easement under ORG \u2019s buildings to be established . ORG indicated that such a request had already been dismissed by the domestic courts ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was impossible to allow the applicants to buy the same plot of land that had been taken from them , because that plot of QUANTITY had not belonged to their father in the first place . In addition , PERSON was not stating that he wanted an easement to be established , thus the applicant \u2019s request in this respect was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained to a member of the ORG , who sent their complaint to ORG . The member of the Seimas asked for explanations about the procedure for restoring the applicants\u2019 property rights and why their property rights to the QUANTITY of land had not been restored . In DATE ORG of ORG explained that the applicants\u2019 property rights to the plot of land of CARDINAL hectares had been annulled in accordance with the decisions of the domestic courts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the applicants had been asked to choose the means by which they wished their property rights in respect of the QUANTITY of land to be restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but they still insisted on having the land returned in natura ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which was not possible . ORG of ORG also provided detailed information about monetary compensation as a means of restoring the applicants\u2019 property rights . The monetary compensation procedure could be started after the applicants submitted a request for their property rights to be restored by means of monetary compensation . As a preliminary estimate , the value of the plot at issue was estimated at MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG of ORG once again informed the applicants that returning the CARDINAL hectares of land in natura was not possible and that they could have monetary compensation . The applicants were also informed that the procedure could be started after a request to restore their property rights by means of monetary compensation was received by the authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The preliminary estimate as to the value of the plot was also indicated as being EUR CARDINAL . It appears that the applicants did not reply to this letter , nor did they submit a request for monetary compensation , but ORG calculated the compensation at ORG CARDINAL after having adjusted it in line with the inflation index , and on DATE invited the applicants to come and discuss the restoration of their property rights . The meeting was adjourned once until DATE because the applicants\u2019 lawyer had holidays planned . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer asked to adjourn the meeting again because CARDINAL of the applicants was ill , but she did not provide any documents confirming this . ORG decided to hold a meeting as planned on DATE , and issued a decision to restore the applicants\u2019 property rights to the QUANTITY of land by paying them monetary compensation of ORG CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the applicants collected the decision on DATE . The decision was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL of the applicants asked a prosecutor to start a pre - trial investigation into ORG \u2019s actions . According to her , PERSON was using land to which he had no rights . In DATE the prosecutor decided to terminate the pre - trial investigation , as there was no evidence of a criminal act . That decision was upheld by a higher prosecutor in DATE and by ORG and ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants asked for interim measures to be applied and for PERSON to be prohibited from constructing buildings , temporary constructions and roads , and from growing plants and farming on the plot of land at issue .

On DATE ORG held that the applicant \u2019s allegations had already been rejected by the decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court also stated that the cadastral plan proposed by the applicant was not approved , because she had included ORG \u2019s land on it and marked it as hers . As a result , the applicant \u2019s complaint was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants initiated civil proceedings regarding the change of purpose of CARDINAL of the buildings belonging to ORG They claimed that ORG house had previously been a school , and thus its purpose was communal and not residential .
