SLOVENIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Following a request for a criminal investigation against the applicant lodged by GPE on DATE and amended on DATE , on DATE the applicant was summoned as accused to appear before the investigating judge of ORG . He was also notified of the charge of aggravated fraud under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , and the underlying allegations submitted by ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was heard by the investigating judge . He denied the charge and submitted a number of documents in support of his position that the accusations were fabricated and unfounded , but was unwilling to answer any of the questions posed by PERSON \u2019s legal counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG issued an order for an investigation of aggravated fraud against the applicant . In the course of that investigation , CARDINAL witnesses were heard who confirmed PERSON \u2019s version of events . The applicant was not present during these examinations , although the investigating judge ordered him to be notified thereof . Judicial records contain no evidence that the applicant received a summons .", "CARDINAL . After the investigation was concluded , on DATE , ORG took over the proceedings and on DATE lodged an indictment for attempted aggravated fraud under LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW . The indictment stated that the applicant had deceived PERSON into believing that he could assist her in preventing her husband from claiming ownership of her share of their joint property , namely the family house . The applicant had taken advantage of ORG age and naivety and persuaded her to sign a fictitious loan agreement stating that he would lend her MONEY ( DEM ) , equivalent to CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT ) , which was to be secured with a mortgage on her share of the family house , despite the fact that PERSON did not owe him anything , which he was well aware of . For this purpose , the applicant had PERSON sign an authority form authorising him to take all measures necessary for the execution of the loan agreement . On that basis , the applicant had the mortgage against ORG property entered in the land register , prejudicing the value of her property in the amount of SIT CARDINAL . Moreover , PERSON paid the applicant SIT CARDINAL in several instalments for the \u201c favour \u201d he had done her .", "CARDINAL . Having been served with the indictment , the applicant lodged an objection , reiterating that ORG accusations of fraud were fabricated and arguing that he would not be able to enter a mortgage in his favour in the land register without ORG cooperation . The objection was rejected by the pre - trial panel on DATE . The latter noted in its decision that the criminal offence should be reclassified as attempted fraud under LAW in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW , as the value at issue did not reach the statutory threshold of significant pecuniary damage . Accordingly , ORG no longer had jurisdiction over the case , which was to be referred to ORG . The applicant was served with the decision and appealed against it ; however , his appeal was dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Following the transfer of jurisdiction to the local court , the ensuing court proceedings were conducted under the rules of summary procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant having failed to collect the first CARDINAL summonses to the hearing which was to take place on DATE , the hearing was rescheduled for DATE . A summons to this later hearing was served on the applicant on DATE through the court courier service at both his home and his work address , and subsequently on DATE by post , again at both his home and his work address . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to the court in which he objected to the hearing , alleging that he had received CARDINAL identical summonses which contained no explanation but only an indication of legal classification of the criminal offence in question . The applicant \u2019s objection to the hearing was received by the local court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG held a hearing in the absence of the applicant , having found that he had not provided justification for his absence , although he had been duly summoned , that he had already been questioned during the investigation , and that his presence at the hearing was not necessary to establish the facts of the case . Thus , the legal requirements for trial in absentia had been met . The court examined GPE and the CARDINAL witnesses who had already been questioned during the investigation ; their accounts corresponded to their previous statements . In her concluding remarks the district state prosecutor modified the indictment , reclassifying the offence to the actual criminal offence of fraud , rather than attempted fraud . She also added some details to the facts on which the indictment was based , in particular the allegation that the applicant had lied to GPE that there would be expenses with regard to the entry of the mortgage in the land registry , for which she had paid him a total of SIT CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Having concluded the hearing , the court found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence as specified in the modified indictment , and sentenced him to DATE in prison . PERSON was invited to pursue her pecuniary claim in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that the statement he had given during the investigation could not suffice for the trial purposes , as an indictment had not yet been lodged and thus could not be disputed . He pointed out that a statement given in the investigation could relate to CARDINAL criminal offence , while the indictment could be lodged for a completely different criminal offence . He was therefore of the view that the provisions on trial in absentia should only be applied to cases where the defendant was questioned after the lodging of the indictment . Moreover , he disputed the credibility of the CARDINAL witnesses and referred to the loan agreement and other documents he had submitted to the court during the investigation , claiming that GPE was evading her contractual obligations and charging him with fraud for that reason . He also challenged the imposed prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded and upheld the first - instance judgment . The higher court found that the applicant \u2019s defence right had not been violated by the fact that he was not present at the hearing . It noted that the accused had the right to attend the summary proceedings , but that he was not obliged to do so . The court noted that the applicant had been heard during the investigation , had received the indictment and had been duly summoned to the hearing , where he would have had the opportunity to make a statement and examine witnesses against him . However , given that the facts of the case had been clear and fully established , the higher court took the view that the applicant \u2019s presence at the hearing had not been necessary . In this connection , the court held that a hearing should only be discontinued if the description of the criminal offence in the indictment , albeit based on the same factual elements as before , was substantially changed . In such a case , the defendant ought to be informed thereof and summoned to attend a new hearing . However , this was not the case in the circumstances complained of by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , reiterating that he should not have been tried in absentia , as he had been questioned only before the indictment was lodged . Moreover , he had not been given the opportunity to cross - examine the witnesses against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment , in which it upheld the lower courts\u2019 decisions . ORG found that the offence which prompted the investigation against the applicant was identical to the offence with which the applicant was later charged . Furthermore , the hearing before the court did not bring to light any new information that had not already been uncovered during the investigation . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW , which sets out the conditions for conducting a hearing in absentia , ORG noted that the defendant had the right to attend the hearing , but that this right could under certain circumstances be waived . It also noted that the applicant had been duly summoned and warned that the hearing could be held in his absence . As regards the examination of witnesses during the investigation , ORG noted that while there were no indications in the case file that the applicant had been notified of it , this procedural breach had been remedied by the hearing at which GPE and the other CARDINAL witnesses had been re - examined . The applicant had had the opportunity to attend the hearing , but had waived his right .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint , which was declared admissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court delivered a decision finding that the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated . The court noted that the applicant had been heard during the investigation and that the charges in the request for the investigation and the indictment which had been lodged after the investigation and served on him had concerned the same acts and the same alleged offence , regardless of some differences in the wording . They both charged the applicant with misleading PERSON into concluding a fictitious agreement with him with the intent of acquiring illicit pecuniary gain . Observing that the indictment had been modified at the hearing , ORG held that although the offence had been reclassified as actual fraud , and no longer as attempted fraud , the charge had remained the same in terms of content as regards the applicant \u2019s conduct and the circumstances in which the offence had been committed . Having regard to that , as well as the fact that the applicant had been duly summoned to the hearing and had failed to provide any valid reason for his absence , ORG held that the local court had had no obligation to ensure the applicant \u2019s presence at the hearing . Moreover , ORG observed that the applicant had not even alleged that the criminal offence which was the subject of the investigation was different from the one examined at the court hearing . He had merely drawn attention to the fact that \u201c a prosecutor may file an indictment for a completely different criminal offence after the investigation is completed \u201d . It was also found that the applicant could have requested an adjournment of the hearing , but did not do so , and instead had failed to appear without specifying any valid reason . Finally , as regards the examination of the witnesses , ORG reached the same conclusion as ORG had previously ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
