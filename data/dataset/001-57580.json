CARDINAL of the viaduct \u2019s supports was to stand on the \" Riddaren \" site , the remainder of which was to be turned into a car park .", "Under LAW DATE ( expropriationslagen - \" the CARDINAL Act \" ) , the Government set at DATE the time - limit within which the expropriation might be effected ; before the end of that period ORG had to summon the owners to appear before ORG ( fastighetdomstolen ) for the fixing of compensation , failing which the permit would lapse .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , at the request of the City , the Government extended this time - limit to DATE . Their decision affected CARDINAL properties , including \" Riddaren No . CARDINAL \" . At that time , the properties in question were not the subject of any city plan ( stadsplan ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government granted ORG a further extension of the expropriation permit ; this extension was applicable to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL properties originally concerned , including \" Riddaren No .

The City had prepared for PERSON a general development plan , known as \" City CARDINAL \" , which gave priority to street - widening for the benefit of private traffic and pedestrians .", "Subsequently , \" City CARDINAL \" , a revised general development plan for PERSON and ORG ( another district in the city centre ) , stressed the need to improve public transport by means of a better network of roads . Some of the sites involved were to be used for street - widening , but any final decision had to await a decision as to the utilisation of the orders . It was estimated that the revised plan , which was of the same type as \" City CARDINAL \" , should be implemented before DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG requested CARDINAL extension of the expropriation permit as regards certain properties , including \" Riddaren No .

In the DATE tax year the rateable value of the applicant \u2019s share of the property was CARDINAL NORP crowns .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government authorised ORG to expropriate CARDINAL properties , including \" ORG . CARDINAL \" , and set DATE , that is to say DATE from the date of the ORG request , as the time - limit for the institution of the judicial proceedings for the fixing of compensation . They justified their decision by reference to LAW plan which envisaged that a multi - storey car park would be erected on the site of the applicant \u2019s property .", "CARDINAL . However , work in this district was postponed and new plans were prepared for consideration . Believing her property to be in urgent need of repair , Mrs. PERSON requested the Government to withdraw the expropriation permit .

To sum up , Mrs. PERSON \u2019s property was subject to an expropriation permit and a prohibition on construction for DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . For DATE , spectacular changes have been taking place in the centre of GPE , comparable to those which have occurred in many cities which were reconstructed after being destroyed or severely damaged during the second world war .", "CARDINAL . PERSON is a district where most of the capital \u2019s important administrative and commercial activities used to be concentrated . DATE , the view was taken that the district should be restructured so that those activities could be carried on satisfactorily . For instance , a proper network of roads was needed .", "Furthermore , most of the buildings were decrepit and in a poor state of repair . A large - scale redevelopment scheme was necessary in order to provide suitable premises for offices and shops as well as to create a healthy and hygienic working environment . NORP expropriation , introduced by an Act of DATE which amended , inter alia , LAW , became the key instrument for implementing ORG plans . In DATE CARDINAL buildings were demolished . Some of the vacant sites thereby created were used to make new roads and others were integrated into larger and more functional complexes .", "CARDINAL . During the DATE \u2019s , town - planning policy in GPE evolved considerably . Far from being in favour of opening access roads to the centre , the city authorities were now trying to reduce the number of cars in the capital . This new policy was reflected in GPE \" plan , which was adopted on DATE . It makes provision for urban renovation based above all on gradual rebuilding that takes account of the present urban fabric and it envisages the preservation and restoration of most of the existing buildings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government , granting a request submitted by ORG in DATE , cancelled , as regards CARDINAL properties including those of the applicants , the expropriation permits issued in DATE and DATE . This was because it was by then considered unlikely that the GPE would need to acquire these properties in order to implement its new town - planning scheme .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the difficulties occasioned by the existence of zonal expropriation permits , it has proved possible to sell CARDINAL properties in GPE affected by such permits .", "CARDINAL . LAW is the main legal instrument of town - planning policy in GPE . For this purpose , it provides for the drawing up of master plans and city plans .", "CARDINAL . A master plan ( generalplan ) will be drawn up by the municipality concerned in so far as this may be required in order to establish a framework for more detailed plans . Its adoption is a matter for the municipal council ( kommunfullm\u00e4ktige ) , which may refer the plan to ORG - before DATE , to the Government - for approval ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . City plans are prepared for those urban areas in which this is deemed necessary ( LAW . A city plan is more detailed than a master plan : it will indicate the purposes for which the various areas may be utilised - housing , roads , squares , parks , etc . - and may also include more specific provisions on their use ( LAW ) . After adoption by the municipal council , it must be approved by ORG . In the course of this procedure , property owners have various opportunities to submit their views to several agencies and they may , in the last resort , challenge the decision adopting the plan .", "CARDINAL . In some cases master plans and city plans will be submitted to the Government for a decision .", "CARDINAL . In conjunction with - or independently of - these plans , the NORP authorities may resort to expropriations and to prohibitions on construction , measures between which there is not necessarily any legal connection .", "CARDINAL . As regards expropriation , the law applicable in the present case was mainly that contained in LAW , which was replaced with effect from DATE by LAW DATE ( \" the CARDINAL Act \" ) . Some additional matters were dealt with in LAW .", "CARDINAL . It is for the Government to decide whether expropriation should be authorised . Their decision takes the form of an expropriation permit and is based on the various conditions laid down in the LAW . Issue of the permit does not automatically lead to an expropriation ; it simply entitles a given public authority ( or , in exceptional cases , a private individual or a company ) to effect the expropriation if necessary . It leaves intact the owner \u2019s right to sell , let or mortgage his property , and is subject to a time - limit within which the expropriating authority must initiate judicial proceedings for the fixing of compensation , failing which the permit will lapse . LAW was silent as to the length of this time - limit and as to the extension of the validity of permits .", "The official statement of reasons accompanying the PERSON in which LAW originated drew attention to the disadvantages which expropriation permits occasion for property owners - uncertainly , restriction of the possibility of disposing of their property , difficulty in deciding whether to incur expenditure - , disadvantages which become more serious with the passage of time .", "For this reason LAW . CARDINAL of LAW of the CARDINAL LAW provides ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" Expropriation permits shall set a time - limit for service of a summons to appear for the purposes of judicial proceedings . The time - limit may be extended if there are special reasons . Requests for extension shall be submitted before the time - limit expires . If the owner establishes that the fact that the question of expropriation remains pending has occasioned significantly more serious prejudice , the time - limit may , at his request , be reduced . No decision to reduce the time - limit can be taken until DATE has elapsed since the issue of the expropriation permit . \"", "The expropriation is not completed until compensation has been fixed and paid . ORG has jurisdiction in the matter ; its decisions may be challenged in ORG and , in the final instance , ORG .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE , expropriation related only to individual properties ; each request for an expropriation permit described in detail the use to which the expropriating authority intended to put the premises concerned .", "The present applications involve another kind of expropriation , known as zonal expropriation . The relevant provision was introduced in DATE , by means of an amendment to LAW , and was repealed in DATE with effect from DATE . It was as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" If it is deemed necessary , for the purposes of public transport or town planning , to carry out a complete redevelopment of a densely - populated district and if such redevelopment can be effected only by means of rebuilding the entire district , the King may - where the redevelopment measures involve the adoption or modification of a city plan for the district concerned - grant the municipality the right to buy up the land needed for the redevelopment and also any land which is situated in the same district or in the immediate vicinity and whose value is likely to increase considerably as a result of the implementation of the plan ... \"", "DATE and DATE , provisions corresponding to this LAW were incorporated in the CARDINAL Act ; they now appear in LAW ( LAW , LAW .", "ORG expropriations were thus designed as an instrument for major town - planning schemes . The permits which they entail may be issued as soon as a new city plan is under consideration , that is to say even before detailed arrangements for its implementation have been worked out .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the transitional provisions of LAW , requests for expropriation permits submitted before this new Act came into force continue to be subject to the old Act .", "CARDINAL . Like the CARDINAL Act , the CARDINAL Act does not provide for any possibility of compensation for prejudice resulting from the length of the validity of , or failure to utilise , an expropriation permit . It does , however , contain one exception ( LAW , DATE , LAW ) : compensation is payable for prejudice occasioned by the issue of an expropriation permit if the authority or person to whom it was granted has instituted , but subsequently abandoned , proceedings for the fixing of compensation .", "CARDINAL . LAW prohibits any new construction that is not in conformity with the city plan ( LAW ) . It permits , even before , and until , such a plan has been adopted by the municipal authorities and approved by the regional authorities , the prohibition as an interim measure of any construction work ( LAW combined with ORG DATE CARDINAL Act ) . LAW provides as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" If a question is raised concerning a request for the adoption of a master plan for a certain zone or for the amendment of a master plan that has already been approved , ORG may , at the request of the municipality , prohibit all new construction ( nybyggnad ) in that zone . The prohibition shall remain in force until a decision in the matter has been taken by the municipal council , but not for DATE . Where necessary , ORG may , at the request of the municipality , extend the validity of the prohibition on contruction by a maximum of DATE at a time .", "Exemptions form the prohibition on construction referred to in the preceding paragraph may be granted by ORG or , in accordance with rules laid down by the Government , by the building ORG ( byggnadsn\u00e4mnd ) . \"", "The same principle applies where the authorities contemplate adopting a new city plan or amending an existing one ( LAW ) . The principle concerns only new constructions , but LAW states that the provisions on new constructions shall extend \" to such alterations to existing premises as may be classified as new construction under rules laid down by the Government \" . A rule to this effect appears in LAW ( byggnadsstadgan ) , which reads as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" The expression \u2018 new construction\u2019 shall mean :", "( a ) the erection of entirely new LOC ;", "( b ) the horizontal or vertical extension of existing LOC ;", "( c ) any rebuilding of the exterior or interior of LOC or any alteration thereto which , on account of its scale , may be equated to rebuilding ;", "( d ) the complete or partial conversion of LOC for a use substantially different from their previous one ;", "( e ) such alteration to premises as results in their no longer being in conformity with the adopted master plan , city plan or building plan ( byggnadsplan ) or the regulations on building activities in zones situated outside the areas covered by city plans or building plans : and", "( f ) any other alteration to LOC which , in their present state , are not in conformity with the above - mentioned plans or regulations , except in the case of residential LOC comprising not CARDINAL dwellings or of outbuildings belonging to such LOC .", "However , for the purposes of the present Article , the expression \" new construction \" shall not include the installation of central heating , water closets or other sanitary amenities in LOC which , even if such installation has not been authorised , are expected to remain in their present state for a considerable length of time . \"", "CARDINAL . In his report of DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) referred to the consequences of long - term prohibitions on construction and envisaged certain solutions ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" As for as can be ascertained from the facts , the property owners in the ORG and LOC cases can not have expected to reap any advantages from the town - planning scheme . This means that the scheme could not provide them with any compensation for the prejudicial effects that were clearly occasioned by the long - term prohibitions . If in such cases one does not institute some means of protecting property owners against the prejudicial effect of long - term prohibitions , then - in order to render the implementation of town - planning schemes less expensive for municipalities - CARDINAL or more property owners will themselves have to bear the prejudicial effects of a prohibition which has been imposed mainly in the interests of the community to settle questions of town planning within a reasonable time . Such a system is irreconcilable with the position that should obtain in a ORG governed by the rule of law .", "What arrangements should be made to protect a property owner against the prejudicial effects of temporary prohibitions on construction that remain in force for a lengthy period can hardly be stated without a thorough study of the problem . However , CARDINAL possibility would be to set a maximum time - limit for the validity of temporary prohibitions . Nevertheless , such a solution could hardly be regarded as compatible with current requirements , for difficulties over determining what form future development should take mean that long delays can not always be avoided . A preferable method would be to introduce a right for the property owner to seek compensation from the municipality for any loss he may establish or to require that it purchase the land once the prohibition has been in force for more than a certain period .", "There should , however , be a condition that the prohibition has been in force for quite a long time and has occasioned significant prejudicial effects that can not be compensated by the advantages which the owners could be expected to gain through the town - planning scheme .", "In view of the foregoing , my opinion is that there should be a study of the question of introducing protection for private landowners against the prejudicial effects of unreasonably long temporary prohibitions on construction . \" ( Justitieombudsmannens \u00e4mbetsber\u00e4ttelse DATE , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time when the applicants referred the matter to the ORG , LAW DATE and , in the case of the capital , GPE DATE provided for and regulated a right of appeal ( kommunalbesv\u00e4r ) against decisions by municipalities . These Acts enabled any local resident - with certain exceptions - to challenge a municipal council \u2019s decisions before ORG .", "Such an appeal could be based on the following grounds only : failure to observe the statutory procedures , infringement of the law , ultra vires conduct , violation of the appellant \u2019s own rights or application of powers for an improper purpose . The appeal had to reach ORG within DATE of the date on which approval of TIME of the decision had been announced on the municipal notice - board ; the place where TIME might be consulted was also indicated on the notice - board .", "Unless otherwise provided , ORG decision could , within DATE from its notification to the appellant , be the subject of an appeal to ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) .", "Almost identical provisions now appear in LAW DATE ( kommunallagen ) . They were slightly amended in DATE , with effect from DATE , in that the appeal now has to be made to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) and not to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned rules apply to a municipal council \u2019s decision to request the ORG to issue or extend an expropriation permit .", "On the other hand , they do not apply to a decision to request ORG to issue or extend a prohibition on construction : such a decision is , in fact , not open to any appeal to an administrative court .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , administrative functions devolve largely on administrative authorities whose decision - making machinery is independent of the Government : such authorities do not come under any ORG , and neither the ORG nor the various ORG may give them orders or instructions on how they should apply the law in this or that case .", "CARDINAL . It is often possible , however , to appeal to the Government against administrative authorities\u2019 decisions .", "Thus , a decision by ORG to issue or extend a prohibition on construction may be challenged by means of an appeal to ORG ( LAW par . CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Generally speaking , the NORP administration is not subject to supervision by the ordinary courts . Those courts hear appeals against the ORG only in contractual matters , on questions of extra contractual liability and , under some statutes , in respect of administrative decisions .", "CARDINAL . Judicial review of the administration \u2019s acts is , therefore , primarily a matter for administrative courts . These courts , which had their origin within the administration itself , comprise CARDINAL levels : ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tterna ) ; ORG ; and ORG , which was set up in DATE on the pattern of certain foreign institutions , such as the NORP PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat , but differs therefrom in certain fundamental respects . These courts are composed of independent judges appointed for life and , as a rule , they enjoy wide powers which enable them not only to set aside administrative acts but also to modify or replace them . In practice , it is very common for the lawfulness of such acts to be challenged .", "There is , however , an important exception to this principle , in that no appeal may be made against decisions of the Government .", "CARDINAL . Certain administrative cases - those with the most important political or financial implications - are reserved for decision by the Government as the first and last instance . Expropriation permits fall within this category ( see paragraph DATE above ) .", "Although LAW DATE ( f\u00f6rvaltningslagen ) is not formally applicable to proceedings before the Government , they must be conducted in compliance with a number of principles : the right of the person concerned to have access to all the documents in the case ; an obligation on the authority to inform him of any document added to the file and to give him an opportunity of stating his opinion thereon ; the right of the person concerned to express his views orally if he so wishes .", "Before the Government take a decision on a request for an expropriation permit , the request will be submitted to ORG which will prepare the file . ORG must , notably , give the property owner an opportunity to present his views on the request ; it will also hear such public authorities as may have an interest in the matter . After collecting the necessary data , ORG will transmit them to the ORG which will then be in a position to arrive at their decision .", "CARDINAL . Cases examined by the Government give rise to decisions which , as a rule , are not open to appeal . However , in special cases it is possible to lodge an extraordinary appeal , of limited scope , known as an application for re - opening of the proceedings ( resningsans\u00f6kan ) . Prior to CARDINAL DATE such applications - which may also relate to a decision taken by ORG in an appellate capacity - were made to ORG . Since that date they are made to ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW , of LAW ) . The grounds for re - opening proceedings are to be found - although the provision is not formally binding on ORG - in LAW , LAW ( r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , which reads ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" Once a judgment in a civil case has acquired the authority of res judicata , the re - opening of the proceedings in the interests of any of the parties may be ordered :", "CARDINAL . if a member or an official of the court has been guilty of a criminal offence or of misconduct in connection with the litigation or if an offence in connection with the litigation has been committed by a lawyer or legal representative , and if such offence or misconduct can be assumed to have affected the outcome of the case ;", "CARDINAL . if a document submitted in evidence was forged or if a party examined on oath , a witness , an expert or an interpreter made false statements , and if such document or statements can be assumed to have affected the outcome of the case ;", "CARDINAL . if there have come to light facts or evidence which , had they been put before the court previously , would probably have led to a different outcome ; or", "CARDINAL . if the application of the law underlying the judgment is manifestly inconsistent with the law itself .", "Re - opening of the proceedings on the ground referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above may not be ordered unless the party concerned establishes that in all probability he was unable to put the facts or evidence before the first instance or a superior court or that he had some other valid reason for not doing so . \"", "If , in a case like the present one , ORG accepts that the proceedings should be re - opened , it may either re - examine the whole case itself or refer it back to the Government .", "The very numerous decisions taken by the Government DATE in fact give rise to very few applications for re - opening of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the past , ORG and municipal bodies incurred no liability in respect of decisions which they took in the exercise of public authority , and no compensation could therefore be awarded for damage resulting from such decisions , although there were some doubts about the scope of this immunity . NORP law on this subject was derived from case - law , specific statutes and unwritten principles .", "DATE . The same law still applies on many points , but on DATE LAW ( skadest\u00e5ndslagen ) entered into force . This LAW consolidates and develops a branch of the law governing compensation for damage in extra - contractual matters . It provides that the ORG and the municipalities are not civilly liable for damage caused by their acts . It does , however , make CARDINAL radical change : the acts of the public authorities may now give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault or negligence ( LAW , LAW ) .", "However , the legislature imposed an important restriction on this new principle , in that , save where the decisions in question have been set aside or modified , an action for damages \" may not lie \" in respect of decisions taken by ORG , the ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL ) .
