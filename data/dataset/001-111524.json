In DATE GPE and GPE , the parents of PERSON , dissolved their common household and concluded a provisional agreement on the custody of NORP under which sole custody was granted to GPE , while his brother stayed with PERSON On DATE PERSON asked for custody to be withdrawn from GPE and transferred to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE and GPE agreed that pending the outcome of an expert report custody be provisionally transferred to PERSON ( vorl\u00e4ufige Obsorge ) and that for the time being NORP should live with PERSON , his father .", "CARDINAL . It appears that subsequently PERSON hindered contact between NORP and GPE and , in DATE , moved to GPE . Thereupon , by an interlocutory decision ( einstweilige GPE ) of DATE , custody of NORP was transferred back to GPE", "CARDINAL . PERSON was ordered to hand NORP over to GPE immediately or to take him back to GPE before DATE . That order was confirmed on appeal on DATE and became final .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon GPE travelled to GPE to have that decision enforced . PERSON proposed to GPE that they enter into an agreement on custody of NORP , and GPE also agreed to staying in GPE . However , no such agreement was finally reached . After GPE had settled in GPE and found employment there , PERSON , together with NORP , left GPE for GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pending the outcome of the custody proceedings , custody was temporarily transferred to ORG . On DATE the court dismissed PERSON \u2019s request for custody to be withdrawn from GPE and transferred to him . The decision was declared immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , various attempts to enforce that decision were undertaken . The NORP newspapers reported on these events because PERSON kept them regularly informed and sought publicity .", "CARDINAL . The first attempt at enforcement , on DATE , failed because GPE and NORP went into hiding . PERSON had informed the media of this step in advance . Some time later they returned . In order to enforce the custody decision the competent court scheduled a hearing for DATE in the course of which NORP was to be handed over to GPE PERSON failed to appear at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon the judge ordered that NORP be brought before the court by force ( zwangsweise GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . When that decision had to be enforced by court officers NORP barricaded himself in his elementary school and , since the police officers who intervened decided not to use physical force on the LOC of the school , this attempt also failed . These events were also widely covered by the media because PERSON had informed them in advance .", "CARDINAL . After further unsuccessful attempts the rural police ( ORG ) were informed on DATE that NORP was at his father \u2019s house . Court officers sent to the house noted , however , that NORP was not in the house but , together with a babysitter , in a car in front of it . The officers tried to take hold of NORP but he cried and resisted . These scenes were again the subject of widespread media coverage because they were observed and photographed by several journalists , who had been informed and had hurried to the spot .", "CARDINAL . In order to establish whether NORP had suffered injuries during the attempt to enforce the court order , PERSON took him to the GPE hospital . On DATE , by means of a diversion manoeuvre , GPE and NORP were separated and on DATE NORP was handed over to his mother , GPE , on the premises of the hospital . GPE and NORP have been living in GPE since that time . This final phase of the events was widely reported on in the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article was published in the applicant company \u2019s newspaper under the title \u201c Mother flees hospital with NORP \u201d ( \u201c Mutter fl\u00fcchtete PERSON aus Spital \u201d ) , which read as follows .", "\u201c On DATE TIME the child - care proceedings concerning DATE NORP from GPE took a very surprising turn : Whilst father , mother and son where still talking together over the sick bed in TIME , the mother suddenly snatched the boy ... , left the hospital via an underground passage , took a car that had been left at her disposal and disappeared . \u201c She is being taken care of on neutral ground and the boy is getting psychological support \u201d said PERSON from ORG . The father suspects the whole affair of being rigged .", "At lunch - time CARDINAL-year - old mother GPE had arrived at the hospital , hidden from the public . \u201c The boy was not afraid of his mother \u201d says children \u2019s advocate PERSON . Whereas the father claims that NORP clung to him and tried to defend himself against his mother .", "PLANNED After talks lasting TIME , the bombshell : GPE snatched her son when he was left unattended for a moment , and fled the hospital . \u201c The operation was authorised by the family judge \u201d explained GPE . Beforehand the older son , PERSON , had been taken to a psychologist and afterwards to the partner of the children \u2019s father .", "ORG suspects the operation of being a conspiracy : \u201c It was planned . They were only waiting for a good opportunity . \u201d He claims to have heard his son crying and then there had been a sudden silence . The father had sat for TIME next to NORP \u2019s empty sickbed .", "Friends and relatives of the father have announced a demonstration for DATE in front of the justice buildings in GPE .", "The whole country is now shocked about this family dispute . It was triggered by an attempt to take NORP away from his father on DATE . CARDINAL bailiffs tried to pull the boy into a car . However , he defended himself , screamed , bit and clung to the car . Since this incident NORP has remained in the children \u2019s hospital .", "Opinions in this dispute are very divergent . ORG tries to justify the conduct of the officers . \u201c In this case the ORG has acted in the interest of the child \u201d , explained the President of ORG , PERSON . The bailiffs had been ordered to seize the child without bodily harming him . This order was carried out accordingly .", "However , ORG has a different view on the matter . \u2018 The conduct of the officers was unacceptable and ORG , declares press officer PERSON . \u2018 This was practically ill - treatment of a ORG , said the GPE child and juvenile advocate PERSON .", "SPECIAL TRAINING The president of ORG , PERSON , suggests special training for bailiffs . She is a family judge and has never in her CARDINAL-year career seen such a case . ORG does not consider it helpful for a judge to be present when children are taken away from their parents : \u201c This would even reinforce the impression of ORG intervention . \u201d", "A report from ORG will be handed over to the disciplinary commission . The Minister of ORG , PERSON ( ORG ) , announced that an expert commission would be established in order to avoid escalations . And in the future he wants a judge to be present when compulsory measures are carried out .", "According to the Minister , the ORG in GPE acted in an appropriate manner ; however , the father had breached his obligation of discretion . Disputes in childcare proceedings should not be fought on the backs of the children . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A second article was published in the applicant company \u2019s newspaper under the title \u201c A dispute might now arise about NORP \u2019s brother \u201d ( Nun droht PERSON um NORP Bruder ) on DATE . It read as follows .", "\u201c After the tumultuous events on DATE the dispute over DATE NORP from GPE has for the time being calmed down . According to information from the ORG , the mother and the boy are at present accommodated and looked after in municipal housing in GPE .", "However , the future of little NORP , and whether and when he will leave with his mother for GPE , is still unclear . A tug of war might also take place over the older brother PERSON : ORG has custody over him for the time being in view of the current child - care proceedings initiated by the father . An investigation procedure is planned for DATE .", "ORG had applied for custody of all CARDINAL children . In DATE his custody applications for PERSON , DATE , and NORP were refused . The decision concerning ORG had been postponed . PERSON is for the time being staying with his father .", "ORG is , however , still at loss about the fact that his ex - wife fled the hospital with NORP . \u2018 I can not talk about it\u2019 , he stuttered on DATE , his voice trembling with tears .", "PERSON , a friend of the family who was present when the father and mother met at the hospital , said : \u2018 I saw the mother slap the boy in the GPE .", "IGNORED The fact that bothered the lady from GPE most was that the mother was only focussing on NORP : \u2018 She has cold - shouldered ORG . I do n\u2019t know why she is behaving like that and what her goal is.\u2019", "Neither the mother nor her lawyer want to answer PERSON \u2019s queries about this incident . PERSON , Chairman of ORG , considers ORG closed as far as the courts are concerned : \u2018 The judicial authorities are no longer involved . It does not concern the judge anymore . It is the GPE responsibility to take the next steps . The court has issued a decision and fulfilled its obligations.\u2019", "In TIME friends of the father started demonstrating in front of ORG . \u2018 Without wanting to get involved in the case in question , we would like to point out that children have a right to be heard and have their wishes and opinions respected\u2019 , says PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant company published a third article in its newspaper under the title \u201c The NORP case : \u2018 ORG authorities have to become more ORG ( Fall NORP : PERSON muss sensibler werden ) on DATE . It read as follows .", "\u201c A GPE judge has given the order to use \u2018 force\u2019 . \u2018 Appropriate force\u2019 in order to take a child away from his father and to take him to his mother in GPE . CARDINAL old NORP from PERSON The boy had fought against CARDINAL bailiffs on CARDINAL DATE . Alarming pictures show the end of the child - care proceedings .", "As reported , the results of the investigations of ORG are now available . ORG President PERSON says : \u2018 This case is also a wake - up call for the judicial authorities . We have to become more sensitive.\u2019", "FORCE In his interview with ORG defends the judge who ordered the officers , who are bound by his instructions , \u2018 to summon the minor with due tact , but without considering his wishes , and if necessary with due force\u2019 . He says : \u2018 That is the wording of the law\u2019 .", "This is not quite true . The word \u2018 force\u2019 is not to be found in the non - contentious act . \u2018 Means of coercion\u2019 are allowed by the law ; however , they have to be directed against the parent not respecting the judgment .", "But ORG also says : \u2018 This matter should never have been dealt with in such a way\u2019 . He wants the officers to be trained how to deal with children and how to talk to them . A disciplinary procedure against ORG judge is going to be initiated : the bailiffs contacted him CARDINAL times during that mission , should he have ended it earlier ?", "Judges are discussing the matter . Judge PERSON : \u2018 This case brings us to the limits of judicial activities , it is a tightrope walk\u2019 .", "Means of coercion have to be allowed for at least in cases where severely mistreated children have to be saved from an abusing parent \u2018 even when they still love their parents and do n\u2019t want to be taken NORP . However , NORP was definitely not in such a situation .", "ORG professor PERSON ( ORG ) says that this law will be changed , taking effect from DATE , and she further states : \u2018 The well - being of the child is the top priority . The new ruling stipulates that the judge has to discontinue the execution of his orders when the well - being of the child is in danger\u2019 .", "President PERSON thinks , on the other hand , that this is already the case DATE . \u2018 Even if this is not clearly written in the text of the law , there is such a thing as common sense!\u2019", "He does not only hope that the judicial authorities will act with common sense but the parents as well . They can fight their wars of the roses anywhere , but not on the back of their children .", "He considers that NORP \u2019s development is positive : \u2018 He was examined by a psychologist before leaving with his mother for GPE . The child has calmed down . He was curious about GPE and he was not LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . All articles were accompanied by photos of NORP . The first article was accompanied by a picture of NORP showing him with a distressed expression , clinging to his brother , and a similar picture accompanied the third article .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the articles published by the applicant company on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and the above events , PERSON , represented by his mother , brought proceedings under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW against the applicant company , seeking damages and publication of the ensuing judgment . He argued that the reporting on him had interfered with the intimate sphere of his life in a manner which was likely to expose and compromise him in public . Moreover , the articles constituted a breach of section CARDINALa of LAW , which prohibited reporting on the victim of crime in a manner which made him or her recognisable in public , which was only allowed if the importance of the offence or the persons implicated meant that there was a preponderant interest of the public in the information . Both applications were filed with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the action and ordered the applicant company to pay damages in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) , to publish the judgment in its periodical , and to bear the costs of the proceedings . The court found that the publishing of the above articles containing details of the custody dispute over DATE Christian W. had caused the intimate sphere of his personal life to be exposed in a manner likely to compromise him in public , in breach of section CARDINAL of LAW . Moreover , the article published on DATE had made the full name of PERSON public and had been accompanied by a photograph of him . Thereby the identity of a person who had been the victim of a criminal offence had been disclosed to a large and not directly informed circle of people without any justification . This was in breach of Section ORG of LAW . ORG observed further that all the articles had been accompanied by pictures of PERSON in which he , with a highly perturbed facial expression , was seen clinging to his brother .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that there existed a direct link between the events reported on and the public interest because of the harsh criticism voiced of the conduct of the court officials who had attempted to enforce the custody order . However , the person having custody of NORP had not agreed to the publication and the public interest in the events could have been satisfied without giving the child \u2019s full name and publishing pictures of him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed . Relying on LAW it argued , inter alia , that ORG had failed to take into account that on the issue of enforcement of custody orders there was an ongoing discussion in which presidents of various courts and the President of ORG were participating . Moreover , the Federal Minister of Justice had set up a working group of experts to draw up a report on the events of CARDINAL DATE . The press had been addressed not only by NORP \u2019s father but also by representatives of ORG , the courts and ORG , which had even held a press conference . In such circumstances it had been necessary to inform the public of the identity of the persons involved , and against the background of the public discussion the custody dispute and the preliminary events leading to the incident on DATE had also been of legitimate interest to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plaintiff commented on the appeal . He argued that the applicant company could not rely in its defence on the fact that organs of the judiciary had also commented in public on the events , because they had neither made public the full name of the victim and details from his intimate life nor published photos of him . Had the applicant company acted in the same way , its reporting would have been fully acceptable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the appeal . It found that there was no breach of LAW of LAW , because under that provision a compensation claim only existed if a media outlet had described acts by which someone had become the victim of a crime and if the description violated the victim \u2019s protected interests . In the present case , however , it was not the description of a criminal act that had breached NORP \u2019s protected interests . It reduced the compensation to ORG CARDINAL per article , altogether ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s criticism that ORG had not taken sufficiently into account that representatives of the judiciary themselves had made public statements . ORG had accepted that there was a direct link between the events reported on and the public interest . However , giving details from the plaintiff \u2019s intimate family life , giving his full name , and adding pictures of the plaintiff had transgressed into his intimate sphere as these details had been given merely in order to satisfy the lust for sensation and the curiosity of its readers .", "CARDINAL . Even if there was a link to public life , the media could only report on a person \u2019s intimate sphere to the extent necessary for adequately satisfying the need for information relating to those elements which were of relevance to the public interest . Reporting on events within the intimate sphere of a person must therefore be adequate to the occasion and proportional . In the present case it had not been necessary for the purpose of informing the public on alleged shortcomings within the judiciary , and it had not been necessary to expose in such an intense and striking way the severe strain being suffered by the juvenile plaintiff through the insertion of photographs showing his distress and despair , through mentioning his full name , and through setting out the details of his seizure .", "CARDINAL .
