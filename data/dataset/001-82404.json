THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , are GPE nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively , who are both resident in PERSON ( GPE ) . They have resided in the GPE ( the Realm in LOC ) for DATE , but not for a period of DATE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE and DATE respectively the applicants requested ORG of GPE ( College PERSON en wethouders ) to include them in the electoral register for the elections of members of ORG of ORG on DATE .", "By decisions of CARDINAL and DATE respectively ORG rejected their requests , as they had not been residents of the GPE for a period of DATE . Pursuant to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL sub A of LAW ( PERSON ) the applicants were thus not entitled to vote .", "The applicants filed an appeal against these decisions with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . The applicants alleged that ORG decisions were in breach of inter alia LAW No . CARDINAL , submitting the following argumentation . ORG is a co - legislature in matters concerning GPE ( hereinafter also referred to as : GPE political control over the establishment of general orders in council for GPE ( algemene maatregelen van rijksbestuur ) . ORG , of which ORG is a part , in fact also acts as a \u201c ORG \u201d , thus the elections of members of ORG of ORG imply also the elections of members of the \u201c ORG \u201d . In other words , the overlap between members of ORG and the ones of the \u201c ORG \u201d implies ipso facto an overlap in respect of the elections of members of ORG of ORG and the ones of ORG of the \u201c ORG \u201d .", "By final judgment of DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the ORG appeal , holding inter alia the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . GPE is composed of CARDINAL autonomous countries , the GPE , GPE and GPE . The relations within GPE and the duties and responsibilities of the different countries are regulated in the LAW [ for GPE ; PERSON het FAC , hereafter referred to as \u201c the Charter \u201d ] , which does not provide for ORG . The CARDINAL countries each have their own parliamentary representative body . The legislative power concerning GPE matters is exercised by the legislature of GPE Articles DATE of the Charter lay down the legislative procedure , providing for control over , and influence on , the legislative process for the representative bodies of the GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG are forwarded to the representative assemblies of GPE and GPE at the same time as they are introduced in ORG . These [ assemblies ] are empowered , prior to the PERSON being publicly debated in ORG , to examine the PERSON , to issue a written report thereon and to designate CARDINAL or more special delegates . Furthermore , the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the country in which the legislation is to apply \u2013 whose actions have to be accounted for in the representative assemblies of GPE and GPE \u2013 , are afforded the opportunity to attend the debate on the PERSON in ORG , to furnish information to the Upper and ORG , to propose amendments to the PERSON and to express their opinion on the PERSON before a final vote is taken . If , after the Minister PERSON has stated his or her opposition to the PERSON , ORG adopts it with a majority of CARDINAL of the number of votes cast , the proceedings shall be suspended and further discussions on the PERSON will take place in ORG . The same power is conferred on special delegates of the representative assemblies of GPE and GPE . Therefore , the LAW provides for a democratically legitimated contribution of the residents of the GPE , GPE and GPE on GPE legislation by the representative assemblies of the different countries , albeit that the contribution is not always organised in the same way in the countries . ( ... )", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It has been established that the appellants are eligible to vote in the elections of members of ORG . Therefore the rejection of their requests for registration does not constitute grounds to find a violation of the right laid down in LAW No . CARDINAL ( ... ) . That argument thus fails .", "CARDINAL . The appellants further argue that the rejection of their requests constitutes an unjustified difference in treatment , in breach of LAW . They are excluded as GPE nationals from the right to vote in the ORG elections , merely because they are residents of GPE , whereas GPE nationals who are also not resident of the GPE do have that right .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . This argument also fails . The legislature has chosen to grant the right to vote in elections for ORG also to GPE nationals who are not residents of the GPE , in order to guarantee that all GPE nationals have the right to vote for a representative assembly . In respect of residents of GPE it is not in dispute that they have the right to vote for the ORG of their country . GPE nationals who are not , or not any longer , residents of GPE are ineligible , or lose their eligibility , to vote in elections for ORG . In that respect the CARDINAL situations are not the same , so for that reason alone there is no unjustified discrimination , within the meaning of LAW . The fact that LAW grants the right to vote to GPE nationals who are residents of GPE and GPE and who have resided in the GPE for DATE , thereby enabling them to vote in the election of CARDINAL representative assemblies , is also not a circumstance which leads to the conclusion that there is an unjustified difference in treatment , within the meaning of the aforementioned provision . From the drafting history of Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Parliamentary Documents I , DATE , CARDINAL CARDINAL , nr . CARDINALb , p. CARDINAL ) it can be deduced that the legislature is of the opinion that a residence in GPE of DATE or more creates a tie with the GPE to such an extent , that it is justified to grant the right to vote in the election of members of ORG [ to this category of GPE nationals ] . The residents of GPE and GPE who comply with this criterion are therefore clearly distinguishable from those who have never resided in the GPE . As regards residents of GPE and GPE who have resided in the GPE for a period of DATE , it can not be held that the legislature could not reasonably have decided upon that criterion . \u201d", "Apart from the proceedings above , the applicants also started proceedings against ORG of GPE concerning the rejection of their application for inclusion in the electoral list for the election of members of ORG on DATE . In the course of those proceedings , ORG of ORG made a reference for a preliminary ruling to ORG of ORG . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment ( Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which reads inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While , in the current state of Community law , there is nothing which precludes the Member GPE from defining , in compliance with Community law , the conditions of the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to ORG by reference to the criterion of residence in the territory in which the elections are held , the principle of equal treatment prevents , however , the criteria chosen from resulting in different treatment of nationals who are in comparable situations , unless that treatment is objectively justified .", "\u00a7 PERSON Here , the relevant comparison is between a GPE national resident in GPE or in GPE and CARDINAL residing in a non - member country . They have in common that they are GPE nationals who do not reside in the GPE . Yet there is a difference in treatment between the CARDINAL , the latter having the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to ORG held in the GPE whereas the former has no such right . Such a difference in treatment must be objectively justified .", "\u00a7 QUANTITY At the hearing , ORG stated that LAW objective was to enable GPE nationals from the GPE residing abroad to vote , since those nationals are assumed still to have links with GPE society . However , it is also apparent from that ORG \u2019s explanations at the hearing that a GPE national who transfers his residence from GPE to a non - member country has the right to vote in the same way as a GPE national transferring his residence from the GPE to a non - member country , while a GPE national - resident in GPE does not have that right .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL NORP In that regard , the objective pursued by the GPE legislature consisting in the conferment of the right to vote and to stand for election on GPE nationals who have or have had links with the GPE falls within that legislature \u2019s discretion as regards the holding of the elections . However , ORG has not sufficiently demonstrated that the difference in treatment observed between GPE nationals resident in a non - member country and those resident in GPE or GPE is objectively justified and does therefore constitute an infringement of the principle of equal treatment . \u201d", "In DATE , GPE ( until then part of GPE ) obtained internal autonomy and became a country ( separate from GPE ) within GPE . The status of these countries and the relations between them and the GPE and towards the GPE as a whole is laid down in the Charter for GPE . LAW provides that the CARDINAL countries shall manage their internal matters independently . Therefore GPE has its own LAW ( Staatsregeling ) and its own Net and parliament , i d est the Parliament of Aruba ( GPE ) , which body has CARDINAL members , who are elected freely , by secret ballot and by means of proportional representation for a DATE term .", "The legislature of the GPE consists of ORG and ORG ( the Monarch and ORG ) together .", "Relevant ( excerpts of ) articles of the LAW for GPE ( as amended by GPE of DATE ) read as follows :", "\u201c DATE", "...", "CARDINAL .
