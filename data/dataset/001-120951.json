The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant married a NORP citizen , PERSON , and the couple had one son , ORG , born on DATE . The family lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a visit to relatives in GPE , PERSON did not return to the GPE and instituted divorce proceedings . The applicant initiated proceedings before the NORP courts in order to have LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) applied and the child taken back to the GPE .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG found that the retention of the child in GPE by her mother without the father \u2019s consent was illegal but refused to grant a return order under LAW . The applicant \u2019s visiting rights were regulated through a number of interim measures pending the divorce proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the pronouncement of the divorce of the applicant and his wife , ORG placed the couple \u2019s son with the mother . After appeals , on DATE ORG regulated by a final judgment the applicant \u2019s access rights in a way that he had access to his son DATE every month and was entitled to spend DATE of the DATE vacation with him , including the possibility to take him to the GPE . The mother was obliged to hand over the necessary travel documents for this purpose .", "The court explained that it was in the child \u2019s best interest to maintain emotional links with his father , which would become difficult should he be disconnected from the linguistic environment . In addition , the court , referring to LAW , found no evidence to support ORG supposition that the applicant would fail to return the child to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained to the GPE ORG that his access granted in respect of DATE could not be exercised on account of the mother \u2019s reluctance to co - operate . In reply , PERSON maintained that the son was sick and needed medical treatment .", "Despite assurances from the applicant that he would accompany ORG to all medical appointments that were necessary , the mother left GPE with the child for a place unknown to the applicant .", "The ORG established that the mother and son had not been available on DATE as regulated in ORG judgment . On DATE the ORG warned the mother that she might be fined for her conduct . The applicant for his part initiated enforcement proceedings with no success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother again failed to comply with the applicant \u2019s access right . On DATE the then competent PERSON ORG imposed a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) on her , ordering the handover of the child to the applicant on DATE . The mother stated that she would not comply with the court judgment as regards the child \u2019s visit to the GPE , since there was an international warrant in place to locate the child , which might impede his return to GPE .", "In the resumed first - instance administrative proceedings ORG ordered ORG to pay a fine and to reimburse the applicant \u2019s travel costs in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again requested the enforcement of the access arrangements . On DATE a bailiff ordered ORG to deliver the child \u2019s passport to the applicant within DATE . Nonetheless , she did not comply with this decision but handed over the child \u2019s passport to an employee of ORG on DATE . However , ORG did not transfer the passport to the applicant upon the bailiff \u2019s order but returned it to the mother on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the employee of ORG on charges of abuse of power . Eventually , on DATE ORG discontinued the investigation , finding no appearance of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established the mother \u2019s non - compliance with the access arrangements in respect of DATE and imposed a further fine of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for the overdue visit . Moreover , she was ordered to compensate the applicant for the costs incurred by travelling in vain . During the hearing before the ORG the mother reiterated that she would not allow the child to travel to the GPE since the father would obstruct his return to GPE . The mother \u2019s request for a judicial review was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant was otherwise able to have contact with his son in compliance with ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , both the applicant and the mother initiated actions before ORG in DATE , the applicant seeking , in particular , a change in custody and the official deposit of the child \u2019s passport . The mother requested a restriction on the applicant \u2019s access rights , removing his entitlement to take the child to the GPE . The cases were joined .", "On DATE the court rejected both actions . Nonetheless , the court allowed the applicant \u2019s request to have the annual summer visits moved to DATE ( in which case a missed opportunity could be substituted for by a visit in DATE ) and modified the scheme accordingly . The decision was upheld by ORG , acting as a second instance court , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The child \u2019s envisaged stay with his father , first scheduled for DATE and then rescheduled for CARDINAL DATE , did not take place . The mother stated that she would not co - operate in this respect , unless the applicant saw to it that the criminal proceedings allegedly initiated against her in the GPE were discontinued .", "On both occasions a police officer accompanied the applicant to the mother \u2019s flat , but his access right could not be enforced , since the mother had left with the child for an unknown place .", "The applicant \u2019s first request seeking the enforcement of his right to DATE visit was dismissed by ORG as premature , because he was entitled to reschedule the visit to DATE . However , subsequent to the omission of the visit in DATE , the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings , following which a penalty in the sum of HUF CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) was imposed on the mother by ORG . This decision was confirmed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it appears that the applicant \u2019s access to his son of DATE every month , as regulated by ORG decision , did not take place at least in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings against ORG in respect of the missing visit of DATE . Based on the mother \u2019s statement that she had stayed at home and been available on DATE in order to hand over the child to the applicant , his action was dismissed by ORG for GPE , acting as the second - instance administrative authority , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant initiated another action before ORG , again seeking a change of custody . In an interim measure of DATE , the court ruled that the applicant \u2019s access rights in respect of the DATE holiday should be exercised in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It limited his access rights to the effect that the access visits during the child \u2019s DATE could take place in GPE only , and this until the child \u2019s sixteenth birthday , explaining that the child was concerned about his father not bringing him back to GPE . The applicant was granted access visits for DATE during DATE , to be exercised in GPE as well . The court also regulated the exact DATE of DATE when the applicant was entitled to visit his son in GPE in DATE . It considered , among other things , that the child did not consider the applicant as being a member of his family , the disputes between the parents had negative impact on him and he seemed to be reluctant to leave for the GPE with his father alone .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision , rejecting the applicant \u2019s request to establish DATE of visit in a flexible way .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s petition for review is pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant rules concerning the enforcement of contact orders are contained in Government Decree no .
