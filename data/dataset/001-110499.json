The only difference was that this time the applicant relied on the LAW and international law . That being so , the grounds given for the previous refusal were still valid . It was stressed that the prosecutor in his actions , in particular in assessing evidence , must be guided by the principle of objectivity and must respect the suspect \u2019s defence rights . However , the prosecutor should first of all ensure the efficient and unimpeded course of the investigation . Since several other persons had been charged together with the applicant , the interests of the investigation required the prosecution to keep secret the findings of fact so far made in order to secure an undisturbed process of obtaining evidence and to avoid any attempt to obstruct unlawfully the outcome of the investigation . As regards the constitutional and international - law arguments advanced by the applicant , the prosecutor considered that they had a marginal impact in the context of this decision since it had a legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure .
