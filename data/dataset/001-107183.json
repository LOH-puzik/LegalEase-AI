The applicant is a NORP citizen of NORP ethnicity , who was born in DATE . He used to be the head of ORG . He has claimed that he left GPE on DATE . In DATE he took up residence in GPE , where he was granted refugee status . Resident in GPE are also his wife , his former wife and his CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a NORP public prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in regard to a suspicion that the applicant had committed genocide and crimes against humanity in GPE in DATE . In particular , the preliminary investigation concerned one of the crimes allegedly committed by the applicant , a massacre of NORP on DATE . The NORP police made several visits to GPE and other countries and questioned numerous witnesses but finally , in DATE , the preliminary investigation was discontinued because the prosecutor found that the evidence against the applicant was not sufficient for a conviction .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG received a request from the NORP authorities to have the applicant extradited to GPE to stand trial on charges including genocide and crimes against humanity . The NORP public prosecutor made a preliminary examination of the matter and presented his comments to ORG . On this basis , ORG asked the NORP authorities to provide it with further information about the alleged crimes of which the applicant was suspected and , in particular , supporting material ( such as forensic evidence and depositions ) . The reason for this was that , according to LAW , a request for extradition may be denied if the evidence in support of the request is deemed insufficient . The NORP authorities did not respond and no decision has been taken by the NORP authorities on the request for extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the NORP police had been informed by ORG in GPE that the applicant had visited them and that he was sought by the NORP authorities , the applicant was arrested in GPE in compliance with an international alert and warrant of arrest . The arrest order was confirmed by ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG on DATE and , on DATE , ORG decided , pursuant to LAW om utl\u00e4mning f\u00f6r brott , ORG ; \u201c the DATE LAW ) , to invite the NORP authorities to present a request for extradition by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE made a formal request for the extradition of the applicant to GPE for purposes of prosecution . It invoked an international arrest warrant issued by the Rwandan Prosecutor - General on DATE as well as an indictment according to which the applicant was charged with the following crimes , allegedly committed DATE and DATE : ( CARDINAL ) NORP genocide , ( CARDINAL ) complicity in genocide , ( CARDINAL ) conspiracy to commit genocide , ( CARDINAL ) murder , ( CARDINAL ) extermination , and ( CARDINAL ) formation , membership , leadership and participation in an association of a criminal gang , whose purpose and existence were to do harm to people or their property . Allegedly , during the relevant period , the applicant had acted as a leader for the PERSON militia . He had trained and encouraged other government - connected civilian militias to kill NORP , to cause them serious bodily harm and to plunder their homes . He had also transported and distributed weapons to members of the PERSON and other militias . He had met with local officials to plan and organise the distribution of weapons and had incited civilians to kill and rape NORP . He had prepared , trained , equipped and organised militias in his home town . Furthermore , together with CARDINAL members of the PERSON , he had been actively involved in the murder of CARDINAL NORP on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the arrest warrant of DATE and the extradition request of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP authorities referred to recent legislative changes concerning the criminal procedure and possible punishment in regard to transferred genocide suspects ( which are further described below ) . They affirmed their \u201c satisfactory assurances on human rights issues \u201d , claiming that , should the applicant be transferred to GPE , he would receive a fair trial in accordance with national legislation and in conformity with fair - trial guarantees contained in international instruments ratified by GPE . He would be tried , at first instance , by ORG and , upon appeal , ORG . In regard to detention , the extradition request contained the following information :", "\u201c If arrested , detained or imprisoned following [ his ] arrest and subsequent to the NORP jurisdictions , [ the applicant ] will be accorded adequate accommodation , at a prison which has been deemed by international observers to meet international standards . Transferred persons will be afforded nourishment and medical treatment , and will be treated in a humane and proper manner , in accordance with international accepted standards . \u201d", "In a footnote , the detention facility was described in greater detail :", "\u201c ORG in LOC has been designated as the primary detention centre . The ORG [ ORG for GPE ] has acknowledged , after visiting the Prison , that it meets international standards . A transfer facility has also been established at NORP central prison , and this facility will serve as a temporary detention centre for suspects appearing before ORG of the Republic . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , the ORG referred the request to ORG . Since the applicant opposed the extradition , he was granted public defence counsel . Moreover , on DATE , ORG decided to remand the applicant in custody on suspicion of genocide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor - General finished his investigation and referred the case to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) for examination in accordance with LAW of LAW . He attached his opinion , according to which there was probable cause for believing that the applicant was guilty of the crimes referred to in the extradition request and , DATE with the exception of the last charge ( CARDINAL above ) \u2013 they corresponded to crimes under NORP law , the extradition request could be granted . The Prosecutor - General further submitted that , although the investigation could give cause for some doubt , there were no impediments to the extradition as the situation in GPE was not so serious that the applicant \u2019s rights under Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL of the ORG would be violated .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant opposed the extradition and denied all of the charges against him . He alleged that the witness accounts which formed the basis of the charges were false and that there was a conspiracy against him . As concerned the alleged massacre on DATE , it had been investigated by the NORP police but the investigation had been discontinued as there was insufficient evidence against him . This lack of evidence applied to all the crimes of which he was accused . Moreover , in his view , the accusations were of a political nature as he was a NORP and he was convinced that he would be seriously persecuted if returned . The applicant further claimed that the NORP justice system was corrupt and dysfunctional and lacking in independence and impartiality . In particular , it would be very difficult for him to call and question witnesses in his defence on an equal basis with witnesses called by the prosecution . Thus , he would suffer a flagrant denial of justice in violation of LAW . He also referred to several decisions in which the ORG had found that there were impediments to transferring genocide suspects to GPE and noted that no other country had accepted such requests from GPE . Lastly , he invoked his poor health , stating that he had undergone a heart bypass operation and would be in need of another such operation within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG took its decision . It first stressed that the examination was limited to the question of whether there were any impediments to the applicant\u2019 \u2019s assessment that there was probable cause to believe that the applicant was guilty of the charges against him and that , since these crimes were also crimes under NORP law , it was permissible to extradite him ( exception was again made for the sixth charge for the same reason as above ) . The court further found that the crimes were not of a political nature and that , hence , this did not constitute an impediment . Furthermore , in regard to the applicant \u2019s NORP ethnicity , which had been of great importance when the NORP authorities granted him asylum , the court noted that the definition of refugee status had been expanded in many countries . The court then noted that neither the NORP decision nor the investigation on which it was based had been adduced in the extradition matter . The court however found that the NORP decision was DATE and that the evidence at the court \u2019s disposal did not support the assessment that the applicant was at a real risk of persecution due to his ethnicity . The court also considered that the applicant \u2019s state of health did not pose any problem for the extradition . Thus , there were no impediments under LAW to the extradition of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the examination under the Convention , ORG first found that the evidence at hand did not give reason to believe that the applicant would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to LAW upon return to GPE . As concerned Article CARDINAL , the court noted that , according to GPE case - law , only a \u201c flagrant denial of justice \u201d in the receiving country could lead to a finding of a violation against the extraditing country . Hence there was no requirement to ensure that the person would be guaranteed a fair trial in all aspects . Moreover , it was for the applicant to show that there were substantial grounds for believing that he would suffer a flagrant denial of justice . In the instant case , the applicant had given information about GPE and had submitted a letter of DATE from ORG ( see further below at \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and decisions by the ORG of CARDINAL May and DATE . He had also presented a decision by ORG of DATE and a decision by ORG in GPE of DATE , both of which declined to extradite some persons to GPE to stand trial . In this respect , the court noted that the NORP decision was based on ORG \u2019s decisions . However , these decisions concerned transfer of suspects from the ORG to the NORP national courts . According to LAW ICTR \u2019s Rules of Procedure and Evidence , extradition was possible if the tribunal was satisfied that the accused would receive a fair trial in the courts of the ORG concerned . This , in ORG opinion , was clearly a much more rigorous demand than that under LAW . ORG \u2019s decisions could therefore not lead to the conclusion that the extradition of the applicant in the present case would be in violation of LAW . In regard to the decision of ORG , ORG noted that , contrary to the lower court , ORG had found that the extradition of the persons in question would put them at real risk of suffering a flagrant denial of justice , with respect to both the difficulty of adducing evidence and the doubts pertaining to the independence and impartiality of the NORP judiciary . While this gave reason to doubt whether the extradition of the applicant would be possible , ORG observed nevertheless that , according to international sources and reports from ORG and ORG in GPE , the judicial system in GPE had made clear improvements after the above - mentioned decisions , although much remained to be done . For instance , a new witness protection programme had been launched and the punishment of life - time imprisonment in isolation had been abolished .", "GPE to stand trial on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity . The court then expressed that it assumed that consideration would be given to the need for further information before the Government made a final decision in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant should be extradited to GPE to stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity . However , it rejected the request in relation to the sixth charge . The Government first agreed with ORG that there were no impediments to the extradition under NORP law . As concerned the examination under LAW , the Government noted that the death penalty had been abolished in DATE and that life imprisonment with special conditions ( such as isolation ) had been abolished in DATE . A new prison had been built which was considered to reach an acceptable international standard and which , inter alia , was meant for persons convicted of genocide . There was also nothing to suggest that the NORP State sanctioned torture or inhuman treatment of convicted persons or persons suspected of serious crimes . Thus , extradition would not be contrary to LAW . In regard to LAW observed that the standards set by the ORG were more rigorous than the standard set by the LAW and ORG case - law . It noted that the judicial system in GPE had improved over DATE and that new laws had been promulgated during DATE to improve the witness protection programme and the possibility to hear witnesses who were not present in GPE . Hence , the Government concluded that the extradition would not violate LAW and therefore approved it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his extradition to GPE . On DATE the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL and , on DATE , ORG decided not to enforce the extradition until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the President of the ORG requested the ORG to reply to certain factual questions in accordance with LAW ( a ) of ORG . Specifically , the President wanted to know if the Government had obtained any guarantees from the NORP authorities that the applicant would receive a fair trial and be treated in a correct manner , if they knew where he would be detained and whether they intended to adopt measures to monitor and follow the future detention and trial of the applicant in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , sent following a request for information from ORG , PERSON , the NORP Minister of ORG confirmed the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If transferred to GPE , [ the applicant ] will primarily be placed in the LOC [ Prison ] during his pre - trial and detention during trial . ORG , however , may serve as a temporary detention center for him while appearing before ORG of the Republic .", "CARDINAL .

NORP authorities will be able to monitor and evaluate [ the applicant \u2019s ] conditions in GPE , in relation to his detention / imprisonment facilities , as well as in relation to his trial and proceedings conducted in GPE . \u201d", "PERSON also assured that the applicant would not be subjected to solitary confinement once returned to GPE . The Death Penalty Abolition Law ( see further below at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) excluded life imprisonment with special provisions ( i.e. isolation ) for those extradited from other states .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG released the applicant from detention .", "CARDINAL . According to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act , a person who in a foreign state is suspected or accused of or sentenced for an act that is punishable there may be extradited to that state following a decision by the Government . Such extradition may be granted only if the act for which it is requested corresponds to an offence for which imprisonment for DATE or more is prescribed by NORP law .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL lay down certain limitations . Thus , an extradition request may not be granted for certain offences committed by members of the armed forces or for political offences . Furthermore , a person may not be extradited if , on account of his origin , belonging to a particular social group , religious or political views , or otherwise on account of political circumstances , he would run the risk , in the foreign state , of being subjected to persecution directed against his life or liberty or otherwise of a harsh nature . Also , the extradition can not take place if the person in question is not protected against being sent to a state where he would run such a risk . Finally , a request may be refused if , having regard to the person \u2019s young age , state of health or other personal circumstances , the extradition would run manifestly counter to the demands of humanity . In the latter case , regard should be had also to the nature of the offence in question and the interests of the requesting state .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL stipulates that an extradition request is submitted in writing to ORG , accompanied by the documentation on which the request is based .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL , the Prosecutor - General gives his opinion in the extradition matter before the ORG takes a decision . If the person concerned does not consent to being extradited , the case is also examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL prescribes that ORG is to conduct the necessary investigation in accordance with the rules applicable to preliminary investigations in criminal cases . Coercive measures are subject to the general rules prescribed for criminal cases . However , there are also some more specific rules outlined in LAW , according to which a decision by a prosecutor to apply coercive measures must instantly be reported to a district court . Appeal against this court \u2019s decision lies directly to ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE and DATE , ORG submits the case and the finished investigation , together with an opinion , to ORG . ORG then decides whether the extradition request may be lawfully granted . A hearing is held if it is considered necessary .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the matter is reported to the Government when ORG has issued its decision . If ORG has found that there is a legal impediment to the extradition , the request may not be granted .", "CARDINAL . ORG has examined several cases regarding extradition of suspected criminals . According to leading ORG case - law ( see NJA DATE p CARDINAL , NJA DATE not NCARDINAL and ORG DATE s CARDINAL ) the scope of the court \u2019s examination is not limited to an assessment of whether there are impediments to an extradition prescribed in the DATE Act , but also includes an evaluation of the compliance of the extradition with the Convention .", "CARDINAL .

The government \u2019s stated goal for the gacaca system was to ensure that those who had participated in the genocide were brought to trial , furthering the ends of justice , ending impunity and promoting national unity . The gacaca law provides for reduced sentences , including community service , for cooperation , and credit for time served .", "CARDINAL . After a pilot phase when CARDINAL individuals were identified for prosecution for having participated in the genocide , the gacaca courts began trials nationwide in DATE . The trials have been public but there have been concerns about their fairness , among other things because of a perceived lack of impartiality and reports that defendants have not been given the opportunity to defend themselves . In addition , some courts have spent TIME hearing each case and poorly qualified , ill - trained and corrupt gacaca judges in certain districts have fuelled widespread distrust of the system . There have been reports of local gacaca officials and citizens abusing the process to pursue personal matters and settle grudges unrelated to the genocide , including making false accusations in order to acquire land . However , in some reported cases where judges had acted inappropriately , gacaca officials have intervened and held that the procedure had been illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the Government , ORG in GPE submitted , inter alia , the following .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the amendments that had been made to LAW , GPE was revising its DATE witness protection scheme so that witness protection would fall under ORG and not , as was currently the case , under ORG . It would apply to witnesses for both the prosecution and the defence .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was of the opinion that the independence of the judiciary was slowly improving and that there was no direct proof that judges followed political orders . In this respect , it noted that GPE was aware that it was being observed by the international community , in particular in extradition cases concerning genocide . As concerned detention conditions , the ORG observed that persons suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity were given priority by ORG and that their detention conditions were good . Again , as the international community followed these cases , GPE made an effort to ensure good standards . Furthermore , persons convicted under this law would serve their sentences in FAC which had been recently built in line with international standards . The ORG also noted that ORG had been created which had CARDINAL members , although CARDINAL of these were still in training .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL letters , sent to ORG and ORG on DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG submitted comments on NORP legislation and practice in relation to international human rights law .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , there was a serious risk that the applicant would not receive a fair trial in GPE , in violation of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . ORG referred to CARDINAL of its reports ( GPE : Suspects must not be transferred to GPE courts for trial until it is demonstrated that trials will comply with international standards of justice , DATE ) in which serious concern was expressed that people who were extradited there faced a real risk of being subjected to an unfair trial and to torture or inhuman treatment in detention centres .", "CARDINAL . Amnesty International referred also to the decisions of the ORG , refusing to transfer suspects to NORP national courts , and to the reasons given in those decisions ( see further below ) . It further stressed that no other country had transferred suspects to GPE but , on the contrary , had found it to be impermissible .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ORG and that court \u2019s case - law , a designated ORG may order referral to a ORG that has jurisdiction over the charged crimes and is willing and prepared to accept the case . In assessing whether a ORG is competent under LAW bis , it has to be established that it has a legal framework that criminalises the alleged conduct of the accused and provides an adequate penal structure . The penal structure must provide an appropriate punishment for the offence and conditions of detention must comply with internationally recognised standards . Prior to ordering referral , the chamber must be satisfied that the accused will receive a fair trial in the courts of the ORG and that the death penalty will not be imposed or carried out .", "CARDINAL . As regards the requirement of a fair trial , the accused must be accorded by the ORG concerned the rights set out in LAW . Those rights in essence mirror the rights laid down in LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG decided in CARDINAL cases to refuse the transfer of genocide suspects for trial in GPE . In the first case , ORG , ORG found ( on DATE ) that there were CARDINAL obstacles to a transfer : the applicable sentence would be life imprisonment in isolation without appropriate safeguards , the trial court \u2019s composition with a single judge involved a risk of its being unable to withstand direct or indirect pressure from ORG , and the defendant would not be able to secure the attendance of and examine witnesses on his own behalf under the same conditions as the prosecutor \u2019s witnesses . Following an appeal by ORG , ORG upheld ( on DATE ) ORG first and third rulings . However , it granted the appeal in so far as the second ruling was concerned : it found that the trial chamber had erred in concluding that GPE did not respect the independence of the judiciary and that the composition of the NORP courts did not comply with the right to a fair trial . With respect to the issues relating to witness testimony , ORG was satisfied DATE contrary to the trial chamber \u2013 that video - link facilities were available and would likely be authorised in cases where witnesses residing abroad genuinely feared to testify in person . However , ORG considered that such arrangements would not guarantee equality of arms \u201c if the majority of Defence witnesses would testify by video - link while the majority of Prosecution witnesses would testify in person \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL of the decision ) . It also shared the concerns of ORG in regard to the treatment of witnesses in GPE and their fears of harassment , arrest and detention . There were reports of murders of genocide survivors who had provided or intended to provide testimony in genocide trials . Moreover , there were justified fears among witnesses that their appearance would lead to indictments being issued against them , for instance for promoting \u201c genocidal ideology \u201d , a term laid down in LAW and given a wide interpretation by Government officials to cover an extended range of ideas , expressions and conduct , including those perceived to display opposition to Government policies .", "CARDINAL . In the second case , PERSON , ORG ( on DATE ) upheld ORG decision ( of DATE ) on the same grounds as in GPE . As regards witnesses inside GPE , ORG stated the following ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ORG considers that there was sufficient information before ORG of harassment of witnesses testifying in GPE and that witnesses who have given evidence before the ORG experienced threats , torture , arrests and detentions , and , in some instances , were killed . There was also information before ORG of persons who refused , out of fear , to testify in defence of people they knew to be innocent . ORG further noted that some defence witnesses feared that , if they testified , they would be indicted to face trial before the PERSON courts , or accused of adhering to \u2018 genocidal GPE . ORG observes that the information available to ORG demonstrates that regardless of whether their fears are wellfounded , witnesses in GPE may be unwilling to testify for the Defence as a result of the fear that they may face serious consequences , including threats , harassment , torture , arrest , or even murder . It therefore finds that ORG did not err in concluding that PERSON might face problems in obtaining witnesses residing in GPE because they would be afraid to testify . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that similar concerns applied to witnesses residing abroad , concluding that , despite the witness protection available under NORP law , the available information indicated that the defendant would not \u201c be able to call witnesses residing outside GPE to the extent and in a manner which would ensure a fair trial if the case were transferred to GPE \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The next CARDINAL cases \u2013 Hategekimana ( Trial Chamber , DATE ; ORG , DATE ) , PERSON ( Trial Chamber , CARDINAL DATE ) and ORG , DATE ) \u2013 contained virtually identical reasoning . It appears that no appeals were made against ORG decisions in PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG transferred several cases to GPE for further investigation and possible action . An ICTR press release of QUANTITY DATE stated as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL cases of persons investigated but not indicted by the ORG were transferred from ORG ( ORG ) to GPE for further investigation and possible future action on DATE . This action was undertaken in accordance with ORG CARDINAL , which urges that appropriate cases be prosecuted in competent national jurisdictions . Justice PERSON , Prosecutor of the ORG , formally handed over electronic and hard copies of the cases to ORG of GPE , Mr. PERSON . PERSON said that the transfer emphasizes the partnership between the ORG and GPE \u2019s national jurisdiction . He commended the NORP government for the improvements it has made to GPE \u2019s judicial infrastructure and capacity . Justice PERSON also noted his intentions to continue pursuing the transfer of further cases to GPE , including a number of cases in which the subjects have already been indicted , pursuant to QUANTITY . Mr. PERSON said that the transfer is \u201d a vote of confidence \u201d , in GPE \u2019s past and present efforts at improvement . He noted that GPE remains ready to receive any future cases from ORG . He also noted that though GPE , \u201c did not succeed in the past , \u201d the government has now addressed the concerns raised by the ORG \u2019s ORG . Mr. PERSON thanked ORG for its partnership and pledged to keep the ORG apprised of GPE \u2019s handling of the cases . CARDINAL case files have been transferred to GPE previously , bringing the total number of dossiers transferred to CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided for the first time to transfer an indicted genocide suspect for trial in GPE . In concluding that it was satisfied that the Government of GPE was now prepared to receive its first referral from the ORG , a ORG took into account the amendments that had been made to NORP legislation DATE and found that the issues which had led to the earlier refusals had been addressed to some degree in the intervening period .", "CARDINAL . As regards the possible punishment imposed on a transferred suspect , the ORG stated the following ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The ORG finds that the current penalty structure of GPE is adequate as required by the jurisprudence of the ORG as it no longer allows for imposition of the death penalty or life imprisonment with solitary confinement . The ORG is satisfied that the ambiguities which existed in previous LAW bis applications regarding the nature and scope of the sentence for accused persons in cases referred to GPE have been adequately addressed by GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It went on to draw the following conclusion as to the conditions of detention in GPE ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The ORG notes that adequate detention conditions are guaranteed by LAW and considers that the Defence submissions that the conditions will be inadequate in practice are speculative at this juncture . The ORG expects that the monitoring mechanism will conduct regular prison visits to ensure that both the detention conditions and treatment of the Accused in detention are satisfactory , and that it will immediately report any concerns to both the Prosecutor and the President of the ORG . Thus , the ORG is convinced that the Accused will be detained in appropriate conditions if his case is referred to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With respect to the main issue concerning the availability and protection of witnesses , the ORG first noted that it was not its role to determine whether the fears held by witnesses were legitimate , reasonable or well - founded but rather to assess the likelihood that the accused would be able to \u201c obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his or her behalf under the same conditions as witness against him or her \u201d ( as required by LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW ) if the case were to be transferred to GPE . As to witnesses residing in GPE , the ORG stated the following ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The Defence cites instances during DATE in which the ORG \u2019s defence counsel have complained that their witnesses were unwilling to testify because of fears of intimidation or harassment . [ ORG ] also refers to incidents in which defence witnesses in GPE have been jailed or victimised before or after testifying . Furthermore , many witnesses fear their appearance will lead to an indictment against them . Defence witnesses may fear being accused of \u201c genocidal ideology \u201d , a crime referred to in LAW but undefined under NORP law . It is the ORG \u2019s view that the concerns of witnesses within GPE regarding their safety have been addressed by changes to the law over DATE . ORG expects that GPE will ensure the safety of both prosecution and defence witnesses in a transfer case as has been stipulated in the new and amended laws .", "ORG notes the previous findings by ORG in LAW bis decisions that witnesses in GPE may be unwilling to testify for the defence due to their fear that they may face serious consequences , including prosecution , threats , harassment , torture , arrest or even murder . The ORG notes that in the CARDINAL genocide cases tried in ORG of GPE , the defence in most cases was able to secure the attendance of witnesses even without the safeguards available to cases transferred from the ORG . It is logical to assume that with the amendments made to the laws regarding witness immunity , the creation of a new witness protection programme , and the safeguards imposed by ORG , ORG finding that witnesses may be unwilling to testify is no longer a compelling reason for denying referral .", "Although the concerns expressed by the Defence are materially the same as those expressed by defence teams in past referral cases , GPE has shown the willingness and the capacity to change by amending its relevant laws over DATE . The amendment to LAW to include immunity for statements by witnesses at trial is a step towards allaying the fears of witnesses . This is complemented by the improvements made to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d which is sometimes also referred to as \u201c FAC ) and the creation of ORG ( \u201c WPU \u201d ) under the ORG as discussed below .", "The ORG notes that in cases before the ORG some witnesses are still afraid of testifying despite the provision of multiple safeguards . The ORG is therefore satisfied that GPE has taken adequate steps to amend its laws in this regard . The full implementation of these additional measures mandated by this Chamber would likely guarantee a fair trial for the Accused .", "The ORG further notes that the subjective fear of witnesses to testify can not be addressed without implementing adequate legal safeguards to allay such fears . Where laws can neutralise the reasonable fears of individuals , the ORG is of the opinion that they must be implemented and revised as needed . It is the considered opinion of this ORG that it is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of a reasonable law in the abstract . Accordingly , the relevant NORP laws must be given a chance to operate before being held to be defective . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG then addressed the situation of witnesses residing abroad and noted , inter alia , the following ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The NORP states that all of its CARDINAL witnesses living abroad have indicated that they were not prepared to travel to GPE to testify or to appear before any NORP judge who might travel to their countries of residence . The ORG notes that following the DATE amendments to LAW , witnesses may now testify in CARDINAL more ways in addition to providing viva voce testimony before the relevant High Court in GPE : via deposition in GPE ; via video - link taken before a judge at trial , or in a foreign jurisdiction ; or via a judge sitting in a foreign jurisdiction .", "At the outset , the ORG observes the use of any of these methods is not a right guaranteed to the Accused ( or to any other party ) . These procedures are intended as an exception to the general rule of viva voce testimony before the court , and whether to provide for any of these measures remains within the sole discretion of the trial court . The law is silent as to whether or not the adverse party can make submissions on such a request and does not establish any criteria that may guide a judge in his or her decision when facing such a request . The law also does not stipulate whether the decision on such a request is subject to appeal , and if so , under which conditions .", "The ORG submits that in the present case the reasons put forward by Defence witnesses in their affidavits may well be rejected by a NORP judge . For instance , it doubts that a judge would consider valid a NORP fear for his or her security if brought to GPE for testimony , the fact that his or testimony would incriminate ORG ( \u201c RPF \u201d ) , or that he or she does not trust the NORP judiciary . Although the doubts expressed by the Defence are relevant the ORG concludes that they are speculative at this juncture .", "With respect to the prospect that witnesses living abroad could testify by video - link , ORG has previously held that \u201c the availability of video - link facilities is not a completely satisfactory solution with respect to the testimony of witnesses residing outside GPE , given that it is preferable to hear direct witness testimony , and that it would be a violation of the principle of equality of arms if the majority of defence witnesses would testify by video - link while the majority of Prosecution witnesses would testify in person . \u201d However , with regards to the witnesses who live outside GPE , this ORG notes that , in addition to the possibility of hearing testimony via video - link , LAW amended Transfer Law allows testimony to be provided a ) via deposition in GPE or in a foreign jurisdiction , taken by a Presiding Officer , Magistrate , or other judicial officer appointed for that purpose ; or b ) before a judge sitting in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of recording such testimony .", "The ORG argues that for its CARDINAL witnesses residing abroad , a judge sitting on the case would have to travel to CARDINAL different NORP countries to receive their testimonies meaning that the Accused would be absent for almost the entirety of his Defence case . The PERSON recalls the right of the Accused to be \u201c tried in his presence , \u201d as stipulated in LAW ) of [ LAW ] . The ORG notes the amendments to LAW which provide the option of hearing evidence from witnesses located outside GPE in order to ensure their protection . Even in an instance where the Accused wishes to exercise his right to examine or cross - examine a witness who is testifying in another location , he could avail himself of the video - link facilities already in place . Thus , there is no apparent impediment to the presence of the Accused during the sections of the trial that would take place outside GPE . The ORG finds that the Defence argument that the Accused would be absent for the majority of his Defence case untenable and that the possibility that witnesses will testify outside GPE can not be regarded as prejudicial to the right to a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted with satisfaction that , in addition to the witness protection programme administered by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , GPE had recently taken steps towards the creation of a witness protection unit under the auspices of the judiciary ( \u201c WPU \u201d ) . However , the terms of reference and effectiveness of the new unit could not be evaluated as it had been established to assist witnesses in transferred cases only , and there had not been such a case yet ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the availability of defence counsel , the ORG noted that many members of ORG had more than five years\u2019 experience , that CARDINAL lawyers were enrolled in the ORG \u2019s list of potential counsel , that NORP lawyers were obliged to provide pro bono services to indigent persons and that there was a legal framework as well as a budgetary provision for legal aid . Consequently , the ORG was confident that defence counsel and legal aid would be available to the accused if transferred ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . While there were concerns about the working conditions for defence counsel \u2013 there had been instances of harassment , threats or even arrests of lawyers defending genocide suspects \u2013 the ORG noted that such incidents could be brought to the attention of the ORG or ORG and that LAW , as amended in DATE , granted lawyers immunity from prosecution for statements linked to their activities as defence counsel ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On the issue of the independence and impartiality of the NORP judiciary , the ORG was of the view that NORP judges , as professional judges , benefited from a presumption in their favour that could not be lightly rebutted ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The judges of ORG and ORG were considered qualified and experienced and in possession of the necessary skills to handle a transferred case ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the NORP legal framework guaranteed the independence and impartiality of the judiciary ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The submissions made in the case by the defence and by amici curiae in support of their contention that the judiciary lacked those qualities in practice , in the ORG \u2019s opinion , mainly concerned cases of a political nature and did not reflect the conditions of the trial or the charges faced by the accused ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . In addition , the information available to ORG did not give reason to conclude that the judiciary was unduly corrupt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of most of the above issues , the ORG noted that there were additional safeguards in the monitoring and revocation mechanisms available under LAW bis . It requested ORG ( \u201c ACHPR \u201d ) , which had already agreed to the arrangement , to monitor Mr GPE \u2019s trial in GPE and declared that the Commission should bring to the attention of the ORG President any potential issues that may arise throughout the course of the proceedings ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The ORG also emphasised that it was authorised to revoke the case from GPE as a last resort if necessary ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ended its decision with the following conclusion ( at paragraphs QUANTITY ) :", "\u201c Upon assessment of the submissions of the parties and the amici curiae , the ORG has concluded that the case of this Accused should be referred to the authorities of GPE for his prosecution before the competent national court for charges brought against him by the Prosecutor in the Indictment . In so deciding , the ORG is cognizant that it is taking a view contrary to the views taken DATE by ORG of this Tribunal where upon assessment of the facts before them , they concluded that those cases should not be referred to GPE .", "ORG notes that , in the intervening period , GPE has made material changes in its laws and has indicated its capacity and willingness to prosecute cases referred by this ORG . This gives the ORG confidence that the case of the Accused , if referred , will be prosecuted consistent with internationally recognised fair trial standards enshrined in the Statute of this ORG and other human rights instruments . ORG is persuaded to refer this case after receiving assurances that a robust monitoring mechanism provided by the ORG will ensure that any material violation of the fair trial rights of this Accused will be brought to the attention of the President of the ORG forthwith so that remedial action , including revocation , can be considered by this ORG , or if applicable , by ORG .", "ORG is cognizant of the strong opposition mounted by the Defence and certain amici curiae to the proposed referral . The ORG , however , considers that the issues that concerned the previous ORG , in particular , the availability of witnesses and their protection , have been addressed to some satisfaction by GPE in the intervening period and that any referral with robust monitoring would be able to address concerns that the Defence and the amici have expressed .", "Before parting with this Decision , the ORG expresses its solemn hope that GPE , in accepting its first referral from this ORG , will actualise in practice the commitments it has made in its filings about its good faith , capacity and willingness to enforce the highest standards of international justice in the referred cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Referral Chamber \u2019s decision has been appealed against to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Several requests by ORG for the extradition of persons suspected of various counts of genocide , crimes against humanity , murder or rape have been refused by the NORP courts . On DATE ORG of ORG declined to order extradition in the case of Bivugarabago . Following the ORG \u2019s approach in GPE and GPE , the ORG court considered that a NORP tribunal would be sufficiently independent and impartial , but that it would not guarantee a fair trial , in particular with regard to the appearance and protection of defence witnesses . Similar concerns led to extradition requests being refused by ORG of PERSON ( in the NORP overseas department of GPE ) on DATE in the case of ORG , by ORG of GPE on DATE in ORG and by ORG on DATE in GPE . The PERSON court reiterated the problems concerning defence witnesses and also found that the possible punishment of imprisonment for DATE in isolation contravened NORP public order as well as LAW .", "CARDINAL . More recently , the appellate courts of GPE and GPE , on DATE and DATE respectively , refused extradition to GPE in the cases of PERSON and PERSON . The GPE court found that the crimes of genocide with which Mr PERSON was charged were not punishable under NORP law at the time when they were allegedly committed and that the \u201c ordinary crimes \u201d listed in the extradition request fell under a DATE statute of limitations . The court further had regard to the DATE arrest and detention in GPE of NORP attorney PERSON , defence counsel for several NORP suspects , on charges of \u201c genocide denial \u201d and concluded that Mr PERSON , if extradited , would not benefit from fundamental procedural guarantees and the protection of the rights of defence .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the reasons for the refusals of the ORG to transfer cases to GPE , an appellate court in GPE / Main , on DATE , dismissed the requests for extradition of CARDINAL genocide suspects , PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG refused to extradite PERSON , a former NORP pastor , to GPE to face prosecution for genocide and murder . ORG referred to several ORG decisions and their conclusion that the right to a fair trial , in particular the right of the defence to call and hear witnesses , could not be guaranteed in GPE . According to ORG , it had neither any reason to question the conclusions of the ORG nor any grounds to assess the prevailing circumstances in GPE any differently than the ICTR . As GPE , by acceding to LAW , had committed itself to guaranteeing a fair trial to persons within its jurisdiction , ORG was of the view that NORP authorities could not , through their own actions , contribute to a trial in a foreign ORG which raised justified concerns as to whether the trial would be conducted in a fair manner .", "CARDINAL . Instead , on DATE , Mr PERSON was charged with genocide and murder before the NORP courts , on the basis of universal jurisdiction laid down in NORP law . The trial began in DATE and , on DATE , after hearing witnesses in GPE , GPE and GPE , ORG found Mr PERSON guilty of genocide and of having murdered or incited others to murder CARDINAL persons . An appeal has been made against the conviction .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government of GPE issued arrest warrants on suspicion of genocide in respect of CARDINAL men residing in GPE . Following an extradition hearing before GPE Westminster Magistrates Court , District Judge PERSON , on DATE , sent the matter to the Secretary of ORG who , on DATE , signed orders that the CARDINAL suspects be extradited to GPE for genocide proceedings . Appeals were made to ORG against the judge \u2019s decision and the Secretary of ORG \u2019s orders .", "DATE . On DATE ORG ( Lord Justice Laws and Lord Justice PERSON ) delivered its judgment ( PERSON and others v. the Government of GPE and the Secretary of ORG for ORG ) . While it did not contest that there was a prima facie case against all CARDINAL appellants , on the principal issue of whether they would receive a fair trial in GPE its assessment of the facts and evidence differed sharply from that of LOC . ORG stated ( at DATE ) that the legal test for the fair trial issue CARDINAL LAW was \u201c whether the appellants would suffer a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice if they were extradited for trial in GPE \u201d . While LOC had correctly stated that the burden of proving that there was such a risk rested with the defence , he had erred in concluding that the appellants had to prove this on the balance of probabilities . According to ORG , this was not the accurate meaning of \u201c real risk \u201d ; rather , the term implied \u201c a risk which is substantial and not merely fanciful ; and it may be established by something less than proof of a PERCENT probability \u201d , thus the same approach as that taken in refugee cases ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the issue of fair trial , ORG referred extensively to the conclusions drawn in the ORG transfer decisions . It noted that there was no specific provision in the procedural law of GPE for witnesses to give evidence via video - link and that , in the circumstances , there was at least a substantial risk that such facilities would not be available . Thus , ORG found it likely that the appellants would be unable to call supporting witnesses who declined to give evidence in person out of a professed fear of reprisals ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , having regard , inter alia , to a report by ORG of DATE and the testimony given by CARDINAL expert witnesses , ORG concluded that there was evidence of judicial interference by the NORP executive and that the appellants would suffer a flagrant denial of justice also in regard to the judiciary \u2019s impartiality and independence ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , the appeals of all CARDINAL appellants were granted and their extradition denied . They were released from detention and can not be tried by the GPE courts .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG refused to extradite PERSON , a former NORP minister , to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following the refused request for a stay of deportation by ORG on DATE , ORG , on DATE , proceeded to deport ORG PERSON to GPE to face trial on genocide charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG granted a request for extradition to GPE of PERSON , another genocide suspect . It first noted that there were reasonable suspicions against Mr PERSON for the crimes with which he was charged . It also considered that there was no reason to assume that , if extradited to GPE , he would be subjected to persecution that would threaten his life or freedom or otherwise be of a serious character . The court noted that the NORP police ( as well as , apparently , PERSON counsel ) had visited LOC ( where , if convicted , PERSON would be incarcerated ) and had found that the conditions there , including medical care , corresponded to international standards DATE a conclusion that had been shared by the ORG . Mr PERSON would also be able to receive regular visits from his family in GPE . The court thus concluded that the extradition would not run counter to humanitarian considerations or LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the main issue in the case \u2013 the fairness of the trial in GPE \u2013 the GPE court noted that improvements had been made in DATE to NORP legislation and administration \u2013 including the witness protection programmes \u2013 in an attempt to meet international fair - trial requirements . While PERSON counsel had claimed that problems persisted in practice in regard to the independence of the judiciary and the equality of arms , the court found that the legislative and other changes , as well as the possibility for observers to follow the trial , meant that there was no real risk that the trial would be unfair . There was thus reason to reach a different conclusion than that drawn in earlier ORG transfer decisions and in the judgment of the GPE ORG . The court also took into account that the NORP police had made CARDINAL investigative visits to GPE since DATE and had interviewed a total of CARDINAL witnesses in the country in regard to CARDINAL different cases . According to the report of the police , there had been no indication that the witnesses \u2013 whether testifying for or against the suspects in question \u2013 had been influenced or instructed by the NORP authorities to give particular statements or that they had been threatened in any way . Nor had any of the witnesses expressed a fear of the authorities or a reluctance to give testimony to the NORP police . In the court \u2019s view , these findings \u2013 together with the NORP witness protection guarantees and the alternative ways of giving testimony in cases transferred to GPE \u2013 indicated that Mr PERSON \u2019s fear that witnesses would refuse to give testimony on his behalf if his case were to be tried in GPE was not sufficiently justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE court further found that the ORG decision in the case of GPE had to be accorded great weight , in particular due to the ORG \u2019s knowledge of the conditions in GPE and since the threshold was higher for transfers from the ICTR ( the chamber had to be satisfied that the accused would receive a fair trial ) than for extraditions examined under LAW ( which were impermissible only if there would be a \u201c flagrant denial of justice \u201d ) . While the court noted that ORG had taken into account the monitoring it had ordered and the revocation mechanism it had at its disposal , the court stressed that the chamber had considered revocation only as \u201c a remedy of last resort \u201d and that it had generally been satisfied that the material changes in NORP legislation would render the trial fair .", "CARDINAL .
