During the first interview , the second applicant expressed the wish to live with her mother and to have regular contact with the first applicant , as she loved both her parents . The second interview was not successful , since the second applicant left the room in tears . ORG concluded that the second applicant was vulnerable and anxious ; a psychological assessment would therefore be helpful to her .

In ORG 's interview the latter stated that she had not allowed the second applicant to have contact with the first applicant from DATE on , as the second applicant was afraid of her father . The expert further examined the second applicant , who told her that she liked spending time with the first applicant . The first applicant did not attend the interview with the psychiatrist . After the examination , the expert concluded that O.\u010c. had been taking good care of the second applicant , who could be in danger only if she was exposed to the active phase of ORG 's illness . However , if O.\u010c. followed her treatment the prognosis would be good for her . As far as the contact between the applicants is concerned she established that they should continue to have contact as they have up to now , or even spend more time together if the second applicant so wished . However , in the expert 's view , the first applicant should be more creative and should share more activities with the second applicant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the court was informed that the first applicant had been told by ORG that it could not ensure that contact would take place in the way the court had determined it should .

She also said that after the first applicant took her to the hairdresser to have her hair cut , she had refused to see him on CARDINAL occasions .
