On DATE GPE , the applicant \u2019s husband , a high ranking tax police officer , was arrested on suspicion of having committed various offences of fraud . He was remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE PERSON was accused of further serious crimes , including forming and leading a criminal association in order to smuggle alcohol and cigarettes in large quantities .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a criminal investigator froze certain property belonging to GPE , his mother and the applicant . The mother appealed against that decision , pursuant to LAW and practice part below ) . As a result , on ORG of GPE released some of her assets \u2013 an apartment , a garage and a plot of land DATE the seizure of which was deemed to have been unreasonable . The court noted , however , that the caf\u00e9 and shares in a telecommunications company which had been in the possession of the mother of PERSON was property acquired as a result of his criminal activities . The seizure of those items was upheld .", "The applicant did not appeal against the seizure of her property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a prosecutor approved a bill of indictment against GPE and CARDINAL of his accomplices , PERSON , GPE and GPE The case was transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON committed suicide in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant and the mother of PERSON requested the court to continue the case to enable his rehabilitation . DATE ORG decided to continue the proceedings in so far as they concerned the activities of the criminal association organised by the applicant \u2019s late husband . The court appointed a lawyer to defend the interests of the deceased .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received a request from the applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother to discontinue the criminal proceedings . By a ruling of DATE the court dismissed that request , noting that it had already started examining the evidence in the case . It observed that , without having examined the evidence , the court could not establish whether grounds existed to rehabilitate GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted its judgment . It noted that there were no grounds on which PERSON could be exculpated . On the contrary , the court found sufficient evidence to prove that the applicant \u2019s husband , being a ORG official , had indeed organised and led a criminal association for smuggling purposes DATE . The offenders had succeeded in passing contraband on CARDINAL occasions . However , in view of GPE \u2019s death , the court decided to discontinue the proceedings against him . CARDINAL of his co - accused , PERSON , GPE and GPE , were convicted and sentenced to prison sentences ranging from DATE . CARDINAL other co - accused were released from criminal liability because they had cooperated with the authorities and contributed to discovering the crimes .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the confiscation of certain items of property on the ground that they had been acquired as a result of GPE \u2019s criminal activities ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . In particular , the court ordered confiscation of the applicant \u2019s apartment in GPE . The court established that the applicant had bought the apartment in DATE , having obtained a sham loan of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) from the mother of GPE The applicant \u2019s shares in a telecommunications company , to the value of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , were also to be confiscated on the ground that they had been obtained through an off - shore company which the criminal organisation used to hide the proceeds of its crimes . The trial court also ordered confiscation of a caf\u00e9 belonging to ORG mother as well as certain other items . Nonetheless , it lifted the seizure of a plot of land , a garden house , and some money and furniture that belonged to the applicant , given that there was no evidence of the illicit origin of that property . For the same reason , the seizure of flats and plots of land belonging to ORG parents was also lifted . Lastly , the trial court ordered confiscation of ORG car on the ground that it had been used as a means to smuggle goods ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "The reasons why each item of seized property should or should not be confiscated were set out in CARDINAL pages of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Considering that the trial court \u2019s judgment was erroneous , PERSON \u2019s family hired another lawyer , PERSON , to prepare an appeal . As the applicant wrote in her application to the ORG , from that moment the lawyer PERSON \u201c de facto represented all persons [ who were affected by the confiscation measure ] \u201d . Appeals were also lodged by the prosecutor and CARDINAL convicted persons .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal the lawyer PERSON contended that the criminal proceedings should have been discontinued after PERSON \u2019s death . He also argued , mentioning each item of confiscated property , that those assets had been obtained from legitimate sources and thus the confiscation was unlawful . As concerns the applicant , PERSON averred that there was no proof to find that the apartment and shares in the telecommunications company , both registered in her name , had been obtained from the proceeds of the crimes . For the lawyer , the trial court \u2019s conclusions about the circumstances in which the applicant had acquired the apartment and the shares were factually and legally erroneous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment . The appellate court emphasised that the persons convicted had acted as an organised group ( nusikalstamas susivienijimas ) which was the most dangerous form of conspiracy ( bendrininkavimas ) . The group \u2019s criminal activity had lasted DATE , was conducted systematically and did great harm to the ORG . The value of smuggled goods was CARDINAL of NORP litai . Taking into account the scale , its systematic nature and the organisational level of the criminal activity , the case could be viewed as exceptional .", "CARDINAL . On the issue of confiscated property ORG noted that of all persons whose property had been confiscated , only PERSON \u2019s parents - in - law had testified before the trial court . Even so , they could not explain how they had obtained that property . Furthermore , ORG conspirator PERSON had confirmed that his GPE financial situation was not good and he could not explain financial transactions by his mother .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant , ORG also noted that she was well aware of the criminal activities of her husband \u2019s criminal association :", "\u201c Even though ORG wife ORG herself has not been charged [ in this case ] , the examined evidence leaves no doubt that she was well aware of her spouse \u2019s and the other co - accuseds\u2019 criminal activities . ... ORG was informed each time smuggled goods were loaded or unloaded as well as about the sale of those goods . ... There is evidence that PERSON herself received money which had been paid for smuggled goods . ... Consequently , PERSON without any doubt knew that property which the [ trial ] court confiscated and which had been registered in her name previously had been obtained as a result of criminal activities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court also dismissed the argument by the lawyer PERSON that confiscation was not possible because criminal proceedings against PERSON had been discontinued . LAW obliged the court to confiscate property which was the proceeds of crime , if third persons to whom the property had been transferred knew about the unlawful origin of that property . Confiscation was in no way linked to whether those third persons had been charged with a crime or convicted . On the contrary , pursuant to the aforementioned provision , confiscation of the proceeds of the crime had to be ordered both when imposing a punishment and when a person has been released from criminal liability and even in the event that he or she had not even been charged with a crime .", "CARDINAL . ORG also held :", "\u201c ... PERSON \u2019s lawyer has unreasonably linked the confiscation of all the property listed in the judgment with the fact that the proceedings had been discontinued against PERSON However , it has been forgotten that not only GPE but also other persons had been charged in the criminal proceedings in question . Those other persons had smuggled goods together with PERSON , and the illicit gains had been obtained together . Some of those co - accused had been released from criminal liability , but CARDINAL of the co - accused , PERSON , GPE and GPE , were convicted . For LAW of LAW to be applied , it was not important that the third persons to whom the property had been transferred should be family members or relatives of the person who committed the crime . Moreover , even presuming that it was PERSON who had transferred the property to his wife , his parents and his parents - in - law , it did not mean that that property had been obtained from the criminal activity of him alone . In the present case that property had been obtained as a result of the criminal activities of all co - accused , including those who had been convicted . Furthermore , GPE , who was PERSON \u2019s cousin , had played a very important role in the activities of the criminal organisation . Accordingly , the persons to whom the confiscated property had been transferred were connected by family links not only to PERSON , who died , but also to GPE , who was convicted . These circumstances totally rebut the appellant \u2019s contention that the property had been confiscated after the proceedings had been discontinued , because in reality confiscation had been ordered after [ the trial court ] adopted an accusatory judgment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the appellate court pointed out that the trial court had exceptionally thoroughly set out the reasons why particular items had to be confiscated . In setting out its conclusions the trial court had relied on extensive analysis of the evidence examined in court , devoting a whole chapter of the judgment , CARDINAL pages in length , to that . In the appellate court \u2019s view , the trial court \u2019s findings had been reasonable . Even so , the appellate court again went through the evidence and upheld the trial court \u2019s findings , dismissing PERSON \u2019s arguments to the effect that the CARDINAL confiscated items in the applicant \u2019s ownership had a lawful provenance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The lawyer PERSON submitted an appeal on points of law . He contended , first , that the criminal proceedings against PERSON should have been discontinued after his death and that confiscation of property was possible only if an accusatory judgment had been adopted . Secondly , he alleged that the property , the confiscation of which had been ordered by the trial court , including that of the applicant , did not meet the requirements of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In his submission , no fault of third person whose property was confiscated had been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law . As regards the confiscation of property , ORG ruled that confiscation as a penal measure ( baud\u017eiamojo poveikio priemon\u0117 ) could be applied independently of whether the procedure had been concluded by acquittal or conviction , and even in cases where a person had not been charged with a crime ( kai asmuo netraukiamas baud\u017eiamojon atsakomyb\u0117n ) . ORG emphasised that it was a court \u2019s duty to confiscate property which fell under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . It was noted that , in its judgment , the trial court had thoroughly reasoned its choice as to which items of property should be confiscated as being the proceeds of illegal activities . ORG acknowledged that most of that property had been found in the possession of third persons . However , given the trial court \u2019s conclusion that those persons knew or should have known about the illicit funding of the items concerned , it was lawful to confiscate them even though those persons had not been charged in the criminal proceedings against GPE and the criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE of ORG the applicant was convicted of misappropriating property and falsifying documents . The court established that she was actively involved in organising unlawful money transfers to off - shore companies used by the criminal organisation led by her late husband , so that the money was hidden . She fully confessed that she had committed the crimes with the aim of helping her husband avoid criminal liability while he was in detention . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The mother of the applicant \u2019s late husband was convicted of falsifying documents and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The court noted that she was merely executing the orders of the applicant , but that they had the common goal of helping GPE", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and her late husband \u2019s mother were pardoned under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure at the relevant time provided that a pre - trial investigator could freeze the assets of an accused , or assets which were acquired in a criminal manner but later were in a third party \u2019s possession , so as to protect a potential civil claim or confiscation order ( LAW ) . Appeals lay against such orders of investigators to CARDINAL court instances ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As concerns confiscation of property , at the material time the Criminal Code provided :", "CARDINAL . Confiscation of property shall be the compulsory uncompensated taking into the ownership of a ORG of any form of property subject to confiscation and held by the offender , his accomplice or other persons .", "CARDINAL .

When ordering confiscation of property , a court must specify the items subject to confiscation or the monetary value of the property subject to confiscation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the legal systems of ORG the concept of \u201c confiscation \u201d generally refers to a measure the effect of which is permanent deprivation of property by way of transfer of that property to the ORG . CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) provide for confiscation orders regardless of conviction . This type of confiscation order generally covers property that has been acquired though unlawful activities . As long as the origin can not be justified , confiscation of such property may be imposed . Criminal liability of the offender is not relevant for the purposes of the confiscation order . For example , in GPE a court may order the confiscation of the proceeds of the crime despite the fact that the proceedings have been discontinued , as long as it can be established that a wrongful act has indeed been committed .", "CARDINAL . Five States ( GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE and GPE ) in principle require conviction as a prerequisite for confiscation whilst allowing for some exceptions to the general rule . In GPE , if it is established or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed the offence , confiscation of property acquired through that offence is permitted , even if the suspect is not ultimately convicted because of his or her death . GPE and GPE allow confiscation of property which constitutes material evidence in limited circumstances . In the GPE , as a rule , a confiscation order will not be available upon the death of the accused . However , confiscation of the property that has already been seized can be imposed if it is plausible that the deceased had indeed committed an economic crime .", "CARDINAL States ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) strictly rule out the possibility of confiscation without conviction .", "CARDINAL . Confiscation of property which is the proceeds of a crime may be imposed without conviction in certain circumstances either against third parties in general , or against family members in particular ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Knowledge of the illicit origin of the property , failure to justify its origin , the type of crime at issue and whether or not the third party is a fictitious owner are CARDINAL most common circumstances in which a confiscation order may be made against property belonging to family members of an accused regardless of their conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ORG , Search , LAW ( DATE ) . The ORG aimed to facilitate international co - operation and mutual assistance in investigating crime and tracking down , seizing and confiscating the proceeds thereof .
