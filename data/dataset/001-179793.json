The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a member of ORG ( Front Islamique du Salut \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and left GPE prior to the dissolution of that political group by a judgment of ORG dated DATE . After spending some time in GPE he entered GPE in DATE using the false name of PERSON . On DATE he applied for political asylum in that country , claiming to have been forced to leave GPE because of his membership of the ORG . His application was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE eight terrorist attacks were carried out in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Although no organisation explicitly claimed responsibility , certain factors , such as the existence of virulent press statements against GPE and the mode of operation of the attacks , pointed to the involvement of ORG ( ORG \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the judicial investigation aimed at identifying the perpetrators , telephone tapping operations carried out on public payphones used by a certain PERSON led to a number of persons being arrested and to the search being focused on GPE and an individual named PERSON ( also known as ORG or ORG ) . The sources of these names or pseudonyms were a telephone conversation of CARDINAL DATE concerning PERSON and the Western Union bank , a search of PERSON \u2019s home during which a document was found showing that a sum of money had been transferred to PERSON from that bank on DATE , and the decoding of a list of telephone numbers found on PERSON \u2019s person and at his home and featuring CARDINAL numbers in GPE preceded by the name \u201c ORG \u201d or \u201c ORG \u201d . PERSON , who was arrested on DATE , also directly implicated \u201c PERSON , claiming that he had funded the campaign of attacks from GPE and had been kept informed of their progress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the French National Surveillance Directorate informed the investigators that the individual known as \u201c PERSON , GPE , GPE , GPE , ORG or ORG \u201d , whom PERSON had identified as having funded the attacks , might be the applicant . The latter , who was living in GPE , was suspected of being one of the leaders of the PERSON in GPE , in particular because of his involvement with the publication PERSON ( or PERSON ) which the ORG used as a mouthpiece abroad .", "CARDINAL . The investigations carried out in GPE established that the applicant had a home there and had a set of keys to a second GPE address , which served as the offices of the magazine PERSON and as a meeting place for all the persons involved in publishing and distributing it . On the LOC the investigators found , among other items , the following : contracts for CARDINAL mobile phones in the names of CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 acquaintances and corresponding to the numbers identified at the home of PERSON , who had rung the numbers before and after each attack ; a receipt for the rental of a post - office box in the name of Fares ELIASS with the applicant \u2019s fingerprints on it ; letters and statements from the ORG ; a statement saying that only the PERSON was entitled to conduct the jihad ; a letter from the ORG to the NORP President calling on him to convert to ORG ; a letter commenting on the attacks carried out in GPE ; copies of press articles on anti - terrorism mentioning the names of judges and members of the intelligence service ; a piece of paper on which \u201c FAC DATE - CARDINAL \u201d was written , corresponding to the telephone number of ORG branch at CARDINAL FAC in GPE ; and a receipt dated DATE issued by a branch of PERSON in GPE for a sum of MONEY ( GBP ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was arrested and placed in police custody from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was detained pending extradition under the terms of an international arrest warrant issued on DATE in connection with the investigation into the attack carried out on DATE close to the ORG metro station .", "CARDINAL . Three further international arrest warrants were issued concerning the applicant : on DATE in relation to the attack of CARDINAL DATE at the PERSON d\u2019Orsay station ; on DATE in the case concerning a conspiracy to prepare terrorist attacks ; and on DATE in relation to the attack carried out on DATE at the PERSON suburban rail station .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged habeas corpus applications which were dismissed in DATE and in DATE . On DATE the NORP Home Secretary ordered his removal to GPE , but that order was quashed by ORG , ORG , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Home Secretary signed a fresh order for the applicant \u2019s extradition in the light of the assurances provided by the NORP authorities concerning the safeguards of a fair and impartial trial in GPE . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was handed over to the NORP authorities and was remanded in custody the following day .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was committed for trial in ORG for involvement \u2013 in GPE and in GPE , from an unspecified date until DATE in an association or conspiracy formed with a view to the preparation , in the form of CARDINAL or more material acts , of CARDINAL of the terrorist acts in question . The investigating judge stated , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c - [ the applicant ] was responsible for distributing the journal PERSON , a propaganda outlet of ORG ;", "- ... was involved on this account in disseminating propaganda for that organisation , which is banned in GPE ;", "- ... was the main contact person in LOC for [ GPE ] , alias PERSON , in organising and carrying out the ORG \u2019s activities in LOC ;", "- ... was tasked with sending money to ORG members still in GPE to enable them to fund and carry out attacks ;", "- ... was in contact with numerous persons involved in and convicted of criminal conspiracy with a view to a terrorist enterprise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE accompanied by CARDINAL pages of reasoning , ORG first of all set out the facts with regard to the \u201c political / religious background \u201d , the emergence of the ORG and then the ORG , the \u201c background to the attacks \u201d in DATE which it listed and described as attributable in all likelihood to the GIA \u2013 and the \u201c context surrounding PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Ruling on the criminal charges , the court began by examining the case against the applicant . It found that it could be established with certainty , on the basis of precise and concurring physical evidence , that the applicant had indeed used various false names and aliases which had come up in the course of the investigations , a fact the court described as \u201c beyond doubt and indisputable \u201d . With regard to the ORG \u2019s funding the court , having noted the prosecution \u2019s claims that the applicant had funded the ORG groups which carried out the attacks in GPE during DATE , examined the factual evidence in the case file at length and in detail . It observed in particular that , according to CARDINAL witness who was a ORG member , the organisation \u2019s groups had different specialisations depending on their location , with the GPE group being responsible for sending funds . The court further noted that the applicant had transferred GBP CARDINAL on DATE , DATE before the attack of CARDINAL DATE . This was established by the statements of the NORP police officers tasked with keeping the applicant under surveillance and of the staff of ORG branch where the transfer had been made , and also by the discovery of the applicant \u2019s fingerprints on the transfer slip kept by ORG branch . The court also observed that one of the perpetrators of the attacks , PERSON , had stated that the money used in preparing the various attacks had always been supplied by the applicant from GPE . The court inferred that the facts as a whole \u201c demonstrate[d ] that PERSON was indeed responsible for funding terrorist groups on NORP soil \u201d . Furthermore , in response to the public prosecutor \u2019s submissions concerning the applicant \u2019s role in disseminating PERSON propaganda , the first - instance court also considered the various items of factual evidence before it , and in particular the wealth of correspondence and propaganda documents relating to the ORG \u2019s views and actions that had been found during the searches of the various premises used by the applicant , as well as the statements by a ORG member confirming the applicant \u2019s role as a member of the team publishing the magazine PERSON , which was the ORG outlet used in particular to claim responsibility for attacks . It also noted the presence at the applicant \u2019s home of pamphlets promoting terrorism and killing with specific reference to GPE . The court concluded that the applicant had played a part in disseminating ORG propaganda and ideas .", "CARDINAL . Turning next to the applicant \u2019s involvement in a criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist enterprise , the court found this offence to have been made out , as the investigation had shown that several groups located in the LOC area , in GPE and in GPE had been behind the DATE attacks . All the members had either been directly involved or had played an indirect role by aiding and abetting and providing resources , and all of them were either known activists or claimed to be activists within the ORG . The court found that the applicant \u2019s contacts with the various members of these networks , who had the shared goal of carrying out attacks , were sufficient to establish his conscious and deliberate participation in a conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts on NORP soil . In its judgment the court set out , among other findings , the facts showing the existence of links to CARDINAL members of CARDINAL groups forming a support network for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG found the applicant guilty of criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist enterprise , on the basis of ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his permanent exclusion from NORP territory . The court cited as reasons for imposing the prison sentence the fact that \u201c by providing funding and issuing propaganda on behalf of the PERSON , PERSON not only enabled the attacks to be carried out but acted as a propagandist , potentially attracting new members to strengthen the networks spread over several NORP countries \u201d . It further cited the fact that \u201c his double talk reveal[ed ] both his bad faith and his complete lack of regret or remorse \u201d . The court awarded MONEY ( ORG ) in damages to the association ORG , which had joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld that judgment . While referring expressly to the statement of facts as established in the judgment , it devoted CARDINAL pages to analysing the charges against the applicant , giving reasons . First of all , ORG gave further details concerning the evolution and operation of the ORG . It also specified that the case before it concerned \u201c the series of attacks carried out in GPE in DATE \u201d , and that \u201c the facts of the case at hand concern[ed ] the preparation of the attacks and the actions enabling the attacks , which started in GPE in DATE , to be carried out \u201d . ORG went on to list the CARDINAL attacks carried out DATE and DATE . With particular reference to the evidence of the existence of an information hub based in GPE which the applicant had allegedly managed , it found this to be established on the basis of the telephone calls made on DATE after the killing of the imam S. in GPE ; DATE before the attack on the PERSON suburban rail station ; on DATE of that attack and DATE after the attempted attack on the ORG high - speed railway line at ORG - sur - Fontaines ; on CARDINAL DATE , DATE after the attack of DATE on GPE in GPE , the attempted attack of DATE on Place Charles Vallin in GPE and the attack of DATE in FAC in GPE ; DATE after the shooting at FAC and the arrest of CARDINAL people ; DATE before the attack of DATE and DATE after it ; on DATE , in other words just before the attack of CARDINAL DATE ; and , finally , on DATE , immediately after a telephone conversation between PERSON and S.A.B. concerning preparations for an attack on the ORG market in GPE , with PERSON stating that the purpose of the call was to report to the applicant on the \u201c final preparations \u201d for the GPE attack .", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised the existence of several items of factual evidence pointing to the applicant \u2019s involvement as the supervisor of a structure set up to fund the ORG \u2019s activities . These included the fact that the applicant had sent funds from GPE on DATE under the false name of PERSON , which had been received by PERSON at the PERSON branch of the ORG bank under the false name of PERSON , and which matched an entry in ORG \u2019s accounts book marked \u201c MONEY , GPE and PERSON \u2019s statements ; the payment by the applicant of ORG and MONEY ( ORG ) , as shown by an entry in ORG \u2019s accounts book which mentioned funds sent by \u201c PERSON \u201d , a false name used by the applicant or the first name of CARDINAL of his acquaintances who could be contacted in order to reach him ; statements from several individuals concerning services offered in return for payment , fundraising , the sending of substantial sums of money , a transfer of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON and the existence of a receipt for GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted a series of facts demonstrating , firstly , that the applicant had been \u201c the main contact person ... in organising and carrying out the PERSON \u2019s activities in LOC \u201d , as was clear in particular from a telephone conversation of DATE , from the statements of a witness who was a ORG member , and from the detailed content of several documents seized in GPE ( press statements , authorisations to conduct the jihad , documents on the management of funds , articles and handwritten notes on the activities of NORP groups in LOC and anti - terrorist activities , notes on military weapons and the handling of explosives , and so on ) ; secondly , that he had been \u201c the ORG \u2019s main propaganda agent outside GPE \u201d , with \u201c his role on the magazine PERSON \u201d ( particularly in the light of documents seized at the applicant \u2019s GPE address , namely a note on how to make the magazine more dynamic , a letter explaining the means of distributing it , a piece of computer equipment which the applicant would have been unable to afford , letters from readers and ORG sympathisers , a large number of magazines detailing the ORG \u2019s ideas and violent actions , a substantial amount of correspondence relating to NORP and NORP issues , some testimonies , and a list of post - office boxes in numerous countries , used by the magazine \u2019s subscribers ) ; thirdly , that he had been at the centre of \u201c the GPE cell which revolved around [ him and which ] also served as a rallying point for young recruits passing through \u201d , as demonstrated by the personal histories of CARDINAL of them ; and fourthly , that he had been a leader with \u201c a strategic role in the ORG \u2019s external organisation \u201d , as demonstrated by his links to members and correspondents of other NORP terrorist groups worldwide .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal echoed the reasons given by ORG and added that there was sufficient evidence in the case to demonstrate that the applicant had been contacted regularly in order to be kept informed of events , that he had been responsible for funding ORG operations in LOC , that he had acted as a conduit for the ORG \u2019s military command and as a propaganda agent for that organisation , especially through the magazine PERSON , that he had given shelter to fugitives passing through GPE and had sometimes been called upon to coordinate the ORG \u2019s external activities . ORG therefore concluded as follows :", "\u201c ORG , like the first - instance court , therefore finds it established that the ORG created \u2018 an external structure\u2019 in LOC designed to enable it to pursue its goal of overthrowing the NORP regime , including by attacking institutions and people in countries that supported or were deemed to support that regime , by setting up networks in GPE and GPE in particular which provided support to the NORP guerrillas by supplying weapons , munitions and various items of equipment , supplying jihadists and providing safe havens ( accommodation and false identity papers ) to fighters who were fleeing the maquis or had arrived to carry out attacks , organised and coordinated by a cell in GPE in charge of fundraising and using funds acquired lawfully or unlawfully .", "... [ the applicant ] knowingly played a decisive role , by means of the material acts referred to by ORG and by this court above , in the achievement of the ORG \u2019s goal , participating from GPE in the implementation of the group \u2019s external structure , and played a vital role within the organisation whose aim was to prepare , assist in and carry out the attacks which took place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG indicted ORG and the applicant for the attack of CARDINAL DATE and committed them for trial before the GPE special ORG . The applicant was charged with aiding and abetting the crimes of attempted murder , destroying or damaging property belonging to others by the use of an explosive substance causing mutilation or permanent disability and temporary total unfitness for work of DATE or of a maximum of DATE , in connection principally or incidentally with a terrorist enterprise , and with the related offence of a breach of the explosives legislation in connection with a terrorist enterprise .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG of ORG upheld the orders issued by the GPE investigating judge on DATE ( concerning the attack of DATE ) and DATE ( concerning the attack of CARDINAL DATE ) for the indictment of the applicant and PERSON and their committal for trial before the special ORG . The applicant faced trial for aiding and abetting the crimes of murder , attempted murder , destroying or damaging property belonging to others by the use of an explosive substance causing death , mutilation or permanent disability and temporary total unfitness for work of DATE or of a maximum of DATE , in connection with a terrorist enterprise , and for the related offence of a breach of the explosives legislation in connection with a terrorist enterprise .", "CARDINAL . These CARDINAL judgments of ORG specified that the applicant had aided and abetted by : transmitting instructions from the ORG ordering attacks with explosives and providing PERSON with instructions on manufacturing ; relaying to the ORG leadership operational information provided by the perpetrators of the attacks ; providing the perpetrators with the funds needed not just to manufacture the explosive devices but also to make all the logistical arrangements for preparing and carrying out the attacks . The judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE added the fact that the funds had also been intended , if necessary , to enable the perpetrators based in GPE to flee .", "CARDINAL . In these judgments the judges noted in particular the following facts in relation to the applicant . The CARDINAL mobile phones used by the applicant had received calls from PERSON on DATE and DATE and DATE ; a receipt for an exchange transaction performed on DATE at CARDINAL TIME ( GPE time ) for an amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been discovered at PERSON \u2019s home , together with a notice of transfer of ORG CARDINAL from an LANGUAGE branch of ORG , and the checks carried out established that the applicant had gone into a GPE shop in GPE containing a ORG office at TIME on DATE and had re - emerged at TIME ( GPE time ) ; the applicant \u2019s fingerprints had been found on the transfer slip kept by the GPE office in the GPE shop ; the words \u201c PERSON CARDINAL FF CARDINAL \u201d had been found in the credit column of PERSON \u2019s accounts and the words \u201c GPE \u201d and \u201c NORP Bank \u201d had also been entered by PERSON in a document logging the details of the CARDINAL DATE attack ; the applicant had possessed the details of ORG branch in FAC in FAC district of GPE ; an exchange receipt dated DATE , for an amount of GBP CARDINAL exchanged at a rate of PERCENT , had been found at the applicant \u2019s home , with the number of a public payphone in NORP used by ORG written on the back , and an entry had been made in the credit column of PERSON \u2019s accounts for the sum of \u201c MONEY from [ W. ] , converted at a rate of PERCENT \u201d ; a sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been sent on DATE ; CARDINAL DATE the sum of ORG CARDINAL had been entered as expenditure for the purchase of a \u201c GPE ticket \u201d , demonstrating that the funds , after being exchanged in GPE , had been transported to GPE in DATE leading up to the attack at the ORG suburban rail station ; and a letter from ORG had been found , addressed to \u201c PERSON \u201d at CARDINAL LOC , the applicant \u2019s address . The judges also noted , as evidence against the applicant , the content of a hard disk found in a GPE flat to which the applicant had keys , containing CARDINAL financial reports , CARDINAL relating to the activities of the ORG in GPE and the other to a set of accounts for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the date of PERSON \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerning the attack of CARDINAL DATE ORG observed in particular that the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL telephone numbers had been called repeatedly from payphones used by PERSON , around the time of the different attacks and in particular on DATE before the attack of CARDINAL DATE . It compared these calls with the statements made by PERSON and a further accomplice , who had been planning an attack on GPE market , according to which they had reported to the applicant on preparations for the operations , and in particular for the attack of CARDINAL DATE . ORG also noted that the applicant had made a transfer of FRF CARDINAL from GPE DATE before that attack \u2013 as shown by the fact that his fingerprints had been found on the transfer slip in the GPE office in GPE \u2013 which had been received by PERSON in GPE on DATE . The link between that transfer and the attack of CARDINAL DATE had also been established by PERSON \u2019s statements and by a call made to the applicant \u2019s mobile phone DATE , after the money had been received .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE relating more specifically to the attack of DATE , ORG stressed that the applicant \u2019s LANGUAGE mobile phone had been called DATE before that attack from a public payphone in GPE close to PERSON \u2019s home from which other calls had been made , including a call to a mobile phone belonging to a member of the NORP PERSON network , made TIME before the applicant was called . Furthermore , DATE before the attack and then on DATE itself , the applicant had received calls from GPE on his various numbers , including from a payphone close to the previous one , concerning his role as an intermediary between the perpetrators of the attacks and the person masterminding them in GPE . Above all , ORG noted that the applicant had on CARDINAL and DATE sent sums of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively which were directly linked to the attack carried out on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in its judgment of DATE ORG also noted that it was clear from these different elements that the applicant had sent funds to the perpetrators of the attacks , not just in relation to the campaign of attacks as a whole but also for use directly in carrying out the attack of DATE . With regard to the latter , it noted that the instructions issued by the ORG concerning the campaigns , which had been accompanied by advice on the manufacture of explosives , had been transmitted via the applicant , who had also funded all the operational arrangements put in place in GPE in order to ensure the success of the attacks , and that the recipients had been required to report to him on how the money had been used . A number of telephone calls had established that the applicant had been kept informed of the progress of the attacks , and in particular of the attack of DATE , which had been followed by a telephone call on DATE telling the applicant that everything had gone well on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE special ORG , composed of CARDINAL professional judges , found the applicant guilty as charged in connection with the CARDINAL attacks . It sentenced him to life imprisonment with a minimum term of DATE . The applicant appealed on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The appeal proceedings before the GPE special ORG , this time composed of CARDINAL professional judges , took place from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL individuals joined the proceedings as civil parties , as did the RATP ( the GPE public - transport operator ) , the ORG ( the NORP national rail company ) , ORG for victims of terrorist acts and other crimes , the Government Law Officer and the association ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE counsel for the applicant made submissions requesting the termination of the proceedings and a finding that the prosecution was null and void , on the basis of the ne bis in idem principle . Citing LAW No . CARDINAL and the judgment in PERSON v. GPE , delivered by ORG on DATE , they argued that the material acts which ORG was called on to examine were the same as those of which the applicant had previously been convicted by ORG in its final judgment of DATE . In counsel \u2019s view , the material acts alleged in the ORG proceedings , namely the transfer of funds to the perpetrators of the attacks , the transmission of instructions to the same perpetrators , and the monitoring of the preparation and carrying - out of the attacks , had also been alleged in the ORG proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE the special ORG dismissed the objection regarding a breach of the ne bis in idem principle , finding as follows :", "\u201c Although PERSON defence counsel correctly points out that LAW No . CARDINAL must be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u2018 offence\u2019 in so far as it arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same , the following factors need to be taken into consideration in the present case :", "- The facts on which the criminal courts based their finding that PERSON was guilty , while they related to criminal acts dealt with in the current set of proceedings , were by no means confined to them . In finding the offence of criminal conspiracy to be made out \u2013 a separate offence that is provided for and punishable under LAW the courts considered all the elements apt to substantiate the accused \u2019s involvement in the conspiracy , which was aimed at organising , developing and ensuring the continuation of a movement that was bent on imposing its cause , in particular by using clandestine methods and material and intellectual resources ( recruitment of and regular contact with activists , dissemination of information on the ORG \u2019s activities and views , fundraising , seeking donations of weapons and various items of equipment , etc . ) , without necessarily pursuing the sole objective of carrying out the attacks that are the subject of the proceedings .", "- The facts to be considered by this court differ substantially from the earlier ones in that they relate to criminal conduct aimed at the achievement of CARDINAL - off objectives which were determined with precision and were not inextricably linked , and which were driven by a specific motivation consisting in particular in providing others , in full knowledge of the situation , with the means of deliberately harming human life or ORG physical or mental integrity by the use of explosives .", "- In these circumstances the finding that PERSON was guilty and his conviction by ORG can not lead ORG to find that his prosecution has lapsed and to declare the criminal proceedings against him null and void .", "- It is thus the task of ORG , on conclusion of the proceedings and in the light thereof , to rule , by answering the questions raised before it , as to whether or not PERSON is guilty of aiding and abetting as charged ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE the special ORG of Appeal deferred its decision on a request for further information and eventually rejected the request in a further interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL questions concerning the applicant alone were put to the special ORG of Appeal . CARDINAL related to the circumstances surrounding the attack of DATE , DATE to the events surrounding the attack of DATE and DATE to the attack of CARDINAL DATE . The questions gave precise details of the various alleged acts and where and when they had been committed , and listed the names of CARDINAL of victims of killings and attempted killings , mutilation or permanent disability , injuries resulting in unfitness for work of DATE or more , and victims of damage to their property . The answer to CARDINAL of the questions was \u201c yes \u201d , by a majority ( some questions , followed by a list of victims and requiring an individual reply in each case , were also found partly \u201c devoid of purpose \u201d ) , and CARDINAL questions were found to be \u201c devoid of purpose \u201d .
