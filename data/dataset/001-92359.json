The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the NORP authorities on DATE , the applicant was arrested and detained in GPE on suspicion of having conspired in the traffic of cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his legal counsel , challenged the lawfulness of his arrest and detention in so far as the arrest warrant had not been issued in accordance with the NORP Arrest Warrant requirements ( in force on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s claim as the extradition request had been made prior to the new arrest warrant procedure with the result that the previous law applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE to stand trial on charges of drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before ORG as a ORG . He challenged the legality of the arrest warrant of DATE . He claimed that the prosecution had to satisfy ORG that the arrest had been lawful and that this could not be assumed , given in particular that the accused had not been personally heard . The applicant argued that the procedure followed by the prosecution , whereby it simply confirmed on oath the report containing the legal provisions on which the charges were based , did not satisfy the requirements of LAW . He made reference in this connection to ORG judgment in GPE v. GPE , ( no . MONEY , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant pleaded not guilty . He also pointed out that he was contesting the NORP courts\u2019 jurisdiction to try him , claiming that the facts he was accused of did not constitute an offence under the laws of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution submitted that the applicant had been brought to GPE following the issue of an arrest warrant by the duty magistrate . Upon the applicant \u2019s arrival and within TIME of the arrest , the duty magistrate was informed of the arrest and confirmed its continuation . Within TIME of the arrest , during which time he was interrogated , the applicant was arraigned before the court . The prosecution further submitted that the case which carried a maximum punishment of life imprisonment was based on the testimony of various civilian witnesses and corroborating evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing ORG took account of the applicant \u2019s not - guilty plea . The hearing TIME read as follows :", "\u201c In regard to whether the accused is going to plead guilty or not guilty as charged the same accused would like to point out that first of all he is contesting the jurisdiction of the NORP courts to try him and secondly that the facts do not constitute , in his regard , an offence under the laws of GPE and thirdly that he is not guilty of any fact alleged against him . To all intents and purposes of law , the ORG [ of Magistrates ] , having heard what has just been put down in the records of the proceedings , is considering the accused as pleading not guilty as charged . \u201d", "ORG did not require the arresting officer to justify why the applicant had been arrested or why his detention was necessary . It declared , without entering TIME to that effect in the records , that the warrant had been issued by a magistrate and confirmed by another magistrate and both sets of proceedings had been held in camera and the arrest had been authorised . Moreover , the case had been examined by the NORP courts in the context of their consideration of GPE \u2019s request for the applicant \u2019s extradition . In TIME it further referred to the fact that the validity of the warrant as regards its procedural aspects was affirmed by ORG in a further set of proceedings which took place while the applicant was still in GPE . Thus , the warrant was sufficient to enable the arrest to be considered lawful at that stage of the proceedings . Nothing had been brought to the attention of the court which enabled it to say that the person charged was under arrest without justification .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the applicant insisted that his arrest was unlawful and unjustified no request for bail was made and he was remanded in custody . His case file was transmitted to another magistrate sitting in ORG in order to proceed with the committal stage .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant applied for bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in the committal stage heard the parties . The applicant advanced once again his argument that the NORP authorities lacked jurisdiction to try him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application for bail , which had been lodged on DATE , on the grounds that there was a real danger that the applicant might abscond , leave the island or interfere or attempt to interfere with witnesses . It further held that it was not competent to give a ruling on the question of jurisdiction and decided that there were enough grounds to commit the applicant for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction , alleging that both at his first hearing and at the committal stage , LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW had been violated . ORG had failed to assess the lawfulness of the arrest by refusing to decide on the defence \u2019s objections , namely that the NORP courts did not have jurisdiction to try the defendant and that the facts alleged against him did not constitute a criminal offence under NORP law . The applicant therefore requested ORG to declare that his arrest and continued detention were unlawful and to order his release and provide him with adequate redress .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that ORG as a ORG was bound to examine solely the lawfulness of the arrest and , if necessary , to order release on bail according to Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The question of jurisdiction related to the merits of the case and therefore could be examined only by ORG . This was not in violation of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG . He reiterated his claims and emphasised that LAW was not an effective remedy as it provided only for provisional release under guarantee or against payment of bail and not unconditional release as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court heard submissions on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal in part . It first held that at the hearing of DATE ORG had satisfied its duty under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW as provided by LAW ( see paragraph DATE , in fine , below ) . In particular , it had heard the parties\u2019 submissions regarding the lawfulness of record ) and because it would have substantially amounted to a plea that the facts of the case did not constitute a crime . Thus , further evidence would have been necessary in order to decide the matter .", "CARDINAL . ORG did , however , find a violation of LAW in so far as on DATE ORG at the committal stage ( LAW had abstained from deciding the issue of jurisdiction , thus disregarding its duty to determine the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW . Even though questions of jurisdiction would , in principle , be dealt with by ORG , in the applicant \u2019s case this issue was interconnected with the factual requirements of the criminal offence . In the absence of solid factual grounds against the defendant , ORG could not commit him for trial . ORG annulled the ORG of GPE order of CARDINAL DATE committing the applicant for trial as well as all subsequent acts . It remitted the case to ORG to be decided afresh after taking cognisance of the applicant \u2019s plea of lack of jurisdiction . It awarded the applicant CARDINAL NORP Liras ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) for just satisfaction , and ordered the payment of the costs of the proceedings to be divided between the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for bail before ORG , the competent court at the time . On DATE the Attorney General sent the records of the proceedings back to ORG . Thus , on DATE ORG refused to take cognisance of the request as it no longer had jurisdiction in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same application was filed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , having regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence , the real danger of the accused absconding or leaving the island and obstructing or attempting to obstruct the course of justice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE issued a warrant extending the legal time - limit for concluding the proceedings to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , still under arrest , was brought before ORG . He alleged that the law imposed a peremptory time - limit of DATE for the conclusion of the committal proceedings . In the applicant \u2019s view , this time - limit could not be extended by ORG , as had occurred in his case . Furthermore , the applicant challenged the magistrate sitting in his case on the ground that she had already sat in the hearings preceding the constitutional proceedings . He invoked the principles laid down by ORG in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( see judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON ) . He also raised once again his plea based on the NORP authorities\u2019 lack of jurisdiction to try him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered that the CARDINAL day time - limit had not been exceeded since ORG had placed the applicant in a status quo ante . Moreover , the warrant of the President of GPE extending the term of the inquiry had been valid according to law . It rejected the challenge to the magistrate on the ground that that court had refrained from giving a definitive judgment on the merits of the case , thus satisfying the objective impartiality test . ORG further stated that the interpretation of LAW f ) of the LAW extended the principle of territorial jurisdiction and that it therefore had jurisdiction to proceed against the applicant . It decided to commit the applicant for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG , the competent court at the material time , to challenge the lawfulness of his detention according to LAW . He requested it to order his release from custody . He also complained that the committing magistrate , who delivered the decision of CARDINAL DATE , had erred when she refrained from stepping down once she had been challenged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application as being unfounded for the purposes of LAW It held that even if the magistrate had erred , this did not render the detention unlawful . Moreover , the proceedings leading to the decision of DATE appeared to have been properly initiated and conducted , as indicated by ORG judgment of DATE , which upheld only the applicant \u2019s complaint about the irregularity related to the refusal to consider the plea of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a new application with ORG , claiming that the Attorney General had exceeded the time - limit allowed for filing the bill of indictment . On an unspecified date ORG rejected the claim .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Attorney General filed the bill of indictment . As a consequence , ORG became competent to take cognisance of any application for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for bail , making reference to GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted bail against payment of a deposit of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . He was put under house arrest at his mother \u2019s home . He was only allowed to go out for TIME in the morning to report to the police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG had started examining the plea of lack of jurisdiction . The applicant was still under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant made another request for his detention arrangements to be alleviated . On DATE ORG rejected his request , emphasising that it could not be said that the applicant was under arrest but was simply confined and limited in TIME during which he could leave his house as a condition of his being granted provisional liberty .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of ORG of DATE , confirmed by ORG on DATE , the applicant was found guilty of the charges against him and sentenced to a term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .
