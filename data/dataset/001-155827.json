The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Narva .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , in misdemeanour proceedings , was fined MONEY ( ORG ) by a police officer of ORG of the Police and ORG for a breach of public order ( breaking a glass panel of a bus shelter ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested this decision before ORG . He argued that he had not committed the act in question and challenged the assessment of witness statements . He complained about the failure of the police to present him to a witness for identification . Lastly , he complained that the police had not indicated in its decision the specific provisions of the local rules on public order which he had allegedly breached .", "CARDINAL . ORG sent summons to the applicant for a hearing scheduled for DATE at TIME It was noted in the summons that the applicant \u2019s participation in the hearing was mandatory . Furthermore , it was noted , with reference to LAW ( ORG seadustik ) , that if a complainant failed to appear at the hearing , although he had been notified of the obligation to participate , and the hearing was not adjourned , the court would refuse to examine the complaint . The applicant \u2019s counsel , a representative of the police prefecture and witnesses were also summoned .", "CARDINAL . The summons sent to the applicant \u2019s address , which he had used throughout the proceedings and which had been indicated in his complaint , could not be served on him personally as he was not present on DATE when the court \u2019s security officer attempted to serve the summons . His mother refused to accept the summons and said that the applicant was living abroad . The applicant \u2019s counsel received the summons on DATE . The witnesses also received the summons in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a ruling by which the applicant \u2019s complaint was admitted for the proceedings . According to the ruling the hearing was scheduled for DATE at TIME and the names of persons to be summoned to the hearing were set out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held its hearing . The applicant did not appear . His counsel asked the court to examine the matter without the applicant \u2019s presence as the applicant was abroad and it was not known when he would return to GPE . According to the applicant \u2019s father , who was in the courtroom as a spectator , the applicant was not to return to GPE within DATE . ORG refused to examine the applicant \u2019s complaint . It delivered its decision in writing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG decision , the applicant had failed to inform the authorities of his new address . However , as the applicant \u2019s father was aware of the time of the court hearing and of the applicant \u2019s intention not to return to GPE within DATE , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s parents were communicating both with the applicant and his counsel . Thus , the applicant must have been aware of the court hearing and summons sent to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in view of the substance of the misdemeanour case and the court \u2019s duty to hear a misdemeanour matter in its entirety , regardless of the limits of the complaint filed , and to verify the factual and legal circumstances on the basis of which the body conducting the extra - judicial proceedings ( that is , the police ) had made its decision , it was not possible to examine the case without the applicant \u2019s participation . It noted that one of the complaints made by the applicant had been that the body conducting the extra - judicial proceedings had not presented the applicant for identification to the witness . Thus , interviewing of the applicant and presenting him for recognition to the witness were important steps for the adjudication of the matter which could not be accomplished without the applicant \u2019s participation . The court considered that adjourning the hearing would serve no purpose since the applicant was not to return to GPE within DATE the time - limit for which a hearing could be adjourned under the law of procedure . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s counsel had not requested an adjournment but examination of the complaint without the applicant \u2019s presence . However , for the above reasons the court did not consider it possible to examine the case without the applicant . Relying on LAW which provided that if a complainant failed to appear at the hearing although he had been notified of the obligation to participate in the court hearing DATE ORG refused to examine the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel appealed , relying , inter alia , on LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW according to which a person had the right to defend himself through legal assistance of his own choosing . The receipt of the summons was not disputed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the ruling of the first - instance court . It noted that under LAW the court could decide on a discretionary basis whether a complainant \u2019s participation in the court hearing was necessary and , if needed , oblige the person in question to appear . In the case at hand ORG had given reasons as to why the applicant \u2019s participation was required and it was not possible to examine the case in his absence . ORG pointed out that the applicant had challenged in his complaint to ORG the failure of the police to present him to witnesses for identification . It was , however , unclear , how ORG could have eliminated this deficiency in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . No appeal lay against ORG ruling ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
