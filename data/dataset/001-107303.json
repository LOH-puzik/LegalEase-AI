She has been receiving an invalidity pension for DATE . She lives alone in her own flat . She is unmarried [ and ] has no children . Her physical health is impaired DATE and that is about all that we can establish without doubt with regard to her physical condition . Owing to the lack of cooperation on the part of the respondent , we have no medical records ...", "At the outset it should be pointed out that the respondent refused to cooperate . During an interview ( organised with great difficulty ! ) she held a monologue for TIME , in which she referred to all the injustice done to her and her mother . She ignored any attempt by the doctor to conduct a dialogue , let alone a structured one . The respondent \u2019s biography or her present life was not addressed . The only thing that happened was her raised voice , rudeness , hostility , a clearly paranoid attitude towards her surroundings , the feeling of being persecuted and a need to defend herself from the institutions that had been interfering with her life , ill - treating her , etc . The expert \u2019s expectation that during a home visit , on her own territory , the respondent would participate in the interview in a more cooperative manner was not met . CARDINAL telephone calls were not answered . The attempts to find her at her home address were also unsuccessful . After DATE she made a telephone call - shouting , accusing , insulting and attacking \u2013 in which she did not want to hear any answers .", "On the basis of all this information and the expert \u2019s personal experience with the respondent , it is easy to conclude that she is a person of a very bizarre mental structure . She suffers from serious emotional disharmony and grave dysphoria and a flood of uncontrolled affective outbursts . In the background , a general paranoid attitude towards her entire surroundings is perceptible , with a fixation on institutions . She is ruled by a feeling that she is exposed to injustice , and to ill - treatment , abuse and systematic denial of her rights . She has succeeded in developing a strong hatred for the employees of ORG and that whole institution . The same is true ( maybe even more so ) about the Home where her mother is placed . She is argumentative . Her behaviour is often disorganised and chaotic . She has deeply estranged herself from everyone , chased away all good - willed people , broken all threads of cooperation . She is entirely uncooperative and is prone to describe everyone who dares to say or do anything she dislikes as an ignorant person , an adversary , [ or ] even an enemy .", "In all that \u2018 NORP the respondent does not even make an attempt to control herself , does not try to hide her hostility , does not try even for a second to reflect and analyse her own contribution to the situation ; she rejects any suggestion that there had been any wrong on her part . She is entirely uncritical and has no introspection ; she automatically seeks the guilty parties in her surroundings . She opposes any suggestion that she address problems regarding her own person or her behaviour and threatens [ to appeal to ] a higher instance .", "In her entire mental world there is a lot of system , that is , logical concepts \u2013 and this would all be fine if that logic were not based on an entirely false , at times even psychotic , basis .", "... her entire mental world is of a paranoid nature . In the best case we are speaking of a paranoid personality disorder , that is , the condition of personal derangement in which feelings of insecurity , being exploited and having suffered damage prevail . Without restrictions and with no basis she seeks enemies in her surroundings , people who are against her , who want to exploit her or injure her . She has difficulty in trusting anyone , if that is possible at all . She is mistrustful , negative towards others who are or could become traitors ; she sees hidden meaning in everything . Such an attitude warrants constant guard , suspicion and defensiveness . It is difficult to assert that this all amounts to a definitive paranoia , but the respondent \u2013 even if she is not in paranoia DATE is surely approaching it . We stress that paranoia is a real psychotic disorder ( that is to say mental derangement ) characterised by the development of and fixation on CARDINAL psychotic thought \u2013 usually of a persecuting type \u2013 or on several such thoughts which are grouped , interconnected and systematised ( connected in a psychotic system ) . In any case , the respondent is not far from mental derangement , which , unfortunately , she does not see and does not understand and therefore refuses any professional help .", "Overwhelmed with this personal condition , the respondent most often estimates the world around her entirely wrongly , giving immense importance to trivialities and at the same time ignoring crucial things . By insisting on the irrelevant , she seriously neglects her vital interests and thus directly compromises them . She exhausts her limited resources on irrelevant , sporadic things , thus calling into question her ability to organise her existence , to structure it adequately and to exploit what she has at her disposal in her best interests . Her mental condition is entirely ( which still does not mean irreversibly ) impaired . She has lost the ability to anticipate and to react and adapt in a preventive manner . Her understanding of the world and her position in it is limited by a feeling of injustice , and is also superficial , wrong and strict . She is incapable of locating herself correctly in the complex , abstract laws of the outside world . She is not capable of recognising the institutional resources at her disposal ; even when they are presented to her , she rejects them uncritically , putting herself in a dangerous , unacceptable and miserable position .", "In her mental condition she has no chance of exploiting outside resources and protecting her rights and interests . She will follow \u2013 without caution , without reflection \u2013 her first impression and thus immediately puts at risk her economic , material and health interests .
