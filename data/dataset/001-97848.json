The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was born prematurely on DATE at the Dr ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was diagnosed with an \u201c inguinal and umbilical hernia \u201d by doctors working in the same hospital .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE or DATE , the third applicant , who is the first applicant 's father , purchased a unit of red blood cells and a unit of plasma from ORG , hereinafter \u201c the FAC \u201d ) . A number of blood and plasma transfusions were carried out on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL and DATE . The first applicant was discharged from the hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Approximately DATE after the blood transfusion , the second and third applicants learned that the first applicant had been infected with the HIV virus which could develop into the more severe Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the information given by the Government , on DATE a donor ( no . DATE , code MUALAB-CARDINAL ) donated blood to the FAC . Subsequent to screening and tests carried out on the donated blood ( serial no . DATE ) , HIV was found and the blood in question was destroyed . Following CARDINAL more tests , it became certain that donor no . CARDINAL had been infected with HIV . The authorities conducted an investigation with a view to determining whether donor no . DATE had donated blood previously . It appeared that the unit of plasma ( serial no . DATE ) used for the first applicant 's treatment had been given by donor no . DATE . The first applicant was admitted to ORG for treatment . The costs of treatment were paid by ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with ORG office in GPE . They claimed that the FAC had provided contaminated blood and ORG had been negligent in conducting the requisite screening and testing in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation . They requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against the doctors and laboratory personnel involved in the transfusion process , as well as against the Director of ORG ( GPE PERSON ) and the Director of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG prepared a report in which it stated that the unit of plasma used for the first applicant 's treatment had been screened and tested for the HIV virus . However at that stage the HIV antibodies had not yet been produced in the unit of plasma donated by donor no . DATE . The report further noted that all around the world the HIV infection had been screened by Anti - HIV ( LAW ) tests on the recommendation of ORG . Therefore , it had been scientifically impossible to diagnose the HIV contained in the unit of plasma in question by the routine tests . Thus , relying on the statements given by health personnel and expert reports , the report concluded that there was no negligence attributable to the health personnel involved in the incident or to any other authority .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding , ORG advised that ( CARDINAL ) a circular be issued to relevant departments ; ( CARDINAL ) the health personnel be reminded to ensure that questionnaires were properly filled in by blood donors ; ( CARDINAL ) questions be asked about the sexual history of the donors and ( CARDINAL ) donations be refused in doubtful cases . ORG added that health personnel 's attention should be drawn to the need to wait for a sufficient period of time before delivering blood in case antibodies had not yet been produced . In this connection , on DATE circular no . CARDINAL and its attachments were communicated to all blood centres and stations in order to prevent infections resulting from blood transfusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that no investigation could be conducted into the doctors who had been involved in the blood transfusion process on the ground that the children 's hospital where the transfusions had taken place was not equipped with facilities for the LAW test . Therefore the doctors had not been at fault in the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with ORG office in GPE , this time against LOC and the Director General of the FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision of nonprosecution . He reasoned that an investigation into the actions of a minister could only be conducted in accordance with LAW , which requires a motion to be brought in parliament . Therefore the Public Prosecutor concluded that he lacked jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione personae in this matter . As regards the Director General of the K\u0131z\u0131lay , ORG noted that he was in GPE whereas the incident had taken place in GPE and that there was no fault directly attributable to him , bearing in mind particularly that he had not been involved in selling the infected blood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an objection with ORG against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' objection for non - compliance with the DATE statutory time - limit to lodge their objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants initiated compensation proceedings against the FAC and ORG . They requested non - pecuniary damage for the infection of the first applicant with HIV as a result of medical negligence on the part of the defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision of non - jurisdiction in respect of the case brought against ORG . It stated that these complaints must be brought before the competent administrative tribunal .", "CARDINAL . As regards the case instituted against the FAC , the court held that it was strictly liable for the incident as it had been established through a witness statement that the test which gave clear results on the presence of the HIV virus could not be carried out due to its high costs and that the health questionnaire system had not been in full practice at the time of the incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It thus awarded the applicants MONEY ( GPE ) plus interest at the statutory rate running from DATE , the date of the incident . The court held , in particular :", "\u201c ... As briefly mentioned above , PERSON suffers from AIDS after receiving HIV virus infected blood supplied by the GPE ORG . ORG is at fault for the infection of the child . This appeared from the sworn statements given on DATE by Prof . Dr. PERSON , who works at ORG , ORG and ORG . PERSON , who is a specialist on this subject , is the only witness of ORG and holds an academic title of \u201c professor \u201d . In his statements , he submitted that AIDS was a disease which could be detected with certainty by a special test but that , because it was very expensive , it was not employed . Bearing in mind that it was possible to detect HIV with sufficient certainty and that the ORG did not employ the test in question , because it was costly , then it should be held responsible for the infection of [ the child ] . The ORG has to bear the consequences of this [ negligence ] . It can not escape this [ responsibility ] . Either it has to employ the test which determines with certainty AIDS , or it fails to do the test and assumes responsibility for providing blood which was infected with AIDS .", "Moreover , the ORG is at fault for the following reason : As is clear from the statements of the doctors indicated by ORG and , following the contamination of the plaintiffs ' child , ORG issued a circular on DATE and required the questioning of donors . It thus follows that this circular had to be issued because no such questioning took place at all previously or was not done properly .", "Even assuming for a moment that the the K\u0131z\u0131lay was not at fault in this incident , it still has strict liability ( kusursuz sorumluluk ) . This is the very requirement of justice .", "PERSON was infected with HIV at a very young age because of the blood given by DATE . He caught AIDS , which is , together with cancer , CARDINAL of the most dangerous diseases of our age . It is unnecessary to explain how evil and fatal this disease is . It is highly unlikely that little ORG will survive this disease ; most probably he will lose his life . Even if he survives , he will live with this disease throughout his lifetime and everybody will avoid him . Strictly speaking , by having been infected with this disease , PERSON has become a social outcast . He should not have sexual intercourse and should not get married during his lifetime . It is impossible for a living person to endure this . Furthermore , PERSON should be taken care of very well . It is impossible to put into words how father PERSON and mother PERSON suffer from sorrow because of ORG 's infection with this disease . In view of the foregoing , the court considers that the award of FAC for each plaintiff in respect of non - pecuniary damages appears to be low . In fact , the sorrow and pain suffered by the plaintiffs can not be compensated even if quadrillions were awarded . As noted above , the amount of compensation awarded is an insignificant one and merely aims at lessening their pain to some extent . Having regard to the fact that DATE compensation of MONEY is awarded in a defamation case and that the amount in question would not even suffice to buy a car by the current prices of DATE , it is obvious that the increase of awards is inevitable . It is considered that DATE is the time to increase compensation to a satisfactory level . For this reason , the determination of the amount in this case , albeit insignificant , was in line with this view .", "Notwithstanding the above , I should like to stress the following : the fact that an aid organisation like the K\u0131z\u0131lay ... chose to pursue all avenues with full strength in order to avoid compensating ORG , instead of redressing his suffering , is thought provoking ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment and stated the following :", "\u201c ... The case concerns the payment of damages incurred as a result of the tortious act of the defendant . In order to hold the defendant liable for the alleged act , it should be established that the defendant was at fault , that the plaintiff incurred damage as a result of the tortious act and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage suffered . There is no dispute between the parties that the damage in question occurred as a result of the blood used by [ ORG ] and that such an act is unlawful . Again , it is also undisputed that the plaintiffs purchased the blood , which was used for the treatment of ORG , from the the GPE office and that the blood was infected HIV positive .", "The focal point of the dispute is whether ORG is at fault ... It is a known fact that a foundation such as the FAC has a noteworthy prominence in meeting the need for blood and is worthy of credence on account of this vocation . In other words , there is an assumption that the blood obtained from the defendant meets expectations . However , it appeared that the blood obtained and used [ in the present case ] was unclean and so malignant that there was no possibility of purifying it . The fact that the [ donor ] was the bearer of the known virus can not absolve the defendant from liability . The defendant should have subjected such an important and vital substance to all necessary tests and screening using the necessary technology in accordance with the purpose of its use and the importance of that substance . Nevertheless it appears that the blood in question was not subjected to the requisite tests available in DATE '", "Turning to the defendant 's contention that the amount awarded in respect of nonpecuniary damage was excessive , ... [ I]t should be noted that the present and future life of the child , his mother and father have become dramatically insufferable . All segments of society will now avoid having any kind of social or physical contact with these people . Thus , it is apparent that the physical , social and personal values of all the plaintiffs , especially those of the child , shall be under attack during their lives . Having regard to the foregoing and particularly to the rule under LAW which stipulates ' ... parties ' social and economic conditions should also be taken into account ... ' , as well as to the current purchase value of money , the court concludes that the amount awarded in respect of non - pecuniary damage was not excessive . In this connection , when determining an amount for non - pecuniary damage , the amount in question should be satisfactory for the suffering party and should have a dissuasive effect for the harming party . Therefore , the defendant 's objections on this part of the case must be dismissed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG paid a total amount of TRL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicants , to cover the nonpecuniary damage awarded by the court and the statutory interest applied to that sum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants initiated proceedings against ORG , requesting non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the case on the ground that the judgment of ORG which had issued a non - jurisdiction decision in respect of the proceedings concerning ORG had been pending before ORG . On DATE the applicants appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision and remitted the case to ORG for examination on the ground that the proceedings concerning ORG must have been considered to have become final , given that ORG had not appealed against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants ' compensation claims . Referring to ORG judgment , ORG reiterated that the FAC and ORG were both liable for the first applicant 's HIV infection . The court added , however , that the purpose of awarding nonpecuniary damage was not to provide full restitution and the award of non - pecuniary damage twice for the same incident would have resulted in unjust enrichment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , holding that there was no provision in domestic law which could have prevented the administration from being held liable jointly with other real or corporate bodies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG rectification request against the above decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE , ORG held that ORG personnel had been negligent in the performance of their duties . The court thus awarded the applicants TRL CARDINAL plus interest at the statutory rate running from the date on which the proceedings had been initiated , namely DATE . Both the applicants and ORG appealed against the judgment . The applicants challenged the failure of the court to order the defendant to pay the legal fees , whereas ORG challenged the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG appeal but partly quashed the judgment insofar as it concerned the fees . The parties did not inform the ORG about the outcome of these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG paid CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ORG to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newly appointed ORG K\u0131z\u0131lay presented their apologies to the applicants and decided to give a scholarship to the first applicant in order to contribute towards his educational costs . A delegation of board members visited the applicants and told them that the medical expenses of the first applicant would also be paid by the FAC .", "CARDINAL . According to the information given by the applicants , the ORG rejected the applicants ' claim for treatment and medical costs which amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and ORG MONEY , respectively , per month . ORG also rejected their request for payment of these expenses .", "CARDINAL . The green card issued by the Governorship of GPE was cancelled right after the announcement of the judgments ordering the administration to pay compensation to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The compensation awarded by the civil and administrative courts covered DATE medical treatment expenses and did not suffice to pay the costs of medication used by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was not admitted to any school because of his condition and reactions from families of other pupils . He thus started his education at a hospital . Following public pressure and negotiations with ORG , he was ultimately admitted to a public school . Yet he has no close friends and suffers from stammering . DATE he sees a psychologist . Upon the latter 's advice , he attends drama and painting courses .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant 's ( the father ) health has been severely affected as a result of reactions from parents of other children and the school administration 's refusal to admit his son to school . Currently he is unable to work and provide any income for the family .", "CARDINAL .
