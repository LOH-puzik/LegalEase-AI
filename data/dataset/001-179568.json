Ideally , non - smokers should be segregated from smokers in order to avoid unnecessary hardship but , despite this resulting in an unsavoury situation , it is understood that because of the particular circumstances such obvious segregation might not be practically possible . As a result it can not be held that this situation reaches the level of severity and intensity required by LAW of the local LAW . Furthermore , upon examining the medical records presented in the case file of the proceedings , no medical or physical deterioration was recorded in the health of the complainant as a result of the passive smoking analysed herein", "CARDINAL .
