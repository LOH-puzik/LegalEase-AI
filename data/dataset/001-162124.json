GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Khanlar Hajiyev;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON & Co. KG , was formerly known as PERSON , a NORP private limited company whose registered office was in GPE . It published the DATE business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche . In DATE it was converted into a private limited partnership and the company seized to exist . The applicant was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its edition of DATE , ORG published an article about the CEO of ORG ) , PERSON . It was entitled \u201c Almighty PERSON \u201d ( ORG ) and critically reviewed his management style and the consequences for NORP Telecom .", "CARDINAL . The article was accompanied by a photomontage , which was shown in different sizes CARDINAL times throughout the entire magazine . The photomontage was a crumbling magenta - coloured \u201c T \u201d , the logo of ORG , with a person sitting on top of it with PERSON face . The picture was put together using the body of a model in a sitting position and a photograph of PERSON head . The applicant retrieved the photograph of the head from the image database of ORG . To fit the body and head together , the photograph of the head was vertically stretched and horizontally shrunk .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON applied for an interim injunction to stop any further publication of the photomontage . He argued that by planting his head on a different body and by the fact that his head appeared more corpulent in the photomontage than in real life , his reputation was being damaged . He stated , in particular , that his cheeks appeared longer , his chin plumper and his neck shorter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the interim injunction , without hearing the applicant \u2019s arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an objection by the applicant , ORG set the interim injunction aside . It found that the photomontage constituted a value judgment in the form of a satirical illustration , which conveyed the criticism expressed in the attached article . The minor discrepancies and the \u201c wrong \u201d body had not infringed Dr PERSON \u2019s personality rights to such a degree as to justify an interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression . The court also stated that it was not its task to assess whether the applicant could have created a \u201c better \u201d , less infringing photomontage , since the form of expression was the prerogative of the author or artist . Furthermore , the satirical nature of the illustration was apparent , as the average reader would not consider that Dr PERSON sitting on a crumbling \u201c T \u201d replicated real life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reinstated the interim injunction . It held that the illustration had to be divided between the \u201c T \u201d and the depicted person . While it was apparent that the \u201c T \u201d part was a satirical illustration , the manipulation of the head , namely the stretching and shrinking , was not so obvious . Consequently , the average reader would expect the picture of PERSON to depict reality . Owing to this \u201c untrue \u201d illustration , the personality rights of PERSON overrode the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the interim injunction preventing any further publication of the photomontage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal brought by the applicant . It reiterated that the manipulated photograph of PERSON showed him in an untrue , unfavourable and disadvantageous light . Nevertheless , since the manipulation was so slight , the average reader would not realise the distortion . The court found that PERSON PERSON did not have to accept this untrue and manipulated depiction of himself in the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned ORG judgment . It found that the satirical illustration could not be broken down into individual components , but had to be assessed as a whole . Therefore , the satirical nature of the illustration was apparent and a typical reader would not expect to see a depiction of reality . Given that the extent of the alteration had been so slight , the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression overrode the personality rights of PERSON , who had to accept the satirical illustration of himself . Furthermore , the court found that the publication of the photograph had not infringed PERSON right to protection of his image because , as the CEO of a well - known former ORG company with a monopoly , he was actually a \u201c relative figure of contemporary society \u201d ( relative Person der GPE ) . Given that the shares of the company were intensely advertised as \u201c people \u2019s shares \u201d ( GPE ) and that the company still had a leading market share the management style of Dr PERSON and the consequences for the company were an issue of general interest . Consequently , the satirical illustration , including the publication of his photograph attached to an article that contributed to a debate of general interest , was legitimate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG repealed ORG judgment and remitted the case ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The court held that personality rights generally also included protection from the publication of technically manipulated photographs . In the context of satirical illustrations , it had to be established whether the manipulation had its own satirical nature or was technically necessary for the composition of the illustration , or whether the alterations were negligible . Applying these principles to the photomontage in question , the court found that the applicants had used a photograph of PERSON to depict reality and make the person identifiable , and that the illustration of the person had no satirical value in itself . Therefore , the untrue photograph could only be justified if the alterations had been technically necessary or negligible . This however had to be ascertained by the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case to ORG , as the latter had not established whether the alterations had been technical necessary or negligible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed an expert to analyse the manipulations of the original photograph of PERSON and establish to what extent it had been altered . The expert established that the head had been vertically stretched by PERCENT and horizontally shrunk by PERCENT . He furthermore compiled his own photomontage that showed that the head could have been fitted to the body without the above - mentioned distortion being made . Consequently , he came to the conclusion that the manipulation had not been technically necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal by the applicant and upheld the original interim injunction , preventing any further publication of the photomontage . The court found that the unnecessary alterations of the photograph conveyed an untrue message regarding the appearance of PERSON . Because the manipulation had not been negligible and had led to an unfavourable and negative presentation of PERSON PERSON , his general personality rights had been infringed . This infraction could not be justified by the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit for adjudication a constitutional complaint brought by the applicant , without providing reasons ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
