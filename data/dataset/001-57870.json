On an appeal by the applicant , ORG of Appeal gave judgment at a private hearing on DATE . It annulled the special supervision measure and ordered the restitution of the security and the property seized and confiscated . Its decision ( decreto ) referred to the \" disconcertingly casual way in which the contested preventive measures concerning the person and property of PERSON had been adopted thereby effectively decreeing his civil and economic death \" .", "The decision was filed with the registry on DATE and signed by the relevant official of the prosecuting authority on DATE .

The above legislation was strengthened by Act no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \" LAW \" ) which inserted , inter alia , a section QUANTITY . It makes provision for various measures to be used in the course of proceedings relating to the application of the preventive measures available under LAW in respect of a person suspected of belonging to such an organisation :", "\" ... ORG may issue a reasoned decision , even of its own motion , ordering the seizure of property at the direct or indirect disposal of the person against whom the proceedings have been instituted , when there is sufficientcircumstantial evidence , such as a considerable discrepancy between his lifestyle and his apparent or declared income , to show that the property concerned forms the proceeds from unlawful activities or their reinvestment .", "Together with the implementation of the preventive measure the ORG shall order the confiscation of any of the goods seized in respect of which it has not been shown that they were lawfully acquired .

In its report ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG sets out a summary of the case - law in this area :", "\" ... The existence of preventive measures is not in itself contrary to LAW . ORG has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations , not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts , but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts ( ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE and judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "Because of their particular object , preventive measures do not relate to the commission of a specific unlawful act but to a pattern of behaviour defined by law as conduct indicating the existence of danger to society ( ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "Consequently , in the NORP legal system , there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures . The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act ; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act .", "In other words , a criminal penalty relates to an offence already committed , whereas a preventive measure is intended to reduce the risk of future offences ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , concerning security measures ) .", "...", "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different , not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter . For example , the presumption of innocence enunciated in LAW does not concern preventive measures , which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned ( ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "Similarly , such measures do not fall within the scope of LAW para . CARDINAL of the LAW , which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions . The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in ORG with regard to confiscation orders under LAW . ORG has ruled , firstly , that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures ( see , for example , ORG , GPE judgment of DATE ) . Secondly , ORG has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive , as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered ORG , PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force ( Court of Cassation , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "In spite of these limitations , preventive measures remain open to thorough scrutiny of their compatibility with LAW .", "As far back as DATE ORG ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law , where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision ( ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned ( ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy . Furthermore , the above CARDINAL conditions are closely linked . Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger ; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one ( Constitutional Court , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "The case - law of ORG is in this respect entirely consistent with that of ORG ; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence , any violation of those rights entailing their nullity ( see , for example , ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in the PERSON case ) .", "ORG has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section CARDINAL ter of the CARDINAL Act . In particular , it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with LAW , which guarantees the rights of the defence , since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal ( Court of Cassation , previously cited ORG judgment ) .", "...", "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) , ORG has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest . This applies in connection with possessions of unlawful origin or their use ( Court of Cassation , previously cited PERSON and ORG judgments ) .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . In its opinion no .
