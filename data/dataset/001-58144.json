NORP On DATE the NORP parliament set up a parliamentary commission of inquiry to look into the way PERSON had performed her duties , and the circumstances of her resignation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry , PERSON , was informed that a PERSON , an NORP citizen , had obtained from the applicant a document which ORG and ORG had refused to communicate to him , in exchange for a payment of MONEY . PERSON was given this information by a Mr Y , who had himself obtained it from the initial informant , a Mr Z.", "CARDINAL . It subsequently transpired that PERSON was named in the NORP letter of request , which contained confidential information about his role in organised crime . Suspicion therefore arose that a member of ORG and Police might have passed on confidential documents relating to the request , thus breaching the duty not to disclose official secrets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened an investigation against a person or persons unknown in order to question the informant Y and to identify the person working at ORG and Police who might have disclosed official secrets .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG decided to close the investigation , on the ground that there was no evidence to corroborate the suspicions that the applicant \u2019s wife or a member of ORG and Police had disclosed official secrets , namely certain passages of the letter of request which had been classified as confidential .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed PERSON that a judicial investigation had been opened , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in connection with the suspected disclosure of official secrets , and that his private and professional telephone lines had been tapped , in accordance with sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) .", "The letter stated that the monitoring had lasted from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and that \u201c conversations connected with his professional activities as a lawyer [ had not been ] monitored \u201d . It also stated that , pursuant to section DATE ter ) of LAW , all the recordings had been destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parliamentary commission of inquiry issued a communiqu\u00e9 concerning the monitoring of PERSON telephone lines in connection with the judicial investigation concerning him . It stated in particular :", "\u201c In the course of its inquiries , in connection with which it obtained authorisation to intercept telephone communications , the [ ORG discovered that the NORP citizen \u2019s NORP representatives had tried to obtain the confidential document in the file by applying to [ the applicant ] . They were hoping for privileged access to ORG and Police on account of the fact that he was the husband of ORG then responsible for that ORG . For a fee , a lawyer from [ the applicant ] \u2019s law firm studied the file in order to decide whether to take on the case , but turned it down . An attempt was then made to obtain the confidential part of the file through another lawyer . The NORP letter of request was in the end disclosed , but only after the confidential passages had been blotted out . On the basis of these findings , ORG discontinued the investigation \u2026 The suspicion that there had been a disclosure of official secrets thus proved to be unfounded . The police investigation did , however , reveal how the rumour that led to the information and the suspicion arose . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a number of NORP newspapers commented on the above communiqu\u00e9 . They mentioned the applicant among the persons implicated and mentioned that telephones had been tapped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE PERSON lodged complaints with ORG and Police about breaches of the legislation on telephone tapping and of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints . Considering that they were to be classified as complaints to a higher authority , it refused him unrestricted access to his file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged an administrative appeal with ORG against the decision taken on DATE by ORG and Police . He complained , among other matters , of unlawful telephone tapping and of the refusal to give him free access to the file .", "Under the heading \u201c Violation of LAW \u201d , he made the following submission in particular :", "\u201c In that context , it should also be noted that the telephone lines of [ the applicant ] \u2019s law firm , which included a number of partners , were tapped . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL bis ) of LAW expressly prohibits the interception of such telephone conversations . Interception of telephone conversations with [ the applicant ] \u2019s law firm was therefore likewise illegal under the above - mentioned provision of NORP law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the administrative appeal .", "It observed that , where telephone tapping was concerned , a complaint to a higher authority , even one which had no basis in law , was to be treated as a normal administrative appeal . It held that it had jurisdiction to determine whether monitoring of the applicant \u2019s telephone lines had been unlawful , whether that measure had been in breach of the LAW and whether the applicant \u2019s right to inspect his file had been infringed . If his personal rights had been infringed , the applicant could claim damages . He could also rely on ORG decision in order to seek redress ( GPE ) from ORG .", "ORG considered that the applicant should have access only to those documents in the file which were directly relevant to the fact that he had had his telephone tapped as a \u201c third party \u201d . It noted that he had had restricted access to the documents , some of which had been censored , particularly as regards the informants\u2019 names . Others , which concerned , for instance , the telephone tapping , had not been made available to him , but he had been orally informed of their existence and content . Several documents concerning third parties had not been handed over to him because their interests prevailed over his .", "According to ORG , section CARDINAL of LAW authorised monitoring the telephones of third parties , such as the applicant , if there was evidence giving rise to a presumption that they were receiving information from an offender or imparting information to him .", "It considered that in the period of general uncertainty due to rumours of subversion which had then obtained ( eine durch GPE verunsicherte PERSON ) there had been specific evidence pointing to a disclosure of official secrets by someone within ORG and Police . The document in question contained confidential information about which guarantees had been given to GPE . The credibility of GPE had therefore been at stake . An apparent risk had been identified when the name of the applicant , who was the husband of the former head of ORG and Police , was mentioned .", "According to ORG , it had been necessary to tap the telephone lines at the beginning of the investigation , before contacts were established with Mr Y and PERSON The civil servants concerned had therefore not immediately looked into the informants\u2019 credibility , considering that any further contact would have compromised the investigation .", "ORG observed that the applicant had had his telephone tapped not as a suspect but as a \u201c third party \u201d within the meaning of section MONEY bis ) of LAW . The conversations he had had in the capacity of lawyer had been expressly excluded . As he was not a civil servant , he could not have been guilty of the offence concerned . His wife had been one of the theoretically possible suspects , but there was no real evidence implicating her or anyone else . The fact that the applicant \u2019s telephone lines had been monitored did not mean , therefore , that he had been under suspicion in the criminal sense . Moreover , the fact that the police investigation had been initiated in respect of \u201c a person or persons unknown \u201d was not simply a ploy to preserve appearances . Lastly , the investigation had not been ordered for political reasons and the chairman of the parliamentary commission had not been in a position to influence it .", "In conclusion , ORG observed that the conversations recorded had been of no interest to the investigators and no report on them had been made . Be that as it may , even if such a report had been sent to the parliamentary commission , it could not have been used improperly because its members were bound by the duty not to disclose official secrets .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also lodged with ORG an administrative - law appeal against the decision taken on DATE by ORG and Police ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He asked ORG to rule that the telephone tapping had been unlawful and accordingly to order the institution of criminal proceedings against those responsible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment against the applicant .", "It first considered whether he should have been permitted to inspect the whole of the file when the case had been brought before ORG and Police . It noted that he had been able to inspect those passages in the document which had determined the decision ( entscheidungswesentlich ) and that the decision not to disclose the informants\u2019 names had been justified . It held that the above conclusion was also consistent with the parliamentary commission of inquiry \u2019s decision to guarantee the informants\u2019 anonymity . Moreover , on the basis of even a partial inspection of the file ( gest\u00fctzt auf die ihm zugestellten \u201c gestrippten \u201d PERSON ) , the applicant had been able to lodge appeals .", "ORG then considered whether criminal proceedings should be brought in connection with the monitoring of the applicant \u2019s telephone lines . It held that it was not required to provide a conclusive ( abschliessend ) answer to the question whether the telephone tapping constituted a violation of LAW , having regard in particular to the fact that the applicant had already appealed to ORG . It noted that criminal proceedings had been instituted for a presumed disclosure of official secrets on the basis of information passed on by the chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry . The applicant \u2019s firm was involved inasmuch as one of his partners had looked into the case in order to decide whether he should take it on . The presumption by ORG that the first informant or the disloyal civil servant would contact the applicant did not seem to have been wholly unjustified .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , any person who discloses a secret entrusted to him in the capacity of civil servant makes himself liable to imprisonment or a fine . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , the offence comes under the jurisdiction of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
