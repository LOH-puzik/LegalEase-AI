SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-c", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE in DATE and qualified as a doctor of medicine in DATE . He worked as a doctor in ORG . From DATE onwards he was responsible for coordinating relations between ORG and the relevant bodies in ORG . On account of his nationality of origin and knowledge of languages , he was more particularly responsible for looking after the NORP patients in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG for the GPE of GPE commenced criminal proceedings against him following a complaint by GPE . The applicant was accused of causing GPE \u2019s welfare institutions to sustain substantial losses with the complicity of an official at the consulate of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and over the period that followed , the applicant was questioned several times by the cantonal investigating judge . On DATE he was arrested and charged with fraud , intimidation and forging documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s release on bail on payment of a sum as security . On DATE the initial investigation was completed and the case file sent to ORG for a decision on whether to proceed with the prosecution . On DATE the applicant paid the stipulated sum and was released .", "CARDINAL . He then travelled to GPE , where he acquired NORP nationality and practised as a doctor specialising in the treatment of certain serious forms of cancer .", "CARDINAL . By an initial order of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE committed the applicant for trial at GPE ORG . That order was subsequently set aside on an application by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a fresh order committing the applicant for trial at GPE ORG . Appeals by the applicant against that order were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . At a preliminary meeting on DATE the President of ORG discussed the case with a prosecution representative and the applicant \u2019s lawyers in GPE . He informed them that the case might be set down for trial DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the President of ORG informed the parties that the trial would commence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of ORG held a further hearing on DATE after giving notice to the parties . At the hearing one of the lawyers for the defence indicated that he envisaged making \u201c an application for an adjournment of the trial \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG made an order for the applicant to appear before ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he questioned the applicant in the presence of his lawyer . The applicant confirmed that he would attend the trial . After the hearing he returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s NORP patients , applied to GPE for GPE , ORG , for orders requiring the applicant to continue to treat him until he could be replaced by another doctor and , in the interim , prohibiting him from leaving GPE . He maintained that his life would be in danger if there were any interruption in the treatment he was receiving from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG granted the application in the applicant \u2019s absence and made a temporary restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of GPE until he was examined by ORG at a hearing to be held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s GPE lawyers and an NORP lawyer acting for him informed the GPE of GPE prosecuting authorities of that order .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place on DATE before the President of GPE for GPE . The applicant stated that he did not know any doctor who was capable of taking over the treatment of his patients . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers informed ORG that under NORP procedural rules an accused had no guarantee that he or she would be served with the documentary evidence in the case file or that there would be a proper adversarial hearing . He also said that there was a risk that the applicant would face the death sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP court issued a restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of GPE and requiring him to surrender his passport . That decision was served on the NORP authorities , including ORG of the GPE of GPE , who was given DATE in which to respond . The applicant was requested to find replacement doctors for his patients .", "CARDINAL . After serving the NORP court \u2019s order on the GPE of GPE prosecuting authorities , the applicant \u2019s lawyers made several applications for an adjournment of the trial , on DATE and DATE and at the start of the trial at GPE ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE the President of ORG declined to adjourn the trial , holding that the applicant had been absent without good cause . He found that it had not been proved that the accused had been unable to attend the trial for a reason beyond his control . On the contrary , there was a consistent body of evidence that showed that the reason relied on by the applicant had not been beyond his control . The President noted , in particular , that the NORP order had been made largely in reliance on evidence from the applicant \u2019s patients , in other words on information of no scientific weight ; furthermore , the applicant had consistently benefited over DATE from the support of NORP figures who were highly influential in GPE and close both to the judge and to the applicant . The President observed that the decision appeared very favourable to the applicant , who had not appealed against it , despite being entitled to do so . Lastly , it was not to be overlooked that the applicant had known for a long time that he would stand trial . He had been told the approximate date of his trial in DATE and the exact date in DATE and it had accordingly been his duty as a doctor to ensure that there was a replacement for him if he really wished to appear for trial .", "CARDINAL . Hearings were held by ORG , composed of the President and CARDINAL jurors , from DATE . The applicant did not appear but his CARDINAL lawyers were present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with GPE for GPE to have the restraining order of CARDINAL DATE set aside , notably on the ground that it infringed the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution , which guaranteed personal liberty and the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions respectively . In reply to a request by the applicant for a hearing date , ORG informed him on DATE that it would not be able to examine the merits of the application for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE of ORG convicted the applicant in absentia and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE , DATE and DATE remained to be served . It also made an order excluding him from NORP territory for DATE . ORG found the applicant guilty on CARDINAL out of CARDINAL counts of forging documents and of a like number of counts of fraud . The applicant was also found guilty of forgery of documents for procuring the signing by his secretary of CARDINAL false receipts for expenses in a name she no longer used . The jury assessed the amount of alleged damage at MONEY . On the other hand , the applicant was acquitted by the jury on CARDINAL counts of forging documents . The offences to which the convictions related had been committed DATE .", "CARDINAL . An application for the applicant \u2019s immediate arrest made by ORG after the delivery of the verdict was dismissed by ORG in view , notably , of the fact that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted had been committed a long time before and that a committal warrant could be issued once the judgment had become final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG of GPE for the conviction in absentia to be set aside , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He maintained that good cause had been shown for his absence at the hearing on DATE , as he had been compelled to comply with the enforceable decision of the NORP court DATE which clearly constituted a reason beyond his control \u2013 and that his case should therefore be remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . It noted that the wording of LAW made it clear that in order to have a judgment of ORG set aside , the convicted person had to show good cause for failing to appear for trial . Referring to GPE ORG case - law , ORG stated that any failure to appear due to absence , illness or any other case of force majeure , such as unawareness of the investigation or prosecution , could constitute good cause . Whether the reason preventing appearance was beyond the control of the accused was accordingly the criterion for distinguishing a reason that justified quashing a conviction from one that did not .", "ORG held , in particular , that the applicant had been seriously at fault in not transmitting his medical knowledge to other practitioners despite knowing from DATE , the date of his release , that he would CARDINAL day stand trial . His trial had eventually begun DATE after his release on bail , so he had had ample time to pass on his experience to others , and to instruct and train them in his method of treatment , even though it was highly sophisticated . Before the NORP court , he had done no more than make vague statements to the effect that he had long since organised training courses for various doctors with a view to sharing his knowledge with them . However , on each occasion that the question had been put to him , he had repeated that only he could treat his patients and that without his care they would be certain to die . ORG described that attitude as irresponsible .", "The applicant was also held to be at fault for having delayed in appealing against the decision of the NORP court . The appeal had been lodged on DATE , that is to say DATE after his trial had actually begun , and his application for an adjournment had been dismissed . By that juncture , for reasons of time , he could no longer reverse the course of events he had helped set in motion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE dismissing his application for relief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE for GPE set aside the order of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the return of the applicant \u2019s passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant attended the hearing before GPE ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded , holding that he had brought about the situation that had prevented him from leaving his patients and appearing before ORG by his own conduct . In addition , statements he had made to GPE cast doubt on whether he had genuinely intended to travel to GPE to stand trial . Further evidence of his bad faith was provided by the fact that he had misled the NORP court about the procedure that would be followed in the criminal proceedings against him in GPE . ORG considered that the applicant had done everything in his power , notably by making remarks that assisted his opponent \u2019s case , to ensure the eventual success of the application to the NORP court for an order restraining him from travelling to GPE to stand trial . It held that the applicant \u2019s inability to appear before ORG was his own fault in that he had made a decisive contribution to that outcome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG a notice of appeal on points of law against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that the argument concerning the refusal to remit the case had been conclusively disposed of in its judgment of DATE . It further held that , in so far as they were not inadmissible as being out of time , having been dismissed in the earlier proceedings , the complaints of violations of the rights of the defence were ill - founded . Lastly , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument concerning the legal definition of the offences of fraud and forging documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a public - law appeal with ORG , seeking to have set aside ORG judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . He alleged , inter alia , a violation of his right to be heard and to attend his trial and of his right to a fair hearing , equality of arms and a properly composed and functioning court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , which was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyers on DATE , ORG dismissed his appeal .", "It held that LAW did not preclude a trial being held in the defendant \u2019s absence if the defendant refused to attend or was unable to attend through his or her own fault . It considered that the applicant had misled the NORP court by making inaccurate statements , notably regarding NORP procedure , in order to secure a judgment making it impossible for him to attend his trial ; indeed , his NORP lawyers had admitted as much . In that connection , ORG noted that the applicant had said that he had been held without charges in GPE for DATE and feared that he would be sentenced to death in GPE . He had also stated that the defence had been denied access to the case file and had not been able to take part in the earlier proceedings .", "Referring to an opinion on NORP law that had been sent to ORG by the NORP embassy in GPE , ORG also agreed with the cantonal authorities\u2019 findings that the applicant had failed to appeal effectively against the NORP court \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE in that he had not appealed to a court ( ORG for ORG ) that could have found in his favour . ORG noted that , according to the author of the legal opinion , the decision of the NORP court was contrary to the public interest and defied common sense , and an appeal to the higher court would have had good prospects of success . As regards good faith , the applicant could not avoid his obligation to appear before the NORP courts by relying on a decision that was ultimately based on equivocal and even knowingly inaccurate statements that he had made to the NORP court .", "ORG held that ORG had not acted arbitrarily in finding that , even supposing that the applicant had not brought about the NORP court \u2019s decision barring him from attending his trial , he had facilitated that decision by supporting his patient PERSON \u2019s argument . Besides , his NORP lawyer had not sought to conceal that the aim of the defence had been to obtain an adjournment of the trial in GPE . Although that lawyer had been to GPE and was in close contact with his client \u2019s GPE counsel , he had not given the NORP court accurate information about the procedure that would be followed or the sentence the applicant would face if convicted . In ORG opinion , it was possible to infer from the foregoing that it was the applicant \u2019s own fault that he had been unable to attend his trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested at FAC ( GPE ) on his way to a conference . He was extradited to GPE and transferred to Champ - Dollon Prison . An application he made for a pardon was refused in DATE . He served the remainder of his sentence , spending part of it in a secure wing of ORG . On DATE he returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , persons convicted in absentia may apply to have their conviction set aside if they show that through no fault of their own they were unaware of the summons to appear or unable to attend the trial ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
