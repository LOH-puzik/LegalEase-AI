A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are CARDINAL NORP Cypriots relatives of QUANTITY men who were killed during the conflict in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and their relatives were living in or about the area of ORG ( Ta\u015fkent ) village . On DATE armed NORP Cypriots who were mostly from the locality arrived at the village and collected the male NORP - NORP population of the village and marched them to a NORP elementary school in the NORP sector . Among the abductors were named villagers under the command of a named NORP man , GPE , from the village , along with CARDINAL NORP soldiers in uniform with a mainland NORP accent .", "CARDINAL . Some CARDINAL NORP - NORP men , including children as young DATE , were kept TIME at the school . CARDINAL NORP - NORP men from CARDINAL other villages were also brought to the school . CARDINAL NORP officers from the mainland told them they were prisoners of war and led them to believe that they would be taken to a prison camp at GPE . TIME , the NORP - Cypriot men and boys were loaded on QUANTITY buses under armed guard . They were taken away to an unknown destination .", "CARDINAL . A statement by PERSON , reported in newspapers shortly afterwards and later included in a book on the conflict , gave the following account of the fate of the men . PERSON , his father and brother were amongst the men loaded on the buses . Their bus drove past GPE and stopped at a junction . The armed men ordered the prisoners to march into the countryside . They were ordered to stop at a hollow and allowed to smoke . Almost immediately , shooting began . PERSON was hit in the stomach and legs and fell down pretending to be dead . He heard the CARDINAL armed guards speaking in a mainland NORP accent , saying \u201c That is the end of them , let \u2019s go now and bring a bulldozer and bury them . \u201d PERSON cousin was also still alive but badly wounded but PERSON was unable to help him due to his own injuries . He fled the scene , hiding out in the hills for DATE . He was eventually picked up by a ORG ambulance and taken to a NORP base . He later went to the north in a helicopter .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the stories of various villagers , naming NORP Cypriots involved in the incident , were published in a booklet \u201c The Tragedy of Turkish Cypriot missing persons in GPE \u2013 Third decade \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants provided information that on DATE , the alleged perpetrator , DATE , made a statement to the newspaper \u201c Alithia \u201d , stating inter alia that he and others had acted together with the government forces and had done what the government forces ordered them to do . He confirmed the gathering of the NORP men and that they had been loaded onto buses by soldiers from ORG .", "CARDINAL . No information about the applicants\u2019 missing relatives was given nor any investigative measure taken until , on DATE , ORG made a statement in newspapers published in northern GPE inviting the families of missing persons to give blood samples to ORG to aid in the identification of remains . The applicants came south and gave blood samples DATE .", "CARDINAL . No news was forthcoming for some time so in DATE the applicants contacted both ORG and the Attorney- General of GPE asking for information . On receiving no reply within DATE , some of the applicants filed CARDINAL cases in ORG on DATE and DATE against the Attorney ORG , ORG and ORG claiming that the authorities had failed to initiate all relevant procedures to ascertain the fate of the disappeared men during DATE and that the authorities should be ordered to conduct an effective investigation to locate and identify the remains and to identify and prosecute the perpetrators .", "CARDINAL . ORG on Missing Persons ( \u201c the UNCMP \u201d ) had meanwhile commenced exhumations . On DATE , excavation began in a mountain region in GPE village and soon after remains of CARDINAL missing men from the CARDINAL villages were found . The remains of CARDINAL of the remaining CARDINAL missing men were later found at another location . A newspaper account dated DATE explained that the remains of this group of victims had been transferred by NORP Cypriots from CARDINAL burial spot to another unknown location due to a minefield \u2013 the remains of CARDINAL men had been left behind . The DNA analysis of the remains has not yet been issued by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the claims finding that the subject - matter constituted an \u201c act of ORG \u201d , with which the courts could not interfere . The plaintiffs appealed . The decision was upheld on DATE ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to information submitted by the ORG , the Attorney General ordered an investigation into the death of CARDINAL missing persons from Tochni on DATE . Steps taken included as follows .", "CARDINAL . The police took statements from CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL relatives of missing persons who had written to the Attorney General naming QUANTITY persons as implicated in the events leading to their relatives\u2019 deaths and requesting an investigation . These CARDINAL witnesses named QUANTITY persons , including QUANTITY brothers , as arresting the missing men and confining them at the elementary school . The men had been boarded on a bus DATE . CARDINAL witness stated that it was CARDINAL NORP Cypriots in uniform whom he did not know who put the men on the bus . The witness who had survived the incident stated that it was the NORP Cypriots who put the men on the bus who later killed them but he did not know their identities .", "CARDINAL . Of the QUANTITY persons named as arresting the missing men ( including the individuals referred to in paragraph QUANTITY above ) , the police found that CARDINAL had died . Statements were taken from the remaining CARDINAL . CARDINAL denied any involvement ; the fourth admitted taking NORP to be confined at the school . He had left at that stage but named CARDINAL men who remained to guard the prisoners . On investigation the police found these QUANTITY men had since died . A statement was also taken from a former policeman who had visited the elementary school at the time ; while he named a man guarding the prisoners , it transpired that this man had died . The police officer also confirmed that orders had been given to confine ORG but did not remember the source of the orders \u2013 with some doubt , he thought they might have come from the national guard general staff . A former PERSON army officer named by a witness as passing on orders to confine NORP was located ; he claimed not to remember whether the orders came from or whether it was his own initiative ; he only recalled confining NORP males from PERSON in the village coffee shop .", "CARDINAL . Police made efforts to track the source of the orders . A search of the national guard records yielded no results .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Attorney - General gave instructions to the police for further investigative steps . Following the ORG \u2019s decision in the case of PERSON and Others v Cyprus , he took further steps to ensure the transmission of information about the finding of bodies of missing persons . On DATE , he was then informed by the CMP of the discovery of the remains of CARDINAL unidentified remains from Tochni village . He in turn informed the chief of police , noting that an investigation was already pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Attorney General was informed of the identification of the bodies of CARDINAL of the missing men from Tochni . On DATE he ordered a specific investigation into their deaths .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the police submitted the ORG investigation file to the Attorney General . He gave instructions on DATE for further investigation , inter alia to investigate the historical background of the DATE events , to explore the possibility that some of those known to be implicated in the DATE events might have been involved in ORG killings , to broaden the temporal scope of the investigation so as not to be restricted to orders given on DATE of the second invasion ( DATE ) and to investigate further the allegation of the witness survivor that the bus had been stopped at a police checkpoint on the route to GPE . He ordered that the investigation should not be closed without the discovery and identification of all the missing men and joined all relevant investigations .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , which found difficulty in reconciling names of applicants with those included in official records , DNA samples were taken from CARDINAL villagers in order to assist in the identification of remains . CARDINAL of these were applicants in this case . These samples were taken in DATE from the villagers who gave them voluntarily after signing a consent form in the NORP language . The consent form stated that the DNA would be isolated from the sample and stored and registered at CING ( the DNA Identification Laboratory ) and that the DNA would be used in tests and identification studies for the identification of the remains of their missing relatives . The results would be communicated to any NORP person or institution as authorised by the President of the Republic and to the donor after approval by the Government .", "CARDINAL . CING processed the samples , isolating the DNA which was stored . In DATE - CARDINAL , during negotiations with the ORG , it was clear that the NORP member wanted fresh samples to be taken . This was reflected in the ORG agreement with CING for provision of funds . Fresh samples of blood were accordingly obtained from NORP - Cypriot relatives under the auspices of the NORP - Cypriot member who verified that all had signed , and understood , a fresh consent form indicating that the DNA isolated from the sample would be transmitted by the NORP - Cypriot member of the UNCMP to CING to be genotyped and only to be used in the framework of the ORG programme of identifying remains . The form stated that previous consent forms were revoked . It was stated that at DATE ORG project copies of all available data would be transferred to the NORP - Cypriot member of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that CING holds DNA samples from CARDINAL applicants , transferred to them in DATE by the NORP - Cypriot member of the ORG . At this stage , the previous samples from DATE were destroyed for CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL villagers . This was in accordance with the revocation of the former forms of consent and new arrangements . Copies of official records of destruction of the material have been provided .", "CARDINAL . The DNA samples of those individuals who only donated blood in DATE are still stored and no analysis has yet been made . No NORP who gave a sample in DATE has approached CING requesting any information about the fate of their sample .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the NORP - Cypriot member of the ORG requested a digital copy of all the data related to the NORP - Cypriot relatives of missing persons . CING transmitted the data on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the destruction of samples given by any of the CARDINAL remaining villagers or applicants who only gave samples in DATE is subject to the procedure set out in ORG of the CING laboratory \u2013 a form existed whereby requests for destruction could be lodged .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , CING was no longer involved in identification of remains . Their role has been superceded by an agreement in DATE between the ORG and ORG on Missing Persons in GPE to which organisation all blood samples are now sent for testing . The applicants pointed out that they were not sent copies of the destruction records and had not been informed that their samples had been destroyed at the time . For those who had given samples not yet destroyed , they had not been given any information about their use or fate .", "CARDINAL . In these cases lodged in DATE , the relatives of CARDINAL NORP - NORP men who went missing on DATE after they had been taken from their homes by armed NORP Cypriots , lodged applications under LAW , claiming that GPE had known of the deaths of the missing persons but had not searched for the corpses or brought the guilty persons to justice and that the Republic had not taken the necessary actions to pursue an effective investigation to determine the whereabouts and fate of the missing persons . In their response , GPE stated that they had not been passive but had been unable to pursue their intentions to exhume and identify corpses due to the agreement between ORG , the NORP - NORP side and themselves that exhumations would be conducted by a common programme of ORG . They also pointed out that exhumations had begun in DATE and the programme indicated the likelihood of the exhumation of the graves in the relevant area would commence in DATE . They disputed that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the courts but fell rather under the supervision of ORG and the authority and initiative of the President of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . In its decision dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG in its appellate capacity held that the fate of missing persons fell under the authority of the President of the Republic as it had an international aspect ; the cases therefore concerned an act of government which did not fall within the jurisdiction to annul of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
