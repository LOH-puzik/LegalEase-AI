NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before ORG by Ms A. \u017buraniewska , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued a building permit allowing the applicant \u2019s neighbour , PERSON , to construct a storehouse ( budnek inwentarsko - sk\u0142adowy ) and a midden ( gnojownia ) on her land adjacent to the applicant \u2019s plot . It was specified that the building should be situated along the boundary between the plots , QUANTITY from the applicant \u2019s land . It was further required that the walls facing the applicant \u2019s property should be without windows or doors and that rainwater should run off onto GPE \u2019s land . It appears that on an unspecified date in DATE another of the applicant \u2019s neighbours , GPE , obtained a similar construction permit concerning her land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG ( FAC ) to complain that GPE and GPE had constructed on their land large buildings serving as slaughterhouses ( ubojnia ) and meatprocessing plants ( masarnia ) . The applicant submitted , inter alia , that ORG building was too close to his property and that rainwater from her roof ran off directly onto his land . He maintained that the ORG activities were a nuisance to him and his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG scheduled an inspection of the properties concerned , which was carried out on DATE . It was established that ORG \u2019s building on the land adjacent to the applicant \u2019s was being constructed in accordance with the building permit issued on DATE by the Mayor of GPE . It was further established that despite the fact that the building had not yet been completed , PERSON was already using it as a meatprocessing plant . PERSON was fined in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the property of GPE , the applicant submitted that he had not been informed of the result of the relevant inspection or the course of the administrative proceedings which had followed . This was so because the authorities considered that he had no legal interest in the outcome of those proceedings since her land did not directly adjoin his .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the construction work on ORG \u2019s land be stopped . The order was to remain valid for DATE and a new decision as to the continuation of the work was to be issued before its expiry . Subsequently , on DATE ORG ordered GPE to submit , by DATE , certain technical documents concerning the construction . The authority informed her that if she wanted to use the building as a meat - processing plant , she would have to apply for so - called \u201c initial planning permission \u201d ( decyzja w sprawie warunk\u00f3w zabudowy i zagospodarowania terenu ) . It was further established that the dimensions of the building were smaller than those stipulated by the original building permit of CARDINAL DATE ; windows and doors had been placed in different places ; the rainwater draining system was inadequate , mainly because the building was situated very close to the boundary between the plots ; and the building was already being used as a slaughterhouse and a meatprocessing plant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a similar decision in respect of GPE \u2019s land . The decision was subsequently quashed by the Rzesz\u00f3w Governor . On DATE ORG upheld the Governor \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a positive opinion with regard to the sanitation of the building on GPE \u2019s property . The inspector considered that the modification of the use of that building as a slaughterhouse and meat - processing plant was legally permitted , on condition that a maximum of CARDINAL porkers were slaughtered per month . On DATE the ORG quashed that decision .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the applicant , on DATE ORG summoned the applicant and PERSON to another inspection of ORG property to be carried out on DATE . It was established during that inspection that ORG had failed to comply with the terms of the original building permit . On DATE ORG asked ORG to impose a fine on her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his neighbours had not ceased their business activities . He submitted that ORG company was slaughtering approximately ten animals per day and continuing the meat - processing activities . He asked for an expert in environmental matters to be appointed to inspect the property . In reply , on DATE ORG informed the applicant that the deadline which had been set for ORG to submit the relevant technical documents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) would expire on DATE and that the proceedings had therefore been stayed until that date .", "CARDINAL . By way of a decision given on DATE , the Rzesz\u00f3w Governor ordered ORG to submit , within DATE , an environmental impact assessment of the slaughterhouse and meat - processing plant , referring to an ordinance of CARDINAL DATE issued by ORG , ORG and Forestry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG warned GPE that noncompliance with the deadline for submission of the documents which she was obliged to submit could lead to criminal sanctions under LAW DATE ( Prawo budowlane ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON submitted the environmental impact assessment in respect of her slaughterhouse and meat - processing plant to the regional office of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his letter of DATE the applicant asked the NORP Governor to carry out an environmental impact assessment of ORG \u2019s business . He complained that GPE and GPE were running CARDINAL slaughterhouses and meat - processing plants , which were causing pollution and posed a real risk to the health of the neighbourhood . He stressed that his complaints to ORG and ORG , ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG ( ORG PERSON ) had been to no avail . On DATE ORG forwarded the letter to ORG and on DATE asked ORG to inform ORG and the applicant about the measures taken as a result of his complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that on DATE ORG ( PERSON GPE ) and ORG had conducted an on - site inspection of the company and established that the applicant \u2019s allegations were unfounded . The inspectors had no objections to the sanitation of the sites . The liquid sewage was drained to concrete containers with covers and removed by a waste - disposal company at least once per week . The owners had been keeping records of the water used and sewage removed from the LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the regional office of ORG that CARDINAL inspections had been carried out on the sites of both companies between DATE and DATE . As a result , certain obligations had been imposed on the owners in order to rectify any irregularities identified during the inspections . Otherwise , the inspectors had found that the companies had been complying with the applicable environmental requirements . In particular , the bacteriological soil tests confirmed that the land had not been contaminated and that no danger to health or the environment could originate from it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for an order to demolish the buildings constructed by GPE and GPE on their plots . He argued that the buildings did not comply with the original building permits issued in DATE . On DATE the Rzesz\u00f3w Governor informed the applicant that he had enquired into why the firstinstance authority had not yet enforced decisions concerning the illegal construction on ORG \u2019s land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Act , which provided for the demolition of buildings constructed in breach of building permits , was not applicable to the buildings on GPE \u2019s and ORG property . This was so essentially because the local land development plan allowed for the type of business activity conducted in those buildings . A demolition order could not therefore be issued in respect of those buildings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged an application for retrospective permission to use the building on her property as a slaughterhouse and meat - processing plant ( post\u0119powanie w sprawie zalegalizowania poprzez wydanie pozwolenia na u\u017cytkowanie budynku gospodarczego za zmian\u0105 sposobu uzytkowania PERSON na rze\u017ani\u0119masarni\u0119 wybudowanego niezgodnie z pozwoleniem ) . She submitted the documentation requested on DATE by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the Rzesz\u00f3w Governor \u2019s Office ( ORG ) informed her that under LAW of DATE ( LOC z dn . CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL o zmianie ustawy o ochronie i kszta\u0142towaniu \u015brodowiska ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) she was obliged to lodge her application for a retrospective permit with ORG . It was pointed out that the new application should contain a report on the environmental impact of her business activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed GPE that her application could not be examined as it did not meet the formal requirements . On DATE ORG renewed her application . On DATE ORG , having noted that the building on her land did not comply with the original building permit , requested an expert opinion from ORG as to the compatibility of the meat - processing plant with the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG of ORG ( ORG PERSON ) refused ORG \u2019s application for a retrospective conversion permit on the grounds that her business plan was flawed . It was further noted that appropriate tests should be performed to assess the environmental impact of her business activities on the neighbourhood . On DATE ORG requested another expert opinion from ORG as to the compatibility of that business with the requirements of the environmental legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered GPE to submit , by DATE , supplementary documents concerning her company ( concerning , inter alia , the results of soil contamination tests , noise levels caused by the operation of the plant and the waste disposal survey ) . On DATE she complied with that order . On DATE she informed ORG that the regional agronomy laboratory had been commissioned to carry out the soil contamination test . However , the test could not be carried out because the applicant had not allowed soil samples to be taken from his property . Subsequently , samples were taken from GPE s property close to the boundary with the applicant \u2019s property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the director of the environmental protection department of the Rzesz\u00f3w Governor \u2019s ORG issued an administrative decision declaring that ORG \u2019s business activity was compatible with the requirements of the environmental legislation . It was held that it had not caused any environmental degradation and its continuation was unlikely to pose any environmental risks in the future . The meat - processing plant fulfilled the requirements laid down by environmental protection regulations . In particular , its operation did not exceed permissible levels of pollution and noise , and the waste and sewage - disposal system worked properly . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to the Minister for ORG , ORG and Forestry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister quashed the contested decision , stating that under new environmental legislation that had entered into force on CARDINAL DATE ( when the proceedings were ongoing ) it was no longer necessary to determine whether the plant complied with environmental requirements , essentially because the plant could not be qualified as being particularly harmful to the environment and/or human health . The proceedings were therefore discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled an inspection of ORG \u2019s property . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that ORG had continued the construction work . On DATE the inspection was carried out . There were no signs of ongoing construction work at that time . It was established that ORG had continued to run her meat - processing business in the unfinished building . On DATE ORG ordered GPE to refrain from using her slaughterhouse and meatprocessing plant , since the building was considered an illicit construction ( samowola budowlana ) . PERSON appealed . On DATE the NORP Governor quashed the contested decision and remitted the case to the firstinstance authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings ex officio because PERSON had , in the meantime , applied to have her case decided under the legal provisions applicable at the time when the construction work had stopped . On DATE the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision . On DATE the NORP Governor quashed the contested decision and remitted the case to the first - instance authority . On DATE FAC ( Rejonowy Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego ) informed ORG that ORG had complied with the requirements imposed on her by the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG issued a decision authorising PERSON to run her business on her property ( decision No . AB CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The applicant appealed . On DATE the ORG Governor quashed the first - instance decision and refused to issue the permit sought ( no . ORG V CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG quashed both the first and second - instance decisions . It referred to the number of proceedings conducted in GPE \u2019s case and found that all of them , including the proceedings concerning the request for retrospective permission to use the building as a meat - processing plant should have been dealt with by FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a positive opinion with regard to the partial use of the building on ORG \u2019s property as a slaughterhouse and meat - processing plant . It had regard to a report concerning that business \u2019s environmental impact . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the FAC ( Wojew\u00f3dzki Inspektor PERSON ) authorised PERSON to use part of the building for meat - processing activities ( decision No . CARDINAL ) . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against that decision . On DATE ORG quashed the contested decision and remitted the case to the first - instance authority . The applicant and PERSON appealed . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE the court rejected ORG \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . A number of decisions given in subsequent proceedings were quashed upon appeal and the case was remitted to the firstinstance authority . On DATE the local ORG again authorised PERSON to use part of the building for meat - processing activities . This decision was quashed upon appeal . The owner was ordered to submit an expert opinion on the technical state of the building . In the proceedings conducted afterwards PERSON acknowledged , in DATE , that she had been conducting meat processing business in a building which had never been certified as suitable for these purposes within the meaning of construction laws . On DATE the local ORG ordered the owner to cease operation of her business . This decision was subsequently quashed and the proceedings were discontinued . The applicant \u2019s efforts to have them reopened remain unsuccessful . In the relevant correspondence the authorities stated repeatedly that in his complaints the applicant had failed to make it clear what procedural steps should be taken by the authorities in respect of the decision to discontinue the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the head of ORG ordered GPE to apply for a permit to continue construction of the storehouse . On DATE FAC discontinued the proceedings , finding that they had become devoid of purpose given that the construction had been finalised . On DATE ORG quashed that decision as premature and remitted the case to the firstinstance authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG transmitted the case file to FAC . On DATE the inspector summoned PERSON and the applicant to participate in an administrative hearing and inspection of ORG property . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered GPE to stop using the storehouse for meat - production purposes , having noted that she had not obtained the relevant retrospective permission ( decision No . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG upheld that order ( decision No . OA CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authority inspected ORG \u2019s property . It was established that she had continued to use the building for meat - processing purposes in breach of the decision of DATE . As a result , ORG was fined on the basis of a judgment given on CARDINAL DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON appealed against the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to ORG . On DATE that court stayed the appellate proceedings because the applicant \u2019s sister , who was a party to the proceedings , had died . On DATE the proceedings were resumed . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and the subsequent decision given on DATE . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and remitted the case to ORG .
