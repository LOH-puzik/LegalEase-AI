The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has suffered from severe myopia , the degree of which was established at -CARDINAL.CARDINAL in the left eye and -CARDINAL.CARDINAL in the right eye . Before her pregnancy , she was assessed by a ORG medical panel , for social - insurance purposes , as suffering from a disability of medium severity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant became pregnant in DATE . She had previously had CARDINAL children , both born by Caesarean section . As the applicant was worried about the possible impact of the delivery on her health , she decided to consult her doctors . She was examined by CARDINAL ophthalmologists ( Dr GPE , Dr N.S .- B. , PERSON ) . It transpired from the documents submitted by the applicant that PERSON had recommended that the applicant have frequent check - ups and avoid physical exertion . Dr FAC .- B. stated that the applicant should consider sterilisation after the birth . All of them concluded that , due to pathological changes in the applicant \u2019s retina , the pregnancy and delivery constituted a risk to her eyesight . However , they refused to issue a certificate for the pregnancy to be terminated , despite the applicant \u2019s requests , on the ground that the retina might detach itself as a result of pregnancy , but that it was not certain .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant sought further medical advice . On DATE Dr O.R.G. , a general practitioner ( GP ) , issued a certificate stating that her third pregnancy constituted a threat to the applicant \u2019s health as there was a risk of rupture of the uterus , given her CARDINAL previous deliveries by Caesarean section . She further referred to the applicant \u2019s short - sightedness and to significant pathological changes in her retina . These considerations , according to the ORG , also required that the applicant should avoid physical strain which in any case would hardly be possible as at that time the applicant was raising CARDINAL small children on her own . The applicant understood that on the basis of this certificate she would be able to terminate her pregnancy lawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in DATE of the pregnancy , the applicant \u2019s eyesight was examined . It was established that she needed glasses to correct her vision in both eyes by CARDINAL dioptres .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant contacted a ORG hospital , ORG and Obstetrics in GPE , in the area to which she was assigned on the basis of her residence , with a view to obtaining the termination of her pregnancy . On DATE she had an appointment with PERSON , Head of ORG of the clinic .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON examined the applicant visually and for a period of TIME , but did not examine her ophthalmological records . Afterwards he made a note on the back of the certificate issued by Dr O.R.G. that neither her shortsightedness nor her CARDINAL previous deliveries by Caesarean section constituted grounds for therapeutic termination of the pregnancy . He was of the view that , in these circumstances , the applicant should give birth by Caesarean section . During the applicant \u2019s visit PERSON consulted an endocrinologist , PERSON , whispering to her in the presence of the applicant . The endocrinologist co - signed the note written by PERSON , but did not talk to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s examination was carried out in a room with the door open to the corridor , which , in the applicant \u2019s submission , did not provide a comfortable environment for a medical examination . At the end of the appointment , PERSON told the applicant that she could have CARDINAL children if they were delivered by Caesarean section .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the applicant \u2019s pregnancy was not terminated . The applicant gave birth to the child by Caesarean section in DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the delivery , her eyesight deteriorated badly . On DATE , DATE after the delivery , she was taken to the emergency unit of ORG in GPE . While doing a counting - fingers test , she was only able to see from a distance of QUANTITY with her left eye and QUANTITY with her right eye , whereas before the pregnancy she had been able to see objects from a distance of QUANTITY . A reabsorbing vascular occlusion was found in her right eye and further degeneration of the retinal spot was established in the left eye .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical certificate issued on DATE by an ophthalmologist , the deterioration of the applicant \u2019s eyesight had been caused by recent haemorrhages in the retina . As a result , the applicant is currently facing a risk of going blind . PERSON , the ophthalmologist who examined the applicant , suggested that she should be learning braille . She also informed the applicant that , as the changes to her retina were at a very advanced stage , there were no prospects of having them corrected by surgical intervention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the disability panel declared the applicant to be significantly disabled , while previously she had been recognised as suffering from a disability of medium severity . It further held that she needed constant care and assistance in her everyday life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against PERSON , alleging that he had prevented her from having her pregnancy terminated as recommended by the ORG on a medical ground which constituted one of the exceptions to a general ban on abortion . She complained that , following the pregnancy and delivery , she had sustained severe bodily harm by way of almost complete loss of her eyesight . She relied on LAW , which lays down the penalty for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm , and also submitted that , under the applicable provisions of social - insurance law , she was not entitled to a disability pension as she had not worked the requisite number of DATE before the disability developed because she had been raising her children .", "CARDINAL . The investigation of the applicant \u2019s complaint was carried out by the GPE - \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie district prosecutor . The prosecutor heard evidence from the ophthalmologists who had examined the applicant during her pregnancy . They stated that a safe delivery by Caesarean section had been possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor further requested the preparation of an expert report by a panel of CARDINAL medical experts ( ophthalmologist , gynaecologist and specialist in forensic medicine ) from ORG . According to the report , the applicant \u2019s pregnancies and deliveries had not affected the deterioration of her eyesight . Given the serious nature of the applicant \u2019s sight impairment , the risk of retinal detachment had always been present and continued to exist , and the pregnancy and delivery had not contributed to increasing that risk . Furthermore , the experts found that in the applicant \u2019s case there had been no factors militating against the applicant \u2019s carrying her baby to term and delivering it .", "CARDINAL . During the investigations neither Dr PERSON nor PERSON , who had cosigned the certificate of DATE , were interviewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor discontinued the investigations , considering that PERSON had no case to answer . Having regard to the expert report , the prosecutor found that there was no causal link between his actions and the deterioration of the applicant \u2019s vision . He observed that this deterioration \u201c had not been caused by the gynaecologist \u2019s actions , or by any other human action \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against that decision to the GPE regional prosecutor . She challenged the report drawn up by the experts from ORG . In particular , she submitted that she had in fact been examined by CARDINAL of the experts , namely the ophthalmologist , whereas the report was signed by all of them . During that examination use had not been made of all the specialised ophthalmological equipment that would normally be used to test the applicant \u2019s eyesight . Moreover , the examination had lasted TIME . The other CARDINAL experts who had signed the report , including a gynaecologist , had not examined her at all .", "CARDINAL . She further emphasised inconsistencies in the report . She also submitted that , before the second and third deliveries , the doctors had recommended that she be sterilised during the Caesarean section to avoid any further pregnancies . She argued that , although the deterioration of her eyesight was related to her condition , she felt that the process of deterioration had accelerated during the third pregnancy . She submitted that there had been a causal link between the refusal to terminate her pregnancy and the deterioration of her vision . The applicant also complained that the prosecuting authorities had failed to give any consideration to the certificate issued by her ORG .", "CARDINAL . She further pointed out that she had been unable to familiarise herself with the case file because the summaries of ORG testimonies and other documents were written in a highly illegible manner . The prosecutor , when asked for assistance in reading the file , had repeatedly refused to assist , even though he had been aware that the applicant was suffering from very severe myopia . The applicant had been unable to read the documents in the case file , which had affected her ability to exercise her procedural rights in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE regional prosecutor , in a CARDINAL - paragraph decision , upheld the decision of the district prosecutor , finding that the latter \u2019s conclusions had been based on the expert report . The regional prosecutor countered the applicant \u2019s argument that she had not been examined by all CARDINAL experts , stating that the other CARDINAL experts had relied on an examination of her medical records . He did not address the procedural issue raised by the applicant in her appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the decision not to prosecute was transmitted to FAC for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE , not subject to a further appeal and numbering CARDINAL lines , ORG upheld the decision to discontinue the case . Having regard to the medical expert report , the court considered that the refusal to terminate the pregnancy had not had a bearing on the deterioration of the applicant \u2019s vision . Furthermore , the court found that the haemorrhage in the applicant \u2019s eyes had in any event been likely to occur , given the degree and nature of the applicant \u2019s condition . The court did not address the procedural complaint which the applicant had made in her appeal against the decision of the district prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also attempted to bring disciplinary proceedings against PERSON and PERSON However , those proceedings were finally discontinued on DATE , the competent authorities of ORG finding that there had been no professional negligence .", "CARDINAL . NORP Currently , the applicant can see objects only from a distance of QUANTITY and is afraid of going blind . On DATE the social - welfare centre issued a certificate to the effect that the applicant was unable to take care of her children as she could not see from a distance of QUANTITY . On DATE a medical panel gave a decision certifying that she suffered from a significant disability . She is at present unemployed and in receipt of a DATE disability pension of MONEY .

It follows from the ORG \u2019s DATE Reports of the execution of the [ DATE ] PERSON [ which the ORG is obliged to submit to the ORG ] and from reports of non - governmental organisations that the PERSON \u2019s provisions are not fully implemented and that some women , in spite of meeting the criteria for an abortion , are not subject to it . There are refusals to conduct an abortion by physicians employed in public health - care system units who invoke the so - called conscience clause , while at the same time women who are eligible for a legal abortion are not informed about where they should go .

The ORG reiterates its deep concern about restrictive abortion laws in GPE , which may incite women to seek unsafe , illegal abortions , with attendant risks to their life and health . It is also concerned at the unavailability of abortion in practice even when the law permits it , for example in cases of pregnancy resulting from rape , and by the lack of information on the use of the conscientious objection clause by medical practitioners who refuse to carry out legal abortions .

A [ woman ] should not be seeking abortion because of the insufficiency of support services , for example for young mothers , because of lack of information about support which would be available , or because of the fear that this might lead to the loss of employment : this requires , at the very least , a close monitoring of the pattern of abortions performed in the jurisdictions where abortion is legal , in order to identify the needs of the persons resorting to abortion and the circumstances which ought to be created in order to better respond to these needs . ... Referring to the Concluding Observations adopted on DATE by ORG upon the examination of the report submitted by GPE under LAW ( CCPR / CO/CARDINAL/POL / Rev . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL) , the ORG notes that a prohibition on non - therapeutic abortion or the practical unavailability of abortion may in fact have the effect of raising the number of clandestine abortions which are practised , as the women concerned may be tempted to resort to clandestine abortion in the absence of adequate counselling services who may inform them about the different alternatives opened to them . ...", "Where a ORG does choose to prohibit abortion , it should at least closely monitor the impact of this prohibition on the practice of abortion , and provide this information in order to feed into an informed public debate .
