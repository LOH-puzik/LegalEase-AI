The facts of the case , as set out by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The present dispute is between GPE , which succeeded to the rights of the heirs of the original NORP owners of the disputed property ( the initial injured party \u2013 \u201c Erstgesch\u00e4digte \u201d ) under ORG of CARDINAL DATE , and the applicants , who are the heirs of a shopkeeper who had acquired the disputed property in DATE ( the initial sale having taken place in DATE ) . The property was subsequently expropriated at the time of the former GPE ( GPE ) . The applicants are thus the heirs of the subsequent injured party \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The disputed plots of land , having respective surface areas of CARDINAL sq.m , CARDINAL sq.m and ORG , are located at ORG , near GPE , on the territory of the former GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a notarially - registered contract of DATE , PERSON and PERSON , who were NORP and partners in the limited partnership \u201c ORG und A. \u201d , the owner of the disputed plots of land , sold them for CARDINAL reichsmarks ( RM ) to the GPE company A. PERSON . Having been the victims of persecution under the ORG regime , PERSON died in DATE and PERSON in DATE . PERSON , daughter of PERSON , emigrated to GPE in DATE and became a GPE citizen in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a notarially - registered contract of DATE , the disputed plots of land were then sold for RM CARDINAL to PERSON , a shopkeeper , who was registered as the owner at the land registry , and the applicants are his heirs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the former GPE , the land was expropriated and became \u201c people \u2019s property \u201d ( ORG ) under the control of a ORG - owned film company .", "CARDINAL . PERSON subsequently brought proceedings in the GPE for the loss of the disputed property , in accordance with the GPE law of DATE on claims against the GPE , which entitled GPE citizens whose property in the former GPE had been expropriated before that date or which had been sold under duress in ORG period to file claims for compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acknowledged that PERSON was entitled to MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation , plus interest at PERCENT from DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP After NORP reunification the property was transferred to the company \u201c dok GPE \u201d , whose sole shareholder was the ORG for special reunification - related questions ( GPE vereinigungsbedingte PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , that ORG observed that the disputed property had been sold for CARDINAL deutschmarks ( ORG ) for investment purposes to the company PERSON , in accordance with LAW ( GPE ) of DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a claim for the restitution of the property with ORG ( PERSON die GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 \u201c Office of the Land \u201d ) , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PERSON on the resolution of outstanding property issues \u2013 \u201c LAW \u201d ( Gesetz zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 Verm\u00f6gensgesetz ) of DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE GPE ( FRG ) and GPE signed ORG on the settlement of certain property claims \u2013 \u201c the German - US Agreement \u201d ( Abkommen zwischen den ORG der PERSON \u00fcber die GPE bestimmter Verm\u00f6gensanspr\u00fcche ) , which provided for a global settlement of compensation claims by GPE citizens resulting from the GPE law of DATE on claims against the GPE . By a law of DATE the German - US Agreement became an integral part of domestic law ; it entered into force on DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE , the ORG paid a total sum of MONEY in compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW ( Verm\u00f6gensrechtsbereinigungsgesetz ) retrospectively amended section CARDINAL ) of LAW , providing that the time - limit for the filing of restitution claims , initially set at DATE , did not apply to the rights of the ORG under ORG ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the ORG indicated to ORG that in accordance with LAW , second sentence , of the GermanUS Agreement , it had taken over PERSON title to the disputed property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 restitution claim and indicated that the proceeds from the sale of the disputed property in DATE was indeed to be paid to the ORG . It first noted that the initial sale of the disputed plots of land in DATE had been obtained under duress , within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Consequently , the rights pertaining to the property fell within the scope of ORG . In accordance with sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and PERSON ) of LAW , read together with LAW , second sentence , of ORG , the ORG had become the legal successor to PERSON She had opted for the payment of compensation and had thus renounced her claims against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought proceedings before ORG , on the ground that they had a lawful entitlement to restitution , having regard to the fact that PERSON had not lodged any application to that effect before the time - limit of DATE , as provided for by section CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of LAW , notwithstanding the subsequent amendment of that provision by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision on all points . In the court \u2019s view , even if the ORG \u2019s right to restitution had lapsed , because no application had been lodged to that effect before the time - limit of DATE fixed by section CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of LAW , its right had subsequently been revived following the amendment of that section in DATE . Moreover , the applicants had not acquired an irrevocable ( unab\u00e4nderlich ) right under LAW ( right to property ) of LAW ) , because at the time of the FRG \u2019s claim in DATE , ORG had not yet given its decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the ORG request for judicial review . It first noted that , under the relevant provisions of ORG , the property rights of PERSON had been transferred to the ORG . Given that PERSON had been compensated in DATE , the ORG ( NORP Claims Conference ) , which had also filed a restitution claim , could not claim property rights . ORG then confirmed that the ORG had not filed a valid restitution claim before the time - limit of DATE as provided for by section CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of LAW . The law on LAW DATE had not provided for any specific provisions in that connection and the letter of DATE from ORG for ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr die GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to the authorities of the ORG could not be regarded as a valid claim because it was not sufficiently specific . Referring to its settled case - law , ORG added that the fixing of this time - limit corresponded to a provision of substantive law , which meant that the rights of the ORG had lapsed with the expiry of the statutory time - limit . However , by amending section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW in DATE , the legislature had \u201c remedied \u201d the failure to file a claim within that time - limit . It was only from DATE that the property rights of PERSON could be considered to have been effectively transferred to the ORG , and not at the time of the complete payment of compensation as provided for in LAW of ORG ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The aim of that legislative amendment had been to ensure the survival of the former property rights and to rectify that omission . In addition , again with reference to its settled case - law , ORG took the view that the applicants\u2019 rights to restitution under LAW did not benefit from the protection of LAW , because those rights did not correspond to existing property rights but stemmed from the ORG \u2019s wish to provide redress for past injustice . Lastly , in accordance with the settled case - law of ORG , it was in this case a question of \u201c quasi - retrospective \u201d effect ( unechte PERSON ) ; having regard to the confused and uncertain legal situation existing at the time , the applicants had not acquired any \u201c confidence warranting protection \u201d ( schutzw\u00fcrdiges Vertrauen ) or any legal certainty that their position as \u201c subsequent \u201d injured party afforded them an entitlement to the restitution of the disputed property . Moreover , the ORG had also filed a restitution claim within the statutory time - limit , and its rights would have prevailed over those of the applicants if it had been successful .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting in a committee of CARDINAL members , refused to allow a constitutional complaint by the applicants . It observed in particular that section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) , fourth sentence , of LAW was compatible with LAW , even if it were presumed in the ORG favour that their entitlement to restitution under LAW , or to the payment of the proceeds of the sale under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of LAW , enjoyed the protection of LAW . In ORG view , section CARDINALa ( CARDINAL ) , fourth sentence , of LAW had to be understood as a provision defining the content and limits ( Inhalts- PERSON ) of the right to property within the meaning of LAW , second sentence , of LAW , and struck a fair balance between the interests at stake . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , taken together with LAW ) , first sentence , of the PERSON of DATE on compensation in accordance with LAW \u2013 \u201c LAW \u201d ( PERSON \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung nach dem ORG zur GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz \u2013 see domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL in fine , below ) , the applicants , being regarded as the \u201c subsequent \u201d injured party , were , from the outset , simply entitled to compensation . Under LAW , second sentence , of ORG , the ORG had succeeded to the rights of the \u201c initial \u201d injured parties , who , having regard to the compensation that they had already received , could no longer claim any rights based on LAW . In filing a claim concerning property rights based on ORG , the ORG had thus sought to secure a property right equivalent to that of an \u201c initial \u201d injured party that had already materially been \u201c claimed \u201d and compensated for . The legislature had thus wished to clarify the situation for that kind of right .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that even if a different position were adopted , namely , as ORG had found , that the rights under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW had lapsed on DATE and had then been revived following the amendment of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the new version of that section had struck a fair balance between the interests at stake . The property rights under the German - US Agreement had originally been provided for by the GPE law of DATE and had already been compensated for in DATE as regards the disputed property . At the time of the ratification of ORG it had been presumed that the total amount to be paid in compensation could reach ORG CARDINAL . The ORG could not have been expected ultimately to renounce its property rights for which it had had to pay compensation in such a high amount \u2013 even though the transfer had not become effective until the determination of the final transfer payment ( nach ORG endg\u00fcltigen PERSON ) . For this reason , ORG had in particular sent the ORG authorities the lists of the rights covered by the LAW , in a letter of DATE from ORG . In addition , the law of DATE on the acceleration of registration procedures ( \u201c Register - Beschleunigungs - Gesetz \u201d ) extended the possibility for the competent authorities to enter reservations in the land register ( stipulating that the property could be sold only with the ORG \u2019s approval ) in respect of the rights arising from ORG .", "Under those circumstances , there could not have been any \u201c confidence warranting protection \u201d as to the maintaining of the statutory situation as it had first existed according to the initial version of section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a request for compensation for the loss of the disputed property with ORG , in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 request on the ground that they had not filed it within DATE after the final rejection of the restitution claim , as provided for by section CARDINALa(CARDINALc ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then appealed to ORG , which stayed the proceedings pending the judgment of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c Property and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed . Their content and limits shall be defined by statute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW of DATE , which was also to be part of LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) , came into force . Under LAW would remain in force in GPE after the reunification of the two GPE on DATE . The LAW \u2019s purpose was , in particular , to settle any conflicts relating to property on the territory of the GPE in a manner that was socially acceptable , in order to ensure long - term legal security in GPE .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that it is applicable to rights in respect of property that was expropriated at the time of the GPE and section CARDINAL ) provides that it also applicable to persons against whom proceedings were brought in GPE DATE and DATE on racist , political , religious or ideological grounds ( weltanschauliche GPE ) and who had consequently lost their property \u201c by forced sale , expropriation or other means \u201d . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW complement section CARDINAL .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that any property that became \u201c people \u2019s property \u201d will be returned on request unless excluded by the law . LAW ) provides that if a number of parties make a request for restitution concerning the same property , it is the party that was \u201c first \u201d injured which is thus entitled . That means that , as in the present case , when property was sold under duress during ORG period , then subsequently expropriated in the former GPE , the heirs of the original NORP owners have a priority right to restitution . In such a case where restitution of the property is excluded ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , the heirs of the purchasers of the property during the National - Socialist period are entitled to the payment of compensation provided for by the law of CARDINAL DATE on compensation according to LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , of LAW provides that if restitution of property is impossible because the property has been sold , the person entitled may request payment of a sum equivalent to the value of his property rights .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ) , first sentence , of LAW stipulates that restitution claims had to be filed no later than DATE . LAW of DATE amended the section in question by introducing a fourth sentence according to which that timelimit does not apply to rights held by the ORG LAW DATE between the ORG and GPE Governments on the settlement of certain property claims .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG provides that GPE citizens have to choose between receiving compensation or bringing proceedings before the NORP courts to obtain reparation in accordance with the GPE law of DATE on claims against the GPE . If they opt for the first solution , they forfeit any right of action against the ORG , under LAW , second sentence , of the LAW . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , their property rights are then transferred to the ORG at the time of the complete payment of compensation . That statutory succession also applies to rights arising from any harmful measures taken under the ORG regime .", "By a law of DATE the German - US Agreement became part of domestic law . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG indicated that section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) , fourth sentence , of LAW ( which , in its new version , provides that the time - limit initially set for restitution claims does not apply to rights stemming from ORG ) did not apply if the legislative amendment had taken place after the issuance of a restitution notice by the competent authority and the transfer of the property to an entitled party other than ORG . In that judgment it further held that , having regard to its wording , meaning and aim , section PERSON ) , first sentence , of LAW applied at the outset to all property claims . In order to ensure legal certainty , the time - limit initially fixed also had to apply to the \u201c derived \u201d claims ( abgeleitete Anspr\u00fcche ) arising from ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
