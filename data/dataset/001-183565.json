It was published by a joint - stock company , PERSON ( until DATE ) and , subsequently , by the limited liability company GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant prepared a report on the advertising and marketing expenses incurred by GPE in DATE and DATE , which he then presented to the ORG \u2019s supervisory board . His report was based on information which he had requested from the heads of the marketing and economics departments . According to the applicant \u2019s report , the ORG had transferred substantial sums for advertising and marketing services to , inter alia , PERSON , for which no supporting documents could be found . This raised suspicions that the ORG \u2019s funds had been misappropriated . The parties did not provide the ORG with a copy of the applicant \u2019s report , nor any further details of that report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG \u2019s supervisory board held an extraordinary meeting and ordered an internal audit to verify the applicant \u2019s findings .

This process had continued while the external audit was being carried out and the ORG had incurred more expenses in this regard . All contracts with PERSON had been approved and signed by the ORG \u2019s highest management .

There was no evidence that the staff members had been forced to work with the particular service provider or to prepare documents for services which the ORG had not received .", "CARDINAL .

He had not directly mentioned ORG by name , surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists . His allegations regarding the misappropriation of GPE \u2019s funds could only have infringed the interests of the ORG as a legal entity ; it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executives , who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass media of the truth . Furthermore , the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the ORG \u2019s internal audit .
