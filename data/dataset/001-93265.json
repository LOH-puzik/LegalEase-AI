NORP The applicant association is dedicated to animal protection , campaigning in particular against animal experiments and battery farming .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to various advertisements produced by the meat industry , the applicant association made a television commercial lasting TIME , consisting of CARDINAL scenes .", "The first scene showed a sow building a shelter for her piglets in the forest . With soft music playing in the background , the voiceover referred , among other things , to the GPE sense of family . The second scene showed a noisy hall with pigs in small pens , gnawing nervously at the iron bars . The voiceover compared the conditions in which pigs were reared to concentration camps , and added that the animals were pumped full of medicines . The advertisement concluded with the exhortation : \u201c Eat less meat , for the sake of your health , the animals and the environment ! \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant association lodged an application with ORG under former LAW .", "CARDINAL . The application was transmitted to ORG on DATE , when Protocol No .

GPE , no .

On the contrary , it had simply intended to participate in an ongoing general debate on the protection and rearing of animals .

ORG , Energy and Communication and ORG submitted in their respective observations of DATE and DATE , which were duly transmitted to the applicant association , that the application to reopen the proceedings should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the application to reopen the proceedings . It held that the applicant association had not provided a sufficiently detailed explanation of the nature of \u201c the amendment of the judgment and the redress being sought \u201d , a formal requirement imposed by CARDINAL of the former LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It observed , in particular , that the applicant association had been unable to show that redress was possible only through the reopening of the proceedings . It further noted that the association had not sufficiently shown that it still had an interest in broadcasting the original commercial , which now appeared out of date almost eight years after it was initially intended to have been broadcast . Lastly , ORG considered that the fresh refusal by ORG , the competent authority in such matters , to sign a new agreement to broadcast the commercial should have formed the subject of separate proceedings . The relevant passages of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL Section CARDINAL of the Federal Judicature Act provides that an application for review must indicate , with supporting evidence , the ground relied on for the reopening of proceedings and whether it has been raised in due time . It is not enough simply to claim that the ground exists ; it is also necessary to explain why , and to what extent , the operative provisions must be amended as a result ( PERSON , \u2018 Revision und Erl\u00e4uterung\u2019 , note CARDINAL , in LAW , PERSON , CARDINALnd ed . , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL The application to reopen the proceedings in the instant case does not meet these formal requirements . The applicant association has sought the review of ORG judgment without explaining the extent to which this is necessary following ORG judgment of DATE . PERSON evidently assumes that ORG decision against GPE in itself makes the reopening of the proceedings necessary , but that is not the case . The mere fact that the ORG , ruling on an individual application , has found a violation of the ORG does not mean that the ORG judgment in issue must automatically be reviewed in accordance with domestic law ( see judgment ORG DATE in the LOC case , point CARDINAL / cc ; PERSON , \u2018 EMRK - Verletzung und bundesrechtliche Revision nach Art . PERSON , in recht DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; BBl DATE II CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Being a subsidiary remedy , reopening is justified only if it appears to remain necessary notwithstanding the compensation awarded by ORG and constitutes the only means of obtaining redress ( see PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . The application to reopen the proceedings must give at least a broad indication of how redress may be obtained only by this means ( see judgment ORG in the LOC case , point CARDINAL / cc ) .", "CARDINAL ...", "ORG evidently once again refused to conclude an advertising agreement with ORG , which appealed against the refusal to ORG ; the proceedings are still pending . By taking this action , PERSON itself proves that it is not continuing to suffer any practical adverse effects that can only be redressed by reopening the proceedings . It does not claim that it still has an interest in having the original commercial broadcast ; it is , moreover , unlikely that this is the case , since ORG \u2019s primary objective is no longer ( solely ) to encourage a decline in meat consumption and to denounce the conditions in which animals are reared ( which are also likely to have changed in DATE since the commercial was intended to have been broadcast ) , but to publicise ORG finding of a violation of its freedom of expression . It is thus no longer the same commercial that is under discussion DATE . The consequences of the Convention violation committed at the time were redressed as a result of the judgment against GPE and the award of just satisfaction under LAW ; the new agreement which ORG now wishes to conclude must form the subject of separate proceedings .", "...", "CARDINAL NORP In its judgment of DATE , ORG held that PERSON \u2019s commercial was subject to the public - law prohibition on political advertising set forth in section PERSON ) of ORG and could provide ORG , or rather ORG , with a valid reason for not concluding the advertising agreement . ORG did not share this view and held that there was no justification in a NORP society for refusing to broadcast a commercial on the ground that it constituted political advertising , which was banned on television . ORG did not express an opinion on whether and to what extent GPE , by not ensuring that the commercial could be broadcast , had breached any positive obligations resulting from the extension of the LAW safeguards to relations between private entities ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment ) . The subject of ORG judgment was the finding by the authorities that ORG \u2019s commercial could be considered \u2018 political\u2019 within the meaning of ORG and that the refusal to broadcast it could be justified on this public - law ground alone . The judgment did not deal with the question whether ORG had boycotted PERSON , whether the company dominated the advertising market and whether , on that account , it would have been under an obligation to conclude an advertising agreement . These ( civil law ) aspects of an obligation to contract must be addressed in the appropriate form of civil proceedings ( concerning cartel law , competition law or the general law relating to personality rights ) and not under the law governing trading licences . This argument , which GPE put forward , was not contested by ORG .", "CARDINAL In this connection , by enacting the relevant ( civil ) legislation and establishing judicial remedies to implement it , GPE has complied with its positive obligation under LAW to ensure the appropriate realisation among private entities of the rights guaranteed by the LAW . The rules of competition and cartel law or the possibility of asserting a civil - law obligation to contract are intended to encourage a means of implementing fundamental rights that is fair and strikes a balance between the various interests at stake in the sphere of economic relations between private entities . ORG is free to use this legal remedy in seeking to have its commercial broadcast , provided that , contrary to what has been said above , it still has a real interest in the broadcast ; in that eventuality , due regard will have to be had in the proceedings to its constitutional rights and the principles enshrined in LAW ( see LAW ) . The judgment of ORG does not conflict with this view ; however , all that can be inferred from the judgment is that the classification of the commercial as \u2018 political advertising\u2019 did not justify refusing to broadcast it , or that the broadcasting of the commercial by ORG , on the basis of LAW , should not have had any consequences for the broadcaster under the law relating to trading licences . ORG rightly points out that the judgment can not be construed as requiring it to broadcast the commercial in issue in breach of the existing legal rules ( such as the provisions of LAW ) , since ORG did not address the corresponding questions , limited itself to examining the issue of \u2018 political\u2019 advertising and did not state any position on ORG \u2018 NORP freedom of expression . Since the ORG \u2019s judgment simply finds that the prohibition of political advertising on television must not stand in the way of broadcasting the commercial , ORG must seek to have it broadcast through recourse to the civil courts and not through the reopening procedure , should ORG , or rather ORG , still refuse to broadcast it ( see ORG , PERSON ideeller PERSON i m GPE , dissertation , GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , \u2018 PERSON , in ORG Zimmerli ( eds . ) , PERSON , PERSON , note CARDINAL ; PERSON , \u2018 ORG f\u00fcr Werbung und ORG , in ORG , pp .

The applicant association had requested ORG to issue a declaratory order to the effect that , under LAW , PERSON was entitled to have its commercial broadcast ( \u2018 right to broadcast ORG ) . ORG acknowledged from a procedural point of view that a right to have such an order issued existed ( LAW in conjunction with LAW ) but ruled in the instant case \u2013 wrongly in ORG view \u2013 on the basis of section PERSON ) of ORG that there was no right of access to television for political advertising . If ORG had decided in the same way as ORG , it would have had to limit itself to finding that ORG had not been entitled to refuse to broadcast the commercial on the ground that it was political in nature , or rather that reliance on this ground for the refusal was contrary to LAW . On the other hand , given the lack of legal basis , ORG could not have ordered ORG to broadcast the commercial in the context of proceedings governed by broadcasting legislation ( see PERSON , op . cit . , note CARDINAL ) . PERSON is now seeking such an order solely by way of the reopening procedure , but it can not obtain it in relation to the decision to be reviewed .

Accordingly , it is inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . NORP The basis in LAW for reopening the proceedings is subject to several conditions . Thus , an individual application must have been upheld by ORG in a final judgment finding a violation of a right guaranteed by LAW ( subsection ( a ) ) ; compensation can not remedy the effects of the violation ( subsection ( b ) ) ; and the review must be necessary to remedy the effects of the violation ( subsection ( c ) ) .

It remains to be ascertained whether a review of ORG judgment is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation of LAW ( section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW ) . The mere fact that there has been a breach of the LAW does not mean that the decision referred to ORG has to be reviewed . This follows from the very nature of the reopening procedure , which is an extraordinary remedy . Accordingly , if there is another ordinary remedy that could afford redress , that remedy should be used first . The answer to this question depends on the nature of the Convention violation that has been found . Where only material interests remain at stake , the proceedings can not in principle be reopened . However , where the unlawful situation persists despite ORG finding of a violation of the LAW , a review is possible . The proceedings are then reopened within the limits of the relevant ground ( see , with reference to LAW , judgment CARDINAL of DATE , point CARDINAL / bb , published in : PERSON DATE no .

ORG also held that the adopter and the adopted person \u2019s mother could not be required to marry in order to restore the adopted person \u2019s relationship with her mother . In the ORG \u2019s view , it is not for the national authorities to take the place of those concerned in reaching a decision as to the form of communal life they wish to adopt . The concept of family under LAW is , moreover , not confined to marriage - based relationships .
