NORP The applicant , ORG of GPE ( ORG , ORG ) , is a NORP political party . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was founded on DATE . It regularly participates in elections to ORG , ORG ( GPE ) , parliaments of the LOC and municipal elections . At the time the present application was lodged , the applicant was represented in the parliaments of ORG and GPE , as well as numerous city councils and county councils .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG , ORG ( NORP ) and ORG ( Bundesregierung ) lodged an application for the ban of the applicant ( Verbotsantrag ) with ORG ( ORG . CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , QUANTITY BvB CARDINAL/CARDINAL , QUANTITY BvB CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) pursuant to LAW ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL ) . The plaintiffs alleged that the applicant was unconstitutional and sought to damage the free democratic basic order ( freiheitlich - demokratische LOC ) . They claimed that the applicant propagated views that were ORG , anti - NORP , racist and anti - democratic and sought to abolish what it called the \u201c system \u201d imposed by the ORG powers at DATE . They further stated that the applicant worked towards restoring the \u201c community of the people \u201d ( ORG ) and towards replacing the multi - party parliamentary democracy by a \u201c rule of the people \u201d ( ORG ) of the \u201c national elites \u201d ( nationale ORG ) . Finally , they alleged that the members and supporters of the applicant did not hesitate to use violence and threatened their opponents with \u201c reckoning \u201d ( GPE ) upon taking power .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings because the statements cited in support of the unconstitutionality of the party could not be clearly distinguished from those of undercover agents of the intelligence services . It found that the principle of separation between party and ORG ( PERSON ) , which was an essential requirement for proceedings aimed at banning the applicant , was not respected due to the influence of those agents , who were even present in the party \u2019s leadership , on the applicant \u2019s decision - making process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application against ORG , ORG and ORG with ORG ( no . DATE ) , seeking a declaration that it was not unconstitutional within the meaning of LAW of LAW . In the alternative ( hilfsweise ) , it requested to find that the defendants violated its rights under LAW first sentence of LAW by constantly stating that the applicant was unconstitutional , thereby causing the effects of de facto ban , without initiating party ban proceedings . In the further alternative ( h\u00f6chst hilfsweise ) it requested to find that its rights were violated because there was no remedy allowing political parties to ascertain their constitutionality before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of its application , the applicant cited leading politicians \u2013Prime Ministers and Ministers of the Interior of different NORP and members of ORG who had stated that the ORG was unconstitutional . The applicant alleged that its members who were working in the public sector had been subject to disciplinary measures or even been excluded from public service because of their affiliation with the party . It submitted that its candidates were not allowed to stand at municipal elections in ORG and in the Land of Thuringia . The applicant submitted that it had made CARDINAL unsuccessful requests to open accounts at public and private banks and that it had to pursue legal action against public banks in CARDINAL cases . It further submitted that it was required to engage in proceedings before the administrative courts almost every time it intended to rent communal space for its events , because the towns had refused to let it use their premises due to a fear of acts by \u201c the extreme left \u201d . The applicant added that it did no longer find companies willing to provide liability insurance for its events , which was a prerequisite for renting communal space . It complained that its authorised demonstrations were regularly disturbed by opponents and that the police did not sufficiently protect these demonstrations . It pointed out that its members were regularly victims of criminal offences committed by \u201c the extreme left \u201d . The applicant moreover complained that public funds allocated to projects against \u201c the extreme right \u201d referred to it as a party of the extreme right and concluded that these funds were used to combat it . Finally , it claimed that the media did not sufficiently give it the floor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the remedies available before domestic courts were not sufficient to protect its interests , given the extent of discrimination and restrictive measures it was confronted with on the one hand and its limited resources on the other hand . It considered that the constant \u201c stigmatisation \u201d and perpetual debate about its potential ban amounted to a \u201c de facto ban \u201d . It submitted that the defendants were , by stigmatising the applicant and by calling on the public to \u201c combat against the far right \u201d ( PERSON gegen PERSON ) , also at the origin of and hence responsible for the discriminatory acts and criminal offences which private actors committed against the applicant and its members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the application for a declaration that the applicant was not unconstitutional was inadmissible . It stated that LAW of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz , see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL ) provided that only ORG , ORG and ORG could apply for decision on whether a political party was unconstitutional . Domestic law did not provide that a political party could have recourse to ORG to have its constitutionality ascertained . It observed that this did not amount to a gap in legal protection , since the applicant and its members could pursue legal action before administrative , civil and criminal courts whenever its or their rights were infringed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s argument that it did not have the resources to pursue legal action in each and every case , ORG stated that this posed a practical challenge that could be overcome with reasonable efforts . It emphasised that a political party which participated in forming public opinion had to accept being criticised as \u201c hostile to the constitution \u201d ( verfassungsfeindlich ) within the limits of freedom of expression . Where public authorities engaged in political debate , they had to respect the limits set by LAW , which were subject to judicial review . ORG considered that a discussion whether or not to initiate party ban proceedings was lawful as long as it contributed to the decision - making process and was not aimed at discriminating against the party concerned . It noted that there were remedies which allowed the applicant to challenge the allegation that it was unconstitutional , such as remedies against the surveillance by intelligence services . It observed that the same held true for the applicant \u2019s members with regard to their employment in public service and added that a lack of success in the respective court proceedings did not mean that there was a gap in legal protection .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that the application , lodged in the alternative , to find that the defendants violated the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW first sentence of LAW by constantly stating that the applicant was unconstitutional , thereby causing the effects of de facto ban , without initiating party ban proceedings , was also inadmissible . It found that , even though this application could in principle be the subject of a \u201c dispute between constitutional organs \u201d ( PERSON , see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) , it was not sufficiently substantiated . It noted that the statements and measures cited by the applicant were not made on behalf of ORG , ORG or ORG , but rather by some of their members only . Therefore , they could not be attributed to these organs . Nor did the applicant substantiate that they infringed , or were about to infringe , its status as a political party .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG observed that the application , lodged in the further alternative , to find that the applicant \u2019s rights were violated because there was no remedy allowing political parties to ascertain their constitutionality before ORG was manifestly ill - founded . It argued that there was no gap in legal protection for the reasons set out in relation to the main application ( see paragraphs CARDINAL ) , which precluded a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL .
