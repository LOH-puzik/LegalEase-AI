ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . An ancestor of the applicants owned agricultural land in the area of LOC , situated close to the seashore . In DATE the land was included in the territory on which a new sea resort called PERSON was constructed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The resort was initially managed by a ORG - owned enterprise , which was , in DATE , transformed into a ORG - owned company . This entailed , under the relevant domestic legislation , its becoming an owner of the assets it had until then used and managed . In DATE it was registered as a joint - stock company . DATE the majority of its shares were privatised . After the privatisation the company was named GPE AD .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , after LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) entered into force in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE the applicants requested the restitution of their ancestor \u2019s land .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE the competent body , the LOC agricultural land commission , adopted a decision in favour of their request for the restoration of their property rights to a plot of QUANTITY in the area of GPE . The decision did not contain reasoning mentioning possible property claims of the company managing the resort , nor whether the plot was subject to restitution in accordance with the criteria set in the law in force at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants obtained a notary deed for the plot of land . On DATE the land commission issued an act for the formal transfer to them of possession of the plot . However , the applicants never obtained actual possession and did not start using the land , which remained within the fenced territory of the resort . The applicants did not bring proceedings to challenge this situation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Duni AD brought rei vindicatio actions against all persons who had had their property rights to land in the territory of the resort restored after DATE . In the applicants\u2019 case , the company argued that the land commission \u2019s decision of DATE had been null and void because the commission had not been competent to restore rights to land which had ceased to be agricultural before the adoption of the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings ended by final judgment of ORG . The domestic courts found that the land at issue had been included in the resort \u2019s territory since DATE , had been used and managed by the ORG - owned enterprise existing before DATE and had become its property after its transformation into a ORG - owned company . Under the relevant legislation this land had not been subject to restitution . The land commission , in not taking the above circumstances into account , had given a decision which was null and void . Lastly , although they acknowledged that the land had remained within the fenced territory of the resort , the courts ordered the applicants to surrender possession .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , in its judgment the first - instance ORG noted that :", "\u201c There is no proof and it has not been alleged that at the time of restitution [ the land commission ] took into account the fact that the plot has been subject to urban planning . \u201d", "It found in addition that :", "\u201c By section CARDINALb of the [ ORG ] , in a case such as the present the owners have to be offered compensation , because the land is not subject to restitution , as is accepted in the constant judicial practice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment ORG noted the following :", "\u201c The present case concerns the construction of a resort , which is a complex of buildings , installations , promenades , alleys , car parks , roads and other communicating areas . Its territory is fenced and the totality of the land is being used for the resort \u2019s needs . The plot at issue is situated at the centre of the resort , as seen from the plan presented by the [ court - appointed expert ] . Its restitution to the previous owners and its physical separation from the resort would infringe upon [ the latter \u2019s ] entirety and unity . In adopting the provision of section CARDINALb of the [ ORG ] the legislator aimed at preserving and guaranteeing what already existed as a complex of buildings and installations , and that is why it has been provided that such land would not be subject to restitution , but that the owners would be compensated through other means . What is decisive is the plot \u2019s situation at the time of the law \u2019s adoption in DATE . ... The plot \u2019s separation through restitution does not correspond to this aim of the law and would have gone contrary to its spirit . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
