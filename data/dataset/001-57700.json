Mr PERSON , a NORP citizen , is a businessman residing at FAC in the LOC - West of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the bankruptcy of the applicant \u2019s removal firm in DATE , a rifle was found among the goods stored on its business LOC . Following a police investigation during which it was recorded that the rifle lacked a breech - block , the applicant was charged , on DATE , with illegal possession of a weapon ( olaga vapeninnehav ) contrary to LAW DATE ( vapenlagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; \" the DATE LAW ) . LAW , sub - section CARDINAL , of the DATE Act expressly included within the definition of weapons unusable items which , if made usable , would count as weapons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently summoned to appear before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE for a hearing of his case ( huvudf\u00f6rhandling ) on DATE . In its judgment of the same date the court stated :", "\" [ The applicant ] has contested criminal liability , on the following grounds : the weapon in question was owned by PERSON , who was married to his mother . PERSON is dead . When [ the applicant \u2019s ] mother moved house DATE the weapon went to [ the applicant \u2019s ] storage room together with furniture for which there was no room in his mother \u2019s new home . The weapon was found in the storage room in connection with [ the applicant \u2019s ] bankruptcy . He was aware of the weapon being there all the time but he did not think of it as a weapon . The rifle lacks a breech - block and there was never any ammunition . [ The applicant ] does not consider himself to be the owner of the rifle since it is his mother , now DATE , who is the formal owner of it .", "The court finds that [ the applicant ] can not avoid being held responsible for the possession of the weapon , but that the violation of LAW is of a minor character . \"", "The court sentenced him to DATE - fines ( dagsb\u00f6ter ) of MONEY each , i.e. MONEY in total . The DATE amount of the fines was fixed on the basis of Mr PERSON \u2019s financial situation . The court also upheld the earlier decision taken by the police to seize the rifle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG for Western Sweden , alleging that :", "( a ) the police investigations had not been sufficiently thorough ;", "( b ) although he admitted that he was aware that the weapon was in his removal company \u2019s care , he questioned whether this company really had a duty to check that the weapon had a valid licence ;", "( c ) new facts had come to light , namely that the actual owner of the rifle was not the applicant \u2019s mother , but the son of his now deceased stepfather ;", "( d ) the sentence imposed by ORG was much too severe in that it had been entered on the criminal records and would have detrimental effects on his future life , in particular as far as his chances of employment were concerned ;", "( e ) the DATE Act had not been correctly applied in his case because the rifle in question had no breech - block , something which could be proven by his mother and CARDINAL - brother , and hence could not be considered a weapon within the meaning of the Act .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE ORG notified the applicant that , according to LAW , section DATE , of LAW , his case could be dealt with without a hearing and invited him to express his views within DATE as to the necessity for a hearing . Alternatively , he could submit his final written observations within the same time - limit . He was asked to indicate in his reply any evidence on which he would rely .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed ORG that he considered a hearing to be necessary in his case and requested the appointment of a defence lawyer under the free legal aid scheme . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE he also advised ORG that the lower court \u2019s judgment had caused him damage because it had on a number of occasions led prospective employers to turn down his applications for work .", "CARDINAL . According to a note dated DATE , written by an official of the court following a telephone conversation with the applicant , the latter stated that he would not insist on calling witnesses because it was no longer disputed that the breech - block was missing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for a defence lawyer . On DATE he was also informed that , since the case could be decided without a hearing , he should submit his final written observations within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant reiterated his argument that the rifle could not be considered a weapon within the meaning of the DATE Act and again offered his CARDINAL - brother \u2019s testimony on this point . Furthermore , the applicant contested ORG refusal to appoint a defence lawyer . ORG , taking the latter submission to be an application for leave to appeal , referred the matter to ORG ( h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , which refused him such leave on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the case on CARDINAL DATE and , in accordance with LAW , section DATE , of LAW , first sub - paragraph , point CARDINAL , and third sub - paragraph , dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a trial hearing as this was found to be manifestly unnecessary ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This decision was made public on DATE when judgment was delivered . The court \u2019s judgment stated , inter alia :", "\" [ The applicant ] has submitted to ORG the same information as was mentioned in the judgment of ORG and added : when [ his stepfather ] and his mother separated , his stepfather left the rifle at the mother \u2019s place of residence at ORG . Because [ the stepfather ] has died it is his son ... who is the owner of the rifle .", "It is undisputed that [ the applicant ] has been in possession of the rifle without a permit . Regardless of how it came into his possession and who owns it , he shall therefore be convicted of having violated LAW . The sentence should be [ the one determined by ] ORG .", "ORG , which accepts [ the applicant \u2019s ] explanations as to how the rifle came into his possession , finds that he is not the owner of it . Accordingly , the question of confiscation of the rifle concerns a person who is not accused in the present case . An action for confiscation should be directed against the owner of the rifle in accordance with LAW of DATE on promulgation of LAW . No such action has been taken in this case . The request for confiscation is therefore rejected . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . He maintained , inter alia , that vital evidence , namely that the rifle had no breech - block and accordingly could not be a weapon within the meaning of the DATE Act , had been disregarded by both ORG and ORG . He asserted that this could easily have been proved had ORG granted his request for a hearing and heard witnesses . ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused an application by Mr PERSON to have his case re - opened .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW of LAW , lower courts must not as a rule give judgment in criminal cases until the accused has been able to defend himself at an oral hearing . Exceptions to this rule do however exist , particularly at appellate level . Thus , LAW , section DATE , of LAW ( as amended as of DATE by PERSON ) provides :", "\" ORG may dispose of an appeal on the merits without a hearing :", "CARDINAL . if the prosecutor appeals only for the benefit of the accused ,", "CARDINAL . if an appeal brought by the accused is supported by the opposing party ,", "CARDINAL . if the appeal is plainly unfounded , or", "CARDINAL . if no cause exists to hold the accused legally liable , or to impose a sanction upon him , or to impose a sanction other than a fine or conditional sentence , or a combination of such sanctions .", "...", "If , in a case referred to [ above ] , a party has requested a hearing , this shall take place unless manifestly unnecessary .", "...", "For a ruling not relating to the merits a hearing need not take place . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG has the power to review questions both of law and of fact . However , there are some limits on its jurisdiction . LAW , for instance , lays down that ORG may not normally change the lower court \u2019s assessment of the evidence to the disadvantage of the accused without the evidence in question being produced afresh before ORG ; LAW , LAW ( as amended by LAW and CARDINAL ) , also contains a rule prohibiting the appellate court , in cases where the appeal is lodged by the accused or by the prosecutor for the benefit of the accused , from imposing a sentence which can be considered more severe than that imposed at first instance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
