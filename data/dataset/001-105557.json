The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in NORP . At the material time he was a chief editor and a co - owner of the local newspaper \u201c Gazeta Ko\u015bcia\u0144ska \u201d , published in NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL journalists working for the applicant \u2019s newspaper interviewed a local GPE , Mr PERSON The interview , arranged during a chance meeting CARDINAL of the journalists and the GPE DATE , at a session of ORG , took place in the LOC \u2019s office in NORP and lasted TIME . All questions and answers were tape - recorded . It related to the LOC \u2019s public and business activities . After the meeting the PERSON requested that the text of the interview be submitted for his authorisation ( autoryzacja ) before its publication , as provided for by LAW ( ORG ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The verbatim transcript of the interview , subsequently prepared by the CARDINAL journalists , ran to CARDINAL standard pages . The applicant requested PERSON , the editing journalist of the newspaper , to prepare an edited version of the interview , fit for the publication purposes . That version ran to CARDINAL standard pages . The latter version was subsequently presented to the interviewee , DATE after the conversation . He read it and informed an employee of his office , Mr K. P. , that he would not give his consent to the publication of the text . He was of the view that the text did not correspond to the conversation he had had with the CARDINAL journalists and that many important statements he had made were not included . He asked PERSON to inform the applicant of his refusal . Shortly afterwards , the applicant called the GPE who reiterated his refusal .", "CARDINAL . In an undated letter to the applicant , served on him on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated :", "\u201c It is true that in DATE I talked to CARDINAL representatives of \u201c LOC \u201d . During that conversation , which was in any event very informal , I replied to a number of questions . However , the text submitted for my authorisation only after DATE , failed to include many of my important statements and to reflect the character and contents of my statements , [ a state of affairs ] which I can not accept . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper published a short text asking the readers whether they would be interested in having an interview with Mr PERSON , the local GPE , published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE parts of the verbatim records of the interview , edited by PERSON and accompanied by photos made when the interview was conducted , were published by \u201c Gazeta Ko\u015bcia\u0144ska \u201d . The text carried a lead informing the reader that the LOC had refused to grant his authorisation for the publication of the interview and that the newspaper was publishing parts of the interview as recorded on the tape , including in its original grammatical form .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE informed ORG that the applicant had committed a criminal offence by publishing parts of the interview without his authorisation and against his will .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on a charge of publishing an interview with the GPE in spite of the latter \u2019s refusal to authorise its publication . During the investigation the GPE submitted that he had talked to the CARDINAL journalists from the applicant \u2019s newspaper . They had had a casual conversation rather than a formal interview . DATE he had been given the text to be published which , in his view , failed to reflect many of his important assertions . Moreover , he was of the view that the text failed to convey both the character and the substance of his statements .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged . The court established the facts of the case as summarised above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It further found that the applicant had published the interview despite the LOC \u2019s refusal to authorise its publication . This in itself amounted to a criminal offence punishable under section CARDINAL read together with section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court observed that it was possible for the interviewed person to renounce his or her right to grant authorisation for the text to be published , but such a declaration had to be unequivocal .", "CARDINAL . The court noted the submission made by ORG , who was heard as a witness . According to ORG , the newspaper had not published the CARDINAL - page summary which had initially been submitted for the ORG \u2019s approval . It had published parts of the interview quoted verbatim . The court found his statement credible .", "The court further noted that ORG \u2019s photographs taken during the interview had also been published together with the interview . The applicant had failed to indicate which photographs he intended to publish and to show them to GPE before the publication .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the applicant had failed to comply with his obligation , under LAW , to obtain the authorisation of the interviewed person . It was of the view that the fact that the interview had been published without the required authorisation breached the interviewee \u2019s personal rights . The applicant had acted with intent to break the law , but he had been motivated by his wish to fulfil his journalistic duties by making the interview available to the public . Having regard to the latter factor , the court concluded that the offence concerned could not be regarded as serious .", "Consequently , and having regard also to the fact that it was not open to any doubt that the applicant was a law - abiding citizen and that his conduct had always been irreproachable , the court conditionally discontinued the proceedings , obliged the applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity and ordered him to bear the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of the Pozna\u0144 Regional Court of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , the first - instance judgment was upheld . The court noted , inter alia , that the photographs taken during the interview constituted its inherent part . The applicant , by publishing them without the interviewee \u2019s consent , had breached his personal rights within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , challenging the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , in so far as they provided for a fine or for restriction of liberty to be imposed on a journalist or publisher for failing to ask an interviewee for his or her authorisation . He relied on LAW , guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression , and LAW , providing for the principle of proportionality in respect of restrictions on constitutional rights .", "CARDINAL . In the ensuing constitutional proceedings ORG sought the opinions of the ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG ) and the Speaker of the ORG ( PERSON ) . In their opinions submitted to that court they concluded that section DATE , read together with section CARDINAL of LAW , was incompatible with the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression . They were of the view , in particular , that the restriction on the exercise of that right by imposition of a criminal penalty was incompatible with LAW , which enshrined the principle of proportionality in respect of restrictions imposed on the exercise of civil rights and freedoms ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They further referred to the existing civil law instruments available for the purposes of effective protection of personal rights ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court gave a judgment on the merits of his constitutional complaint on DATE . It held that the contested provisions of LAW were compatible with LAW read together with its LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court noted that it was proposed in a public debate to do away with the obligation to seek and obtain the authorisation provided for by LAW . However , the opinions pointing to the potential danger of such a legislative measure could not be overlooked . ORG was of the view that abrogating the authorisation requirement would , on the one hand , expose persons interviewed by the press to the risk of having their personal rights breached by having their words distorted and , on the other , be dangerous for the exercise of the freedom of expression . The essence of the authorisation was not only to ensure that statements made by interviewees were rendered literally , but also to protect the integrality of such statements . This , in turn , ensured that the intentions of the speaker were faithfully conveyed .", "Therefore , the applicant \u2019s argument that the authorisation requirement gave the interviewee an opportunity to block the publication of a statement indefinitely was incorrect .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further read :", "\u201c Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a NORP society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual \u2019s self - fulfilment . It is applicable not only to \u201c information \u201d or \u201c ideas \u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference , but also to those that offend , shock or disturb . The press has a duty to impart DATE in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest . This duty is closely intertwined with the right of the public to receive information . ( ... )", "Statements made public by the media could , as they have a great power of persuasion , lead to the infringement of the personal rights of the individuals concerned . In certain cases the post factum remedies available under law are insufficient to provide effective redress for such infringements , and in some cases the damage could indeed be irreparable . However , a publicly made statement not only could be an instrument of an infringement , but could also be unlawfully distorted . This was why the legislature decided to grant additional protection to statements made in the context of interviews by creating the authorisation requirement . Assuming that this requirement amounted to a restriction on freedom of expression as it obliged journalists to obtain authorisation from the author of literally quoted statements , its necessity in a NORP society has to be examined . [ The ] freedom of expression is not ius infinitum and could therefore be limited . However , it is necessary that restrictions on its exercise are compatible with the principle of proportionality set out in DATE . This provision allows for restrictions imposed on individual rights only when they have statutory legal basis and are necessary in a democratic state in the interests of national security or public safety , for the protection of environment , health or morals , for the protection of rights of others . These restrictions can not not impair the essence of rights and freedoms . ( ... )", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides for everyone \u2019s right to the legal protection of one \u2019s private and family life , of one \u2019s honour and good reputation , and for the right to decide about one \u2019s personal life . No restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of these rights ( ... ) . On the contrary , the freedom of expression can be restricted . The obligation to obtain the interviewee \u2019s consent amounted to a restriction . However , such restriction can not be seen as impairing the essence of the freedom of expression , because it concerns only statements quoted verbatim in press publications . It does not restrict or limit journalists\u2019 right to inform the public of the content of such a statement by summarising it . When a journalist chooses to summarise or otherwise convey the content of a statement made by the interviewee , he or she is not obliged to seek the interviewee \u2019s authorisation or to inform them of the intended publication . Nor , therefore , does it restrict the right of the public to obtain information .", "[ ... ] that requirement is also necessary in a NORP society to protect the personal rights of journalists\u2019 sources . Hence , not only it is not in breach of any constitutional right but , on the contrary , it had to be regarded as a guarantee of the effective exercise of constitutional rights .", "Furthermore , this requirement is justified not only by the necessity to protect individual rights [ ... ] but it derives its legal foundation from other elements which , taken together , formed the constitutional notion of the public interest . As the authorisation serves to establish with full clarity the authorship of a given statement made public , it contributes to the clarity and transparency of public debate . It makes it possible for the reader to be certain that the speaker identifies himself with the statement \u2019s content and would not try to change it or to distance himself from it . It is therefore in the reader \u2019s interest to maintain it . Without this requirement , readers could not be sure whether statements purportedly made in the context of interviews are really authentic .", "In ORG opinion the authorisation requirement was therefore a means of guaranteeing the reader \u2019s right to obtain reliable , credible , truthful , honest , clear , not misleading and responsible information . This right has not been expressly guaranteed by LAW , but it was anchored in it . [ ... ] \u201d", "CARDINAL . In so far as the criminal sanction for failure to obtain the authorisation was concerned , ORG observed that it aimed at ensuring that the citizen \u2019s right to reliable information was respected . Authorisation was the simplest way to ensure the veracity of the message , whereas statements published without authorisation could be distorted , which was clearly undesirable .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court referred to the legal provisions penalising defamation . It was of the view that while the offence of defamation was directed against an individual \u2019s reputation , in the same way the offence penalised by section CARDINAL read together with section CARDINAL of LAW was aimed at obtaining compliance with the obligation to quote and report statements made by interviewees in a fair and accurate manner , in order to protect their personal rights . The penal sanction provided for by these provisions thus respected the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . A dissenting opinion of Justice PERSON was attached to that judgment . He had regard , firstly , to considerations which could be said to have constituted the ratio legis of LAW when it had been adopted in DATE . He noted that LAW , in force at that time , guaranteed neither the right to freedom of expression nor the right to respect for family and private life in any form comparable to the current constitutional regulations . At that time all media had been subject to preventive censorship and it was ultimately the ORG which decided what could be published or broadcast . The opinion further read , inter alia :", "\u201c The provisions of LAW regarding the authorisation requirement were only , at that time , an additional safeguard against the press publishing any information given to journalists by ORG or ORG agents if such information was capable of jeopardising the interests of then political power .", "[ Given that constitutional background , it is only natural that ] LAW did not provide for any distinction in respect of the authorisation requirement between the persons exercising public functions and all other persons . Thus , that LAW provided for identical protection , by way of the criminal law , of persons holding public offices who were , for that reason , obliged to provide information about their acts to journalists , playing the role of \u201c watchdogs \u201d of the public powers on behalf of public opinion , and all other , \u201c private \u201d , persons . ( ... )", "Moreover , LAW failed to indicate any time - limit within which a journalist could reasonably expect that authorisation would be granted or refused . ( ... )", "While it is true that during DATE of the ancien r\u00e9gime , in CARDINAL , ORG censorship became less strict , the origin of the examined provisions of LAW and the place they had in the legal order at that time can not be ignored . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Justice PERSON further disagreed with ORG in so far as it had held that the restrictions imposed by the impugned provisions satisfied the test of proportionality , enshrined in LAW . In this context , he stated that the freedom of speech standards developed by ORG in its judgments could not be overlooked . The dissenting opinion further read :", "\u201c The impugned provisions [ seen in this light ] amounted to an unnecessary and excessive interference with the freedom of the press in the interest of the personal rights of persons providing information to the press . These provisions were not necessary for that purpose at the time they were adopted and are still less necessary in a democratic ORG governed by the rule of law .", "Authorisation to publish information quoted verbatim is unknown to the legal systems of other GPE of ORG . ( ... )", "The authorisation requirement amounts to censorship which makes it impossible for the reader to know the original statement made by the interviewee . It may dissuade journalist who is wishing to obtain an interview for their newspaper with a politician important in a national or local context from asking uncomfortable , searching questions . ( ... )", "In a democratic state a politician , a public person , has no right to manipulate his or her statements post factum . If he or she resorts to such manipulation , the public opinion is entitled to know this because it is an important element relevant for public image of a politician if he or she tampers with his or her public statements . The requirement of authorisation makes it impossible for the public to acquire such knowledge . ORG expect politicians to have the courage to make wise decisions in difficult situations . If a politician is unsure of the choice of words to be used when speaking in a public situation it might be a signal to the public that he or she is unable to cope with stressful circumstances . It is something that public opinion is entitled to know . ( ... )", "I do not share the view expressed by ORG in the present case that a journalist , when refused authorisation to publish a verbatim quotation , can resort to paraphrasing the statements concerned ; that LAW therefore does not in any way restrict the journalist \u2019s right to convey the interviewee \u2019s thoughts and the right to inform the public thereof ( ... ) . I am of the view that public opinion always has a right to be informed of the interviewee \u2019s statements quoted verbatim always where a journalist deems it necessary to convey information which is interesting for readers . I am also of the opinion that that descriptive technique is manipulative and makes it possible for both a journalist and an interviewee to shirk responsibility for the words they use . Furthermore , the fact that the impugned provisions of LAW make it possible to use such \u201c techniques \u201d and \u201c evasions \u201d demonstrates that they do not meet the standards required of a fair - minded legislator . ( ... )", "There is no right in the LAW or in a NORP society to \u201c true \u201d or \u201c right \u201d information . A journalist is not obliged to provide such information ; if only because he or she does not exercise public powers . His or her professional duty is to seek and disseminate information , views and judgments . Only persons receiving information , readers , listeners , TV watchers or internet users are to decide whether information is true or not . ( ... )", "The authorisation requirement is not , as such , wrong . A journalist , when talking to experts , may have , at the editing stage , some doubts whether he or she has properly understood what they said , even where the interview was recorded . In practice , in such situations journalists themselves request the persons interviewed to read the text and to correct or supplement it . A journalist is well aware that errors he committed in gathering specialist information could jeopardise his position on the market . What then is a sword of a criminal sanction needed for ? ( ... )", "The mere fact that section DATE of LAW has practically never been applied recently by the courts ( ... ) does not mean that it does not play in the NORP legal system a negative role , with a chilling effect on public debate . No one challenges the constitutionality of the provisions of civil law applied by the courts in the context of disagreements arising out of press publications . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
