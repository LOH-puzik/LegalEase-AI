In its reasoning , the court held that the published information had been untrue and that the applicant had not properly verified its accuracy .

Although the CARDINAL remaining eyewitnesses , GPE and PERSON , testified that the handgun had indeed been in PERSON 's hands , the court did not find their testimonies convincing , on the ground that they differed . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c As to ... whether the plaintiff ... took the official handgun from the security officer in the press room and threatened GPE with it , the court ... heard evidence from the plaintiff ... and witnesses GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE", "The plaintiff and witnesses PERSON and ORG stated in their testimonies that the plaintiff had not had PERSON 's official handgun in his hands .

In reply to the question from whom [ ORG ] had taken the handgun , the plaintiff or PERSON , witness PERSON could not reply with certainty , explaining that it had all happened relatively quickly and that she had been shocked to see the handgun in the plaintiff 's hands , since she had seen this as a personal threat .", "Witness PERSON in her testimony also stated that ... she had seen the plaintiff searching the security officer PERSON , after which the plaintiff had held the handgun in the palm of his right hand , which he had been holding ... on the palm of his left hand . According to [ her ] testimony , the plaintiff was at that moment talking to GPE with a raised voice .", "The court does not accept the testimonies of GPE and PERSON , because they are not convincing .

PERSON was unable to say from whom PERSON had taken the handgun , whereas ORG stated that she had taken it from the plaintiff 's hands .", "On the other hand , the testimonies of ORG and the plaintiff ... are in concordance ... From the testimony of the plaintiff and PERSON it follows that while in the press room the plaintiff was holding the documents for the forthcoming session under his left arm , so it was not possible that he was holding the handgun in his hand [ at the same time ] , as ... PERSON testified .", "This court does not accept the written statement ... by GPE or the testimony of PERSON , because they were not present during the incident and have no direct knowledge of it . It is to be noted that GPE 's written statement and the testimony of PERSON concerning PERSON 's testimony ... are completely contradictory and different , for which reason the court does not accept them as convincing .", "...", "Given that the plaintiff was acquitted by a final judgment in criminal proceedings on a charge of ... having told GPE on DATE ' you should be killed ' , and of having taken the handgun afterwards from the security officer PERSON and held it in his hand , and having regard to the testimonies of witnesses PERSON , PERSON and the plaintiff himself ... , and even GPE herself , this court finds that on the critical [ date ] the plaintiff did not threaten PERSON , nor did he say on the same occasion that ... she should be killed . For that reason the conditions set forth in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of the [ Public Information ] Act for exonerating the [ respondent ] from liability to pay damages are not met , in that the information causing the damage is not based on true facts . The court also establishes that the conditions for exculpation of the publisher DATE according to which the publisher is to be exonerated from liability if the information causing damage is based on facts which the author had reasonable grounds to believe were true and with regard to which it took all necessary measures to verify their accuracy \u2013 were not met either .", "In this respect the court ... heard evidence from witnesses ...

Finally , on DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant company 's subsequent constitutional complaint , finding no violation of its constitutional right to freedom of expression . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "ORG found that the complainants ' constitutional rights guaranteed by LAW had not been breached by the impugned judgments .", "Constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression of thoughts , which includes the freedom of the press , is not absolute but is subject to restrictions prescribed by LAW or statute .", "Those restrictions stem , in respect of the media , from the ...

Its protection is of special significance where the press is concerned because the latter 's task is , inter alia , to publish information of public importance . However , the freedom to publish information in the press is circumscribed by the protection of the dignity and reputation of other persons . It is therefore important to determine the conditions under which the ORG authorities may take measures which could impinge on the activity of the press in cases of legitimate public interest .", "Freedom of expression of thoughts concerns not only the publication and expression of information with positive connotations , but also the publication of information which may resonate negatively in the public . However , freedom of the press is not absolute , but is subject to certain restrictions , even in respect of press articles which concern information of public interest . These duties and responsibilities come into play also when , as in the present case , the reputation of a ORG official is harmed . It is precisely because of these duties and responsibilities of those who exercise their right to freedom of expression that the press , when imparting information of public interest , is bound to act in good faith in order to provide trustworthy information in accordance with the ethics of journalism .", "In assessing whether freedom of expression has been breached it is necessary to view each individual case in the light of all the circumstances , including the content of the impugned statements , as well as the context in which they were made . In particular , it is necessary to establish whether the measures taken in order to restrict freedom of expression are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued by that restriction . The protection of a ORG official from harassment must however respect the right and the interest of the press to free reporting and allow it to impart freely information of public interest .", "The article for which the [ complainant ] was ordered to pay damages to the victim is , by its content , of such a nature that it constituted an attack on the victim as a public figure , in particular on his reputation , and it certainly influenced public confidence in him , given his function as Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of GPE at the time . ORG , in this particular case , and on the basis of the findings of the [ lower ] courts , finds that the impugned article contained allegations on the behaviour of another individual ( public figure ) , which harmed [ his ] reputation ...", "It has to be noted that the impugned allegations were based on the statement of CARDINAL individual and were not completely arbitrary in nature . Namely , even if a public figure was involved , the complainant was required to verify the accuracy of the information before its publication . This is especially so because the impugned allegations related to a specific incident . The [ lower ] courts found that the [ complainant ] , in publishing information which could have harmed the dignity , honour and reputation of another person , had not taken all necessary measures in order to verify its accuracy .", "Given that the [ complainant ] in this case did not satisfy its duty to verify the information before publication , as ... it was required to do , and given that the information harmed the reputation and honour of another person , ORG considers that the measures restricting the [ complainant 's ] freedom of expression were necessary and justified .", "As regards the compensation for non - pecuniary damage awarded for harming the reputation of another person , the Constitutional Court emphasizes that the courts have discretion in assessing the amount of compensation for mental pain sustained by the victim , having regard to the circumstances of each case . However , a judicial decision on the amount of such compensation may also breach the principle of proportionality between the intensity of the interference by the courts with freedom of expression and the importance of the interest pursued by the restriction of that freedom .", "The Constitutional Court finds that the measure taken to protect the reputation of another person , that is , the award of damages in the above - mentioned amount , is proportional to the intensity of the breach of that person 's reputation , and to the intensity of the interference by the courts with the freedom of expression caused by that measure . Given that the complainant as a publishing house did not comply in its activities with the provisions of the [ LAW ] , ORG considers that the article tarnished the reputation of another person and undermined the public confidence in that person as a ORG official .", "Therefore , it is established that the measure taken in this case to restrict the freedom of the press is , taken as a whole , proportional to achieving the legitimate aim \u2013 the protection of the reputation of another person , and that the impugned judicial decisions did not lead to a restriction of the complainant 's rights or freedoms , contrary to LAW .", "ORG decision was served on the applicant company 's representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
