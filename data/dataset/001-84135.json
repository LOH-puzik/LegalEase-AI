It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of CARDINAL gothic paintings , known as the \u201c Collection of the Master of PERSON \u201d . In DATE the collection was seized by the ORG and subsequently deposited in ORG in GPE .", "On DATE law no . CARDINAL on the adjustment of certain property relations of holy orders and congregations and of the NORP of LAW ( z\u00e1kon o \u00faprav\u011b n\u011bkter\u00fdch majetkov\u00fdch vztah\u016f \u0159eholn\u00edch \u0159\u00e1d\u016f a kongregac\u00ed a arcibiskupstv\u00ed olomouck\u00e9ho ) ( hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) entered into force . It contained an exhaustive list of property and of church entities entitled to acquire it upon the LAW \u2019s entry into force . Neither the collection nor the applicant was listed therein .", "On DATE ORG recognised the applicant \u2019s property rights to the paintings , but refused to surrender the collection .", "On DATE the applicant sought to recover the collection by means of a civil action for determination of the ownership of the paintings , brought against ORG .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE CARDINAL ORG ( obvodn\u00ed soud ) found that , in general , the ORG had acquired control over the church property in DATE pursuant to law no . CARDINAL . It noted that ORG ( ORG matice ) , a special ORG agency , was founded by decree no . CARDINAL to administer church property . The court granted the applicant \u2019s action , basing its finding on documentary evidence , including a contract of deposit concluded by ORG and ORG on DATE , according to which the former had deposited the collection of paintings with the latter ; and an offer by ORG of DATE to donate the collection to ORG , under the terms of which the ownership of the paintings was to be transferred to the State on DATE of the acceptance of the offer . The acceptance of the offer by ORG is dated DATE .", "The court held in particular :", "\u201c The original ownership rights to the collection are not challenged by [ ORG ] . What is disputed is the validity of the contract of donation ...", "It ensues from the evidence taken ... that ORG knew who the real owner of the items was and could not , therefore , be in good faith that it was the owner . The transfer of the ownership of the items [ by the donation ] could not , therefore , have any legal consequences and remained ineffective with regard to [ the applicant ] . Since no legislation or decision provided for the transfer of the ownership from the plaintiff to the ORG or to any other person , [ the applicant ] is the owner ... \u201d", "The court further stated that the legislation on restitution , in particular the LAW , was not applicable to the present case , as it applied only to situations where ownership of property had been transferred to the ORG , not to situations where such a transfer was not effected . In the latter case , the ORG seized and held property without acquiring ownership of it . The owner of such property was therefore eligible to claim that it be surrendered to him by using general civil - law actions intended to protect ORG rights in respect of any third person interfering with their property rights . The court concluded that the LAW did not preclude the applicant \u2019s standing to have recourse to this procedure to defend its property rights against ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) upheld this judgment , ruling in particular :", "\u201c [ R]egard must be had to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE no . CARDINAL PERSON ... according to which the church property was ... seized by the ORG using a set of practices typically used to deprive holy orders and congregations of their property ... The [ A]ct applies .... in particular to these practices ... It applies at least in so far as it governs the restitution of church property taken away from its owners by the ORG pursuant to these practices . ... If [ the LAW ] in its enumerative list provided for a remedy for injustices only in respect of certain seized property [ seized in a certain way ] , and not in respect of other property , even if the latter was seized in the same way as the former ( by donation by ORG ) , then \u2013 as [ the LAW ] is lex specialis \u2013 the logical conclusion is that a person otherwise entitled ( to the property listed therein ) , does not have standing to claim property rights to the property which is not listed there . ... ORG took a similar approach in its decision of CARDINAL DATE no . CARDINAL Cdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL . \u201d", "The court continued by adopting a different approach , stating :", "\u201c [ The Municipal ] court dissented with this opinion , e.g. in its judgment of DATE no .

In its view , this would be contrary to the constitutional law .", "ORG filed an appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) with ORG ( PERSON ) which , on DATE , found that the lower courts had not applied the LAW correctly and therefore quashed their judgments . Referring to its case - law , the court reiterated that the LAW had to be interpreted as part of the legislation on restitution which was lex specialis in respect of the civil law and was thus to have precedence over the civil law . It stated :", "\u201c The court can not accept the position adopted by the appellate court . There is no doubt that the Act forms by its nature a part of the legislation on restitution ....", "It is not acceptable to reduce [ the application of the LAW ] in cases where the property was seized in accordance with the law then in force ... \u201d", "ORG supported this conclusion by stating that the restitution legislation was drawn up by the ORG to mitigate the injustice caused by communist rule in GPE in the area of property rights . When adopting a suitable legislative technique for the restitution of church property provided for by the LAW , the legislator opted to include an exhaustive list of property to be restored and added an enumerative index of church entities entitled thereto . In the court \u2019s view , it was therefore irrelevant in terms of the restitution of this property whether the ORG had seized it in accordance with or contrary to the law applicable at the time of seizure .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG , having been bound by ORG opinion , dismissed the applicant \u2019s action without taking any further evidence .", "On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "The applicant appealed on points of law before ORG , which rejected its appeal on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) contending that the lower courts had failed to protect its property rights and that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected in the proceedings before ORG , as the appeal on points law submitted by ORG had been admitted for examination on the merits while its own appeal had not . It further contested the lack of assessment of the facts by ORG in the proceedings following the judgment of ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON sen\u00e1t ORG soudu ) rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal , finding in particular :", "\u201c In respect of the [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments concerning ...
