THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of the introduction of the application , was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant , his spouse and their CARDINAL daughters left GPE for an unspecified destination somewhere in LOC . In the course of their journey , one of the applicant \u2019s daughters died of suffocation in the truck in which they were hiding . The applicant \u2019s spouse and the other daughter returned to GPE in order to bury the deceased child there . The applicant continued his journey .", "On DATE , the applicant and CARDINAL others , who were found concealed in a vehicle bound to leave the GPE for GPE , were arrested by ORG ( ORG ) on suspicion of being illegal aliens . On DATE , after a verification of his identity , nationality and residence title , the applicant was placed in GPE detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE , the applicant \u2013 with the assistance of an interpreter DATE was interviewed by an official of ORG in relation to the grounds for his asylum request .", "The applicant stated , inter alia , that as from DATE he had made propaganda for the pro - NORP HADEP party and that as from DATE , being a pharmacist , he had provided the ORG with medicines on a regular basis . His brother , a ORG member since DATE , had been arrested in DATE and was detained since . DATE , he himself had been arrested several times . After having been kept in detention for short periods , he had been released each time . After the arrest in DATE of a ORG member who had had medicines from the applicant \u2019s pharmacy in his possession , the applicant and his family left their home town for GPE . During his stay in GPE , the applicant learned that his pharmacy had been destroyed by a bomb by the NORP authorities . The applicant concluded therefrom that the arrested ORG member had given his name to the NORP authorities .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum or a residence permit . The ORG Secretary doubted the veracity of the applicant \u2019s account and in this respect noted , inter alia , that the applicant , who stated he was a pharmacist , could only name CARDINAL kinds of medicines amongst which aspirin , that he was unable to state the name of the medicine he claimed to use for treatment of his mental condition and that he was unable to state the name of the wholesaler from whom he would have bought medicines for his pharmacy . The ORG Secretary did not find it established that the applicant would face a real danger of treatment contrary to LAW if be expelled to GPE . In accordance with LAW , the ORG Secretary further ordered that the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement be restricted by assigning him to an asylum ORG centre and that this order was suspended until the measure of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was lifted otherwise than by a departure from the GPE .", "On DATE , the legal basis for the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was altered from LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW into LAW ( a ) of LAW . On DATE his expulsion from the GPE was ordered .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) of ORG ( ORG ) sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of DATE . He further requested ORG for an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings . As he was placed in GPE detention he was not required , like asylum seekers not placed in GPE detention , first to file an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the ORG Secretary of ORG before filing an appeal with ORG .", "At CARDINAL unspecified points in time the applicant started a hunger strike in order to obtain access to the asylum procedure for persons not placed in GPE detention . His first hunger strike lasted DATE and his second DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG sent a notification to ORG of ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch that the applicant had been in GPE detention for DATE without having filed an appeal against the decision of his placement in GPE detention . This notification is considered on a par with a first appeal under LAW of LAW .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , ORG rejected the appeal filed by way of a notification . It considered that the applicant \u2019s arrest and placement in GPE detention was lawful under the relevant statutory provisions . It held that there were serious grounds for believing that the applicant would seek to find ways of avoiding his expulsion . ORG considered at the outset that there were serious doubts as to the veracity of the applicant \u2019s account that he had come to the GPE to apply for asylum , as at the moment of his arrest he had been at the point of leaving the GPE . ORG found it established that he had intentionally sought to evade any form of control of entry of aliens and had sought to leave the GPE in an uncontrolled manner .", "In these circumstances , ORG did not find that the applicant \u2019s request for asylum opposed ( a continuation of ) his placement in GPE detention . Noting that , at the time of his arrest and to date , the applicant did not hold a valid residence title , did not have any identity papers and did not have sufficient means of existence , ORG found that there were sufficient grounds to justify the measure of placement in GPE detention . It finally considered that the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings on the refusal to grant him asylum or a residence permit did not as such affect the lawfulness of his placement in GPE detention as pending the determination of this request it could not be said that there were no prospects of expulsion . Moreover , there were no indications in the applicant \u2019s case that it was highly likely that his request for an injunction would be successful . In this respect the court further noted that the injunction request would be dealt with in the near future . In the court \u2019s opinion , there were as yet realistic perspectives for the applicant \u2019s expulsion and the authorities were sufficiently diligent in their activities aimed at the applicant \u2019s expulsion .", "On DATE , the applicant and a unspecified number of others placed in GPE detention started a third hunger strike in order to obtain access to the asylum procedure for persons not placed in GPE detention . He claims that during this hunger strike , that lasted until DATE , he was denied recreational rights that other persons placed in GPE detention enjoyed , such as access to the library . He further claims that he was not allowed to buy a telephone card or cigarettes and that medical care was hardly provided . Also , after he had ceased his hunger strike , no medical care was provided although he did complain of pain .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , the President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . The President held that , although the general ( human rights ) situation in ( in particular south - east ) GPE could be called bad , the mere belonging to the NORP community in GPE is not sufficient for a finding of persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW . The President found that it had not been established that the applicant had founded reasons to fear persecution within the meaning of the DATE Convention .", "The President further considered that the fact that the applicant has only applied for asylum following his arrest did cast doubts as to the reliability of his statements . The President noted that the applicant , who alleged to be a pharmacist , could only name CARDINAL kinds of medicine and was unable to state the name of the wholesaler in GPE from whom he would have bought medicines . The President further considered as implausible the applicant \u2019s claim that pharmacists in GPE do not necessarily have to be professionally qualified . Since the applicant had failed to substantiate his account with any documents , the President held that the above seriously undermined the credibility of the applicant \u2019s account .", "The President noted that the applicant \u2019s activities for HADEP were only of a marginal nature and that the applicant had stated that his various arrests were not linked to his brother \u2019s activities for the ORG but were based on his own activities for the ORG . Further noting that , shortly after each arrest , the applicant had been unconditionally released , the President held that there was no indication that the applicant was being considered by the NORP authorities as an important political opponent . The President further did not find it plausible that the NORP authorities would consider the fact that the applicant had provided the ORG with medicines as a political act , since a pharmacist always runs the risk that medicines are being provided to ORG members . The President further found no causal link between the bomb attack on the applicant \u2019s pharmacy and his activities for the ORG and considered that it was more plausible that this was linked to the general security situation in south - east GPE .", "", "The President also noted that the alleged events had not given the applicant cause to leave GPE immediately as he had remained in GPE until DATE without having encountered any problems from the side of the NORP authorities . As to information contained in a letter of DATE from ORG in GPE to the effect that the applicant was an active supporter of ORG , that the NORP authorities were aware of these activities and that it was extremely likely that the applicant , if returned to GPE , would be arrested and detained with a very high risk of being ill - treated and/or tortured during his detention , the President held that this information could not be considered as coming from an objective source . The President concluded that it had not been established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW . In these circumstances , the President did not find it necessary to determine the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction on his expulsion .", "On DATE the applicant filed a second request for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was interviewed by an official of ORG in respect of his second asylum request . According to the written record of this interview , the applicant stated that he could understand the assisting interpreter very well , that he had no new facts or circumstances to adduce in support of his new asylum request and that he had filed this new request upon the advice of his new lawyer who considered that the written record of the applicant \u2019s interview held on DATE did not correctly reflect the applicant \u2019s account .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s new lawyer sent comments on the written record of the applicant \u2019s interview held on DATE to the ORG Secretary of ORG . In this letter a number of examples were given of discrepancies between what the applicant had allegedly said and what had been recorded . According to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , these discrepancies were the result of inadequate interpretation . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s new lawyer submitted comments to the written record of the interview held on CARDINAL DATE .", "By letters of DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed complaints with the Minister of ORG and ORG about the asylum proceedings conducted in the applicant \u2019s case . In these letters , the applicant \u2019s lawyer complained in particular about the quality of interpretation during the applicant \u2019s interviews in relation to his CARDINAL asylum requests in that this interpreter was allegedly unable to communicate adequately in either NORP or NORP .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s second request for asylum or a residence permit . The ORG Secretary noted that the comments submitted on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE related to the first asylum proceedings and could not be regarded as new relevant facts and circumstances . In this respect , the ORG Secretary noted that the applicant \u2019s initial lawyer had already addressed the contents of the record on the interview held on DATE and had raised the same points as the ones that were now being raised by the applicant \u2019s new lawyer in relation to this interview . These subject matters had been examined both in the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s first request for asylum and in the proceedings on the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention . The applicant \u2019s new asylum request was , therefore , inadmissible .", "The ORG Secretary of ORG further held that no facts or circumstances had appeared on the basis of which the applicant would qualify for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and that it had not been established that there was a real risk that the applicant , if returned to his country of origin , will be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW . Having found no reasons on grounds of which the applicant should be given the possibility to await the outcome of a possible appeal in the GPE , the ORG Secretary considered that the applicant should leave the GPE as soon as possible . The ORG Secretary further ordered that the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement be restricted by assigning him to an asylum seekers centre and that this order was suspended until the measure of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was lifted otherwise than by a departure from the GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE was scheduled for DATE . No information has been submitted as to whether he has in fact been deported on this or any subsequent date .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where the interests of public order , public peace or of national security so require , the following persons can be placed in GPE detention :", "a. alien whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious reasons for expecting that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not entitled to residency in the GPE under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending a determination of a request for a temporary or permanent residence permit or a request for admission as refugee .", "CARDINAL . Placement in GPE detention will not be ordered when - and will be terminated as soon as - the alien indicates that he wants to leave the GPE and has the possibility to do so .", "CARDINAL . A placement in GPE detention under the first paragraph under b. or c. shall in no case exceed DATE . \u201d", "An alien who does not have any identity papers and whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in GPE detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be lifted .", "According to NORP case - law , the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , it is feasible that this point in time is attained at an earlier or later point in time than after DATE have passed . It can be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it can be sooner where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "LAW ( PERSON ) provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Other than in the cases laid down by or pursuant to law , no one may be deprived of his liberty .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who has been deprived of his liberty other than by order of a court may request a court to order his release . In such a case he shall be heard by the court within a period to be laid down by law . The court shall order his immediate release if it considers the deprivation of liberty to be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The trial of a person who has been deprived of his liberty pending trial shall take place within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . A person who has been lawfully deprived of his liberty may be restricted in the exercise of fundamental rights in so far as the exercise of such rights is incompatible with the deprivation of liberty . \u201d", "Article PERSON of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A measure taken under this LAW to the effect of a limitation of the freedom of movement or deprivation of liberty shall , for the purposes of LAW , be considered as being on a par with a decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court shall examine a first appeal against a decision to the effect of deprivation of liberty within DATE , either during the preliminary examination under LAW or during a court hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the appeal is directed against a decision as referred to in the second paragraph , the court shall determine the time of the trial proceedings without delay and in any event not DATE after DATE of transmission of the appeal . In deviation of LAW , the delay referred to in that Article can not be prolonged .", "CARDINAL . ORG hands down its written decision , unless immediately at the court hearing a decision is handed down orally , within DATE following the closure of the investigation < at the hearing>. As a deviation of DATE , second paragraph , of LAW , the delay referred to in that provision can not be extended .", "CARDINAL . Where the court finds that the applicant or execution of the measure is contrary to the law or after weighing the interests involved can not in all reasonability be regarded as justified , it declares the appeal < filed > under this provision founded and orders that the measure be lifted or a change in the manner of its execution . \u201d", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes . Furthermore , an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected ( cf . ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for filing an appeal against a decision of placement in GPE detention and in principle a person placed in GPE detention can file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "Pursuant to LAW , the Minister of ORG must send a notification to the competent court when an alien has spent DATE in GPE detention where the person concerned has not himself filed an appeal against this decision .
