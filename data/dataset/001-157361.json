On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the first - instance judgment . It agreed with the first - instance ORG findings of fact . As regards the reopening of the proceedings , it observed that the ORG had acted in accordance with LAW . In that context , it referred , in particular , to paragraph CARDINAL of this provision which explicitly allowed the ORG to reopen the proceedings if it came to light that the submitted evidence had not constituted sufficient grounds for the right to the pension to be established . It also noted that , in the applicant \u2019s case , the proceedings had been reopened because new evidence had been obtained by the authority , namely the documents relating to the course of the child \u2019s medical treatment .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , before paragraph CARDINAL was added to section CARDINAL of the DATE Law , ORG adopted a resolution in which it held :", "\u201c A different assessment of the [ same ] evidence as attached to the application for a retirement or disability pension , carried out by a social security authority after validation of the decision awarding the right to a pension , is not one of the circumstances justifying the ex officio re - opening of the proceedings for a review of the right to a pension in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on retirement and disability pensions paid from ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE ( case no . III GPE CARDINAL ) ORG held that , when applying section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Law , the domestic courts should take into account the criteria set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case . They should first establish whether the mistake in granting a social security benefit had been caused by the authorities themselves without any fault of the person concerned . In examining whether the social security authority was allowed to reopen the proceedings , they should also take into account the period of time that had elapsed from the date when the social benefit in question had been granted . When applying the provision of domestic law they should assess the proportionality of the consequences of the interference with an individual \u2019s right to a social benefit . Accordingly , where the mistake had been caused by the authorities themselves and the revocation of the benefit would entail substantial negative consequences for an individual , the relevant decision should not be revoked .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . I GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG reiterated that the revocation of the right to a social security benefit following the reopening of the proceedings under LAW of the DATE PERSON should be assessed in the light of the criteria set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case . In this connection ORG underlined that ORG constituted an integral part of the NORP legal system and that the domestic courts should therefore interpret the provisions of the domestic law in the light of the jurisprudence of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case no . III GPE CARDINAL ) ORG held that section CARDINAL(CARDINALa ) of the DATE PERSON should not be interpreted as providing a separate legal basis for reopening of the proceedings concerning the grant of a social security benefit and should be read in conjunction with LAW CARDINAL ) . If this provision was to be understood as allowing the social security authority to reopen the relevant proceedings of its own motion merely on the basis of a new assessment of previously submitted evidence , it would have to be considered incompatible with the principle of the rule of law set forth in LAW . ORG considered that its interpretation of the provisions of the DATE PERSON was further supported by the principles set out in the FAC judgment of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an application to ORG , asking for section CARDINAL(CARDINALa ) of the DATE Law to be declared unconstitutional . The ORG argued that the impugned provision was unconstitutional in so far as it expressly allowed for an ex officio reopening of proceedings relating to the grant of a pension or a disability pension on the basis of a new assessment of the evidence which had already been submitted before the relevant authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that section CARDINAL(CARDINALa ) of the DATE PERSON was in breach of LAW ( the principle of the rule of law ) and LAW ( the right to social security ) of LAW . It found that , as the provision in question allowed for an unlimited re - assessment of evidence which constituted grounds for the initial decision concerning the entitlement to a social security benefit , it was in breach of the principle of the rule of law as set forth in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that the provision in question did not strike a fair balance between the general interest and an individual \u2019s right to social security under LAW . The court considered that an interference with individual rights guaranteed by LAW , which pursued the aim of correcting the authority \u2019s own mistake , could only be justified under exceptional circumstances . However , on the basis of the impugned provision the social security authority could , at any time and without any limitations , review the decision concerning a social security benefit by means of re - assessment of the evidence before it .", "CARDINAL . In the grounds for the ruling ORG also referred to the ORG \u2019s PERSON judgment . It noted that this case had likewise concerned a revocation of the right to a social security benefit following the reopening of the social security proceedings , which had been , however , based on section CARDINAL ) of the Law CARDINAL as section CARDINAL(CARDINALa ) had not been in force at the material time . It further observed that the ORG \u2019s judgment had influenced the interpretation of section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Law by ORG ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , with regard to the consequences of its ruling , ORG noted that the breach of LAW should be remedied by restoring the state of conformity with the law ( wymaga przywr\u00f3cenia stanu zgodnego z prawem ) . In that context , ORG explicitly stated that the finding of unconstitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINALa ) of the DATE PERSON should be a ground for the reopening of proceedings in which final rulings had been based on this provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment was published in ORG ( PERSON ) and entered into force on that date .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW , in so far as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final .", "CARDINAL . Judgments of ORG , ... shall be published immediately .", "CARDINAL . A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from DATE of its publication ; however , ORG may specify another date for DATE the binding force of a normative act ...", "CARDINAL . A judgment of ORG on the non - conformity with LAW , an international agreement or statute , of a normative act on the basis of which a final judicial decision , final administrative decision or ruling on other matters was given , shall be a basis for reopening proceedings , or for quashing the impugned decision or ruling in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW in conjunction with LAW ( Kodeks Post\u0119powania Cywilnego ) a party to civil proceedings terminated by a final judgment may request that these proceedings be reopened , if ORG has found that the normative act on the basis of which this judgment was given was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a request to that effect shall be lodged within DATE from the date on which the judgment of ORG has entered into force . Pursuant to LAW a request for the reopening of the proceedings must be lodged within DATE from the date on which the final judgment has been given , unless the party could not act in the proceedings or was not properly represented .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a reopened case is to be examined within the limits determined by the grounds for the reopening . According to LAW of this provision , after a fresh examination of the case , the court may either dismiss the request for reopening , or allow it and alter or quash the impugned judgment . If need be , it may reject the claim on formal grounds or discontinue the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
