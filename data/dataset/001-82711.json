The first applicant , who was born in DATE , is a lawyer practising in GPE . He is the owner and general manager of the second applicant , a holding company which is , inter alia , the sole owner of the limited liability company ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , upon a request for legal assistance ( PERSON ) by ORG , issued a warrant to search the seat of the applicant company and ORG . Both companies have their seats at the first applicant \u2019s law office .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that in the course of pending criminal proceedings concerning , inter alia , illegal trade in medicaments against a number of persons and companies in GPE , invoices addressed to ORG , owned PERCENT by the applicant company , had been found . It therefore ordered the seizure of all business documents revealing contacts with the suspected persons and companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the search of the seat of the applicant company , which is also the first applicant \u2019s law office , was carried out by CARDINAL officers of ORG of the GPE police ( GPE ) and data - securing experts ( PERSON ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . One group of officers searched the law office for files concerning ORG or PERSON in the presence of the first applicant and a representative of ORG . All documents were shown to the first applicant and the representative of ORG before seizure .", "CARDINAL . Whenever the first applicant objected to an immediate examination of a document seized it was sealed and deposited at ORG as required by LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . All seized or sealed documents were listed in a search report which was signed by the applicant and the officers who had carried out the search .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , another group of officers examined the first applicant \u2019s computer systems and copied several files to disks . According to his statement before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the IT specialist who normally serviced the computer systems was called upon to provide some technical assistance but left again after TIME . The representative of ORG was informed about the search of the computer systems and was also temporarily present . When the officers had terminated the search of the computer systems , they left without drawing up a search report and , apparently , also without informing the first applicant about the results of the search .", "CARDINAL . DATE the police officers involved in the search of the applicants\u2019 electronic data drew up a data securing report ( ORG ) . Apart from a number of technical details concerning the first applicant \u2019s computer systems , the report states that a complete copy of the server was not made . The search was carried out using the names of the companies involved and the names of the suspects in the NORP proceedings . A folder named ORG containing CARDINAL files was found plus one further file containing one of the search items . All the data were copied to disks . In addition , the deleted items were retrieved and numerous files which corresponded to the search items were found and also copied to disks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge opened the sealed documents in the presence of the first applicant . Some documents were copied and added to the file while others were returned to the first applicant on the ground that their use would impinge on the first applicant \u2019s duty of professional secrecy .", "CARDINAL . The disks containing the secured data were transmitted to ORG who printed out all the files . Both the disks and printouts were then handed over to the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the first applicant and the applicant company lodged complaints with ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . They submitted that the first applicant was the owner and manager of the applicant company but also the lawyer for a number of companies in which the latter held shares . They complained that the search of their LOC and the seizure of electronic data had infringed the first applicant \u2019s right and duty of professional secrecy under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Rechtsanwaltsordnung ) in conjunction with LAW as some officers had proceeded unobserved to examine and subsequently copy electronic data . The applicants submitted that the data contained the same information as the documents which had been examined in the presence of the first applicant . However , with regard to the electronic data , the first applicant had not been given an opportunity to object and have the disks sealed .", "CARDINAL . They further submitted that the search report did not mention that part of the search , nor did it mention which electronic data had been copied and seized . Furthermore , the search report had only been signed by CARDINAL of the officers , but did not mention the names of all the officers who had been present at the search , omitting in particular the names of the data - securing experts of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaints .", "CARDINAL . It observed that the first applicant \u2019s computer data had been searched with the aid of particular search criteria . Files which corresponded to these search criteria had been copied to disks which had been seized .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , there was no ground for holding that this seizure circumvented LAW : the search of the first applicant \u2019s law office concerned exclusively documents which the first applicant had in his possession as an organ of ORG and PERSON , and therefore did not concern a lawyer - client relationship .", "CARDINAL . It further observed that the search of the first applicant \u2019s law office was based on a lawful search warrant which included the search and seizure of electronic data . The procedural safeguards laid down in LAW , namely the right of the person concerned to object to an immediate examination and to request the deposit of data seized with ORG and a decision by ORG , also applied to the search of electronic data .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , however , the officers had , whenever asked , complied with the first applicant \u2019s requests to seal certain documents and deposit them with ORG . Some of these documents had been returned by the court in order to ensure compliance with the applicant \u2019s duty of professional secrecy .", "CARDINAL . It therefore concluded that the applicants\u2019 complaints were unfounded . ORG decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE respectively , the first applicant and the applicant company lodged complaints with ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) . They submitted that the search and seizure of electronic data in the first applicant \u2019s office had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG held public hearings at which it heard evidence from a number of witnesses .", "The IT specialist in charge of the first applicant \u2019s computer facilities said that he had been called and had arrived at the office when the search of the LOC was already under way . He had left again after TIME . The officer in charge of the search stated that the first applicant had been informed about the search of his computer data . CARDINAL other officers stated that the search of the first applicant \u2019s computer systems had not begun until the arrival of his IT specialist and that the representative of ORG had been temporarily present . This was confirmed by the representative of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaints . It found that they concerned alleged breaches of certain provisions of LAW regulating searches . The officers who had carried out the search had possibly not fully complied with these provisions . They had , however , acted on the basis of the search warrant and not exceeded the instructions of the investigating judge . The search was therefore imputable to the court . Consequently , a review of lawfulness did not fall within the competence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) concern the search of LOC and persons and the seizure of objects .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides in particular that a search may only be carried out if there is a reasonable suspicion that a person suspected of having committed an offence is hiding on the LOC concerned , or that there are objects there the possession or examination of which is relevant to a particular criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL a search should in general only be carried out after the person concerned has been questioned , and only if the person sought has not come forward of his or her own volition or the object or objects sought have not been voluntarily produced and if the reasons leading to the search have not been eliminated . No such questioning is required where there is danger in delay .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to LAW and QUANTITY the occupant of the LOC subject to the search or , if he is unavailable , a relative of the occupant , shall be present during the search . A report is to be drawn up and to be signed by all those present .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that , if objects relevant to the investigation or subject to forfeiture or confiscation are found , they are to be listed and taken to the court for safe keeping or seized . It refers in this respect to LAW , pursuant to which objects in safe keeping have to be put into an envelope to be sealed by the court , or be labelled so as to avoid any substitution or confusion .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When searching through documents steps must be taken to ensure that their content does not become known to unauthorised persons .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the owner of the documents does not want to permit their being searched , they shall be sealed and deposited with the court ; ORG must determine immediately whether they are to be examined or returned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the courts\u2019 case - law , which is endorsed by the opinion of academic writers ( see Bertl / Vernier , PERSON , CARDINALth edition ) , the provisions relevant to the search and seizure of paper documents also apply mutatis mutandis to the search and seizure of electronic data . If the owner of disks or hard disks on which data is stored objects to their being searched , the data carriers are to be sealed and ORG must decide whether they may be examined .", "CARDINAL .
