The villagers obtained permission , from their local gendarme station , to stay in the village until the harvest , until which time they lived in shelters .

He did not recall that there had been a particular terrorist problem in ORG at that time .", "CARDINAL . The witness initially said that he did not remember receiving a complaint or hearing about ORG being burned by the security forces . He then accepted that the applicant had made this allegation to him in DATE when ORG requested him to secure the applicant 's attendance . However , since the prosecutor had already been seized of the matter , he had no power to investigate . He could not recall whether he had been to ORG after DATE .

When operations were to be carried out in an area under his station 's jurisdiction , ORG would give the co - ordinates to ORG ( PERSON ) who would inform the witness orally so that gendarmes from his station would avoid the operation area . He was not informed of the identity of the relevant military unit and did not know if the NORP Commander would have known .

NORP If military units from outside the region apprehended someone on operations , they had to surrender that person to the gendarme station in whose jurisdiction they operated . Therefore , if someone was apprehended within the jurisdiction of PERSON gendarme station , the detainee would be handed over to ORG or directly to GPE from where the person would be transferred to a public prosecutor as necessary . There was a small custody room at ORG station ( a capacity of CARDINAL people for TIME only ) . Generally , a military unit would have contact with ORG rather than with his station . He did not recall any such contact even from units he saw passing his station and no detainees were ever handed over to him . If he had had any such contact , the witness said he would have remembered it .", "CARDINAL . Gendarme custody records would indicate by whom and on whose orders the person had been taken into custody .

The witness identified the custody records for the relevant period from his station . The date noted in that record was the date and time the person had been first taken into custody .

His command was attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness knew ORG : it was attached to ORG gendarme station . ORG was QUANTITY from GPE and was CARDINAL of the CARDINAL villages in the GPE region . At the relevant time there was a terrorist threat in the entire GPE area , in all its villages and hamlets without exception . The ORG would threaten the locals to obtain what they wanted . He agreed that the security forces did not have any problem with the local population , but rather with the ORG . He could not recall the applicant or how many houses were in ORG .", "CARDINAL . He confirmed that there was a commando regiment at Bolu at the time . ORG would let him know , generally orally , that an operation was to be carried out in a particular manner and place between certain dates . They were told not to go out on mission between those dates . No details , not even the name of the military unit , would be mentioned . Any gendarme records of those military operations would be retained by ORG . He did not recall if there had been any major troop movements in ORG or indeed in his area in DATE .", "CARDINAL . When informed that it was claimed that PERSON had told the muhtar that the relevant troops were from Bolu , he stated that he did not believe that PERSON would make such a statement and suggested a direct confrontation between him and the people making such an accusation , a suggestion of confrontation he repeated during his evidence .", "CARDINAL . He did not recall a visit from the muhtar on DATE . Nor did her recall any allegation that ORG had been burned or giving permission to stay until the harvest .

He did not recall any complaint , by the applicant or anyone , about the ORG ' apprehension on DATE or any complaint of the applicant to that effect . It was DATE and it was not possible for him to remember every complaint by every person to his station : during his DATE at ORG , he spoke to an average of CARDINAL people DATE . DATE was a period of intense terrorist activity , everyone believed himself to have been wronged by the terrorists and everyone asked for help .", "CARDINAL . He did not recall ever being contacted by any prosecutor asking about the disappearance of the NORP and he denied any knowledge of any investigation despite being shown the letter of CARDINAL DATE from LOC to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He did not recall PERSON , let alone an investigation conducted by that officer , even when it was pointed out to him that PERSON had been his deputy in ORG at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . There were custody facilities in ORG . Those facilities accommodated CARDINAL persons . People who were taken into custody for any offence were first searched and were then referred to a doctor for a medical examination and report . When the medical report issued , the detainee was entered into the custody register of the custody room by the commander of the station himself . After the interrogation was completed they would be referred to the public prosecutor . A medical report for the public prosecutor would be obtained and the detainee 's valuables would be handed over to the gendarmes against a receipt . He considered his custody record to be sound . If the military apprehended someone requiring detention , they would contact ORG", "CARDINAL . He initially confirmed that a person is entered into the record when he or she is put into the custody room . On further questioning he clarified that , where there is no place in the custody room and the person is detained elsewhere in the building , the detainee will still be entered in the custody record . However , the witness had never come across such a situation during his career .", "CARDINAL . He agreed that , generally speaking , if he had heard a complaint that a village had been destroyed by security forces , he would have thought that the ORG were responsible and that the complaint was a propaganda exercise designed to blame the security forces . He cited CARDINAL example , from the innumerable similar incidents he recalled , of NORP in the GPE area which everyone knew had been burned down by the ORG in or DATE but which fire was attributed to the ORG . Was it not true that the ORG was asserting itself and its struggle ? Had the ORG not attained that goal by killing CARDINAL innocent people ? Had the ORG not intimidated the people ? The ORG , the witness asserted , had burned down CARDINAL of villages and killed CARDINAL of people .", "CARDINAL . This witness classed the applicant 's accusations as \u201c unfounded libels \u201d aimed solely at safeguarding his interests . He fixed at CARDINAL to CARDINAL the possibility of the ORG destroying a village . As to the security forces detaining citizens , killing those persons and then disposing of the bodies , the witness exclaimed that he would not even give that possibility a CARDINAL chance , as the military would never do such a thing .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . He was temporarily assigned to ORG from DATE . During that period he deputised for his superior officer , PERSON , for DATE . Otherwise he was on operations .", "CARDINAL . The witness emphasised this peripheral connection to ORG to explain his small involvement in , and limited memory of , the PERSON investigation . He identified a letter from him to ORG dated DATE : this was the sum of his memory of the ORG ' complaint . He clarified that his confirmation therein , that the ORG had not been detained by \u201c our command \u201d , included the stations attached to ORG . Most of the investigation for that letter had been completed before he came to ORG or had been done by subordinate officers while he was there . Accordingly , he had no idea of the concrete steps that had been taken during the investigation to which his letter referred . Indeed the letter he signed on CARDINAL DATE would have been written by a subordinate officer and he may not even have looked at the letter of DATE to which his own letter referred . He was unable to say who decided on what was \u201c the necessary investigation \u201d or whether some guidance would or could be sought or received from the relevant prosecutor 's office . He could not describe the further investigative measures which his letter of CARDINAL DATE promised .", "CARDINAL . The witness pointed out that an operations ' unit does not normally apprehend people . They only do so when there has been a particular incident as , for example , someone found to be carrying a firearm without a licence . Once apprehended , a suspect is handed over to the relevant ORG and that station that takes the suspect into custody .", "CARDINAL . He initially stated that one could tell from the custody records whether the gendarme or military had initially apprehended someone . However , on examining those records before the Delegates , he concluded that the custody records would not , in fact , yield such information .", "CARDINAL . He did not recall ever encountering any military units from outside the region carrying out an operation in the area during his time in GPE . He too confirmed that ORG is notified orally for security reasons of the co - ordinates of the area where a military operation would take place and asked to stay away .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to PERSON , the witness would not even accept a CARDINAL to CARDINAL possibility of a military unit being responsible for a village being burned and for persons disappearing : in his view it was simply not possible . In DATE there was a great deal of ORG activity in the GPE and ORG area and the witness had seen burned villages when out on operations in that area . He was of the view that the ORG was responsible , relying on his personal experience of CARDINAL village raids by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . He was ORG Commander at the relevant time . Since his station was attached to ORG , PERSON was his superior officer .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE central and district gendarme stations were located in the same building . Therefore there was only one custody room in that building , with a capacity of CARDINAL or QUANTITY detainees , and that facility was attached to and under the authority of the central station . Any excess detainees were detained somewhere inside FAC building but would still be entered in the custody records . Ultimate responsibility for keeping the records lay with the witness as station commander but if he was not there his CARDINAL assistants would complete the record .", "CARDINAL . The witness knew ORG by name only and had never been there . He could not recall whether there had been an operation in DATE and DATE around ORG involving units from outside the region . There had been many operations in the region and he did not remember the precise dates or areas covered . Since they were never told of the identity of the units ( only the area of operation ) , he could not specifically say whether the Bolu unit had been there . His gendarmes did not carry out joint operations with units from outside the region . Operation units were generally based outside populated areas .", "CARDINAL . He did not know where troops were based in ORG . He knew that ORG had , like every district , a boarding school . He had never heard that military units from outside the region billeted in ORG . He had never heard any allegation about the burning of NORP village on DATE by soldiers . His only recollection of the claim that the NORP had been apprehended by a military unit and disappeared was a rather vague memory of correspondence with the prosecutor 's office in GPE . The witness also confirmed that , if someone had been apprehended by a military unit on operation , it would be obliged to hand over the detainee to the gendarmes : such units do not have custody facilities or power to detain .", "CARDINAL . Persons apprehended and sent by ORG station to ORG would not have come through his hands as the latter command would have passed on the detainee to the public prosecutor unless the suspect could only be brought DATE to the prosecutor , in which case the central gendarme station would detain the suspect in its custody room until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having initially confirmed that the custody record would not indicate whether it had been the gendarme or the military who initially apprehended an individual , in cross - examination he confirmed that the latter information could be gleaned from the custody records in the \u201c reasons for arrest \u201d section . He then reverted to his initial position , adding that what is important is the reason for apprehension and not who apprehended the person . Therefore he agreed that some of the persons listed in his custody records could have been handed over to him by military units from outside the region without the custody record showing that . He also agreed that this meant that the custody record would not provide any documentary proof to an individual who later alleged that the arresting forces had ill - treated him before handing him over the gendarmes . While he suggested that a further investigation would allow the identification of the unit who had initially apprehended a person , the witness could not refer to any specific records which would assist any such investigation .", "CARDINAL . Having confirmed that he was required to fill in all the columns in a custody record , the witness accepted , when shown the records from his station for the relevant time , that no date of release had been entered for CARDINAL detainees . He accepted that it was not possible therefore to say with certainty from the custody records when those QUANTITY persons had been released . It could be possible to verify if someone had been sent to the public prosecutor by checking the investigation report completed by the gendarme , sent with an individual to the public prosecutor and retained in the public prosecutor 's records and , if someone had been released , by checking the hospital records as a detainee is medically examined on release .", "CARDINAL . The witness was ORG Commander from DATE , a station situated on the outskirts of town near ORG . Attached to his station was a central gendarme station ( which was in the same building and commanded by PERSON ) and CARDINAL outlying stations . There was CARDINAL set of custody facilities which was shared between the district and central stations and located in the central station .", "CARDINAL . He did not recall any allegations that soldiers were responsible for the burning of ORG or of the disappearance of the NORP . He did not know ORG . He did not remember ever being involved in any way in the investigation into the ORG ' alleged disappearance or any correspondence to or from ORG about any such investigation .", "CARDINAL . He confirmed that large - scale military operations were conducted , inter alia , by the Bolu regiment in the ORG , GPE and \u015e\u0131rnak districts many times in the course of DATE he served there . He could not recall any specific operation .", "CARDINAL . His command would be informed of the co - ordinates of a planned operation DATE before its execution by ORG . They would be advised not to enter the operation area . If the operation had been planned in advance , that information would have been passed on in writing on a pre - printed form called a preliminary report form ( whereas an emergency operation was notified orally only ) . A preliminary report form was not given to privates for confidentiality purposes : it would have been received by the person in charge of the information centre and brought to the witness . If alerting subordinate units was required , he would have done so by telephone .", "CARDINAL . He also confirmed that military units from outside the region were billeted at ORG and that he knew the school . The students , teachers , military units and other employees were housed in the same buildings inside the grounds of the school . There was a security check on entering the grounds of the regional boarding school . There were CARDINAL separate but almost identical buildings each with CARDINAL floors . The first building contained classrooms , the second had student dormitories , bathroom facilities and a refectory ( yemekhane ) .", "CARDINAL . The third building had been built with classrooms . He initially said that that building had been unused before the military units began to be billeted there . However , he later gave evidence that the third building had not been empty before it housed troops as its ground floor was used by school administrative staff and by students , with the second and third floor classrooms being used as dormitories by the military ( a battalion of CARDINAL people maximum ) . The third building was therefore jointly used by the military , students and teachers .", "CARDINAL . He initially testified that the sketch of the school submitted by the Government in the above - cited PERSON case represented either of the first CARDINAL buildings used by the students . He was subsequently unsure about that and then confirmed that those plans appeared to represent the shared third building .", "CARDINAL . NORP The soldiers had higher ranks so it would have been professional discourtesy to pry into what was going on in ORG . However , \u201c judicial duties \u201d were an exception to that rule . Accordingly , if a person was apprehended during an operation by a military unit ( if that unit encountered someone already suspected of an offence or someone caught committing a crime ) , that person had to be handed over to the gendarmes . A delivery record was prepared and placed on the investigation file compiled by the gendarmes and transferred to the public prosecutor . That record would include a note of where and when the detainee was originally apprehended .", "CARDINAL . It was not possible to determine from ORG custody records whether a person noted therein had been originally detained by the military or by the gendarmes unless \u2013 and it was not obligatory - a note was entered to that effect in the column entitled \u201c Comments \u201d . Therefore , the identity of the gendarme or military unit which has originally apprehended an individual could not be gleaned from the custody records as was the case , for example , for entry No . CARDINAL ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the capacity of FAC custody room was CARDINAL persons . Any detainees in excess of this number would be put in a suitable place in the central building , a guard would be posted with them and they would be entered in the custody record if they were to be detained . However , certain persons who were not free to leave ( as they were being retained pending questioning ) would not necessarily be entered in the custody record unless and until a decision had been made to detain them .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . He was ORG Commander DATE and DATE . His station was attached to , and in the same building as , ORG and PERSON was therefore his superior . The witness did not know ORG : it was not attached to his station .", "CARDINAL . He knew ORG as he had been there on several occasions . When reminded that his evidence in the above - mentioned NORP case suggested that there was only CARDINAL building , he confirmed that there were , in fact , CARDINAL large buildings .", "CARDINAL . NORP However his evidence as to the layout of each building changed many times throughout his evidence , the last version being as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first building contained the refectory ( yemekhane ) , the library and administration offices together with classrooms on the first and second floors . The second building contained only dormitories for the students .", "CARDINAL . The third had also been built as a teaching building with classrooms . He could not remember whether there was a library but confirmed that there was a refectory ( yemekhane ) on the ground floor from which soldiers could get hot meals . Students could use the canteen ( kantin ) ( or a cafeteria - kafeterya ) on the ground floor where they could buy things . Some administration offices from which teachers would work were also on the ground floor . The second and third floor classrooms were occasionally used as dormitories by the military , and could house a battalion of CARDINAL soldiers . He did not agree that it was impractical to have soldiers and students in the same house : some measures were taken but the students and soldiers were on good terms .", "CARDINAL . He was shown the sketch of the school which had been submitted by the Government in the LOC case . He initially said that those plans related to the first building , he then said he was not sure and later confirmed that , in any event , it was not the third building .", "CARDINAL . He had no authority over , or any function concerning , the military in the boarding school . No gendarmes were based there and no gendarme controls were carried out while the military were there . He agreed that it was possible that a military unit could detain someone in ORG without the gendarme knowing .", "CARDINAL . He confirmed that military units from outside the region ( including the Bolu regiment ) were on operation in his area . All gendarme officers at his level would know when an operation was taking place . They would not know all details , but would know generally from where the unit had come and where they would go on operation . Prior to such operations , military units were given a list of suspects and if suspects were apprehended during an operation , those persons could be held by the unit until it returned from operation when they would be handed over to the gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . The witness was clear in his evidence that it was not possible to determine from the custody record alone whether the detainee had been initially apprehended by gendarmes or by the military .", "CARDINAL . The witness was reminded that in the LOC case he was asked to explain why the names of certain persons , who had been noted in the GPE custody records as having been transferred from FAC , did not appear in that station 's custody records . The explanation given by him in that case was that sometimes the detention room was \u201c humid \u201d , the detainees would be kept under supervision outside the detention room and , in such circumstances , they would not be entered in the custody record . He added that persons detained for further investigation or those detained on military charges could be detained outside of the custody room without being entered in the custody records for TIME , while the relevant procedures were completed , before being handed over to the relevant prosecutor . This meant that the names of certain persons who were not free to leave the station may not have been in the custody record .", "CARDINAL . The witness was born in DATE . He succeeded PERSON as FAC in DATE , a post he held for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to giving evidence , the witness had never heard of allegations about the burning of ORG or the disappearance of the NORP . He felt it was wrong to discuss such allegations as the armed forces were there for the people and it was inconceivable that any such thing could happen .", "CARDINAL . The witness confirmed that , while he was at ORG , military units from outside the region frequently carried out operations in his area . ORG Commander ( PERSON ) would inform him orally that operations would be conducted in certain areas , giving him the map co - ordinates of those areas , only sometimes identifying the units . Many units came on operation and sometimes the unit was from Bolu .", "CARDINAL . While he could not remember a specific incident , units were not authorised to detain persons and were required to bring persons apprehended from the operation area to their unit and from there to a gendarme station .", "CARDINAL . He identified his own signature on ORG custody records from in DATE . He agreed that the custody records would not indicate who ( the military or gendarmes ) had initially detained an individual but other gendarme records containing this information would be on the prosecutor 's file . If a person was not sent to the public prosecutor , those additional records were retained in the gendarme station .", "CARDINAL . He also confirmed that persons could be at the gendarme station , not free to go and yet not be formally \u201c taken into custody \u201d and entered in the custody record ( when , for example , the investigation documentation could be completed in the space of hours ) .", "CARDINAL . He further stated that military units were frequently based at ORG in vacant rooms . Since it was a period of intense NORP activity in the region , the school was rarely empty of military personnel . Once the military were there , the school was under their jurisdiction and control .", "CARDINAL . The witness had visited the boarding school and said he could therefore guess its approximate structure .", "CARDINAL . When asked why he would therefore visit the school , he initially said that the military occasionally called his district commander when they had apprehended someone during an operation and he would be asked to go to the school for that purpose . On being asked to clarify whether a military unit would therefore take a detainee to the school first before handing them over to the gendarmes , the witness said that he would meet the military on their way to the school and he later added that the military would generally come almost as far as his station to hand over detainees .", "CARDINAL . Indeed it was \u201c impossible \u201d for a military unit to detain persons at the school . When he was informed that his predecessor in FAC ( Hasan \u00c7ak\u0131r ) had said that it was possible , the witness responded that there was no point in taking detainees to the school and he had no idea what PERSON was talking about .", "CARDINAL . The witness remembered CARDINAL main buildings together with several small staff living quarters . CARDINAL of the buildings contained classrooms , the second contained the students ' refectory ( yemekhane ) and dormitories . The military were billeted in the third building , probably in the rooms originally designed as classrooms . Some of the school 's teachers used administrative offices on the ground floor . There was also a place in the basement where teachers , students and soldiers would play table tennis together . The library was also situated in the third building , and there was probably a further refectory ( yemekhane ) for the military in that building . He later confirmed that it was a canteen ( kantin ) that was in the third building where food and even clothes could be sold to both the students and the military .", "CARDINAL . He could not say to which building the sketch of the school submitted by the Government in the LOC case related .", "CARDINAL . The witness , born in DATE , was a public prosecutor in the office of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The only recollection he had of , and only involvement in , the allegations of the burning of ORG and of the ORG ' disappearance was a statement he took from the applicant on DATE in ORG and a follow - up letter dated CARDINAL DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Given the location of ORG , the judicial investigation would have been carried out by ORG . He was not part of that investigation . He took the applicant 's statement because of the letter from ORG of DATE . He was therefore a channel through which the ORG would direct its requests to the subordinate and competent district prosecutors ' offices ( in this case , GPE ) . The reason he had interviewed the applicant personally was because he had been requested by ORG to establish the applicant 's wishes and whether the form of authority signed in favour of NORP lawyers was genuine , and , having done so , to determine what action had been taken in connection with his application . From the interview the prosecutor learned the district to which the complaint related , the scope and kind of complaint in question and what kind of documents were to be requested and from which district . Hence his letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's statement was taken with a clerk in a busy secretariat room at the ORG courthouse and not in a separate interview room . The witness followed the standard procedure for such matters : the witness put questions , the applicant answered , the witness listened and dictated to the clerk , who recorded the applicant 's evidence as the applicant listened . The witness showed the applicant the form of authority and asked the applicant whether it was his signature , and whether or not he knew what it meant . The clerk typed the applicant 's answers dictated in a loud voice by the witness ; the witness made sure that the applicant had nothing to add , read the statement to the applicant and CARDINAL persons present signed it . The applicant told his story frankly , sincerely and without compulsion and it was accurately recorded in his statement . The witness could not understand why the applicant had later changed his mind .", "CARDINAL . The witness denied having been angry and pointed out that , had he wished to protect the ORG , he would have left out the applicant 's remarks which were critical of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness , born in DATE , was CARDINAL of the CARDINAL prosecutors at ORG office ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The CARDINAL prosecutors in GPE divided the work between them . When the prosecutor dealing with the applicant 's complaint was on holiday , he reviewed the file and considered CARDINAL letters to be necessary : that of DATE ( to ORG ) because no response had been received to his office 's letter of DATE and that of CARDINAL DATE ( to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The witness had reviewed ORG file prior to giving evidence and was asked some general questions about the investigation .", "CARDINAL . He initially confirmed that a very detailed investigation had been carried out by both the military and civilian authorities . However , it was then pointed out to him that the report dated DATE noted several allegations that the NORP had been detained by the Bolu regiment and that there was no evidence of any enquiry of that regiment on the file and he was asked whether this was a satisfactory state of affairs . He responded that there was \u201c clearly a deficiency in the investigation \u201d . As to why there were CARDINAL investigation reports on file ( CARDINAL dated CARDINAL DATE signed by PERSON and CARDINAL dated DATE signed by PERSON ) , the witness pointed out that the President of ORG may have chosen , in his discretion , to re - launch the investigation with a second investigator if he found the first investigation inadequate .", "CARDINAL . He also confirmed that a visit to PERSON in Lice prison by someone not a relative would have required the competent public prosecutor 's permission .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the witness confirmed that it was a matter of discretion as to how much guidance a prosecutor would give to the gendarmes asked to conduct an investigation . Sometimes no guidance was given . He also confirmed that , as a matter of general practice , it would be normal to communicate to the complainant the prosecutor 's decision on lack of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL .
