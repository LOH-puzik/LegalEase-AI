On DATE ORG decided to release the applicant on bail . Noting that to release the applicant would run contrary to the letter of LAW of LAW , the court stated that nevertheless the continuation of the applicant 's detention could not be reasonably justified . The court stated that numerous inexcusable delays had been caused by failure of witnesses or injured parties to appear or owing to police inaction and that the applicant should not bear the consequences . The court also noted that according to a medical report the applicant 's mental health had deteriorated . In particular , he was passive , depressed and his behaviour revealed a high risk of a suicidal crisis .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant appealed against his continuing pretrial detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . The court noted that the applicant was a recidivist and that therefore the danger of his absconding and re - offending was presumed under the new wording of LAW , as in force since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

On DATE the applicant appealed against his detention . On DATE his appeal was granted and he was released . The court accepted that the applicant 's failure to appear on DATE did not disclose a danger of him absconding , taking into consideration the applicant 's explanation and his diligent behaviour in the proceedings . The court also took into account the fact that the applicant had already spent an excessively lengthy period in pre - trial detention , which ran contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the practice of ORG , LAW required that a person charged with a serious wilful offence had to be remanded in custody . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL an exception was only possible where it was clear beyond doubt that any danger of absconding or reoffending was objectively excluded since , for example , the accused was seriously ill . The detainee bore the burden to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances .", "CARDINAL .

In accordance with the amended LAW CARDINAL of LAW , accused persons may be remanded in custody only where it is established that there is a real danger of them absconding or committing an offence . For purposes of the initial decision to detain the accused person , such a danger is presumed , inter alia , where the charges concern an offence punishable by DATE imprisonment or where the accused person was a recidivist . However , this presumption does not shift the burden of proof : the authorities must verify in each case whether or not a real danger exists of the accused person absconding or re - offending . Also , for purposes of subsequent decisions to extend pre - trial detention , the persistence of a real danger of the accused person absconding or re - offending must be established ( see ORG decision no . CARDINAL of DATE of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE in case no . ORG , ORG awarded damages to the plaintiff , whose appeal against detention had been examined DATE following its submission . The court found that that excessive delay had breached LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . It further considered that damages were due despite the fact that the exact legal characterisation of the claim under LAW was unclear . In assessing the case , the court took into account the fact that the plaintiff had suffered a serious psychological trauma as a result of her continued detention and had tried to commit suicide by knocking her head against the wall .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE in case no . PERSON , ORG noted that the plaintiff 's request for release had been examined DATE following its submission , in violation of LAW . Nevertheless , the court considered that it was not possible to speculate whether or not the plaintiff 's release would have been ordered had his application been examined within the relevant time - limit . Therefore , no damages were due on account of the delay ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-4", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
