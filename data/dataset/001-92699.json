In particular , it noted that it was necessary to listen to CARDINAL recordings of the applicant \u2019s phone conversations , to perform an expert analysis of those recordings , to carry out fingerprint , physico - chemical and psychiatric expert examinations , to make these expert opinions available to the defendants and counsel and to draft a bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She repeated her arguments advanced in the previous grounds of appeal and further claimed that ORG had not explained how she could interfere with the expert examinations or obstruct the listening to the recordings .

On DATE ORG upheld the extension order on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigator applied for a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , submitting that the investigation had not been completed . It was necessary to listen to CARDINAL recordings of the applicant \u2019s phone conversations , to perform an expert analysis of those recordings and make the results available to the defendants and counsel , to find and question witnesses who might have information about the group \u2019s activities , to find one of the accomplices who had absconded , to find out whether the defendants were involved in the commission of other crimes related to drug trafficking , to bring final charges against them and to perform other investigative measures .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld the extension order on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigator applied for a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , submitting that the investigation was still pending . In particular , an expert analysis of the recordings of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations had not been completed and some of the applicant \u2019s accomplices had not been charged yet . The applicant refused to cooperate with the investigation and there was a risk that she might abscond , reoffend or put pressure on witnesses if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It noted that the applicant was charged with a particularly serious offence and that further investigation was necessary . The purpose of her detention was to ensure that the investigation was completed effectively and in good time and to eliminate any risk of her absconding , reoffending or hampering the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In her appeal submissions the applicant complained that the court \u2019s conclusions had not been based on relevant facts .

On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , referring to the gravity of the charges , the need for a further investigation and the risk of her absconding or interfering with the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In her grounds of appeal she complained , in particular , that the length of her detention had exceeded a \u201c reasonable time \u201d , contrary to QUANTITY of the Convention . She submitted that all evidence had been already collected and the investigation completed , save for certain purely administrative formalities . She further claimed that ORG conclusion that she might abscond or interfere with the investigation had been hypothetical and had not been supported by relevant facts . The court had disregarded her arguments that she had a permanent place of residence and employment , positive references , a clean criminal record and a terminally ill brother . She also complained about inhuman conditions of her detention , in particular overcrowding , insufficient number of sleeping places and poor sanitary conditions . She asked the court to apply a more lenient preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the extension order on appeal . It noted , in particular , that the maximum DATE time - limit permitted by the domestic law had not been exceeded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It noted that the defendants and their counsel were studying the voluminous case file and the investigator needed time to prepare the case for the committal before a court . It referred to the complexity of the case , the number of the defendants , the gravity of the charges against the applicant and her leadership of an organised criminal group . The applicant \u2019s arguments about her good character were insufficient to warrant release . The court found that she might reoffend , abscond , or intimidate witnesses . It also rejected the applicant \u2019s request to be released on bail of MONEY ( RUB , MONEY ( ORG ) ) , finding that there was no reason to amend the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . In her appeal submissions the applicant asked to be released . She complained that the court had not given reasons for rejecting her bail offer and offered to post higher bail if the proposed amount was insufficient . She argued that the length of her detention had exceeded a \u201c reasonable time \u201d and that the investigating authorities had failed to display \u201c special diligence \u201d in the conduct of the investigation . In particular , they had procrastinated in preparing the case for remittal before a court . She further submitted that she could no longer interfere with the investigation as it had been completed , all witnesses had been questioned and material evidence collected . Finally , she again complained of overcrowding , insufficient sleeping places and poor sanitary conditions in the detention facility and submitted that the combination of those factors to which she had been exposed for DATE had already resulted in a deterioration in her health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the detention order on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It noted that the defendants and their counsel were studying the case file and that the investigator needed time to prepare the case for committal before a court . It referred to the complexity of the case , the number of the defendants , the gravity of the charges against the applicant and her leadership of an organised criminal group . It also noted that her drug test had been positive , therefore there were reasons to believe that she might abscond , reoffend , intimidate witnesses or interfere with the proceedings in some other way .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , repeating her arguments set forth in the previous appeal submissions . She also argued that the drug test had been performed a long time ago and its results were irrelevant for the assessment of the risk of absconding , reoffending or interfering with the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the extension decision and ordered that the applicant be released on bail of RUB CARDINAL . It found that ORG had not adduced sufficient reasons to justify an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention up to DATE . In particular , it held that under domestic law the complexity of the case could only serve as a justification for up to QUANTITY months\u2019 detention and could not justify an extension of detention beyond that time - limit . ORG conclusion that the applicant might abscond , reoffend or interfere with the proceedings had not been supported by relevant facts or evidence . ORG had disregarded such pertinent facts as the applicant \u2019s positive references , permanent residence and employment and her family situation . It had failed to take into account the recent death of her brother , which mitigated the risk of her absconding as in such circumstances she naturally wished to be with her family . As the investigation had been completed and the witnesses questioned , the risk of interfering with the proceedings was also negligible . The results of the drug test were irrelevant for the assessment of the risk of reoffending , as the test had been performed immediately after the arrest , that is DATE before , and the applicant had never been medically certified as being a drug addict . ORG further referred to the applicant \u2019s frail health and \u201c her well - founded complaints about the inhuman conditions of her detention , which caused her humiliation and imperilled her health \u201d . Finally , it found fault with ORG for its failure to consider the possibility of applying a more lenient preventive measure , although the applicant had asked to be released on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant posted bail and was released . It appears that the criminal proceedings against her are still pending .", "CARDINAL .

There were no insects or rodents in the detention facility , as all the cells were disinfected DATE . It follows from the certificate of DATE from the facility administration that sanitary services cleansed the cells regularly to reduce the number of rodents and insects . The applicant claimed that there was no forced ventilation and it was stifling and smoky in the cells . It was also smelly as the windows faced a pigsty . The cells swarmed with flies , mosquitoes and lice . Inmates had to do their laundry indoors , creating excessive humidity . The ceiling was covered with fungus . Some of the inmates were suffering from tuberculosis .", "CARDINAL .

The dining table was fixed to the floor less than a metre from the toilet and the bunks were QUANTITY from it . No toilet articles or detergents were distributed . There was no running hot water in the cell but detainees were permitted to use immersion heaters .", "CARDINAL . The Government further contended that inmates were allowed to take a shower once DATE and were provided at that time with clean bedding and towels . The temperature in the shower hall was QUANTITY , while the water temperature was QUANTITY . The water temperature could be adjusted by the warders upon request . According to the applicant , inmates were allowed to take a shower once a week for TIME . The water was too hot . It took time to call a warder to adjust the temperature and then inmates had insufficient time to shower . It was so cold in the changing room in DATE that the door was covered with ice .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the ORG submitted that inmates were provided with sufficient and wholesome food . There were containers with boiled drinking water in each cell . The applicant claimed that the food was insipid and she could not bring herself to eat it . Inmates were not provided with drinking water and had to drink tap water which did not meet sanitary conditions .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had an TIME - long walk DATE . The yard measured QUANTITY m. It was covered by a roof to protect inmates from rain . The entire cell population was taken to the yard at once . The number of inmates walking in the yard simultaneously with the applicant varied CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .
