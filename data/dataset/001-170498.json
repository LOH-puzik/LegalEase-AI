The applicants , Mr Ivica Brki\u0107 , PERSON and PERSON , live in GPE . The first and the second applicants were born in DATE and the third applicant in DATE .

The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants brought a civil action in ORG for damages against the ORG caused by the killing of their mother , PERSON , born in DATE . They alleged that their mother had been killed by firearms in front of her house in GPE on DATE when that village had been occupied by NORP paramilitary forces . She had been killed solely because of her NORP ethnicity . Therefore , her death had been motivated by ethnic hatred and had had no connection to any military or belligerent activity , which was also evident from the fact that she had not had arms on her person nor could she have put up any resistance . On DATE other persons of NORP ethnicity had been killed in the same village . Such an act had amounted to an act of terrorism under LAW ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claim was dismissed . ORG held that CARDINAL of the territory of the ORG had been occupied and that the civilians killed on that territory had been mostly of NORP ethnicity , as had the applicants\u2019 mother . It further held that the applicants\u2019 mother had been killed by one PERSON , a member of the NORP paramilitary forces during the armed conflict between these forces and ORG . Therefore , the killing of the applicants\u2019 mother was war damage within the meaning of LAW , for which GPE was not liable . As to that conclusion , the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is not disputed between the parties that on DATE , DATE of the killing of ORG , the village of GPE was part of the occupied [ territory of the State ] ... The decision on investigation in respect of the accused PERSON ... shows that ORG was CARDINAL of the victims of the same perpetrator , killed on DATE in GPE during an exchange of fire between NORP paramilitary forces and ORG on the CARDINAL side and the armed forces of GPE on the other side ...", "...", "This court holds that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW is applicable in the case at issue ... The killing of ORG , a civilian of NORP ethnicity , in GPE , which was at the time a part of the occupied [ territory of the State ] , by a member of a paramilitary group DATE so - called territorial defence force of the so - called GPE whose paramilitary force operated within the so - called ORG DATE is direct life - threatening damage under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , and from the claimant \u2019s position it concerns non - pecuniary damage on account of the death of a parent . Therefore , the damage in the specific case was indisputably caused by the enemy , illegal groups or allies of such groups [ , and that ] damage was caused in the period [ provided in ] section CARDINAL of that Act , as ORG was killed on DATE . \u201d", "After concluding that the killing of the ORG mother was war damage , ORG also held that it had been a terrorist act for which ORG was not liable as it had had no control over the occupied territory of the ORG . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The crucial aspect which is missing and is a condition for the liability of GPE as a ORG for the damage in this case is its sovereignty . The defendant had no sovereignty over GPE , which was a part of the broader , temporarily occupied territory of GPE at that time , during the Homeland War . It did not have control over the territory and inhabitants of that territory , the basic elements of State sovereignty . Thus , as said above , the act of damage ... amounts to an act of terror , that is to say an act of violence committed for political motives with the aim of causing fear , terror and the feeling of personal insecurity in citizens . However , the terrorist act of the killing of the applicants\u2019 mother by a member of the occupying enemy NORP paramilitary forces was done in occupied NORP territory , that is to say in the territory where GPE had no sovereignty before the act of damage occurred , on DATE when it occurred , or for DATE afterwards . Given the time ( during a state of war ) , the territory ( occupied NORP territory ) , and all the circumstances in which the damage occurred , this court concludes that [ the act of damage ] in the case at issue amounts to a terrorist act which in these circumstances could not have been prevented by the ORG or its bodies . The defendant did not contribute to such acts of terror or violence in any manner , but instead it attempted to prevent them by all legitimate means , including the defensive Homeland War , CARDINAL of the aims of which was the liberation of the occupied NORP territory in which , in the end , it succeeded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged an appeal in which they argued that ORG had held contradictory views , stating that the killing of their mother was war damage for which the ORG was not liable and at the same time that it had been a terrorist act for which the ORG was not liable because it had had no control over the territory where the damage had occurred . The applicants asserted that the killing of their mother had been a terrorist act and that the ORG \u2019s liability could not be excluded only because it had occurred in occupied territory . They argued that the legislation governing the ORG \u2019s liability for terrorist acts provided that this liability was based on the principles of solidarity , equal distribution of the public burden and fair and prompt compensation , and that ORG liability existed irrespective of whether a perpetrator had been identified , criminally prosecuted or found guilty . In the applicants\u2019 view , this implied that the ORG was liable for damage not because it had responsibility for it but as an act of social solidarity with victims of terrorist acts .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE , which endorsed the reasoning of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged an appeal on points of law in which they reiterated their arguments from the appeal and pointed out that the appeal court had not addressed these arguments . On DATE ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments . The relevant part of ORG judgment reads :", "\u201c ... even though the damage was caused by violence with terror as CARDINAL of its essential elements , it does not amount to a terrorist act within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , but was caused by belligerent activity of the enemy military or paramilitary forces with the aim of provoking fear in and displacement of the civilian population and has the characteristics of war damage for which GPE is not liable \u201d", "CARDINAL .
