On DATE was placed in public care by an emergency order issued pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag DATE ) .

CARDINAL witnesses were examined at ORG request ( i.e. the Acting Director of the reception centre and a psychologist who had examined ORG both in the presence and in the absence of the applicant ) and CARDINAL witnesses proposed by ORG of its own motion ( i.e. A. \u2019s teacher , his school counsellor and his personal assistant in the reception centre ) . Counsel for the applicant did not propose any witnesses .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed on DATE , ORG having found , inter alia , that ORG \u2019s public care had been justified in order to carry out a complete assessment of his conditions and the extent of psychological assistance required to treat his behavioural disturbance . Although such an investigation would have been possible as an open - care assistance measure , the applicant had refused to co - operate with the social authorities both in that respect and more generally . The applicant \u2019s further appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to terminate PERSON \u2019s public care and pay her damages . Her request for termination of the public care was allegedly never examined by ORG , as one of its senior officials considered that the applicant had not adduced any fresh information regarding her conditions .", "During a visit to GPE on DATE was apprehended by customs officials and placed in a children \u2019s home . At meetings with social welfare officials in DATE the applicant and PERSON opposed the latter \u2019s intended transfer to a children \u2019s home in PERSON , where he was placed by decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "According to the Government , the facts of the case are as follows .", "The first report concerning PERSON had been drawn up already in DATE . A. \u2019s situation had been closely followed in GPE by the PERSON social authorities due to the applicant \u2019s mental problems and difficulties in assuming PERSON \u2019s upbringing . In DATE the applicant had requested that A. be placed in a children \u2019s home but without wishing to discuss the reasons therefor . The authorities had located a place for A. but the applicant had refused to accept it . Neither had she accepted DATE - care for A. The applicant had failed to attend the meetings agreed on and had failed to be available for home visits .

In DATE the social authorities had made an appointment for A. at a child psychiatric clinic , but the applicant had refused to take him there . Nor had she accepted any open - care assistance . During a home visit in DATE the social worker had noticed that their CARDINAL - room flat had contained only a double - bed and CARDINAL chair with a small table for A. \u2019s homework . In DATE his situation had worsened considerably : he had repeatedly behaved in an aggressive manner towards other pupils . The applicant had failed to attend a meeting with the school psychologist to discuss A. \u2019s disruptive behaviour . The applicant having told the social authorities that she would take GPE to GPE if they were not left alone , PERSON had been placed in emergency care . Social welfare officials had visited the applicant DATE to inform her about the order . It had not been possible to inform her of the care intention at the meeting with the school psychologist on DATE because she had failed to attend that meeting .", "On DATE A. \u2019s emergency care had been extended until DATE . Assistance in open care had remained impossible because the applicant had rejected all help . In DATE had been examined by psychologist PERSON , who had concluded that he was in need of a living environment with clear and safe limits and needed to learn and find ways to solve conflict situations .", "On DATE the applicant had taken A. out of the reception centre and had apparently sent him to GPE alone . The applicant had refused to co - operate with the social welfare authorities and had not revealed PERSON \u2019s whereabouts and conditions . On DATE she had requested termination of ORG \u2019s public care . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE \u2013 which had been communicated to the applicant \u2013 the Board had noted that the normal care order had been finally upheld DATE . ORG had decided to take no measures until the applicant had provided information on A. \u2019s whereabouts and her own conditions , thereby enabling ORG to examine her requests in accordance with the law . To that end , she had been invited to forward any opinions prepared by the NORP child welfare , school and health authorities , on the basis of which the NORP authorities would contact them to establish A. \u2019s conditions and decide on his future care .", "On DATE had been apprehended by NORP customs officials and placed in a child welfare institution .

The applicant had maintained that there was no need for public care and had refused to inform the authorities of her place of residence . On DATE had been placed in a family home specialised in the foster care of LANGUAGE - speaking children . The applicant , represented by counsel , had objected to ORG \u2019s continued public care and had challenged the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE before ORG and ORG which had rejected her appeals on DATE and DATE respectively .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had again requested termination of ORG \u2019s public care . The social authorities had asked ORG \u2019s foster parents and the headmaster of his school to give their written opinions . On DATE ORG had decided to maintain the public care and the applicant had not appealed . ORG had recalled that ORG \u2019s public care had been justified in view of the applicant \u2019s difficulties in assuming his upbringing . At no stage had she accepted that A. needed psycho - social examinations and care . Nor had she recognised her own difficulties for which she would need psychiatric help before being able to look after A.", "The relevant legislation is outlined in the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and GPE ( [ ORG ] , no .
