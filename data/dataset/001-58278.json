At the material time , the first applicant , Mr PERSON was the major shareholder in ORG ve PERSON , a NORP company which owns a DATE review entitled Haberde Yorumda Ger\u00e7ek ( ORG and Comments ) , published in GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON was the editor - in - chief of the review .", "CARDINAL . In the CARDINAL DATE and DATE issues of the review , an interview with a leader of ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) , an illegal organisation , was published in CARDINAL parts . In the edition of CARDINAL DATE a joint declaration by CARDINAL socialist organisations was published .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of these publications read as follows ( translation ) :", "\u201c Q : What do you mean when you say [ the elections present ] dangers ?", "A : NORP The GPE say : \u2018 The NORP are oppressed . PERSON is slaughtering them . We are protecting the NORP against PERSON \u2019s massacres . Their survival is in our safekeeping.\u2019 But it is quite obvious that this is a big swindle . If they were really protecting the NORP against massacre as they claim , they ought to be protecting them against ORG , too . Since the massacre which ORG is carrying out against our people in the GPE is as horrible as that of PERSON . In fact , there are practices which are much more extreme than those of PERSON . So the GPE ought to be doing the same thing against GPE . The double standard is clear for all to see . The GPE take action against PERSON , but support GPE \u2019s massacres against the NORP people in both the LOC and the LOC . There have been many signs of this and our people are aware of it . They want to make the NORP an instrument for gaining their own ends . Their aim in the elections is both to contain the positive developments in the LOC through the organisations they want to promote and to block the fight for independence and freedom which is developing in GPE in general . They want to bring all the NORP movements under the control of those CARDINAL organisations already controlled by them [ the GPE ] . So that is why they all present a danger for the NORP people .", "Q : Laws will be enacted once a parliament has been established in LOC . Treaties will be signed , on the one hand with neighbours , i.e. GPE and GPE , and , on the other hand , with the GPE . GPE can have only one demand from these countries , that the ORG be excluded . If NORP parties take part in such an environment , what would be the ORG \u2019s attitude ?", "A : It is a well - known fact that GPE and/or imperialism wants to divert our people from its national identity and struggle . But we want to achieve our identity as a nation and have a fatherland . That is what we are fighting for . They want to uproot us and drive us out of our territory ; they want to annihilate us or force us to change . But we fight to live in freedom in our own territory . If either the GPE or GPE or any other power which claims to be acting in the name of NORP identity attempts to force us out of any part of our country , we will fight in order to stay where we are . That is what we are fighting for right now . ORG wants to oust us from our territory . It is driving people out of their villages . It wants GPE to become a totally uninhabited area . But we are resisting . No one can tell us or ask us to get out . We are not on anyone else \u2019s territory ; we are on our own territory . No one can tell us to leave our own territory . We make no distinction between the LOC and the LOC ; we are in GPE . We are amongst our own people . If they want us to leave our territory , they must know that we will never agree to it . We are a people who have lost everything we had and who are fighting to regain what we have lost . That is the purpose of our action . We have nothing to lose . We shrink from nobody and are afraid of no one . All we can lose is our slavery . That is why we act without fear .", "Q : It is said that broadcasting programmes in NORP on NORP State television would be interpreted as making a concession to the ORG . Could that be true ? It is also rumoured that the ORG is going to set up a TV station . Is that right ?", "A : It is not true that the ORG is going to broadcast on television . We have no such facilities . Television broadcasting either by satellite or through any other channel is not an issue for the ORG . It was PERSON who brought up the issue of NORP TV in GPE when he went to the GPE . That is what is being debated . A very small fraction of people say that GPE was right , but a very large proportion are against it . Those who are suggesting NORP TV are doing so deliberately . The aim is supposedly to influence and win over the masses and thus to isolate the ORG . That is what the idea is . But even if NORP TV became a reality , it would do them no service . That is why they are against it . The purpose of those who want to create NORP TV is to isolate the ORG . For there is no mention of any argument such as \u2018 Here is a people who have their own language and we must broadcast in their language . There is need for respect for that people . It is wrong to ban a people \u2019s language , that also harms ORG Far from it . The debate has revealed the real intentions : \u2018 How can we wipe out the influence of the ORG ? How can we isolate the ORG ? How can we pull the wool over the NORP people \u2019s eyes?\u2019 It is a tactical approach . It is a trick . But no matter what steps they take , they will be working to the advantage of the ORG . ORG has now lost GPE . That is a fact . Any move the ORG makes in GPE after this will turn out to the advantage of the ORG and to the disadvantage of ORG ... .The NORP press has no principles . We consider that there is no longer any point in communicating with that unethical press . We shall not be satisfied with abstaining from any contact with the press ; we shall endeavour to stop the press from entering GPE .", "Q : A different tactic was applied in the Uludere attack . Previously , attacks were always carried out at TIME . But this time , the attack was carried out during DATE and the clashes continued throughout DATE . It is said that this entails more risk for the guerrillas . What was the reason for it ?", "A : What they say is right . Our combat has reached a certain level . Tactics have to be developed which match that level , because it is a mistake to wage war with less developed tactics . Progress can be achieved in the war by using tactics in keeping with the level of warfare which has now been reached . That is why an action of that nature was planned . The idea was to attack in TIME and hold our ground , continuing the clashes throughout DATE and it was successful in the end . It was an experiment . From our point of view there are conclusions to be drawn from it . We are studying the matter . We shall benefit from that in the actions we carry out in the future . \u201d", "\u201c Q : What do you think about the assassinations by unknown perpetrators in GPE and the actions ascribed to the \u2018 LOC ?", "A : It is true that there is an organisation known as ORG . But it is a weak organisation . It is not that organisation which is carrying out the massacres , contrary to what is being said . Since the organisation is weak , GPE has captured its members in many places . Many massacres are carried out in the name of that organisation , but it is actually ORG itself which is doing the killings . We say this to the members of ORG : \u2018 If you are really NORP , [ you should know that ] the NORP faith is against repression and injustice and advocates what is right and PERSON It is a well - known fact that ORG is repressive and carries out massacres and inhuman actions . They [ the ORG ] must respect those who oppose these acts . If they want to wage war , they must join forces with them . That is what we are asking of them . We warn them as friends that they must throw out the contra - guerrillas who infiltrate their ranks . For unless they do that , they will come to grief . We have not , as yet , reacted more seriously , we have just warned them . We say that that phenomenon has served ORG and we have received a favourable response from DATE . They have said that ORG people or NORP have not in fact been involved in that sort of action and that the acts have not been carried out by ORG people . That is favourable as far as we are concerned . But it [ the ORG ] is still carrying out massacres in some places in ORG \u2019s name ...", "Q : On what lines will the struggle be carried out from now on ?", "A : NORP The climate does affect a war , although the effects are not decisive . The DATE was very hard and that affected our movements , the capacity for combat and caused several difficulties DATE both for us and for ORG . But they have the advantage of using technology and they used that advantage to the full . To no avail , however . They intended to deal us murderous blows DATE . They thought they would have overthrown us and ousted us by DATE . But they did not achieve what they wanted . Our capacity for movement was reduced by the hard DATE conditions and , as a result , steps could only be taken late as compared to DATE . The DATE is gradually becoming more suitable , however . There is still snow on the ground in many places , but it is presenting less and less of an obstacle . DATE will be more different compared to other DATE , but we never say : \u2018 Let us improve our armed combat , let us expand it further.\u2019 If we continue the war , we do so because we have to . Because there is no possibility of achieving a different life and developing . All roads have been blocked for us . We are waging war because we are forced to . Any further expansion of the war will depend on the attitude of ORG . The ORG is intensifying the war . So we have to extend the war to that degree . The war will escalate . Before the ORG , there was a CARDINAL - sided war being waged in GPE . In DATE that war has begun to be a CARDINAL - sided war . In DATE , ORG used to achieve whatever ends it intended to achieve in the war it was waging , and the NORP people was being rapidly wiped out as a result . But the NORP people have begun to say \u2018 Stop!\u2019 . They began to resist in order to avoid annihilation . It was the ORG which started the war and the ending of the war will also depend on ORG . We did not start the war . We developed a defensive war against the war of annihilation that was being waged on us . This war will continue as long as ORG refuses to accept the will of the people of GPE : there will be not CARDINAL single step backwards . The war will go on until there is CARDINAL single individual left on our side . \u2026", "The ORG colonialist authority has completely disappeared in some places \u2026 As the government of war we want the people \u2019s will , which makes itself increasingly known , to be able to express itself officially . We shall make our way towards that objective CARDINAL step at a time . We shall reach it by destroying or weakening the sovereignty of the ORG different ways and in various forms , by setting up a popular regime in certain places and favouring a dualistic regime in others . That is what we call the power of the people , the government of war . \u2026", "The ORG encounters all kinds of problems and resolves them . No questions are put to ORG . No one speaks to it . Everyone speaks to ORG or the local ERNK official . The ORG is considered competent . For the moment , we are in the process of electing the representatives of the people . \u201d", "\u201c ORG of GPE ( TDKP ) , ORG of GPE ( TKEP ) , ORG for the Liberation of Northern Kurdistan ( TKKK\u00d6 ) and ORG of GPE ( TKP / ML Hareketi ) have called on all revolutionaries and NORP to unite forces .", "\u2018 Let us unite against ORG terrorism , against the repression and oppression of the NORP people , against the massacres , the street killings , the dismissals and unemployment ; let us unite and step up our efforts for freedom , democracy and socialism!\u2019 Such is the heading of the appeal in which it is stated that the only means of action for the ruling classes is that of force and violence . And the \u2018 democratisation\u2019 initiatives of the ORG and ORG government are described as a manoeuvre , purely a means of concealing their attacks . \u201d", "The appeal goes on to state the following views :", "\u201c Workers , labourers and young people of the NORP and NORP nation !", "It is possible and perfectly feasible for us to drive back the attacks levelled on us by imperialism and the collaborating ruling classes and to obtain our economic and political rights and freedoms . To do so we must rally our forces around our common demands and join battle .

On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ordered the seizure of all copies of the CARDINAL DATE issue of the review , since it allegedly contained a declaration by terrorist organisations and disseminated separatist propaganda .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an indictment dated DATE ORG at ORG charged the applicants with having disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the ORG by publishing an interview with a ORG leader and a declaration made by CARDINAL terrorist organisations . The charges were brought under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the criminal proceedings were joined in view of the fact that the incriminated articles were considered to constitute a single interview published in CARDINAL parts .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the applicants denied the charges . They pleaded that the interview had been published with the aim of providing the public with information within the scope of journalism and the freedom of the press . As regards his freedom of expression , the first applicant referred to the LAW and the case - law of the ORG and the ORG . He stated that pluralism of opinion was essential in a NORP society including opinions which shock or offend . He argued that the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act restricted freedom of expression in contravention of LAW and the criteria laid down in the case - law of the Commission and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE ORG found the applicants guilty of offences under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act .

The second applicant was sentenced under section CARDINAL to a fine of MONEY and under section CARDINAL to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a further fine of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , the court held that the interview with the ORG leader was published in the form of a news commentary . It further held that the interviewee had referred to a certain part of NORP territory as \u201c GPE \u201d , had asserted that certain NORP citizens who are of NORP origin form a separate society and that GPE expels NORP people from their villages and massacres them . The court further considered that the interviewee had praised NORP terrorist activities and had claimed that the NORP should form a separate ORG . On these grounds , the court found that the interview , as a whole , disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the ORG . The court further held that another page of the review contained a declaration by terrorist organisations and its publication constituted a separate offence under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against their conviction . In addition to the defence which they invoked before ORG , their legal representative emphasised that in a democratic society opinions must be freely expressed and debated .
