RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "The applicant has been the leader of the public movement ORG ( \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437 \u2013 Russkiy obshchenatsionalniy soyuz ) since its inception in DATE .", "On DATE ORG registered the movement as a public association .", "On DATE , at the sixth general assembly of the movement , members decided to reorganise the movement into a political party bearing the same name . An application for the party \u2019s registration was lodged with ORG .", "By a letter of DATE , ORG refused the application on a number of grounds . The first ground for the refusal was that the adjective \u201c NORP \u201d ( \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 DATE russkiy ) in the name of the party referred to an ethnic group , whereas section GPE of LAW prohibited the establishment of political parties based on professional , racial , ethnic or religious affiliations . The applicant contested that particular ground for the refusal before a court of general jurisdiction .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint after hearing evidence from several experts called by the defence . The experts concurred that the meaning of the word russkiy was ambiguous , since it could be understood either as denoting anything related to GPE DATE and in this sense its meaning was closer to the word rossiyskiy ( \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 ) DATE or as referring to CARDINAL particular ethnic group , the NORP . A representative of ORG submitted to the court that the word \u201c all - nation \u201d ( \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u2013 obshchenatsionalniy ) in the name of the applicant \u2019s party also had CARDINAL meanings , the first being \u201c an association of people belonging to different nations \u201d and the second \u201c an association of the people of CARDINAL nation \u201d . However , since it was preceded by the word russkiy , these CARDINAL adjectives had to be read together and understood as \u201c an association of the nation of [ ethnic ] NORP \u201d . ORG accepted that interpretation , which was not disputed by the applicant , and found that the applicant \u2019s party was founded on the basis of ethnic affiliation . This amounted to a breach of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , even though the party \u2019s articles of association and programme did not indicate protection of the interests of NORP as its main objective .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , endorsing the reasoning of ORG .", "The applicant challenged section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW before ORG , alleging that it was incompatible with LAW . ORG joined his complaint with those of ORG of GPE and PERSON .", "On DATE ORG issued Ruling no . CARDINAL-P. It noted at the outset the special role of political parties as the only form of public association vested with the right to nominate candidates in elections to ORG bodies . According to LAW , membership of political parties is individual and voluntary and may not be restricted on account of professional , social , racial , ethnic or religious affiliation , gender , social origin , property or place of residence . The court concluded that the right of individuals of any ethnicity or religion to become members of a party whose objectives and goals they shared could not be restricted . It further found as follows .", "\u201c The principles of pluralist democracy , a multi - party system and a secular ORG that form the constitutional basis of GPE \u2013 in so far as they apply to legal regulation of the establishment and functioning of political parties , including conditions for their registration \u2013 may not be interpreted or implemented without regard to the particular features of GPE \u2019s historic development , the ethnic and religious structure of NORP society and the specific character of interaction between the ORG , political power , ethnic groups and religious denominations .", "... The principle of a secular ORG can not be applied in GPE in the same way as in those countries that have a single - faith and single - nation social structure and boast a well - developed tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism . In particular , some of those countries have permitted the establishment of political parties based on NORP democratic ideology ; in these cases the term \u2018 ORG has moved beyond denominational confines and designates affinity with the NORP system of values and culture .", "In multinational and multi - denominational GPE , owing to the specific modus operandi of leading faiths ... , their influence on public life and their invocation in political rhetoric ( which has historically been linked to the ethnic question ) , public consciousness is more likely to identify the terms \u2018 ORG , \u2018 Orthodox\u2019 , \u2018 Muslim\u2019 , \u2018 Russian\u2019 , \u2018 Tartar\u2019 , etc . with specific denominations or ethnic groups , rather than with a system of values common to the NORP [ rossiyskiy ] people in its entirety .", "Furthermore , contemporary NORP society , including political parties and religious associations , has not yet acquired substantial experience of democratic coexistence . In these circumstances , parties based on ethnic or religious affiliation would inevitably strive to assert principally the rights of their respective ethnic and religious communities . Competition among parties based on ethnic or religious affiliation ... could lead to stratification of the multinational people of GPE instead of the consolidation of society , to the opposition of ethnic and religious values , exaltation of some and belittlement of others and , ultimately , to attributing predominant importance not to those values which are common to the entire nation but to those restricted to CARDINAL ethnic ideology or religion , a result which would be contrary to LAW ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "The establishment of parties based on religious affiliation would open the door to the politicisation of religion and religious associations , political fundamentalism and the clericalisation of parties ... The establishment of parties based on ethnic affiliation could lead to a situation where representatives of parties advocating the interests of large ethnic groups DATE to the detriment of those of small ethnic groups DATE would predominate in elected governing bodies ; a situation which would violate the principle of equal rights irrespective of ethnic origin , established in GPE ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Thus , the constitutional principle of a democratic and secular ORG , as applied in the particular social and historic context existing in GPE as a multinational and multi - denominational country , does not allow political parties to be established on the basis of ethnic or religious affiliation .", "For those reasons , in the face of unrelenting inter - ethnic and interdenominational tension and the ever - growing political demands of DATE religious fundamentalism , when any religion - based distinction , once brought into the sphere of politics ( and therefore , into the struggle for power ) , may acquire an ethnic dimension and lead to a division of society along ethnic and religious lines ( a division , in particular , into NORP and PERSON elements ) , the introduction into LAW of a ban on the establishment of political parties based on ethnic or religious affiliation is compatible with the authentic meaning of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW read together with Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL ... \u201d", "Finally , ORG noted that it was not competent to determine whether in a particular case a party had been established on the basis of national or religious affiliation and whether a party \u2019s name reflected its aims , namely the promotion of ethnic or religious interests , these matters coming within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts .", "The LAW guarantees plurality of ideologies and political parties and prohibits the activity of public associations which incite social , racial , ethnic or religious discord ( LAW . Article CARDINAL guarantees the secularity of GPE and equality of religions . Article CARDINAL establishes the principle of equality before the courts and the law . Article CARDINAL guarantees the right to freedom of conscience and religion .
