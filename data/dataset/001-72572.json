FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) and Mr JeanFran\u00e7ois Fillon ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in ORG and the second applicant in ORG , in the d\u00e9partement of ORG . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , who was succeeded as Agent by PERSON , ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants both run farms rearing pigs for meat production . This type of farm is subject to the legislation on establishments classified for the purposes of environmental protection ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "The applicants\u2019 farms were inspected by the veterinary services department of PERSON , as a result of which criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicants .", "The first applicant was convicted of running the farm without giving prior notice , while the second applicant was convicted of running his farm without obtaining prior authorisation from the prefect .", "The first applicant , Mr GPE , co - manages with his wife a limited liability farm company by the name of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant acquired a farm situated QUANTITY from his place of residence ( ORG ) , in the neighbouring municipality of ORG .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s wife informed the veterinary services department that she and the applicant had purchased the farm and planned to construct a building for raising pigs on deep straw bedding , designed to accommodate CARDINAL meatproducing pigs . The letter also informed the department that notice to that effect would be given by DATE .", "On DATE the inspector of establishments classified for the purposes of environmental protection carried out an inspection of the piggery . The applicant arrived in the late morning while the inspection was in progress .", "In a report drawn up DATE , the inspector noted that there were around CARDINAL fattening pigs on the farm . As an establishment housing QUANTITY pigs , the farm fell into the category of classified establishments in respect of which notice had to be given to the prefecture ( heading DATE ) . The inspector \u2019s report stated that the applicant , who had arrived on the farm during the inspection , had been unable to provide a document from the prefecture of ORG acknowledging receipt of the required notice .", "On DATE the applicant was interviewed by officers at ORG gendarmerie station . He referred to the letter of CARDINAL DATE stating his intention to give notice by DATE .", "On DATE the public prosecutor at the ORG tribunal de grande instance summoned the applicant to appear before ORG on a charge of operating a classified establishment without giving prior notice . The establishment in question housed CARDINAL fattening pigs , so that it came under heading DATE of the classification and was subject to notice . At the outset of the trial the applicant objected that the proceedings were void because a senior police officer ( officier de police judiciaire ) had entered his home unlawfully for the purposes of LAW , the inspector \u2019s visit having taken place in the farmer \u2019s absence and without his express consent . He further objected that the inspector \u2019s report was invalid , as it had not mentioned his status as a senior police officer or provided accurate details as to the number and weight of the pigs .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the objection , finding as follows :", "\u201c Unless it were to be argued that the defendant had made his home in the piggery , which was hardly the case , the building housing the pigs can not be considered to satisfy the criteria for a \u2018 home\u2019 .", "Accordingly , it must be held that the inspector did not conduct a search or enter the applicant \u2019s home unlawfully . Nor is it necessary to respond to the unfounded assertion that inspectors of establishments classified for the purposes of environmental protection have the status of senior police officers , which they patently do not .", "The inspector merely made use of his powers to inspect at any time the establishments for which he is responsible under LAW no . CARDINAL , without his being bound by the rules governing searches . \u201d", "On the merits , the court found the applicant guilty of operating a classified establishment without giving prior notice , and sentenced him to payment of a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) , equivalent to CARDINAL ( ORG ) .", "The applicant appealed .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled as follows on the objection that the proceedings were void as there had been a violation of LAW .", "\u201c The concepts of \u2018 private life\u2019 and \u2018 home\u2019 remain confined to the personal sphere , although they may in certain circumstances encompass professional and commercial activities .", "The visit by the inspector of classified establishments was conducted in accordance with the provisions of LAW of DATE ... in a piggery used solely for agricultural purposes which was a potential source of harm to the environment , and in no sense in a \u2018 home\u2019 within the meaning of LAW . The first objection should therefore be dismissed .", "Furthermore , reports by inspectors of classified establishments are generally drawn up during the inspection , which constitutes an administrative measure . The provisions of LAW do not therefore apply . In any event , the inspectors\u2019 powers derive from LAW of DATE , which confers specific powers derogating from ordinary police procedure . LAW states that inspectors \u2018 may inspect the establishments under their supervision at any time\u2019 . The intention of the law in this respect is to allow the prefecture to ensure that classified establishments which , by definition , are a potential source of harm or nuisance to the community , are being operated in accordance with the relevant legislation or rules . Applying the provisions of LAW to the supervision of these establishments would deprive the measures laid down by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE of any effect . \u201d", "ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction at first instance but , noting that the situation had been regularised in the meantime , reduced the fine to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "In a judgment of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant , finding that the appellate court had given reasons for its decision , notably in the following terms :", "\u201c ... inspections of establishments under their supervision , carried out under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON of DATE by the inspectors of classified establishments , do not constitute general searches or house searches within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "The second applicant , Mr Fillon , runs a farm . In DATE he built a unit on the farm to house pigs for breeding and fattening .", "The ground plan supplied by the applicant shows that the farm comprises a collection of several farm buildings and also his house , which is set back from the buildings housing the pigs .", "On DATE the veterinary services inspector conducted an inspection of the farm , in the presence of the applicant , and produced a report noting the presence of CARDINAL boar , CARDINAL sows and around QUANTITY meatproducing pigs . The report stated that the farm had over QUANTITY pigs , so that it came under heading CARDINAL of the classification of establishments subject to authorisation by the prefecture . In his report , the inspector noted that the applicant had been unable to produce an authorisation decision from the prefecture of PERSON , as he had not submitted the relevant application .", "On DATE the applicant was interviewed by officers at ORG gendarmerie station . He told them that he had increased the capacity of the farm out of financial necessity .", "The public prosecutor at the ORG tribunal de grande instance summoned the applicant to appear before ORG on a charge of operating a classified establishment , consisting of a pig farm with CARDINAL animals , without prior authorisation from the prefect ( heading DATE ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG set aside the report and the subsequent proceedings , finding :", "\u201c ... under LAW of the PERSON of DATE , these inspectors may inspect the establishments under their supervision at any time .", "However , although these provisions allow them to derogate from TIME laid down for house searches by LAW , they do not exempt them from the requirement set forth in LAW to obtain , in the case of a preliminary investigation , the prior express consent of the person concerned .", "It should be noted in this connection that a farm constitutes a \u2018 home\u2019 .", "It should further be noted that the inspection of Mr ORG \u2019s farm was carried out in order to ascertain the situation vis - \u00e0 - vis the receipt for notice in respect of CARDINAL sows .", "Hence , the provisions of LAW should have been complied with , and the infringement of those provisions renders the report and , consequently , the subsequent proceedings and prosecution invalid . \u201d", "The prosecution appealed .", "The applicant argued before ORG that the right to respect for his home guaranteed by LAW applied to business LOC . He maintained that the interference with his property by the inspector constituted a violation of LAW .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside the judgment , finding :", "\u201c However , while LAW provides that everyone shall have the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence and that a public authority may interfere with that right only under certain very stringent conditions , it is none the less true that the concepts of \u2018 private life\u2019 and \u2018 home\u2019 remain confined to the personal sphere , although they may in certain circumstances encompass professional and commercial activities .", "In the present case , PERSON inspection was conducted ... in a piggery put to exclusively agricultural use ... [ and ] , given that PERSON simply counted the animals , in no sense in the home of ORG , whose residence and administrative premises are separate from the piggery .", "The report by the inspector of classified establishments is generally drawn up during the inspection , which constitutes an administrative measure .", "Consequently , the provisions of LAW do not apply . \u201d", "With regard to the merits , ORG found the applicant guilty of not applying for authorisation as required by the rules governing his farm , and sentenced him to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . An announcement of the conviction would be published in CARDINAL local newspapers and posted at the entrance to the farm .", "On DATE ORG delivered a judgment , served on the applicant on DATE , dismissing an appeal by the applicant and finding :", "\u201c ... inspections of establishments under their supervision , carried out under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON of DATE by the inspectors of classified establishments , do not constitute general searches or house searches within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "This PERSON governed all establishments which were a potential source of significant harm or nuisance to the surrounding area and the environment ( section CARDINAL ) .
