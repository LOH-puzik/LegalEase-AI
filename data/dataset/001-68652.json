He is a lawyer and a former member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wrote a novel entitled \u201c The Heat of \u015eiro \u201d ( \u015eiro'nun Ate\u015fi ) . The book was based on real events which took place in Ormani\u00e7i village in the province of PERSON . The book was published in DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG requested the seizure of copies of the book . The public prosecutor contended that the content of the book incited hatred and hostility by making distinctions between NORP citizens based on grounds of their ethnic or regional identity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG accepted the submissions of the public prosecutor and made an interim order for the seizure of copies of the first edition of the book . In its decision ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the book , by attributing extremely disgusting acts to the security forces , identified with names and rank , incited people to hatred and hostility by making distinctions between NORP citizens based on grounds of their ethnic or regional identity . The court further held that , while artistic expression fell within freedom of expression , that freedom was not absolute and that the dissemination of distasteful and disgusting texts by way of a novel could not be considered to be artistic expression .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , copies were then seized . However , the seizure protocol drafted by the police and signed by the owner of the publishing company on DATE recorded that copies of the book were not found .", "CARDINAL . The Government in their observations drew attention to following passages on pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the book :", "\u201c ... Ah , I wish I were strong like before so that I could catch ORG in the meadow of ORG . Then he would have understood what the world is like . I would have stripped him under the DATE sun ; I would have had him walk before GPE and whipped him DATE .", "- Then how would you be any different from those tyrants ? No matter who does it , cruelty is an ugly thing . Whether it is you or the fox . It does not matter . Cruelty is such a dishonourable thing that , whoever does it , is not a human being .", "- I swear that I would turn him inside out . If I had only caught him then he would have understood . I swear upon your head that I would have put a rope around his neck and walked him naked all around GPE , then I would have skinned him and filled him up with salt , as an example to all tyrants .", "- Then you , PERSON , would become LOC PERSON . Our Mizrak or somebody else 's Mizrak , what difference does it make ? People like Mizrak should not exist in GPE , GPE , GPE or anywhere else . These kind of people contaminate the world . They destroy love and brotherhood .", "- I beg you Brother , why do you talk like this ? There is no other way to fight these tyrants ! You have to talk to them in their own language ; there is no other way !", "- I used to think just like you , ORG . However , I went there and realised that LOC is not alone .", "- See , you have to make all of them disappear ; you have to kill all of them .", "- You can not terminate it by killing them . There are too many to kill . Whomsoever you want to kill is only the cog of the machine . Even if you break the cog of the machine there are too many degenerated people out there waiting to become the cog ! When you are struggling with the first ones , the same old tyrannising machinery continues to function , and this goes on forever . We have to stop this machinery ! That is what we should do . There is no other way . Then you would see how they are running away like cows .", "- Where is that power ?", "- Is there anyone stronger then us , PERSON ? When all human beings stand up against this tyrannising machine , see if the machine still continues to function ? Then they would see whether it is them or us who are stronger . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the seizure order . The applicant averred that the seizure order constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by ORG . However he gave an incorrect case number on his appeal . As a result it appears that the appeal court did not consider the facts of his case , but that of another ( relating to a poetry book ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and upheld the order , together with the single judge 's reasons for issuing it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor attached to ORG filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and requested that he be convicted and sentenced under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL .
