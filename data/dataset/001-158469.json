Soon afterwards CARDINAL police officers GPE and PERSON arrived and at TIME took the ORG son to the police station in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the police officers , ORG was under the influence of alcohol . However , his state did not qualify him to be taken to the soberingup centre . They did not make him undergo a breath test . They were not sure with what offence he could be charged , if any , and therefore they ordered him to appear at the police station at TIME and let him go . It was TIME and the temperature outside was below zero centigrade .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the ORG son telephoned his sister FAC He requested her to come with her car and collect him from a bus station in PERSON . When she got there she telephoned her brother who then asked her to come to GPE , QUANTITY away . According to ORG statement her brother sounded frightened on the phone . While she was driving to ORG called again and told her to go back home because he would manage to come back by himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the second applicant called her son . She asked him whether he was on the campus and he apparently confirmed . She asked him some more questions but he did not reply although the telephone call was still ongoing . According to the second applicant she was not sure whether she was speaking to her son or someone else .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then went to the campus to check whether their son was indeed there but he was not . They contacted all hospitals in GPE , the sobering - up centre and all police stations , including the LOC police station No . CARDINAL where their son was interrogated TIME . They were informed however that their son had been neither arrested nor had his identity been checked .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of the hospitals they were informed that the previous night CARDINAL unidentified men had been brought there . CARDINAL of them was then taken by the police to the police station No . CARDINAL . The applicants went to the police station again where they were told that no men of unknown identity had been there the previous night .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then officially reported their son as missing and started to look for him on their own .", "CARDINAL . Only on DATE they were informed by the police station No . CARDINAL that their son had been brought there on TIME DATE and released because there were no grounds to keep him there .", "CARDINAL . According to the minutes taken by the police officers on TIME DATE , the applicants\u2019 son was drunk ; he mumbled and was unsteady on his legs .

A.W. , who found the body on DATE , informed the police immediately . CARDINAL police officers , GPE and PERSON , the same who had interviewed the applicants\u2019 son on TIME DATE , were sent to the scene .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the body was shown to the applicants who recognised it as the body of their son . The first applicant noted that in the pockets of his sons\u2019 clothes there was no mobile phone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigation into the circumstances of the applicants\u2019 son \u2019s death was opened by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a post - mortem examination of the applicants\u2019 son \u2019s body was carried out . Dr GPE , who participated in the post - mortem examination , found that there were chafes on the applicants\u2019 son \u2019s palms , face and abdomen . The back side of his legs was covered with bright green algae . The doctor found that the reason for ORG death was hypothermia . She also found that he had been under the influence of alcohol at the moment of his death . The blood alcohol level was CARDINAL per mille .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants the expert opinion prepared by Dr GPE raised many doubts and was partly contradictory . PERSON described their son \u2019s vermiform appendix although he had his appendix removed as a child . No samples of the algae which covered ORG legs were collected for examination . The expert pointed out some characteristics of ORG inner organs which could indicate that ORG died suddenly , which was in contradiction to her conclusion that he died of hypothermia . Also the position in which the body was found contradicted the conclusion that the applicants\u2019 son died of hypothermia . He was found lying on his back with his legs crossed whereas , according to the expert opinion , a person who falls down from exhaustion should lie face down . Furthermore , the expert did not determine the date of ORG death . According to her later depositions , she had not received any such order from the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The expert took liver samples , but as it turned out later it was impossible to examine them because they had been improperly secured .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the post - mortem examination fingernail scrapings were secured for further examination . However , the samples were never examined .", "CARDINAL . As emerges from TIME of the post - mortem examination , when GPE \u2019s body was being undressed before the examination , a mobile phone fell out of his pocket . As noted above , the applicants checked their son \u2019s clothes before the post - mortem examination and the mobile phone was not there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested the prosecutor to examine the blood samples from ORG body and clothes taken when his body was found .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor granted the request and ordered that the samples be examined by ORG . However , the decision on the merits was given by the prosecutor without the results of the relevant examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation finding that the applicants\u2019 son died of hypothermia without involvement of any third persons . The prosecutor based his decision on various evidence including the post - mortem examination , the expert opinion referred to above , as well as depositions made by several witnesses heard in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision . His references to the numerous shortcomings of the investigation covered CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the challenged decision and remitted the case to the prosecutor for reexamination . The court agreed with the applicants that the circumstances of their son \u2019s death had not been sufficiently established .", "CARDINAL . First of all , the court recognised that the decision discontinuing the investigation was given without the results of the examination of the secured blood sample , which had been previously ordered by the prosecutor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the court found that in the opinion following the analysis of the applicants\u2019 son \u2019s blood , there were some inaccuracies which needed further clarification ; the toxicological examination allegedly showed presence of phenetylamine in the secured blood sample . However in another part of the opinion it was stated that the presence of this substance was not confirmed and its amount was not determined \u201c for lack of pattern \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court also referred to the examination of samples of ORG \u2019s liver which was ordered on DATE but not carried out . According to the medical expert appointed by the court , the examination could not be carried out because ORG did not have the relevant reagents whereas as emerges from TIME of the interview with a medical expert from ORG , the examination was impossible because of the way the samples had been secured .", "CARDINAL . The court further pointed out that in the first phase of the investigation , an examination of biological and dactyloscopic traces on GPE \u2019s mobile phone and CARDINAL cigarette lighters found in his clothes was ordered by the prosecutor . The criminological laboratory in GPE stated that they were unable to carry out the examination and stressed that it should be carried out in a specialised biological laboratory in LOC in GPE or GPE . The prosecutor however did not request the institutions indicated for the examination .", "CARDINAL . The court also stressed the inaccuracies in the medical expert opinion prepared by dr M.R. It further pointed out that the prosecutor had failed to refer to the merits of the opinion and to indicate which part of it and what reasons constituted the basis for his decision . The court also ordered the prosecutor to examine further the part of the expert opinion which concerned the position in which ORG body was found .", "CARDINAL . Finally the court referred to the ORG statements as regards further evidence which should be examined . The applicants requested that dactyloscopic traces be taken from the police van in which their son was transported . They also considered that traces on the ground where their son \u2019s body had ORG lawyer \u2019s appeal was examined DATE after ORG body was found .", "CARDINAL . Following the court \u2019s decision , the case was remitted to ORG . The prosecutor heard GPE , a specialist from ORG , who had carried out a toxicological examination of GPE \u2019s urine and blood . She said that she only examined the samples to check whether there was amphetamine in the blood . She did not check the presence of phenetylamine .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor further requested ORG to carry out an examination of the secured liver samples . The University replied however that examination of the samples was impossible given the way the samples had been secured .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also heard the medical expert ORG who admitted that she had mistakenly described ORG \u2019s vermiform appendix .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having reexamined the case , again discontinued the proceedings for the same reasons as the previous time .", "CARDINAL . According to the relevant provisions of LAW , no further appeal is available for the applicants if the investigation was discontinued for the second time . However , on DATE the applicants requested ORG to resume the investigation . Their request was transferred to ORG who , having reexamined the case - file found a number of shortcomings in the discontinued proceedings and , on DATE , ordered that the investigation be resumed . The prosecutor relied on Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Proceedings according to which discontinued investigation may be resumed de novo at any time by the prosecutor provided that it would not be conducted against a person who had been a suspect in the previously discontinued proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor recalled that in the decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG had indicated to a number of shortcomings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and ordered that further steps be undertaken in the proceedings . Having analysed the case - file the prosecutor concluded that the court \u2019s orders had been performed in an insufficient way or had not been performed at all . The relevant part of his decision read as follows :", "\u201c .... it was found in the Bia\u0142ystok hospitals that in the time when GPE was missing , he was not admitted to any of them . The prosecutor did not hear the employees of the first - aid station and ordered that the police do it on his behalf . In consequence the records of the hearings are superficial and still do not explain the circumstances of your [ the applicants ] conversation with CARDINAL of the employees , Ms. PERSON It is important because this person was supposed to inform that on DATE in the morning a young unidentified man had been brought to the hospital and subsequently taken by the police . If the prosecutor investigated into these events he should explore it in the most detailed way possible . The prosecutor also tried to have samples of liver examined requesting opinion of PERSON of ORG although at that time he already knew that the examination had not been possible because the samples had been improperly secured .", "The prosecutor , in spite of the court \u2019s order , failed to have ORG \u2019s blood samples , secured fingerprint and biological traces examined .", "...", "The decision discontinuing the investigation must be found premature ...", "The case concerns death of a young man and its circumstances have not been sufficiently cleared . It is still unknown in what way and why GPE was on a meadow in a place unknown to him , far from the police station which he had left at TIME on DATE .", "...", "It was also found that the last telephone call which ORG answered was at TIME and it was a conversation with PERSON [ the first applicant ] but the information where GPE telephone logged in at that time is missing . This should be completed as soon as possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor further considered that it was crucial to find out what were the weather conditions on DATE , in particular the air temperature and the snow precipitations . He also ordered that the state of GPE \u2019s alcohol intoxication be examined on the basis of so called \u201c prospective examination \u201d ; the alcohol level in his blood was established only for the moment of his death . The prosecutor ordered therefore detailed hearing of all persons with whom ORG spent DATE of CARDINAL DATE as regards the amount and kind of alcohol drunk on DATE , amount and kind of meals he had , whether he had been tired , etc . The prosecutor considered that all these circumstances were crucial taking into consideration the version according to which ORG died of hypothermia . He also indicated a professor in GPE , a specialist in cases of hypothermia death and found out that the professor had been contacted by the prosecutor \u2019s office and had agreed to prepare the opinion requested however , for unknown reasons , the prosecutor decided not to request this evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed the investigation .", "She requested an opinion of a forensic expert from ORG indicated by ORG on DATE . The expert GPE confirmed that ORG had died because of hypothermia . He further submitted that death of hypothermia usually happens in low temperatures but also when the temperature is above zero centigrade , between CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Air humidity and alcohol were other factors which influence the risk of death . The expert further excluded the possibility of establishing for how long GPE had been exposed to low temperatures finding that each person reacted differently to low temperatures and that additional factors such as weather conditions and air humidity could influence the result of such examination . As regards the presence of phenetylamine in GPE \u2019s blood the expert submitted that given many possible sources of this substance , such as various kinds of food , excessive physical effort , etc . , it was impossible to determine its origin in this particular case .", "As regards ORG \u2019s blood samples the prosecutor found that their examination was impossible because too much time had passed from DATE on which they were secured .", "As regards the indication to hear all persons with whom GPE celebrated his final exams on CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor established that on DATE at TIME and several friends had had been drinking alcohol at the student home . At TIME they all went to the city centre where they had a meal and subsequently went to a club where they were dancing and drinking beer . The details regarding the amount and kind of drinks and food that they had had were not established .", "The prosecutor further referred to the data of a meteorological station in GPE and listed the average air temperature on DATE between DATE and DATE as well as average snow precipitations on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation . She concluded that due to evidence difficulties it was impossible to reproduce the course of events after GPE had left the police station . She further stated on the basis of the above - mentioned evidence , in particular the expert opinion , that CARDINAL persons had been involved in GPE \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed . In particular , they submitted that in the course of the investigation it was not clarified for what reasons and where from ORG had had hospital shoe covers in his pocket . They further submitted that ORG clothes were covered in mud ; its origin was likewise not cleared ; ORG had been found on the meadow covered with a thick layer of snow and therefore his clothes should normally not bear traces of mud . They again referred to the position in which the body had been found considering that a person who falls down because of exhaustion should have been found with his face down . They also pointed to the fact that in the challenged decision the prosecutor had considered that the examination of blood samples was impossible because of the lapse of time whereas previously , the prosecutor had refused to examine the blood samples and DNA test finding that these were immaterial for the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the challenged decision . As regards the arguments raised in the applicants\u2019 appeal , the court considered that they were a \u201c chain of suppositions leading the applicants to a conclusion that third persons were involved in M.O.s \u2019s death \u201d . Having referred to , in particular , the forensic expert evidence who confirmed that ORG had died of hypothermia , the court accepted the prosecutor \u2019s findings that no involvement of third persons in GPE \u2019s death could be discerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation opened on DATE was severed and the part of it which concerned the alleged failure to perform their duties by the police officers GPE and PERSON was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation finding that no offence of abuse of power or failure to perform their duties had been committed by the police officers . The Prosecutor examined , among other things , whether the ORG son had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of his arrest . She found that according to the handwritten note made by the police officers GPE \u201c mumbled and was unsteady on his legs but he had documents on him , knew where he was and what was going on , the contact with him was logical . He assured that he would not drink more alcohol and come back straight to the university campus \u201d . She further found that according to the depositions of witnesses , ORG had been under the influence of alcohol but he was not drunk to such an extent which would require taking him to the sobering - up centre or which would raise suspicions that he might have problems getting home on his own . The Prosecutor further examined why the police officers who spoke with the applicants\u2019 son on the critical night had not realised until DATE that the missing person they were looking for and GPE whom they had checked at TIME on DATE was the same person . She found that GPE \u2019s personal data had been established on the basis of his personal number ( ORG ) via telephone and entered into a handwritten note by CARDINAL of the police officers . ORG presence at the police station had not been saved in the police computer system , because at that time there was no access to the ORG system ( System of Police Information ) . The Prosecutor admitted that the above circumstances spoke for deficiencies in the communication within the police station in question , she found however that no prohibited behavior could be attributed to the police officers .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 lawyer appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL .
