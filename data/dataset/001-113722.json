On DATE ORG appointed his brother , Mr PERSON , as his guardian ( kurator ) . Subsequently , the guardian applied to the court to have the order varied and to have the applicant declared totally incapacitated .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , on DATE , an expert psychiatric opinion was prepared which confirmed that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia and that he had a tendency to abuse alcohol .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG changed its previous decision and decided to declare the applicant totally incapacitated as his mental condition had deteriorated . The applicant \u2019s brother remained his guardian ( opiekun prawny ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s guardian requested ORG ) to admit the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC ( ORG PERSON ) decided to place the applicant in the social care home , as requested by his guardian .

On DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG , where he remained for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG that he had been placed in the care home against his will and without any medical necessity . On DATE the president of the court informed him that the placement had been in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC informed the applicant that his guardian was authorised to place him in the care home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for proceedings to be initiated to have his legal capacity fully restored . The court considered that the applicant , being legally incapacitated , did not have the authority to lodge such a request , and that his guardian did not support the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of ORG explained to the applicant again that due to his total incapacitaty he had not been a party to the proceedings relating to his placement in the care home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of ORG informed the applicant in a letter that there were no grounds to institute proceedings to restore the applicant \u2019s legal capacity of the court \u2019s own motion .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the president of ORG informed the applicant that any variation of his incapacitation order was governed by Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( ORG ) . The president further clarified that proceedings to vary the incapacitation order could be instituted by a court of its own motion . In addition , the applicant himself , although lacking legal capacity , could apply to the court for such proceedings to be instituted . According to the president , the latter possibility was based on the interpretation of the law as provided in a commentary to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant again asked ORG to quash the legal incapacitation order . On DATE the court rejected the request as inadmissible in law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of ORG explained to the applicant , in a letter of response to the applicant \u2019s query , that only his legal guardian could institute proceedings to have his legal incapacity revoked . Alternatively , the applicant could request the court to institute such proceedings of its own motion , but for that to succeed new medical evidence needed to be provided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG rejected further requests by the applicant for his legal capacity to be restored , on the ground that the applicant had no legal standing to institute such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court rejected a further appeal by the applicant against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court noted that following ORG judgment of DATE the domestic law had been amended , and it was now possible for a person lacking legal capacity to institute proceedings to have the incapacitation order set aside . However , the amendments to the ORG had been introduced by the law of CARDINAL DATE , which would enter into force only on DATE . Thus , the applicant \u2019s request had not been examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Jaros\u0142aw ORG informed the applicant that his complaints , in particular against PERSON , who had prepared an expert opinion in DATE in the proceedings concerning his incapacitation , were manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions in DATE the applicant attempted to institute proceedings to have his incapacitation quashed ; however , all his requests were refused for failure to comply with various procedural requirements , including failure to pay court fees in the amount of MONEY ( ORG , CARDINAL QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) . The applicant appealed against all the decisions and submitted new requests for the incapacitation order to be lifted .", "CARDINAL . It appears that a later request was successful , as on DATE ORG instituted proceedings to have the applicant \u2019s legal capacity restored ( file no . Ns CARDINAL ) . The court decided to have an expert opinion prepared and for the applicant to be heard by a judge in the presence of a psychologist and a psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge , with a panel of experts , heard the applicant during a twentyfiveminutelong interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts submitted their opinion to the court on the basis of that interview with the applicant . The applicant submitted to the experts that he had been placed in the social care home against his will by his brother DATE previously . In the home he had been independent , had not been drinking alcohol and had been taking his medication . In DATE he had been given long leaves of absence to visit his home , and had travelled alone . He would like to make his own decisions and to vote in elections and not to be obliged to ask his brother for everything . He also mentioned that if his capacity were restored he would prefer to stay in the social care home and to continue visiting his family home on leaves of absence .", "CARDINAL . The experts concluded that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia , although for DATE he had not experienced psychotic symptoms or displayed aggressive behaviour . However , without a rigorous therapeutic regime the applicant \u2019s state of health could worsen . According to the experts the applicant did not consider himself to be a person with a mental disorder , and showed a lack of critical judgment regarding his state of health and his actions . On the basis of the file and the interview with the applicant the experts concluded that his primary intention in applying for restoration of his legal capacity was to leave the social care home . In this context they noted that during the interview the applicant had spontaneously declared that he would prefer to stay in the social care home even if his capacity were restored . Nevertheless , judging from his consistent and extensive correspondence with the courts so far , the experts considered that his sole intention remained \u201c to live freely in the family home and not in the social care institution \u201d . The experts concluded that the applicant \u2019s mental state had improved but not to the extent that would allow him to function independently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts informed the court that they considered it unnecessary to notify the applicant of any court decisions or applications to court , given his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to stop sending the applicant any notifications of court decisions and appointed a court officer as a guardian to represent his interests in legal proceedings . The applicant submitted that he had never met this guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a request by the applicant to have his legal capacity restored . The decision contains no reasons , as it appears that the applicant \u2019s guardian had not asked for them . Nor did she lodge an appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the applicant \u2019s guardian , he was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A court may quash legal incapacitation if the reasons for which it was ordered cease to exist ; the quashing may take place of the court \u2019s own motion .", "CARDINAL . Where the mental state of an incapacitated person improves , a court may change the total incapacitation to partial ; where his or her mental state deteriorates , partial incapacitation may be changed to total . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment in case no . K CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The judgment was published and entered into force on DATE . The court decided that Article CARDINAL of the ORG was unconstitutional in so far as it deprived an incapacitated person of the right to lodge a request to have a legal incapacitation order quashed or varied . As regards the consequences of the judgment , ORG considered that the most appropriate means of enforcement would be for the legislature to introduce an amendment to LAW . In that connection it welcomed a bill under examination by ORG which included a relevant amendment . However , it emphasised that the judgments of ORG should be enforced not only by the legislature but also by the ordinary courts . In the present case that would mean changing the unconstitutional practice of courts examining cases concerning incapacitation , and allowing proceedings to be brought by individuals deprived of legal capacity . ORG stated :", "\u201c From the date of publication of the judgment in ORG the presumption of the constitutionality of Article CARDINAL , taken together with LAW ORG , in so far as it prevented an incapacitated person from instituting proceedings to quash or vary an incapacitation order , is no longer applicable . ORG wishes to emphasise that that is so in consequence of the judgment of ORG itself , whether or not legislative changes are eventually introduced . It should therefore be considered that the finding by LAW of the unconstitutionality of limiting an incapacitated person \u2019s procedural rights allows the courts to interpret LAW in accordance with LAW . In the context of this judgment the opinion expressed by ORG resolution of DATE , to the effect that amelioration of the procedural position of incapacitated persons could not be achieved through interpretation of the existing regulations as that would amount to overstepping the boundaries of judicial power , is no longer applicable . Judges , when carrying out their duties , are subject not only to statute but also to the LAW , which is the highest law in GPE and may DATE and in cases of conflict with existing statutes confirmed by ORG shall \u2013 be directly applicable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Law of CARDINAL DATE , which entered into force on DATE , amended the ORG . A new paragraph was added ; Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides as follows :", "\u201c An application to have a legal incapacitation order quashed or varied may also be lodged by the incapacitated person . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE LAW ( ustawa o ochronie zdrowa psychicznego ) the admission to a psychiatric hospital of a person who has a mental disorder or is mentally disabled and is unable to express his or her consent must be approved by a civil court ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . A court can also decide on the admission of a person who has a mental disorder but who does not consent to treatment in the hospital . A guardian can express consent to admit an adult who is totally incapacitated , but the latter must agree too , unless he is unable to express agreement . In any event , and in particular in the event of disagreement between the patient and the guardian , the question of admission is decided or confirmed by a court ( section CARDINAL ) . Admission to the hospital is preceded by a psychiatric examination .", "CARDINAL . Admission to a social care home is governed by section CARDINAL et seq . of the LAW . It provides that a person who , on account of mental disorder or mental disability , is unable to take care of himself or herself and can not be taken care of by somebody else , and does not need hospital treatment , may be placed in a social care home with his or her consent or the consent of his or her guardian . Only if the person concerned or his or her guardian does not consent to the placement must the decision be taken by a court .", "CARDINAL . According to the Ordinance of the Minister of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , a regional court must supervise the legality of the admission and continuing residence of individuals confined to psychiatric hospitals and social care homes ( section CARDINAL ) . However , an obligation to carry out periodic reviews , DATE , of the need for continuing residence applies only to those admitted to psychiatric hospitals ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The regulations on the functioning of social care homes were also governed by the DATE LAW ( LANGUAGE o pomocy spo\u0142ecznej ) , replaced by LAW . According to the relevant regulations , the costs of the person \u2019s stay in a social care home must not exceed PERCENT of his or her income or pension . Both Acts provided that placement of a totally incapacitated person in a social care home may only be done with his or her guardian \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL .
