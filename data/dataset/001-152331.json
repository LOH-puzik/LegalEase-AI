The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has claimed , so far unsuccessfully , title to part of a house , owned by PERSON at the material time , and to the land on which it stands . Her claim is based on the following arguments : that the part of the house in question was constructed at her and her late husband \u2019s expense ; that her husband lawfully obtained title to the property , which she subsequently inherited ; that it was not sold to PERSON despite there having initially been an agreement with the applicant \u2019s son to that effect ; and that the sales contract on which PERSON claim to the property was based was forged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s property claim was considered on numerous occasions by the domestic courts . Eventually , following the reassignment of the case by ORG to lower courts with different territorial jurisdiction , the applicant \u2019s claim was dismissed . Relying on the statements of CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL of whom was heard in person , and documents submitted by PERSON , the courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction found that Mr M. had bought the foundations of the part of the house in question from the applicant \u2019s son in DATE and had subsequently built it at his own cost . Mr PERSON , accordingly , was the lawful owner of that part of the house and had the right to use the land on which it had been constructed . The final decision , upholding the rulings of the lower courts , was taken by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG , complaining in particular of unfairness in the domestic court proceedings concerning her claim . She also complained about the length of the proceedings and alleged a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention taken alone and in conjunction with LAW on account of their outcome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a judgment in the case , which became final on DATE . The ORG held that there had been a violation of LAW , having regard to the circumstances in which the applicant \u2019s case had been reassigned by ORG and to the lack of sufficient reasoning in the domestic decisions , these issues being taken together and cumulatively ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ The ] reassignment [ of the applicant \u2019s case ] was ordered by ORG after having expressly disagreed with the findings of the lower courts as to the facts and having stated its position concerning one of the principal aspects of the case ... even before the new assessment of facts and taking of evidence by the lower courts took place ... Considering in addition ORG failure to provide reasons for the reassignment , the ORG is of the opinion that the applicant \u2019s fears that the judges of ORG , including its Deputy President , had a prefixed idea concerning the outcome of the case and that the judges to whom the case had been transferred on DATE would have to consider the case in accordance with ORG view could be held to be objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that this overall procedural situation also disturbed the principle of legal certainty ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALIX ) . The fact that ORG views on the subject of the applicant \u2019s case differed from those of the lower courts could not be a sole ground for its repeated re - examination . Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised for correction of judicial mistakes , miscarriages of justice , and not to substitute the lower courts\u2019 assessment of facts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that the domestic courts had afforded no reply to the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning the reliability of the ORG statements and the validity of the documentary evidence , which had been decisive for the outcome of the case ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the above findings under LAW , the ORG decided that it was not necessary to rule on the applicant \u2019s complaint based on LAW No . CARDINAL , as it raised no distinct issue ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s complaints about the length of the proceedings and a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL taken in conjunction with LAW were dismissed as unsubstantiated ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was awarded ORG CARDINAL by way of just satisfaction in respect of non - pecuniary damage . The ORG also noted \u201c that the applicant was entitled under NORP law to request a rehearing of her case in the light of the ORG \u2019s finding that the domestic courts had not complied with LAW in her case \u201d ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . To date , ORG has not yet concluded the supervision of the execution of the judgment under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG an \u201c appeal in the light of exceptional circumstances \u201d pursuant in particular to Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , she asked ORG to quash the ORG decisions in her case and to adopt a new judgment allowing her claims in full . She joined to her appeal copies of the ORG \u2019s judgment and of the domestic decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG of ORG , having examined the appeal in chambers and relying on LAW set out in paragraph CARDINAL below ) , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The relevant part of ORG decision reads as follows :", "\u201c By the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s complaints of unfairness in the proceedings and of a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL admissible , and the remainder of the application inadmissible . A violation of LAW ... was found in the case . [ The ORG ] ordered that the respondent ORG was to pay the applicant , within DATE from the date on which the judgment became final according to LAW ( DATE ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage ...", "In paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment of ORG , it is noted that the applicant \u2019s submissions mainly concern CARDINAL issues , namely :", "( a ) NORP whether the courts , which dealt with [ the applicant \u2019s ] case , were independent and impartial ;", "( b ) DATE whether the fact that the case was heard by ORG prevented the applicant from participating in the proceedings ;", "( c ) NORP whether the principle of equality of arms was observed with regard to the failure of the domestic courts to hear the witnesses whose written statements the courts admitted as evidence ;", "( d ) whether the final decisions given by the courts of first , appeal and cassation instances were sufficiently substantiated .", "As can be seen from the case materials , the applicant was represented in the [ domestic ] proceedings by her son , a lawyer ... During the entire duration of the proceedings she failed to appear before the court , although she was duly informed of the hearings .", "None of those taking part in the case , including Mr B.I. [ the applicant \u2019s son ] , asked for the witnesses to be summoned ... Mr B.I. failed to submit witness statements ... capable of proving that the house was constructed at his ( or his father \u2019s or his mother \u2019s ) expense .", "None of the parties , including Mr B.I. , sought the withdrawal of the [ first - instance ] judge . Complaints of the court \u2019s lack of objectivity ... were only raised by PERSON B.I. after the judgment had been adopted in the case .", "As can be seen from the case materials , the validity of the sales contract of DATE , according to which Mr PERSON purchased from Mr B.I. half of the foundations and some of the construction materials , was not challenged ... There is also a document confirming that the left - hand side of the house was constructed at Mr M. \u2019s expense and a document according to which PERSON paid Mr GPE karbovanets [ the former transitional currency of GPE before DATE ] for the foundations of the left - hand side of the house . These circumstances were not refuted by the expert examination in the case .", "In its judgment , ORG also noted that the applicant ... had failed to provide evidence that she had suffered discrimination in the enjoyment of her property rights , contrary to LAW , on account of the outcome of the civil proceedings . [ The ORG ] concluded that the applicant \u2019s complaints [ under these provisions ] were to be rejected as manifestly ill - founded pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . Therefore , ORG concluded that the [ domestic ] courts\u2019 decisions were lawful and well - founded and decided to award the applicant compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL only for the violation of the \u2018 reasonable - time\u2019 requirement by the NORP courts .", "In the light of the foregoing , the courts\u2019 decisions in the case may not be quashed on the grounds mentioned in PERSON application .", "Relying on [ Article ] CARDINAL of the [ Code of Civil Procedure of GPE ] , the panel of judges of ORG of ORG of GPE", "[ Decided ] :", "To refuse to allow the appeal [ of PERSON ] for review in the light of exceptional circumstances of the judgment of DATE of ORG of ORG , the decision of DATE of ORG and the decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new \u201c appeal in the light of exceptional circumstances \u201d with ORG .

On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG of ORG , relying on Article CARDINAL of LAW , declared the appeal inadmissible , as it contained no arguments capable of serving as grounds for reconsideration of the case in the light of exceptional circumstances pursuant to LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below for the text of LAW and for the relevant extracts from LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
