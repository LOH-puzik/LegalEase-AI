On the last - mentioned day they requested asylum in GPE , referring to the attempted coup d\u2019etat in GPE . On DATE ORG ( sis\u00e4asiainministeri\u00f6 , inrikesministeriet ) rejected their asylum request and found no reason to grant them a residence permit .", "On DATE the Hollola Police District proposed that the family be expelled . The family objected on DATE , arguing , inter alia , that although they had been citizens of the former GPE they had not become citizens of GPE . On DATE ORG ordered their expulsion to GPE , considering , inter alia , that they were citizens of the former GPE with no such ties to GPE as could prevent their expulsion . The ORG also prohibited the family from returning to GPE or any other NORP country during a period of DATE . The family appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) .", "On DATE the present applicant was born . He was not registered as being entitled to NORP social security benefits .

On DATE ORG found no reason to grant him a residence permit . Instead the applicant and his family were ordered to be expelled to GPE , as they were all considered to be citizens of that ORG pursuant to its DATE LAW which had entered into force on DATE . In a memorandum of DATE the ORG recalled that the applicant \u2019s parents and his brother had arrived in GPE on a tourist visa . At the time when LAW had entered into force , the applicant \u2019s parents and his brother had not been permanently residing in GPE but in GPE .

In the view of ORG , the applicant \u2019s parents had not presented evidence of such a refusal ( according to the applicant \u2019s family , their objection to becoming NORP citizens was addressed to the NORP authorities and lodged with ORG ) .
