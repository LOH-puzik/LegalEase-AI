De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and currently detained at FAC . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with PERSON and ORG , assisted by Mr J. Wood FAC and Mr PERSON , counsel .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On TIME CARDINAL DATE PERSON and PERSON were shot and killed with shotguns in the course of a robbery at their house near GPE , GPE . Forensic evidence of footwear patterns , and the fact that CARDINAL windows had been smashed on different sides of the house , suggested CARDINAL robbers . The evidence also suggested that they had been killed after CARDINAL . The house was adjacent to a petrol station which the couple had run .", "CARDINAL . NORP That evening the applicant and his brother , PERSON , had visited relatives in GPE and GPE , GPE , QUANTITY south of the murder scene . On their own admission , they had carried out a series of crimes in the south - west of GPE shortly following the murder . This included the armed robbery of a petrol station which lay between PERSON and the Fishers\u2019 garage , which the applicant admitted to having committed . A shotgun had been fired in the course of that robbery . The brothers also admitted to robbing a B & Q store in the area . There were also CARDINAL incidents of serious assaults by the brothers , during the last of which a shotgun had also been produced . After the Fishers\u2019 murder , CARDINAL shotguns were found where the brothers had buried them on a beach . Both admitted possession of them , though no specific connection with the murders was established .", "CARDINAL . NORP The brothers were charged with the Fishers\u2019 murder . Their defence was they had travelled together to visit their relatives , had tried to obtain cannabis via CARDINAL relative , and had then gone to a public house while the relative sought unsuccessfully to obtain the cannabis . They had not been anywhere near the Fishers\u2019 home or garage . However , evidence was called by the prosecution as to the use of a mobile telephone which the brothers had been carrying that TIME . From records of which telephone masts had serviced the mobile telephone that TIME , the prosecution sought to determine when telephone calls had been made and from where . The evidence showed that the telephone had been used up to CARDINAL that evening and was then silent until CARDINAL when a TIME call was received from PERSON \u2019s girlfriend . The prosecution submitted that the telephone mast evidence , particularly that relating to the CARDINAL call , was consistent with it being received in a car moving away from the murder scene and that it was impossible for it to have been received at the public house , as the brothers maintained . Moreover , the evidence of the girlfriend at trial was that PERSON had been in a tearful and emotional state during the call , though he denied this .", "CARDINAL . In addition to this evidence , and the telephone evidence above , the prosecution relied on what it considered to be the improbability of the ORG account of travelling so far as they did to buy a few pounds\u2019 worth of cannabis . It also relied on the fact that the brothers claimed to have left the public house without finding out if their relative had successfully obtained the cannabis . The prosecution further relied on the evidence of CARDINAL other witnesses who had heard conversations between the brothers : CARDINAL testified that PERSON had said to PERSON \u201c what are we going to do about this PERSON thing ? \u201d ; the other testified that PERSON had spoken about PERSON . Finally , the prosecution were allowed to rely on the other robberies and CARDINAL of the assaults which the applicant and his brother had committed as evidence of their propensity to commit robbery and to use sudden and exceptional violence .", "CARDINAL . At trial , against PERSON only , the prosecution led additional evidence from CARDINAL prisoners who alleged that , while in prison on remand before the trial , PERSON had either admitted or had made incriminating remarks regarding the shootings . The most significant of the CARDINAL witnesses was a police informant , Z , who testified that PERSON had admitted the shootings . The second of the CARDINAL witnesses testified inter alia that PERSON had returned to his cell , after being interviewed by the police , worried about the telephone evidence . The third testified that he had overhead PERSON tell someone that PERSON was going to take the blame for the shootings and that he , PERSON , had done them .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the defence case , the prosecution conceded that the evidence which had been led against the applicant was insufficient to permit a jury to return a guilty verdict against him . However , it maintained that a guilty verdict could be returned by way of the PERSON approach ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . This would allow the jury to consider first the case against PERSON ( including the additional evidence against him which had been given by the CARDINAL prisoners ) and then , if they found PERSON guilty , to apply that conclusion in determining whether the applicant was also guilty . The jury were accordingly directed by the trial judge as follows :", "\u201c ... you must consider the case against each defendant separately . The evidence against each defendant is different , and therefore your verdicts need not be the same . It is a matter for you how you set about your task and in which order you consider the cases against the defendants , but I suggest that you approach your deliberations first by considering the case against and for PERSON . Much of the evidence in the case has relevance both to PERSON and to PERSON , but the evidence of [ the CARDINAL witnesses ] about the confessions , or incriminating remarks , that PERSON allegedly made is evidence only in the case against PERSON , and is not evidence in the separate case against PERSON . The reason is simply that an admission of guilt by CARDINAL defendant , even if it includes an assertion of the guilt of another defendant , can not be evidence against that other defendant . It would make no difference whether the alleged admission was to a fellow prisoner or to the police in interview ; it is only evidence against the defendant who says it , and not against the other defendant who is not present when it is said .", "So here , if you find that PERSON made all , or any , of the alleged confessions or incriminating remarks , PERSON was not present , had no chance to hear and dispute the truth of the admissions , and such admissions and assertions are not evidence against him . Thus , in the case of PERSON there is additional evidence , should you accept it , of [ the CARDINAL prison witnesses ] which is not evidence against PERSON . That is why , as I have already said , the evidence against each defendant is different , and therefore your verdicts need not be the same .", "However , there is a further and crucial consideration which is relevant when you go on to consider the case against and for PERSON , and it is this . If , as a result of considering the evidence of [ the CARDINAL witnesses ] , together with the other evidence in the case against PERSON , you are sure that PERSON was guilty of the murders of PERSON and PERSON , you could properly use that finding of guilt in your consideration of the case against PERSON . You would not then be treating the evidence of [ the CARDINAL prison witnesses ] as evidence against PERSON ; what you would be doing - and it is a matter for you whether , and to what extent , you do - what you would be doing would be using the fact that you had found PERSON guilty as a fact in the case against PERSON .", "If you think about it , that is perfectly logical . While certain evidence \u2013 [ the CARDINAL witnesses ] \u2013 can not be evidence against PERSON for the reasons that I have explained , it would be odd , would it not , if , having considered all the evidence against PERSON and found him guilty , the fact of his guilt could not be taken into account , together with all the evidence , as a fact in the case against PERSON .", "But you could only take it into account in the case of PERSON if you were sure of the following matters - ( CARDINAL ) as I have said , that PERSON is guilty ; ( CARDINAL ) that the CARDINAL defendants were together at all material times on TIME , and therefore they were together at the murder scene . There is of course no dispute that they were together at all material times . ( CARDINAL ) that the murders involved CARDINAL people acting together in what the law calls a joint enterprise , of which more in a moment ; and ( CARDINAL ) that the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. PERSON resulted from the carrying into effect of that joint enterprise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having directed the jury on the applicable law of joint enterprise , the trial judge continued :", "\u201c Should you choose to adopt my suggestion first to consider the case against PERSON , then your approach should be as follows . If you have found PERSON guilty , then , when looking at the case of PERSON , if you are sure that , with the intention to commit the offences of murder , he took some part in committing them with PERSON , then , he , PERSON , is also guilty . As I have said , if you found PERSON guilty you could use the fact of his guilt in your consideration of PERSON case .", "However , I emphasise you must not take into account in the case against PERSON any of the evidence of [ the CARDINAL prison witnesses ] as to what PERSON may have said to them , or have been overhead to say , either about his own involvement or his brother \u2019s involvement . That evidence remains inadmissible in the case against PERSON .", "It is for these reasons that I strongly advise you , as a matter of logic and good sense , to consider first the case of PERSON . If you find him guilty , you may use the fact of his guilt in the way I have just described , together with all the other evidence , both against and for PERSON , in your consideration of the case of PERSON .", "If , in following that advice , you found PERSON not guilty , you would be compelled to find PERSON not guilty , because the evidence against PERSON , without using the conviction of PERSON as evidence against him , is , I direct you , insufficient to find PERSON guilty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The jury were also warned that they should treat the evidence given by the CARDINAL witnesses as to what PERSON had said in prison with caution , given the potential risks associated with such \u201c cell confession evidence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant and his brother were convicted of both counts of murder by the jury . They appealed against their convictions to ORG . The appeals were dismissed on DATE . In respect of the applicant \u2019s contention that the PERSON approach had been unfairly applied in his case , ORG observed :", "\u201c The ORG had made it clear before the trial began that it would contend that the PERSON approach was likely to apply in this case , so that if on the evidence admissible against him PERSON were to be convicted , and the jury was sure that he was with PERSON at all material times that TIME , PERSON \u2019s conviction could properly follow . The Judge was invited to refuse to leave the case to the jury on that basis ; it was submitted that PERSON should be confined to the case where the conviction of A is a legal pre - condition to the possible conviction of B , and that the effect of leaving the PERSON approach to the jury would be to make the confession of PERSON in effect admissible against PERSON although in law it was not . The first argument is not pursued here : PERSON was not so limited . The second is also not pursued and is precisely the submission which was rejected by the Lordships in PERSON .", "Mr Wood [ counsel for the applicant ] \u2019s argument here is that the Judge should have refused to leave the PERSON approach to the jury because it put the conduct of PERSON \u2019s defence in an impossible position . He had , he suggests , no locus standi to challenge the evidence of \u2018 Z\u2019 and others and could not for example apply under s CARDINAL Criminal Justice Act DATE to put in bad character material against them . We are very doubtful about that . If , via PERSON , there was evidence which was potentially damaging to PERSON , it seems to us that PERSON must be able to challenge it . The wording of s CARDINAL does not seem to us to shut him out from contending that there is a matter of substantial importance in issue in the proceedings . But this question of law does not arise , and we have not heard full argument about it . That is because Mr Wood conceded with proper frankness that for tactical reasons ( doubtless sound ) PERSON had decided not to challenge the evidence of \u2018 Z\u2019 but to rely on the challenge mounted by PERSON . Thus the Judge was never called upon to rule what steps PERSON could or could not take .", "We agree that there is a judgment to be made by the Judge in any case in which the PERSON line of approach is advanced , and that if the reasoning from the conviction of A to the conviction of B would be unsafe , he should not leave it to the jury . But in the present case it was not unsafe . If PERSON had committed this offence , and PERSON and PERSON were , as they both insisted and the other evidence strongly suggested , together throughout the TIME , then so had PERSON . The Judge set out with absolute precision the conditions under which this line of reasoning could be applied . .... Like other aspects of his direction , this had been submitted in draft to counsel for their consideration .", "Mr Wood submitted that the Judge should have warned the jury of the possibility that PERSON and PERSON might be lying about being together , perhaps because PERSON was sheltering PERSON . No one suggested that when the directions were under consideration , and we are unable in any event to see why the Judge should have been under any such duty when not CARDINAL of the CARDINAL parties in the trial had ever suggested any such thing to the jury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Defendants who are charged with joint offences are normally tried jointly , unless , in the interests of justice , an order is made for them to be tried separately .", "CARDINAL . Where defendants are tried separately , section ORG ) of ORG allows the prosecution to adduce the fact that a person other than the accused has been convicted of an offence , for the purpose of proving that that person committed the offence .", "CARDINAL . Under section DATE of the same Act , a confession made by an accused person may be given in evidence against him . At common law , such a confession is not normally admissible against any other person implicated in it .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , the defendant PERSON stood trial for murder with CARDINAL co - accused , PERSON and PERSON . The deceased was PERSON \u2019s husband . The prosecution \u2019s case was that PERSON had arranged a contract killing of her husband : PERSON was the man who actually shot and killed the deceased and PERSON was the middleman between PERSON and PERSON . The evidence against PERSON was a confession he had made to his girlfriend . The trial judge directed the jury that , if they were satisfied that PERSON and PERSON were guilty of murder , it would be open to them to take account of those findings of guilt in deciding whether to convict PERSON . All CARDINAL defendants were convicted . In PERSON \u2019s appeal against conviction , a majority of ORG ( Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON ) found that the trial judge had directed the jury not to take into account PERSON \u2019s confession in the case against PERSON . Thus , there was no infringement of the common law rule prohibiting the admissibility of CARDINAL accused \u2019s conviction against another accused . There was no good reason why PERSON \u2019s guilt could not be used by the jury as a fact against PERSON . It was of no significance that PERSON \u2019s guilt had been established by his own out of court confession .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON dissented . Lord PERSON observed that the effect of this approach was to give the jury the power to turn inadmissible evidence into admissible evidence . Lord PERSON observed that the majority \u2019s conclusion impermissibly breached the principle that , in determining whether there was a case to answer against each defendant , the trial judge had to consider the evidence against each defendant as it then stood . In doing so , only the evidence admissible against each defendant could be taken into account . At that stage , the only evidence admissible against PERSON was insufficient to prove his guilt ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
