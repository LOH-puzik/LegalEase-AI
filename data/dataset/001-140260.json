On DATE the head of ORG issued CARDINAL certificates addressed to the ORG . According to CARDINAL certificate , DATE and DATE while the applicant was held in PERSON DATE he had not made any complaints concerning his detention .

The decision remained silent about the report of DATE to which the applicant referred in his complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a supervising prosecutor set aside the above decision .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the investigating authorities again refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant \u2019s complaint .

On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the ORG under LAW of LAW concerning the decision of CARDINAL DATE , arguing that the inquiry into his allegations of ill - treatment by the police had been incomplete and , in particular , the investigating authorities had ignored the report of DATE .

By a decision of DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the decision of DATE , stating that this latter decision had by that time already been set aside by a supervising prosecutor and an additional inquiry into the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment had been ordered . It is unclear whether the applicant appealed against the ORG decision to a higher court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating authorities again refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment .

The relevant decision noted that the applicant , when interviewed with regard to his allegations , had submitted that during the period of his detention in the Shchelkovo IVS he had been ill - treated on several occasions by police officers , who had chained him to a chair or a table and had beaten him on his back and in the ribs , and that upon his delivery to ORG a report had been drawn up confirming his injuries . He had also stated that he had undergone an X - ray examination in the GPE town hospital on DATE and that the results of that examination had been recorded in QUANTITY - ray image no . CARDINAL . The applicant had submitted that he did not know the police officers who had beaten him , and that he only knew a certain ORG , an officer of ORG , who had not himself applied force to the applicant , but had brought with him CARDINAL individuals in civilian clothes , the latter forcing the applicant to confess to the alleged offence . The decision went on to say that in the applicant \u2019s personal file there was no information indicating whether he had undergone any medical examinations in the period DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The decision further stated that the officer ORG , referred to by the applicant , and investigators B. and PERSON , who had conducted the investigation into the applicant \u2019s criminal case , when interviewed in the context of the present inquiry had denied using physical force or psychological pressure in respect of the applicant or seeing anyone else doing so . The decision also noted that the applicant had not complained about the alleged ill - treatment until DATE after the events in question . It then stated that the investigating authorities considered that the applicant had alleged such ill - treatment by the police in an attempt \u201c to mislead the investigating authorities , who were spending their time and resources investigating offences that [ had ] in reality [ not been ] committed , and to accuse public officials of serious offences , thereby affecting a number of individuals who were obliged to devote time to giving oral evidence to the investigating authorities \u201d . The decision therefore concluded that there was no evidence of the offence alleged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor set aside the decision of DATE , stating that the inquiry had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the investigating authorities again refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had been ill - treated by the police . The relevant decision was identical to that of DATE . The only comment added was that it appeared impossible to question investigator PERSON and officer PERSON , as they had not responded to telephone calls .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed a complaint by the applicant concerning the decision of DATE . Although the court noted that the applicant referred to the medical report of CARDINAL DATE , it did not address it any further but instead stated that the investigation conducted into his allegations had been complete . The court referred , in particular , to certain explanations obtained from the investigators who had been in charge of the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . A request by the applicant to restore the time - limit for appealing against the decision of DATE was granted by the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG quashed the decision of the ORG of DATE on appeal on the following grounds . Firstly , although the applicant had challenged the judge DATE because it was the same judge who had convicted him \u2013 this had not been examined by the first - instance court . Secondly , the first - instance court had not examined the report of CARDINAL DATE and , thirdly , it had referred to certain explanations by investigator PERSON and officer ORG that could not be found in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the decision of DATE . The court stated , in particular , that whereas the applicant had provided a copy of the report of CARDINAL DATE , it appeared impossible to verify its authenticity since there was no information about the medical examination in question in his file . It further noted that neither during the preliminary investigation nor at the trial had the applicant made any allegations of ill - treatment . It is not clear whether the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile the applicant resubmitted his complaint of ill - treatment , which was dismissed by the investigating authorities on CARDINAL October DATE on the grounds that an investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations had already been conducted and they had been proved unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . At some point , CARDINAL of the witnesses stated that he had made false statements incriminating the applicant in the course of the criminal proceedings against the latter . Thereafter the applicant attempted DATE unsuccessfully DATE to have criminal proceedings brought against that witness . In the period between CARDINAL and DATE the domestic courts dismissed complaints by the applicant concerning the investigating authorities\u2019 decisions to dispense with criminal proceedings in that regard .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides for judicial review of decisions , acts or inaction on the part of an inquirer , investigator or prosecutor which affect constitutional rights or freedoms . The judge is empowered to verify the lawfulness and reasonableness of the decision , act or inaction and to grant the following forms of relief : ( i ) to declare the impugned decision , act or inaction unlawful or unreasonable and to order the authority concerned to remedy the violation ; or ( ii ) to dismiss the complaint .", "CARDINAL . In its ORG of CARDINAL DATE ORG of GPE stated that it was incumbent on judges DATE before processing an LAW complaint \u2013 to establish whether the preliminary investigation had been completed in the main case ( point CARDINAL ) . If the main case has already been sent for trial or the investigation completed , the complaint should not be examined unless it has been brought either by a person who is not a party to the main case or DATE if such a complaint is not amenable to judicial review under LAW at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings . In all other situations the complaint under LAW should be left unexamined and the complainant should be informed that he or she can raise the matter before the trial or appeal courts in the main case .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , according to ORG construction , a complaint under LAW can not be brought or pursued after the criminal case to which the complaint is connected has been submitted for trial . However , where it is established that a party to the proceedings ( including a judge or a witness ) has committed a criminal offence , thus seriously compromising the fairness of the proceedings , the LAW exceptionally allows for separate investigation of the relevant circumstances , leading to a reopening of the case ( see Decision no . CARDINALOO of CARDINAL DATE ; see also Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE and Ruling no . CARDINAL of DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
