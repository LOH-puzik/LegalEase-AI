{"ITEMID": "001-82079", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "BORGMANN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG issued an arrest warrant in respect of the applicant , who had been employed with ORG in GPE , on the ground that he was strongly suspected of being member of a terrorist group called the PERSON and that he had participated in various terrorist attacks during the period DATE . PERSON , which dissolved itself in DATE , was responsible for CARDINAL terrorist attacks . Its regional branch in GPE , ORG , was responsible for CARDINAL terrorist attacks , inter alia for attempts to explode ORG for Asylum Seekers and the victory column in GPE as well as for attempted assassinations of the chief of ORG and a presiding judge of ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant was put on detention on remand . On DATE , ORG filed the bill of indictment against the applicant and CARDINAL other indicted persons for membership of a terrorist organisation and the causing of an explosion in CARDINAL instances . The bill of indictment was based on various items of evidence , among them the testimony of a privileged prosecution witness ( GPE ) , the results of the preliminary investigations , the preliminary investigation against the above witness for the prosecution and subsequent measures under LAW as well as further seized evidence . The main proceedings regarding the above charges commenced on DATE , but were subsequently adjourned until CARDINAL DATE in order to join them to the proceedings against a further person .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to quash or set aside the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE . It found that there existed a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the crimes of which he was accused and that he was likely to abscond if released , given the sentence which he risked incurring if found guilty as charged . ORG noted that the applicant had stable social ties as he had been married since DATE , he was frequently in touch with his daughter who lived in GPE , and the dismissal from his job at ORG in GPE had not yet become final . However , ORG took the view that there was concern that the applicant could vanish abroad as he owned with his wife an estate in GPE where he could travel uncontrolled . His various skills could earn him a living there , and his extradition to GPE could not be taken for granted given the practice of the NORP authorities . Moreover , the current length of the detention on remand was not disproportionate to the expected prison sentence .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion against the decision of ORG of DATE . It found that neither the manner in which the proceedings had so far been conducted nor the adjournment until DATE had been in violation of the obligation to proceed speedily ( Beschleunigungsgrundsatz ) . The reasons given by ORG for the adjournment were plausible , and the delay of the proceedings was still proportionate to the length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand .", "On DATE , ORG ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand because both the strong suspicion and the reasons for detention persisted .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . It considered that there persisted strong suspicion which had not been dissipated by the evidence gathered during the main proceedings . The period of DATE and DATE which the applicant had so far spent in detention on remand had not eliminated the danger of the applicant \u2019s absconding , nor had it made that detention disproportionate . Despite the considerable period since the crimes the applicant was charged with had been committed , the applicant \u2019s probable sentence in view of their gravity and the fact that he had played a leading role in the terrorist organisation could justify the assumption that there was significant incentive to escape and that the continuation of the detention on remand was proportionate .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to quash , or alternatively to set aside , the arrest warrant . ORG took the view that there persisted a strong suspicion that the applicant and CARDINAL other persons had committed the terrorist attacks , which was supported by evidence collected in the main proceedings . It further held that there was still the danger of him absconding and that it was proportionate to continue the detention on remand given the gravity of the charges and the likely prison sentence .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE . It referred to its earlier decision of DATE and found that the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand was justified as the circumstances had not significantly changed since then . ORG noted that it was not objectionable that ORG had found that there persisted a strong suspicion of the applicant \u2019s responsibility for the crimes . ORG also held that the main proceedings had so far been conducted speedily which was appropriate in view of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . The complexity of the proceedings against several accused persons combined with the difficulty in establishing events planned with conspirative means by a terrorist group in the period DATE had so far prevented the judgment from being delivered . The assessment of the reason for arrest and the proportionality of the detention on remand had not considerably changed since ORG decision of DATE . The likely sentence of the applicant still exceeded the period of his detention on remand ; hence there remained the danger of his absconding . Therefore , the continuation of the detention on remand was proportionate .", "On DATE , ORG suspended the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the applicant instead to participate in the main proceedings , to submit his passport and not to leave the territory of GPE without prior consent by the court . ORG found that , in view of a serious accident of the applicant \u2019s son - in - law who needed intensive care , the danger of the applicant absconding was reduced to such a degree that the less far - reaching measures which had been ordered instead would satisfy the purpose of the detention on remand . The applicant was released on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decisions of ORG of DATE and the decision of ORG of DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer received the decision on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of ringleadership of a terrorist organisation and of causing an explosion on CARDINAL occasions and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In determining the sentence , ORG took into account the length of the detention on remand and the length of the criminal proceedings as mitigating facts . The judgment has since become final .", "Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides , inter alia :", "\u201c As long as the accused is in detention on remand , he may at any time apply for a court hearing to determine whether the arrest warrant is to be revoked or whether its execution is to be suspended in accordance with LAW . \u201d", "LAW provides , inter alia :", "\u201c No trial shall be held in respect of a person who is absent . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
