He noted that at the time , PERSON had not yet been the applicant \u2019s counsel . However , well aware that the applicant had committed serious criminal offences , PERSON had advised him what to do .

He had then advised the applicant to try to avoid arrest and , if that was not possible , to destroy his telephone and the ORG card , and to remain silent when questioned . In the investigator \u2019s opinion , by giving such advice , PERSON had been trying to hide his connections with the applicant and his knowledge of the criminal offences committed by him .

On DATE the ORG found that the legal services agreement of CARDINAL DATE stated that PERSON was to provide the applicant with legal assistance in the framework of criminal proceedings , without clearly identifying the criminal proceedings to which it related . The investigator had not been informed about that agreement .

When summoned by the applicant to assist him at the time of his arrest , he had refused to come and had offered to send another lawyer . That gave reasons to doubt that PERSON had been representing the applicant at the time in the present criminal proceedings . The investigator had subsequently removed PERSON as counsel for the applicant . PERSON had not , however , been called to testify against the applicant in breach of legal professional privilege .

It relied on the transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations with PERSON and PERSON , among other evidence , observing that the interception of the applicant \u2019s telephone communications had been authorised by a court . Having analysed the transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations with PERSON , it held as follows :", "\u201c The lawyer had not been formally admitted to provide legal assistance to [ the applicant ] at the time [ when the interception had taken place ] . His actions were considered by the investigator to be unlawful and served as a basis for the decision to remove [ PERSON ] as counsel for [ the applicant ] and for considering the question of opening criminal proceedings [ against PERSON ] . The court does not have any reason to believe that the information obtained as a result of [ intercepting the applicant \u2019s ] telephone communications with [ PERSON ] can not be used as evidence , given that the information in question has not become known to [ PERSON ] as a result of providing legal assistance to [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the conviction . It held , in particular , that the transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations with PERSON and PERSON had been correctly admitted as evidence . It further observed that the applicant \u2019s allegations of violations of his right to defence during the preliminary investigation had been examined by the first - instance court and had been rejected as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody . It held that he was suspected of particularly serious offences , did not have a permanent job , and that his assertions that he owned a family business were unconvincing . There were therefore sufficient reasons to believe that he might abscond , obstruct the course of justice , and continue his criminal activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ordered extensions of the applicant \u2019s detention , citing the need for further investigation , the gravity of the charges and the risks of the applicant absconding , putting pressure on witnesses and obstructing the course of justice . There were no factors relating to the applicant \u2019s character , state of health , family or other circumstances which would warrant release . The applicant did not appeal against those extension orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal case file was transferred to ORG for trial . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s and his co - defendants\u2019 detention during trial , referring to the gravity of the charges and the lack of permanent employment \u201c at the time of the commission of the crimes \u201d . It considered that the grounds which had served as the basis for the preventive measure remained valid . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s and his codefendants\u2019 detention , finding that the grounds which had served as the basis for the preventive measure remained valid and that there were therefore no reasons to change it . The trial could not proceed for objective reasons as it was necessary to wait for the results of a psychological expert examination of S. and for the transfer for questioning of CARDINAL prosecution witnesses against S.", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the above extension orders to ORG . He submitted that he had been permanently residing in GPE , that he had been working in the family business , that he had no previous convictions and that he had no intention of absconding from the authorities . The authorities had failed to substantiate their allegations that he might abscond or continue with his criminal activity . As regards the risk that he might put pressure on witnesses , it was no longer relevant as all the witnesses had already been questioned by the trial court . According to the applicant , the extension of his detention had been based solely on the gravity of the charges against him . The trial had been adjourned for reasons which were not related to his personal situation , but in order to carry out expert psychological examinations of CARDINAL of the co - accused and to ensure the transfer from GPE of CARDINAL prosecution witnesses who were to give evidence against that same co - accused . He asked to be released on bail or on his father \u2019s personal guarantee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE ORG upheld the above extension orders on appeal , referring to the gravity of the charges and the risks of the applicant absconding or putting pressure on witnesses . The fact that the witnesses had already been questioned was irrelevant because the applicant might still put pressure on them or otherwise obstruct the trial .", "CARDINAL .
