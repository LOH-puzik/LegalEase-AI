A non - commissioned officer who arrived at the scene immediately checked for a pulse and realised that Mr PERSON was still alive . At TIME he was taken to the infirmary in an ambulance .", "CARDINAL . DATE a First Lieutenant ( \u201c the military investigator \u201d ) carried out an inspection of the dormitory , drew a sketch of the place , questioned a number of PERSON colleagues and recorded their statements .", "CARDINAL . A pistol was found some distance away from the place where PERSON PERSON had fallen , but the exact distance is not specified in the sketch . The pistol had been cocked and had fired CARDINAL rounds but had failed to fire a third time . CARDINAL spent bullet cases and CARDINAL bullets \u2013 one of which was misshapen \u2013 were also found . It was established that the pistol belonged to CARDINAL of PERSON colleagues , expert sergeant PERSON , who had left it in his locker just outside the dormitory . According to a document drawn up by the military investigator , PERSON had obtained the pistol by smashing the padlock on the locker with a stick .", "CARDINAL . Expert sergeant PERSON , when questioned by the military investigator , stated that PERSON had stayed at the former \u2019s house TIME . Mr PERSON had been drunk and in an agitated state . PERSON had been concerned about PERSON state and had taken his pistol away from him and then hidden it in his house . When he had woken up in TIME , PERSON had already left the house , leaving his pistol behind . He had found PERSON in a restaurant , drinking . They had then gone to the barracks where PERSON had unsuccessfully asked expert sergeant PERSON for the key to GPE \u2019s locker . M.A. had then started to walk away but turned back when he heard a gunshot ; whereupon he saw PERSON on the floor , with a pistol next to his feet .", "CARDINAL .

Expert sergeant PERSON told the military investigator that , DATE TIME , he had been changing his clothes in front of his locker in the corridor when PERSON had approached him and asked him where PERSON \u2019s locker was .

When he had reached the dormitory he had seen Mr PERSON lying on the floor with his head bleeding .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL expert sergeants questioned by the military investigator and subsequently by the military prosecutor stated that they had been in their bunk beds in the dormitory when PERSON entered at TIME and asked them to get up and start work .

A number of PERSON colleagues told the military prosecutor that he had been feeling low for DATE and had been drinking a lot . He had fallen in love with a girl in DATE but his mother opposed their marriage .", "CARDINAL . Expert sergeant PERSON was the only person in the dormitory who claimed to have seen Mr PERSON shoot himself . He told the military investigator that he had seen and heard Mr PERSON fire once , using his right hand and aiming at the right side of his head . When he was subsequently questioned by the military prosecutor , he stated that he could not remember exactly how many shots he had heard as he had been in a state of shock . He added that , although he had been QUANTITY away from PERSON at the time , he had not actually seen PERSON shoot himself as he had covered his face with his hands .", "CARDINAL . According to a report prepared by the NORP public prosecutor DATE , the military authorities had requested him to assist them in the investigation by carrying out a preliminary examination of the body of Mr PERSON , who had died before his arrival at ORG . Mr PERSON \u2019s body was formally identified by his colleague , expert sergeant PERSON ..", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor and a doctor first examined PERSON clothes and observed that there were no bullet holes or any other marks on them . They observed a bullet entry hole on the left temple and a bullet exit hole on the right temple . A lack of gunpowder residue or burns on the skin next to the entry hole led the doctor to conclude that the shot had been fired at close but not at point - blank range . There were no other injuries on PERSON body .", "CARDINAL . During the examination the prosecutor and the doctor smelt alcohol emanating from PERSON body . Expert sergeant PERSON confirmed that Mr PERSON had been drinking that TIME . PERSON also informed the prosecutor and the doctor that PERSON had been right - handed and had always used his right hand when shooting during their military training .", "CARDINAL . The doctor secured plastic covers to PERSON hands to preserve them for a subsequent swab test . The body was then sent to ORG , where a post - mortem examination was carried out DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of that examination , the pathologist observed no gunpowder residue next to the bullet entry hole and concluded that the shooting had occurred at point - blank range . The bullet entry hole was QUANTITY above the left eyebrow . The exit hole was next to the right ear . There were burnt and un - burnt gunpowder particles inside the bullet entry hole .", "CARDINAL . A blood sample was found to contain no alcohol and the cause of death was established as the destruction of the brain . The pathologist also took swabs from PERSON hands for a forensic examination which found gunpowder residue on the outside of the deceased \u2019s right hand ( report of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military investigator concluded his investigation . In a CARDINAL - sentence conclusion , the military investigator stated that PERSON had \u201c committed suicide as a result of a sudden bout of depression \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A lieutenant , who was PERSON immediate commander and who knew him well , was recorded as stating that PERSON had been a very good soldier and that he had not had any psychological problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , who is one of the applicants and a brother of PERSON , asked the office of the military prosecutor for copies of the documents from the investigation file because the family had \u201c suspicions surrounding his death \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer for the applicants wrote to the office of the ORG military prosecutor and repeated the family \u2019s request for information and documents about the investigation into PERSON \u201c alleged suicide \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer for the applicants wrote to ORG and again asked for information about the investigation . The lawyer also stated in his letter that his clients had merely been informed by the military authorities that PERSON had committed suicide . However , neither he nor the family had been given any information or documents from the investigation file despite their written requests . The lawyer submitted that a number of anonymous telephone calls had been made to the mobile telephone which had been owned by PERSON and which had since been returned to the family . The callers had stated that PERSON PERSON had been murdered . The lawyer submitted that the lack of information about the investigation strengthened the family \u2019s conviction that PERSON had indeed been murdered .", "CARDINAL . A military prosecutor in ORG replied to the lawyer \u2019s letter on DATE , enclosing a copy of the post - mortem report . The prosecutor stated that , as the investigation was still continuing , no decisions had been taken yet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor in ORG decided to close the investigation . He concluded that PERSON had shot himself in the \u201c right temple and at close range \u201d because his mother had opposed his marriage to his girlfriend . He had thus been feeling unhappy . No one had helped him to commit suicide .", "CARDINAL . The military prosecutor \u2019s decision is largely devoted to notes reproduced from a notebook which had apparently been found among Mr PERSON \u2019s personal belongings following his death . Some of the notes are confused and resemble a suicide note .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an objection to the military prosecutor \u2019s decision to close the investigation . They pointed out , inter alia , that gunpowder residue had been found on PERSON right hand but the bullet entry hole had been on the left side of the head . According to the applicants , it was improbable that a person would commit suicide by shooting himself in the left side of the head with his right hand . Furthermore , they drew attention to the failure to determine the distance between the place where the pistol was found and the place where PERSON had fallen . They also pointed to the fact that the military prosecutor had not investigated the conflicting statements made by the officers who had witnessed the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a military court rejected the objection lodged by the applicants , considering that all necessary investigative steps had already been taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote to the ORG military prosecutor \u2019s office and asked for the investigation to be reopened . In their request they repeated their above - mentioned arguments and added that they had not been consulted during the investigation . They also argued that the case file should have been sent to ORG with a view to obtaining that ORG opinion as to whether it would have been possible for PERSON to commit suicide by shooting himself in the left side of the head with his right hand . They pointed out that the pistol used in the incident had been semi - automatic , meaning that the trigger had to be pulled for each shot and , as such , it would not have been possible for PERSON to shoot himself a second time after a bullet had already entered and exited his head . Nevertheless , according to the investigation , the pistol was found cocked and it was established that it had failed to fire a third time . To try to shoot himself a third time , they maintained , would have been impossible .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted in their request that neither the pistol nor the wooden stick allegedly used to smash the padlock on GPE \u2019s locker , nor the locker itself , had been examined for fingerprints to establish whether Mr PERSON \u2019s fingerprints were on them .", "CARDINAL . They asked the military prosecutor to carry out another investigation with a view to eliminating these unresolved issues and to determine with certainty whether PERSON had been killed or had committed suicide as alleged . They maintained that , even assuming that PERSON had committed suicide , those responsible for the failure to ensure his psychological wellbeing should be prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not receive any information about the outcome of their application for a reopening of the investigation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
