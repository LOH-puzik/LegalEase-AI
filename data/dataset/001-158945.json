The police officers who subsequently arrived at the scene informed the soldiers that it could be the body of PERSON , whose disappearance had been reported to them by his family .", "CARDINAL . NORP The local prosecutor arrived at the scene at TIME on DATE and gave instructions for the deceased \u2019s body to be taken to the hospital in PERSON , where it was formally identified by Mr PERSON \u2019s brother , PERSON , who also informed the prosecutor that after his brother had failed to come home the previous evening the family had telephoned the local police at TIME because they feared that he might have been abducted . He added that his deceased brother had been a prominent figure in the town of GPE and that that had been the reason for the family \u2019s suspicions that he might have been abducted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Ep\u00f6zdemir \u2019s body was examined by CARDINAL doctors , who noted that there was a bullet entry hole on the face and a corresponding exit hole on the back of the head .

On DATE the ORG prosecutor opened an investigation file into the killing and informed ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG police headquarters sent a letter to the governor \u2019s office in the town of G\u00fcroymak , in whose administrative jurisdiction the body had been found , and asked the governor whether the applicants\u2019 relative had been in FAC DATE and whether they had any information about anyone in G\u00fcroymak who might have harboured hostile feelings towards Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant asked the ORG prosecutor whether there had been an outstanding arrest warrant in respect of his father . On DATE the prosecutor informed the second applicant that no such warrant had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor decided that he did not have the requisite jurisdiction ratione materiae to investigate the case and forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG , which did have jurisdiction to investigate such offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor at ORG sent a letter to the ORG prosecutor and asked him to resume his investigation into the killing and to inform him DATE about developments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sent letters to the offices of the PERSON and ORG prosecutors and asked to be provided with information regarding the steps taken in the investigation over the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office decided that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci to investigate the incident and forwarded the ORG letter ( mentioned in the preceding paragraph ) to the office of the prosecutor in ORG . On DATE the ORG prosecutor decided that his office did not have jurisdiction ratione loci either and sent the letter to the prosecutor \u2019s office in G\u00fcroymak .

On DATE the prosecutor also issued a standing search order and asked the G\u00fcroymak prosecutor to continue to search for the perpetrators and to inform his office DATE about developments .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the G\u00fcroymak prosecutor instructed the local gendarmerie to search for the perpetrators until DATE ( the date of the expiry of the time - limit prescribed by the statute of limitations ) . On DATE and DATE a number of gendarmes visited the place where the body had been found in DATE and noted that there was no evidence there to help solve the killing .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicants brought compensation proceedings against ORG . In their petition the applicants argued that the perpetrators of the killing had not been found , despite the fact that DATE had elapsed since the incident . They submitted that their relative had been a well - liked person in ORG and that he had never had any problems with anyone . The applicants argued that GPE were responsible for protecting their ORG lives and that in the event that they failed to do so , they had a duty to find and punish the perpetrators of any resultant unlawful death ; otherwise they themselves should be held responsible for such loss of life . The applicants also submitted that , because of the failure to find and punish the perpetrators of the killing of PERSON , they had suffered immeasurable pain and stress and the ORG had thus an obligation to compensate them for the damage that they had sustained . They argued that the ORG \u2019s liability arose from its failure to protect the deceased \u2019s life . In any event , even if no such failure could be said to have occurred , they further argued that the ORG nevertheless had an \u201c absolute liability \u201d to compensate them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police headquarters informed ORG , in response to an apparent query from the latter , that the applicants\u2019 relative , PERSON , had never requested protection from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to award compensation to the applicants , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It held that when carrying out their duties the public authorities had an obligation to take the necessary measures and to show due diligence in doing so . In the present case the public authorities had failed to comply with that obligation .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of the ORG appealed , arguing that it had not failed in that obligation because the reason for the killing and the identity of its perpetrators had not yet been established .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not submit any observations in reply to those of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG because it considered that , given that the reason for the killing had not been established and the perpetrators had not been identified , no causal link could be said to exist between the damage caused by the killing and any actions on the part of the public authorities . It added that for the public authorities to be said to have failed in their obligation , it was necessary to establish that they had either not performed their duties at all , or had failed to perform them in a timely manner , or had performed them in an unsatisfactory fashion . ORG further held that the lack of the above - mentioned causal link also prevented the courts from awarding compensation to the family on the basis of the public authorities\u2019 \u201c absolute liability \u201d because the sole fact that the deceased had been a \u201c member of society \u201d was not sufficient . For it to be able to award compensation on the basis of the \u201c social risk doctrine \u201d it was a precondition for the damage to have arisen in a setting within which public servants were carrying out their duties .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG re - examined the case in the light of ORG decision and decided to reject the applicants\u2019 claim for compensation . In reaching its conclusion , the administrative court noted that the investigation into the killing was still ongoing and , in any event , the deceased had never sought protection from the ORG . It thus held that the public authorities had not acted in breach of their duties . It further held that , as the conditions of the \u201c social risk doctrine \u201d had not been satisfied , it was not possible to award compensation to the family on the basis of the ORG \u2019s \u201c absolute liability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision and argued that a citizen need not officially seek protection from the authorities in order to trigger the ORG \u2019s obligation to protect such a citizen \u2019s life . To argue otherwise would be at odds with the LAW and the international treaties to which GPE was a party . The applicants also submitted that at the time of the killing , a state of emergency had been declared in their part of the country ; this had created a climate that was conducive to the perpetration of such crimes . The fact that DATE after the killing the perpetrators had still not been identified was an indication that the public authorities had failed in their duties . The applicants maintained that the authorities had failed to take the necessary steps to prevent the attack on their relative and to find the perpetrators . ORG was therefore responsible for the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage arising from the failures on its part .", "CARDINAL . The appeal lodged by the applicants was rejected by ORG on DATE . A request made by the applicants for ORG decision to be rectified was also rejected , on DATE . The final decision was served on the applicants on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
