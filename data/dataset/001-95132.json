THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON ( hereafter \u201c the applicant institution \u201d ) is a foundation ( ORG ) possessing legal personality under GPE law and domiciled in GPE , GPE . It was represented before the ORG by Mr W.E. Pors , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant institution , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is an educational institution that provides adult education and secondary vocational training at a number of locations in the GPE area . Although primarily dependent on Government funding , the applicant institution is a private legal entity . In matters of funding and tuition fees , the applicant institution is bound by law .", "In so far as the applicant institution could not command income from private sources , it depended on Government grants paid by the Minister of Education , ORG ( Minister PERSON , ORG , \u201c the Minister \u201d ) ; the necessary powers were delegated to , and exercised by , a Deputy Minister ( staatssecretaris ) . The precise amount of public money payable to each educational institution was calculated DATE by dividing a sum of money budgeted for educational institutions collectively by the total number of students registered across the country and multiplying the resulting figure by the number of students per institution . A detailed formula was applied which made allowance for , among other things , individuals in part - time education .", "It was possible for students to register for CARDINAL course at the same time .", "On DATE and again on DATE the Deputy Minister granted Government funding to the applicant institution . The precise amounts were calculated in accordance with the law in force , based on information provided by the applicant institution itself .", "The applicant institution had in DATE reported a number of students as having registered for CARDINAL course , tuition fees for the additional courses to be met by it from its own budget instead of by the students themselves . The applicant institution admits that in actual fact there was no provision for additional tuition fees in its books .", "In DATE , following findings of irregularities , the Deputy Minister ordered an investigation into the accounting practices of educational institutions that provided adult education and secondary vocational training . All such educational institutions were asked to clarify their reporting practices . This investigation became known as the \u201c ORG \u201d ( PERSON ) .", "The applicant institution stated to the investigators , as relevant to the case before the ORG , that a number of students had entered for CARDINAL course at the same time . They were counted as separate students in respect of each course \u2013 meaning that , for the purpose of calculating the applicant institution \u2019s share of Government funds , a number of individual students were counted for DATE the additional tuition fees being covered by the applicant institution itself out of its private funds .", "The report of ORG , which synthesised the submissions of the various educational institutions , came out on DATE . It was forwarded to ORG in DATE .", "An investigating committee , known as the \u201c ORG \u201d after the name of its chairman PERSON ( a former member of ORG ) , was set up and tasked with , among other things , examining specific cases of abuse with a view to the recovery of monies paid to educational institutions in excess of their entitlement .", "In DATE and again in DATE the Deputy Minister responsible granted the applicant institution a share of the available funds based on the applicant institution \u2019s own figures .", "On DATE ORG published its report , entitled \u201c Share and share alike : Investigation into irregularities in the funding of higher education and secondary vocational education \u201d ( Eerlijk delen : NORP naar onregelmatigheden in de bekostiging van het hoger onderwijs en het middelbaar beroepsonderwijs ) , which among other things singled out particular educational institutions which had received funding in excess of their entitlement . The applicant institution was among those mentioned .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant institution that it had found the applicant institution to have received funding unlawfully and would advise the Deputy Minister to recover the sums concerned .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister gave a decision modifying the earlier decisions of DATE and DATE . This decision was based on the findings of ORG of which the applicant institution had been informed on DATE . It stated that the applicant institution had unlawfully waived tuition fees but had received Government funding in respect of the students concerned . The grants for DATE were reduced retrospectively , the applicant institution being ordered to repay MONEY ( ORG ) which would be set off against the funding due in DATE .", "The applicant institution submitted an administrative objection ( bezwaar ) to the Deputy Minister .", "A hearing was held before an advisory board on DATE . On DATE the Deputy Minister gave a decision dismissing the objection .", "The applicant institution appealed to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE .", "ORG gave its decision on DATE . It established as fact that the applicant institution had misreported the number of students and obtained government funding exceeding its entitlement , so that the Deputy Minister had , in principle , the right under section CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW ( Algemene wet bestuursrecht ) to reclaim the excess . Nonetheless ORG quashed the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision on the following grounds : the applicant institution \u2019s lack of good faith had not been proved ; the Deputy Minister had been aware of the applicant institution \u2019s reporting methods ( or ought to have been so aware ) at the time when the subsidies were granted ; and the repayment order was disproportionate in the light of , firstly , a policy rule according to which repayment would not be demanded if it could be shown from bookkeeping records that the additional tuition fees were adequately covered by the applicant institution itself using funds obtained from non - governmental sources , and secondly , the finding that the applicant institution \u2019s income from non - governmental sources appeared adequate and the students concerned had actually followed the courses , so that there was no misapplication of public funds .", "The Deputy Minister appealed to the final appellate Court : Administrative Jurisdiction Division ( Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . ORG appointed to hear the case included Councillor NORP , an ordinary councillor of ORG , and CARDINAL extraordinary councillors . It held a public hearing on DATE and gave its decision on DATE .", "ORG quashed ORG decision .", "It found as a matter of fact that the applicant institution did not deny having misreported the number of students to be counted for the Government subsidy .", "Admittedly the Deputy Minister had been aware of the applicant institution \u2019s misreporting as DATE when the report of the \u201c Self - Cleansing Investigation \u201d became available , but the funding decision of DATE antedated this report . The Deputy Minister had therefore been unaware of the said misreporting when the decision of DATE was taken , from which it followed that that decision could lawfully be reconsidered in the light of information subsequently becoming available .", "As regards the subsidy grant of DATE , it had transpired at ORG hearing that the funding decision had been provisional and might have to be revisited in the light of the outcome of further investigations , in particular the investigation of ORG . That being so the Deputy Minister had been entitled to reconsider the latter grant of subsidy also .", "The Deputy Minister \u2019s decision had not been disproportionate as that expression had to be understood in the light of ORG case - law . In particular , while it might have been the case that the applicant institution could have evaded its obligations to repay the excess subsidy by means of a simple administrative expedient , that was not a fact that the Deputy Minister had failed to take into account but which would have required a deviation from otherwise quite reasonable Government policy .", "ORG and LAW , as relevant and applicable at the time of the events complained of , provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
