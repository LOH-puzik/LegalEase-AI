AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The firm of PERSON , which at the material time was a limited partnership ( Kommanditgesellschaft ) and was subsequently converted into a limited company ( Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter PERSON ) , is based in GPE , GPE . Mr Zumtobel was its manager and sole shareholder .", "CARDINAL . The case concerns expropriation proceedings instituted with a view to the construction in the province of PERSON of a provincial highway , the L CARDINAL , intended as a bypass for part of the municipality of PERSON . It appears that the scheme in question dated back to DATE , but that opposition from local landowners had prevented its realisation .", "The authorities conducted an investigation into inter alia whether the projected road was compatible with the requirements of environmental protection ( ORG ) . The proposed route was published ( zur \u00f6ffentlichen Einsichtnahme aufgelegt ) and the file made available for consultation at the PERSON council offices from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW Landesstra\u00dfengesetz ) , on the initiative of ORG ) , expropriation proceedings relating to a parcel of land of CARDINAL belonging to the LOC partnership were opened on DATE . The expropriation would have had the effect of dividing the first applicant \u2019s property , which covered an area of some CARDINAL,CARDINALmCARDINAL , into CARDINAL parcels of approximately CARDINAL and CARDINAL,CARDINALmCARDINAL .", "The authorities consulted several experts . The first applicant repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested to be allowed to study various documents in the file , namely a report of ORG ( ORG ) , an expert report on the environmental implications , the decision taken by the local authorities of ORG , GPE and PERSON on the proposed section of the road , and an opinion of the environmental department of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG ( Amt der Landesregierung ) , attended by its chairman , the first applicant \u2019s lawyer , and CARDINAL of its official experts ( PERSON ) , specialising in environmental protection , highways and road traffic respectively . They submitted their reports and made additional observations . According to the highways expert and the road traffic expert , the proposed section of highway was important because it would improve traffic links between PERSON and PERSON , which went through densely populated built - up areas .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an order for expropriation and fixed compensation at QUANTITY . At the same time it dismissed CARDINAL requests by the first applicant , CARDINAL for full details of the planning procedure for the L CARDINAL , and the other for the appointment of an independent road traffic expert to assess whether the planned road was necessary . The ORG considered the first request to be irrelevant to the case ; as to the second , it stated that the official expert had not shown any bias in favour of the authorities and had submitted a convincing report .", "CARDINAL . LOC partnership thereupon applied to ORG ) . It claimed that the expropriation proceedings , which were subject to final review by ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) and ORG , had violated its right of access to a court with full jurisdiction , guaranteed inter alia by LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . It also alleged that there had been a breach of the principle of equality of arms , as the ORG had heard its own experts but refused to consult independent ones .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the conclusion of a hearing held in private ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , Bundes- Verfassungsgesetz ) , ORG decided not to entertain the application since , in view of its case - law on LAW and the authorities\u2019 discretion in determining the routes of highways , the application did not have sufficient prospects of success . Moreover , the alleged violations resulted at the most from the erroneous application of an ordinary law ( einfaches PERSON ) and their examination did not involve any constitutional considerations . Finally , the case did not fall outside ORG jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in ORG . Relying on substantially the same arguments as in ORG , it now complained of breaches of procedural and substantive law ; it also asked for an expert to be appointed .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE , after a purely written procedure ; the applicants had not asked it to hold a hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In the court \u2019s opinion , the complaint that the scheme objected to was not based on any reasonable overall plan was not enough to establish that the contested decision had been unlawful . The court added as follows :", "\" In the context of the power of review conferred on it by LAW ( PERSON ) , ORG can not hold to be unlawful the fact that the respondent authority had regard to road traffic requirements and based its decision principally on the consideration that no other more appropriate solution - than the construction of the proposed section of the L CARDINAL over the land in issue - was possible . As can be seen from the findings of fact in the contested decision , the respondent authority took the view that it was in the interests of road users to divert through- traffic from the NORP built - up area , which at the same time would create a useful addition to the existing road network in the NORP area . \"", "The court held that the applicant partnership had also failed to cast doubt on the official experts\u2019 reports such as could disclose a procedural irregularity capable of affecting the decision . The fact that ORG had not made the commencement of construction work for the L CARDINAL subject to a final decision on the length of the route was not incompatible with LAW . Contrary to the applicant partnership \u2019s arguments , the ORG had indeed taken environmental protection into account when assessing the various relevant interests . The commencement of expropriation proceedings before the adoption of a decree ( ORG ) defining inter alia the route and length of the highway and the failure to consult the association of local authorities ( Gemeindeverband ) of PERSON did not vitiate the impugned decision either . As for compensation in kind ( GPE ) or an exchange of land ( ORG ) , the documents in the case showed that these had not been available as alternative solutions . Finally , the fact that notice of the hearing of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not been given in ORG ( PERSON ) could not have infringed the applicant partnership \u2019s rights , as it had been directly notified of the hearing .", "The court also rejected the complaints relating to the hearing of the official experts . It noted to begin with that the ORG was obliged to consult them , under LAW of DATE ( ORG , \" the DATE Law \" ) . The court considered that mere general remarks on the independence of official experts were not enough to prove a specific legitimate doubt for the purposes of LAW ) , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of the DATE Law . The fact that such an expert took part in proceedings to which the GPE was a party did not , unless there were special circumstances , constitute a serious reason within the meaning of the DATE Law to doubt his complete impartiality . In the absence of any formal requirement , there was nothing to prevent a written record being made of an orally delivered expert report , without the expert having to supplement it in writing . Nor had the authorities been obliged to summon the parties to attend the inquiry ( GPE ) .", "With reference to the complaints of lack of access to the case file , the court stated that it could not find that the ORG had disregarded procedural rules , compliance with which could have led to a different decision . As the applicant partnership had not been a party to the environmental protection proceedings ( GPE ) , it could not claim a right of access to that file . As to ORG report , the observations of the department for planning and the environment ( Raumplanungs- bzw . GPE ) and those of the relevant local authorities , there was nothing to show that these documents could have been material to the applicant partnership \u2019s case or that the ORG had based its decision on them . The report of expert PERSON had been included in the expropriation proceedings file but , contrary to the applicant partnership \u2019s arguments , the authorities were not obliged by law to supply photocopies of the entire case file or of certain documents in it .", "ORG also found that there had been no breach of LAW and declined to refer the matter to ORG .", "With regard to the request for an independent expert to be appointed to report inter alia on \" the economic viability , the reasonableness and hence the lawfulness \" of the proposed route of the L CARDINAL , the court cited a judgment given by an enlarged chamber in DATE and stated :", "\" [ That judgment shows that ] ORG is not allowed , in a case which has been before the respondent administrative authority , to put itself in the place of that authority and take evidence , which the latter may have omitted to take , or to supplement the investigation by itself taking investigative measures to establish the facts . ORG can , however , take evidence in order to determine whether an essential procedural requirement has been breached , and it is therefore entitled to take investigative measures in order to establish whether a procedural defect is essential or whether the respondent authority could have reached a different decision if that procedural defect had been avoided ; it can also do so for the purpose of reviewing the assessment of the evidence . In view of the above findings with reference to the weighing up by the respondent authority of the interests at stake and the facts on which its decision was based , however , ORG sees no reason to order the investigative measure sought . \"", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had meanwhile applied to ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) to determine the amount of compensation . On CARDINAL DATE this was set at CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) .", "On DATE , on appeal ( PERSON ) to ORG ( PERSON ) , the amount was reduced to ORG CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( Revisionsrekurs ) against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON expropriation for the purpose of construction of a provincial highway can take place only after ORG has issued a decree giving a brief description of the route of the highway and stating its approximate length ( LAW . Landowners who are affected by the measure can , once the plan has been made public , contest its appropriateness before the administrative authorities , and then challenge the decree in ORG .", "Such an expropriation is permissible only if it is not possible to construct or retain a section of highway which is more suitable from the point of view of traffic requirements , environmental protection and the financial implications ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On an application ( Beschwerde ) ORG will determine whether an administrative decision ( Bescheid ) has infringed a right guaranteed to the applicant under LAW or whether the decision applied a decree ( Verordnung ) contrary to the law , a law contrary to LAW or an international treaty incompatible with NORP law ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , ORG has jurisdiction to hear inter alia applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON ) reads as follows :", "\" In so far as ORG does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority \u2019s lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) , sub - paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ... , it must examine the contested decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ...
