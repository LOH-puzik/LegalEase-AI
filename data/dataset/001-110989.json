De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr Todor PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON V. Panayotov , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are father and daughter . The second applicant suffers from severely impaired hearing , an anxiety disorder and hypochondria . In DATE she was classified as PERCENT disabled and since then has been in receipt of a disability pension . She lives with the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date after DATE the applicants were charged with defrauding CARDINAL individuals by purporting to sell them a flat which they had already sold to others . In DATE , in the course of the trial , the defrauded individuals brought claims for damages . It is unclear whether at that stage of the proceedings the applicants were legally represented .", "CARDINAL . During the trial ORG ordered an expert report on the second applicant \u2019s mental health at the time of the alleged offence and on her fitness to stand trial . The experts , a psychiatrist and a psychologist , stated that she suffered from an anxiety disorder which presented as emotional instability and irritability which , however , did not amount to psychosis , and concluded that at the time of the alleged offence she had been able to understand the nature of her actions and to control them . She was also judged able to take part in the proceedings and to give evidence . The experts further observed that she suffered from severe hearing loss and difficulties in articulation due to missing teeth , which had hampered their communication with her . On the basis of previous medical reports in respect of the second applicant , the experts also observed that her relations with the first applicant had at times been strained .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found both applicants guilty of fraud and sentenced them each to DATE suspended imprisonment . In addition , it ordered them to pay damages to the civil parties .", "CARDINAL . All parties appealed . The first applicant and the civil parties were represented by counsel , but the second applicant was not . In her appeal , the second applicant alleged that her conviction was wrongful and had been tainted by breaches of the rules of procedure , and that her sentence was too harsh . At the hearing , which took place TIME and TIME on DATE , ORG appointed counsel for the second applicant with reference to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , it did not specify whether the appointment of counsel was necessary because of the applicant \u2019s mental disorder or because of her hearing impairment .", "CARDINAL . In her closing speech , the courtappointed counsel argued that the sentence imposed on the second applicant was too harsh and should be reduced in view of her state of health and the numerous mitigating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction and sentence , as well as the award of damages to the civil parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a court bailiff served notice of the judgment on the second applicant , who undertook to transmit it to the first applicant . However , according to the first applicant she did not do so within the statutory DATE time - limit for appealing on points of law , which expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested ORG to extend the time - limit for appealing on points of law . He asserted that he had not been duly notified of the judgment , as notice of it had been served solely on the second applicant , in breach of the rules of procedure .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the request at a hearing held on DATE . The first applicant was represented by counsel . The second applicant was absent and was not legally represented . The court , considering that the applicants had conflicting interests and noting that the second applicant was absent , decided to appoint counsel for her . In her closing speech , the court - appointed counsel argued that the request was unfounded and that the second applicant had not been negligent with regard to the delivery of the notice to her father . The court observed that all previous summonses and notices to the applicants had been served on the second applicant in her capacity as the daughter of the first applicant and not as a co - accused . This had been in line with the relevant rules of procedure and there was no reason to find that the notice in question had not been properly served .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against that ruling to ORG . The court heard the case on DATE . The public prosecutor supported the appeal , arguing that it was open to doubt whether the notice had really been transmitted to the first applicant . He also said that extending the time - limit for appealing on points of law would be consistent with the first applicant \u2019s defence rights .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that the notice of ORG judgment had been served in accordance with the applicable rules . The second applicant was an adult . This fact , as well as her relationship to the first applicant , had been noted in the certificate of service . The applicants did not have conflicting interests . It was true that the second applicant suffered from neurasthenia , but , according to the expert report drawn up during the trial , this had not prevented her from understanding the nature of her criminal act and bearing responsibility for it . In their appeals against the first - instance court \u2019s judgment the applicants had not mentioned any mental - health problems affecting the second applicant . Moreover , all earlier notices and summonses to the first applicant had been served on him through the second applicant without this being the source of any problems .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d ) , as worded at the material time , provided that the participation of defence counsel in the proceedings was mandatory if the accused suffered from a physical or mental handicap preventing them from conducting their defence in person . The participation of counsel was also mandatory if CARDINAL or more accused had conflicting interests and CARDINAL of them was legally represented ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , or if the case was heard in the accused \u2019s absence ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . As a rule , process had to be served personally ( LAW ) . If the addressee was absent , it could be handed to an adult member of his or her household , and if there was no such individual , to the building caretaker , a flatmate , or a neighbour , if he or she undertook to deliver it to the addressee ( LAW ) . If the process was addressed to an accused and it was impossible to serve it in the manner described it could be handed to his or her defence counsel ( LAW ) . The process server had to note on the receipt the name and address of the individual through whom the process was being served , as well as his or her relationship to the addressee ( LAW ) . An individual who undertook to deliver process to the addressee and failed to do so could be fined up to MONEY ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A statutory time - limit could be extended , after its expiry , if it had been missed for a valid reason ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CCP DATE ) . The court had to examine the matter at a public hearing in the presence of the parties ( LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
