FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practicing in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant has a son , PERSON , born in DATE out of wedlock . The applicant stopped cohabiting with PERSON \u2019s mother , PERSON , shortly after PERSON \u2019s birth . A. was granted sole custody of PERSON and no access arrangements were made for the applicant . It appears that the applicant had barely any contact with his son in his early childhood .", "Due to A. \u2019s unstable life , child welfare officials intervened to give her support in caring for PERSON from DATE . In DATE , PERSON , then aged DATE , was taken into public care for DATE and placed with a substitute family ( S .- V. ) , who lived QUANTITY away from the applicant \u2019s home . Since then , this family has provided PERSON with support and respite and holiday care . In DATE started psychological therapy .", "On DATE , A. was hospitalised and PERSON moved to live with the S .- V. family . DATE died . PERSON continued to live with PERSON Around that time the applicant began to visit PERSON regularly , and it appears that PERSON began to stay with him every other DATE .", "On DATE , the local ORG ( sosiaalilautakunta , socialn\u00e4mnden ) decided to take LOC into public care pursuant to LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslagen ) and ordered that he be placed with the S .- V. family . It appears that the applicant consented to the care order , and did not appeal against it .", "Meanwhile , ORG instituted proceedings before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that custody of PERSON be granted to his foster parents . During the proceedings , the applicant applied for custody .

In addition , the visits between the applicant and PERSON had taken place without difficulty .", "In DATE the applicant requested ORG to remove his son from public care . ORG asked for a report on the applicant \u2019s circumstances from ORG of the applicant \u2019s home municipality . According to the report , the applicant had been unwilling , or unable , to cooperate . The social welfare officials considered that were PERSON to live with his father , his care , upbringing , supervision and other needs might not be guaranteed . They were not convinced that PERSON would be better off with his father . PERSON \u2019s psychiatrist , Dr. PERSON , filed an opinion with ORG , in which she reported that PERSON did not want to decide where he should live , but had said that he did not want further changes in his life and wished to continue going to the same school with his friends .", "It appears that the applicant was invited to participate in CARDINAL preparatory meetings held by ORG on DATE and DATE . The applicant did not attend .", "On DATE , ORG decided to refuse the request . It considered that the circumstances justifying PERSON \u2019s continued public care still existed .", "The applicant continued to meet PERSON regularly . It appears that although he was granted a right to have PERSON live with him for CARDINAL extended periods in DATE and DATE , for reasons attributable to the applicant the visits did not in fact take place .", "The applicant challenged the care decision before ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . He claimed that public care was contrary to PERSON \u2019s interests . Further , the fact that he was PERSON \u2019s biological father had been neglected in the decision - making . He maintained that if the decision had been based on the fact that he had never lived with PERSON , it was deficient since he had never been given that possibility .", "ORG submitted a statement to the court to which the applicant filed a response . Upon the request of the applicant , ORG held an oral hearing on DATE . In the hearing the applicant maintained that PERSON should live with him . He claimed that cooperation between the social welfare officials and the substitute family had been difficult . The court took evidence from a social worker , PERSON , who stressed inter alia that PERSON had been provided with child welfare services since DATE . She also considered that cooperation with the applicant had been difficult and that he was socially restricted . The foster mother , PERSON , told the court that the applicant had never visited them and that PERSON had developed significantly during his stay with the substitute family . PERSON , then aged DATE , expressed the view that he would like to live with his father , although he had good relations with his foster parents and the other children living in the substitute family .", "ORG upheld the decision on DATE . It found that the mere fact that the applicant had been granted custody of PERSON was not conclusive of the public care in issue . It went on to find that the applicant was reported as having been uncooperative with the social welfare officials , who could not rely on him to take DATE responsibility for QUANTITY As M. had had difficult experiences and had suffered bereavement in his childhood , ORG concluded that , in its assessment , the continuation of public care in the substitute family was in PERSON \u2019s best interests .", "On DATE , a care plan meeting was held at the home of the substitute family . According to the Government , the social welfare official reported that the applicant had behaved inappropriately at the meeting . This was contested by the applicant .", "ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , having obtained written submissions from ORG and the applicant , upheld the public care decision on DATE .", "In DATE M. lived with the applicant for DATE . He refused to return to the S .- V. family and on DATE , he was placed in a children \u2019s foster home . When the re - placement was considered by ORG , PERSON did not object , and nor did he express the wish to live with the applicant . The applicant did not attend a preparatory hearing although allegedly invited . PERSON spent DATE with the applicant over DATE .", "For an account of domestic law see PERSON and T. v.

DATE amended ) provides that ORG must take a child into care and provide substitute care for him or her if ( a ) the child \u2019s health or development is seriously endangered by lack of care or other conditions at home , or if the child seriously endangers his or her health and development by alcohol or drug abuse , by committing an illegal act other than a minor offence or by any other comparable behaviour ; ( b ) the measures of assistance in open care are not appropriate or have proved to be inadequate ; and ( c ) substitute care is considered to be in the best interests of the child .", "According to section QUANTITY , ORG must discharge a child from care when there is no longer any need for the care or substitute placement referred to in section CARDINAL , unless such discharge is clearly contrary to the best interests of the child . In determining the best interests of the child , the duration of the substitute care , the relationship between the child and the persons providing the substitute care , and the contacts between the child and his parents shall be taken into account ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
