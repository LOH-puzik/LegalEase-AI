NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented successively by their Agents , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to the NORP police headquarters for questioning in relation to fraud charges . He was suspected , together with GPE , his business associate , of having written cheques to be drawn on the bank account of the company they owned together , despite being aware that there was no money in that account . In the absence of a lawyer , the applicant gave a statement and maintained that he had acted in accordance with the law at all times . At TIME , after he gave this statement , the police informed the applicant that he was accused ( \u00eenvinuit ) , according to domestic law . The applicant waived his right to have an appointed lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before a prosecutor . He gave a new statement in the presence of a lawyer who had been appointed to represent him . It appears from the documents in the file that he maintained his initial statement . He was then placed under arrest and taken to the cells of Bihor police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a complaint that the applicant had lodged against the arrest warrant was allowed and ORG ordered his immediate release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was summoned to appear in front of the prosecutor for further questioning . On that occasion , he was again placed in pre - trial detention . He was subsequently released on DATE , following a decision of ORG allowing a challenge to his arrest brought by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before being released , on DATE he was transferred to FAC , where his head was shaved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was committed for trial and the case was registered with ORG . On DATE the county court fixed a new date for the start of the trial , because the summons had not been served on the applicant at the correct address . On CARDINAL DATE following a written request from the applicant , the trial was again postponed to CARDINAL June DATE . On DATE , the applicant was absent from the trial hearing but his lawyer was present . The county court questioned GPE and dismissed further requests for witnesses to be heard made by GPE and the prosecutor , holding that the written evidence in the file was a sufficient basis on which to decide the case . It proceeded to judge the case , convicting the applicant of having been an accessory to fraud and sentencing him to six years\u2019 imprisonment . In so ruling , the county court mainly relied on the parties\u2019 submissions and on the commercial and accounting evidence adduced before it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal . On DATE ORG examined the case by calling , at the applicant \u2019s request , one witness and also hearing the parties\u2019 submissions . The applicant was present on this occasion . On DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant of all charges , holding that the first - instance court had erred in its interpretation of the evidence as to the applicant \u2019s guilt . It considered that the simple fact that the applicant had written CARDINAL cheques following the instructions of his co - accused did not indicate that he was guilty , as long as he had not been aware that the cheques could not be cleared because of a lack of money in the account .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed . The case was heard by ORG on DATE . The applicant was present at the hearing and he was also represented by CARDINAL lawyers of his choosing . His lawyers presented arguments for dismissing the appeal on points of law . From the report of the hearing , it appears that the applicant made a concluding statement to the effect that he agreed with his ORG submissions .", "CARDINAL . In his application , the applicant maintained that both he and his coaccused had been heard by ORG . However , he submitted that he had only been asked CARDINAL questions during the hearing , namely : ( i ) if he was a business associate of his coaccused ; and ( ii ) if the new criminal proceedings pending against him also related to fraud . He also claimed that these CARDINAL questions , and his answers to them , were purposely omitted from the transcript of the hearing . The Government did not provide any clarification on that point .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the same date as the hearing , ORG delivered a final decision by which it found the applicant guilty , convicted him of having been an accessory to fraud and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It held that the evidence available in the case file was sufficient to indicate that the applicant had knowingly written the cheques and had been aware that there was no money in the account to clear them .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this final decision , the applicant started serving his prison sentence . He was conditionally released on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
