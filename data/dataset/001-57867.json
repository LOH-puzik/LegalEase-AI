SWEDEN (No. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , an agricultural engineer , is a NORP citizen . He lives at GPE , GPE .", "The applicant and his wife own land in the municipality of PERSON , on which there is a gravel pit . They held a permit to extract gravel from the pit from DATE until DATE , when the permit was revoked ; it had previously been extended on the understanding that the activities in question would be terminated and restoration work carried out on the land by DATE .", "The revocation of the permit , and the lack of a court remedy against this and a related measure , gave rise to an earlier case before the ORG , which held in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) that there had been a violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , but not of LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) taken either alone or in conjunction with LAW article CARDINAL+PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Following the revocation on DATE , the applicant applied to ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) for a special extraction permit , so that he could comply with a plan adopted by ORG on DATE for the restoration of the pit . The application was dismissed by ORG on DATE and an appeal by the applicant against this decision was rejected by ORG ( ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , seeking the annulment of the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , applied to ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) for review under LAW ( lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut GPE - \" LAW \" ) . He alleged that , by denying him a special extraction permit , the competent authorities had prevented him from taking measures to comply with the restoration plan ; the refusal contravened the principle of objectivity enshrined in LAW , section CARDINAL , of ORG ( regeringsformen , which forms part of the LAW ) . Moreover , contrary to the principle of proportionality and section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( naturv\u00e5rdslagen DATE ) , the authorities had gone beyond what was necessary in the interests of nature conservation , as well as other public and private interests . Their decision was also incompatible with the aim of nature conservation laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act . Finally , the only reply given by ORG to his question as to what steps he should take had been that the time - limit for restoration of the pit had expired ; he had thus been the victim of a denial of justice .", "In addition , the applicant asked ORG to hold an oral hearing in his case .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( beslut ) of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judges , dismissed the latter request by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , finding that there were no grounds under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for holding a hearing . As to the merits , on the basis of written observations submitted by the applicant and ORG , it concluded unanimously that the ORG \u2019s decision was not unlawful and confirmed it .", "According to TIME of deliberations on DATE , the CARDINAL judges who were in favour of a hearing had regard in particular to the fact that LAW had been enacted in order to ensure that NORP law complied with LAW and also with ORG case - law in this area ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They noted moreover that certain essential points of PERSON case remained unclear , since there was disagreement between him and ORG as to whether the above - mentioned restoration plan ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) required the further extraction of gravel from the pit or simply the moving of gravel within it . In addition they drew attention to the lack of clarity in PERSON plea against the Government .", "The same CARDINAL judges considered that the Government , like the applicant and ORG , should have submitted written observations on the case ; apart from their reasons for rejecting the applicant \u2019s appeal , they should have given their views on the above - mentioned issue of the need for further extraction of gravel and on whether their decision meant that PERSON had been prevented from restoring the pit in the prescribed manner after DATE .", "CARDINAL . It was not possible under NORP law for the applicant to appeal from ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW was introduced as a result of ORG findings in several cases , notably against GPE , that lack of judicial review of certain administrative decisions infringed LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention ( see , for instance , the GPE and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . DATE , paras . DATE ; the ORG v. GPE and the ORG v. GPE judgments of CARDINAL DATE , respectively Series A no . CARDINAL-A , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , paras . CARDINAL , and Series A no . PERSON , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . It was enacted as a temporary law to remain in force until DATE ; its validity was subsequently extended to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of this Act , a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the ORG or another public authority may , in the absence of any other remedy , apply to ORG , as the first and only judicial instance , for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis - \u00e0 - vis a private individual . The kind of administrative decision covered by the LAW is further defined in LAW , sections CARDINAL of ORG , to which section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . LAW specifies several types of decisions which fall outside its scope , none of which is relevant in the instant case .", "In proceedings brought under LAW , ORG examines whether the contested decision \" conflicts with any legal rule \" ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . According to the preparatory work to the LAW , as reproduced in Government PERSON ( pp . DATE ) , its review of the merits of cases concerns essentially questions of law but may , in so far as is relevant for the application of the law , extend also to factual issues ; it must also consider whether there are any procedural errors which may have affected the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . If ORG finds that the impugned decision is unlawful , it must quash it and , where necessary , refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , as applicable at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . The procedure before ORG is governed by LAW DATE . It is in principle a written procedure , but ORG may decide to hold an oral hearing on specific matters if this is likely to assist it in its examination of the case or to expedite the proceedings ( section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
