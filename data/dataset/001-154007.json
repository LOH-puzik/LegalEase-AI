According to information provided by the site managers , various LOC , including several dirt tracks , had been cemented over since the incident , with a view to keeping the soldiers\u2019 uniforms clean . The floors had not been raised during this work . This point was confirmed by measurements which established that the ceiling height was still QUANTITY , as it had been at the time of the incident .", "DATE . In the light of all the evidence gathered , the experts reached the following conclusion : PERSON had been sitting or crouching and was holding his rifle in his right hand ; while he was attempting to stand up by leaning on his weapon , and with his knees still bent , his hand had pulled the trigger and the shot had been fired .", "CARDINAL . During his visit to the site , the prosecutor questioned private GPE , the other soldiers on duty at the time of the incident having completed their military service .

CARDINAL ) , in which he set out the measures taken and responded to the shortcomings noted by the court . With regard to the traces of gunshot on the hands , he pointed out that the file contained an expert report indicating that gunshot residue was very volatile and that it could have moved from the dead man \u2019s clothes or hands to GPE \u2019s hands immediately after the incident . He added that several statements supported that hypothesis , in that they confirmed that PERSON had been in physical contact with the deceased when attempting to lift him up .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the court \u2019s observation that the firing position hardly corresponded to that of an individual who intended to commit suicide and its argument about the lack of a motive , the prosecutor stated that the decision not to prosecute contained no indication that the incident had been a suicide and , indeed , that the hypothesis of suicide had not been entertained .", "CARDINAL . As to determination of the bullet \u2019s trajectory in the light of the impact mark on the ceiling and the entry and exit wounds on the body , the prosecutor stated that the following hypothesis had been accepted : PERSON had been sitting on an ammunition box and playing with the rifle \u2019s cocking lever and magazine ; while he was holding the weapon , with the magazine removed and at an angle on his right side , he had leaned forward and towards his right side with the intention of using the rifle to support himself in standing up , his hand on the part of the weapon near the trigger , and the shot had gone off ; the bullet had entered through the right side of his neck and emerged under the lower edge of the left shoulder - blade , before hitting the ceiling ; thus , PERSON had not committed suicide , he had been the victim of an accident . The prosecutor added that he had organised a reconstruction of the scene on DATE in order to ascertain the credibility of this hypothesis , having regard to the bullet \u2019s entry and exit points , the point of impact on the ceiling and the deceased man \u2019s build , and that the conclusions of the reconstruction confirmed this sequence of events .", "CARDINAL . The record of the reconstruction of the incident was attached to this report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "DATE .
