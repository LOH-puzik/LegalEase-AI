NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Dr PERSON and Dr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant suffered from Attention - Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c ADHD \u201d ) , and was the subject of a treatment order . In view of the treatment order , he was being kept at ORG ( the ORG mental health hospital ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a shop in GPE , GPE , was burgled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of committing the burglary in question . The applicant was questioned at police headquarters and detained overnight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was arraigned before ORG ( as a ORG ) charged with aggravated theft and other related offences . During the arraignment procedure the applicant requested that he be released on bail , but this was refused . Since the applicant was the subject of a treatment order , the court ordered that he be kept under arrest at ORG . However , the applicant was kept under arrest at ORG rather than the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyers became aware that on CARDINAL DATE a certain ORG had admitted committing the burglary in PERSON ( of which the applicant had been accused ) , and that that person had , on DATE , confirmed his admission before ORG . On DATE , the applicant applied to ORG to be released on bail .", "CARDINAL . Later on CARDINAL DATE , the police inspector who had arrested the applicant was informed of ORG \u2019s arrest for the same incident the applicant had been accused of , and that ORG had admitted to committing the crime . The inspector communicated DATE with the Attorney General ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , who directed him to submit an urgent application to ORG for the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . At TIME DATE , in the light of the applicant \u2019s and the police \u2019s applications for his release on bail , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional release against a personal guarantee of CARDINAL ( ORG ) . He was forbidden to leave the country , approach witnesses or commit any other crimes . He was also obliged to sign in at the police station DATE and a curfew was imposed from TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the police withdrew the charges against the applicant . According to the applicant , he lost his right to the treatment order at ORG as a result of the arrest and arraignment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . He argued that he had been arraigned without there having been a reasonable suspicion against him . Moreover , on the basis of that arraignment he had been denied release on bail . The applicant further submitted that the Commissioner of Police , despite realising that the applicant had been detained for no reason ( because ORG had admitted to committing the crime the applicant had been accused of ) , had failed to withdraw immediately the accusations against the applicant . In the applicant \u2019s view , all those facts , either taken together or separately , had resulted in an infringement of his right to liberty under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction found that the applicant had not suffered any violation of his rights . The costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court held that it would not substitute its own discretion for that of the police . Its role was to analyse whether the police could have had a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crime , in the light of the evidence they had had before them at the time they had made the decision to arrest and eventually arraign the applicant . It noted firstly that when the applicant had been arraigned he had failed to contest the validity of his arrest . In determining whether the police could have had a sufficiently reasonable suspicion , the court considered factors , including , but not limited to : the fact that the police had received a tip - off / confidential information that the applicant had committed the crime ; ORG footage of the shop that had been held - up and ORG footage of some of the neighbours of the shop . According to the court , in the light of other information the police had had in its possession , it had been reasonable for them to conclude that the person seen in the footage was the applicant , especially given the similar build and hair style . Indeed , once the police had seen the applicant in person they had confirmed that he looked like the person in the ORG footage . Moreover , the court noted that , according to the police , the applicant \u2019s mother had failed to confirm that her son had been at home at TIME ( the time of the commission of the offence ) , leading the chief investigator to believe that he had no alibi for the time of the crime . Also , the police had found out that on DATE where the burglary occurred the applicant had been on leave from the hospital . In addition , the applicant \u2019s past had been taken into account , including : the fact that the applicant was known to the police as a person taking drugs ; that he had ongoing proceedings against him for theft with aggravated assault allegedly committed in DATE ; and that he had previously been found guilty of crimes related to theft and drug abuse . Furthermore , the police had discovered that on DATE of the hold - up the applicant had argued with his mother about money and drugs - related issues . Taking all those factors into account , ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction confirmed the existence of a reasonable suspicion and thus a justification for the arrest .", "CARDINAL . It also concluded that the ORG of GPE refusal to grant the applicant release on bail had not been unreasonable . ORG had considered the applicant \u2019s regular visits to ORG ; his past involvement in crimes involving violence ; and factors associated with the risk and gravity of the crime at issue .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the criminal proceedings against him had not been withdrawn immediately upon ORG \u2019s arrest and admission to the crime , the court noted that the only person who could have shed light on what had happened was the inspector , but he had not been produced as a witness . Nevertheless , based on the evidence before it , the court observed that as soon as the inspector who had carried out the applicant \u2019s arrest had found out that another person ( ORG ) had been arrested for the same crime , he had requested direction from the ORG . The inspector had then proceeded to submit an urgent application to ORG for the applicant \u2019s release . The first time a third person had come into the scene had been on DATE , when ORG had been arraigned . The applicant had been released from detention DATE . In the light of those facts the court concluded that there had been no failings by the police . It noted that LAW concerned protection from arbitrary arrest or detention and that the applicant had been released on DATE . The fact that the accusations against the applicant had only formally been withdrawn on CARDINAL DATE did not raise any issue under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He reiterated his claims and argued , inter alia , that there had been no reason for ORG to fear that he would not attend court proceedings , or that he would in any way influence the proceedings against him because he had been undergoing a treatment order at ORG . The applicant also stated that the police had found out about ORG \u2019s involvement in the hold - up on DATE but had waited until DATE ( when ORG had been arraigned before ORG and had pleaded guilty to the charges ) to take action towards remedying the applicant \u2019s situation . He argued that the police were obliged to remedy a situation of unlawful detention as soon as they became aware of it , as was also contemplated under LAW . He complained that as a result of their delay he had spent DATE in detention and had later been subject to conditional release .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld his claims in part . It found a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights as protected under LAW ( c ) of LAW CARDINAL ) of the LAW for the limitation of liberty the applicant had suffered DATE and CARDINAL DATE , but rejected his other complaints . It awarded him CARDINAL as compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court confirmed the first - instance court \u2019s finding in respect of the existence of a reasonable suspicion justifying arrest which had persisted until the applicant \u2019s arraignment before ORG . The applicant had thus not suffered a violation of his rights protected by LAW ) of the LAW during that period .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that until DATE the applicant \u2019s situation had remained the same as on DATE . However , it had changed on CARDINAL DATE , when a third party had been arraigned before ORG for the same crime . ORG observed that as soon as the inspector responsible for the applicant \u2019s arrest had been informed that another person had been arrested for the same offence the inspector had taken action . On DATE , as requested by both the police and the applicant himself , ORG had ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional release . The applicant had been released DATE , against a personal guarantee . ORG found that the amount of time that had passed between the third party being arrested and the applicant \u2019s release had been reasonable . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s detention until his release on DATE had not been arbitrary and had not violated his rights protected under LAW ( c ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the same could not be said of the period DATE , during which the prosecution had no longer held a reasonable suspicion against the applicant . At that point , the restriction of liberty had , according to ORG , no longer been justified under LAW ( c ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In awarding compensation , ORG considered that the applicant had contributed to the violation himself by only requesting conditional release on DATE , rather than unconditional release . The court ordered the applicant to pay DATE of the costs of the proceedings before the first - instance court and ORG and the Commissioner of Police to pay DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
