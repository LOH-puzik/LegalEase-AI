The applicant was born in DATE . He is presently detained in the NORP prison .", "CARDINAL . During the DATE period the applicant was convicted CARDINAL times of various offences : theft , car theft , deserting military duties and possession of narcotic drugs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant fled GPE to GPE , travelling through the former GPE and GPE on a NORP passport . The applicant submits that he left GPE on DATE , but according to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) he committed a rape on DATE and an attempted rape on DATE , both offences taking place in GPE . In DATE the applicant settled in GPE , where he lived until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant on charges of rape . There is no indication \u2013 and it has not been argued by the Government \u2013 that the applicant was notified of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were stayed , most probably because the applicant was abroad . The proceedings resumed on DATE and thereafter were conducted in the applicant 's absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted an indictment against the applicant to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court held a hearing on DATE . The applicant was represented by an ex officio counsel , as mandated by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of rape and attempted rape and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court found that on DATE the applicant had decoyed a PERSON , who vaguely knew him , into following him into a house , where he had threatened and beaten her into having sexual intercourse with him . The court also found that on DATE the applicant had decoyed , in a similar manner , an acquaintance of his , ORG , had likewise threatened and heavily beaten her and had cut her with a knife . She had , however , managed to break out , thus avoiding sexual intercourse with the applicant . The court based its findings of fact on the testimony of PERSON , PERSON , PERSON husband , CARDINAL other witnesses , medical reports and other written evidence , including CARDINAL notes written by the applicant himself .", "CARDINAL . No appeal having been lodged against the judgment , it came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG casefile , containing all documents relevant to the proceedings , was destroyed . Only a copy of the judgment was kept in the archive of the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted a copy of the judgment to the police with a view to the applicant 's apprehension for the purpose of enforcing his sentence . The letter accompanying the judgment stated that the applicant was believed to be in GPE , but his exact whereabouts were unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a copy of the judgment to ORG with a view to the applicant 's extradition from GPE . On DATE ORG wrote back to ORG , stating that the legal cooperation treaty between GPE and GPE contained no provisions for assistance in criminal cases , and that therefore there was no possibility to request the applicant 's extradition from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a second copy of the judgment to the police with instructions to enforce it in the event the applicant returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police issued a nationwide search warrant for the applicant . ORG was also requested to establish the applicant 's whereabouts , apparently to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant came back to GPE , to visit relatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he went to a police station in GPE to renew his driver 's licence . DATE he was arrested and taken to a prison facility to start serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed with ORG a request for release . He argued that the tenyear limitation period for the enforcement of his sentence had expired in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request , holding that the DATE limitation period had been interrupted on several occasions and had therefore not expired . The latest interruption had taken place on DATE , which was DATE before DATE of the applicant 's arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , holding that actions had been undertaken for the enforcement of the applicant 's sentence in DATE and in DATE . Therefore , the running of the limitation period had been interrupted and a new period had started to run in DATE , due to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , submitting that the actions which had been undertaken during the DATE period had not in fact had the effect of interrupting the running of the limitation period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal , holding that the running of the limitation period for the enforcement of a sentence was interrupted by every act of the competent authorities aimed at its enforcement . These acts could be legal acts , or organisational , or technical acts . During the DATE period the competent authorities had undertaken a number of acts for enforcing the applicant 's sentence . In particular , a copy of the judgment had been sent to the police in DATE and a nationwide search warrant had been issued for the applicant in DATE . These had had the effect of interrupting the running of the limitation period .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , holding that the running of the limitation period had been interrupted on several occasions and that therefore it had not expired as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant lodged with ORG a request for the reopening of the DATE criminal proceedings against him on the basis of LAW ORG . He also argued that the limitation period for the enforcement of his sentence had expired and requested release on that basis .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the request in a judgment of DATE . It held that the request was partly inadmissible and partly illfounded . The applicant 's request for reopening and rehearing of the case was inadmissible , since that could not be done , the casefile having been destroyed in DATE . Whether the casefile had been destroyed in accordance with the relevant rules was immaterial , the fact remained that as a result , a rehearing was impossible in practice . Insofar as the applicant could be understood as requesting reopening , quashing of the conviction and suspension or discontinuation of the proceedings , that request was illfounded , as it had not been established that at the time of the trial there had existed grounds for suspension or discontinuation of the proceedings . As to the applicant 's request for the application of the statute of limitations , it was inadmissible , as ORG had no primary jurisdiction in such matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the president of ORG to restore the casefile of the DATE criminal case against him . It seems that he has received no reply to his request .", "CARDINAL . The ORG allows trial in absentia in certain limited circumstances .

Until DATE NORP law did not provide for reopening of criminal cases heard in absentia . Thereafter such reopening became possible in cases where the convicted person was unaware of the criminal proceedings against him or her and submits a request for reopening within DATE after having learned of the conviction ( new Article CARDINALa of the ORG ) . The request is examined by ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) , which may quash the conviction and either order rehearing of the case ( LAW ORG ) or discontinue or suspend the criminal proceedings ( LAW ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , insofar as relevant , provides that a judgment imposing a sentence from DATE imprisonment can not be enforced DATE after its entry into force . The running of this limitation period is interrupted by every act effected by the competent authorities for the purpose of enforcing the sentence ( LAW of the ORG ) . Such interruptions notwithstanding , the sentence may no longer be enforced if DATE have elapsed since the judgment 's entry into force ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not contain express provisions establishing a procedure to be followed in cases where there is a dispute as to whether a person has been detained in execution of a sentence after the expiry of the limitation period for its enforcement . LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG provides that the court which has delivered a judgment rules on all difficulties or uncertainties relating to its interpretation . In general , the authority responsible for supervising legality in the enforcement of sentences of imprisonment is the competent prosecutor ( LAW ORG , section CARDINAL ) of the Judicial Power Act and section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .
