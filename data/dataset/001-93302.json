Although the legal provisions did not expressly provide for such a possibility , usually the written reasons accompanying such decisions were limited to a simplified , schematic formula which did not contain any legal analysis , did not indicate the specific grounds for the decision , did not invoke grounds of appeal and did not refer to any facts or circumstances which would allow the identification of a particular case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE new provisions on a \u201c cassation complaint \u201d came into effect , replacing the provisions governing the cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) ORG examined a number of constitutional complaints challenging the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that although the LAW did not guarantee a right to cassation as such , the fact that it was provided for by LAW meant that it had to meet the requirements of the rule of law and procedural justice .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed , inter alia , that certain terms describing the conditions which a cassation appeal had to meet under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code ( \u201c significant legal issue \u201d , \u201c provisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the ORG case - law \u201d , \u201c arguments showing that examination of the cassation appeal would be justified \u201d ) were drafted in the broadest terms . It noted that the judicial practice regarding their application had given rise to serious interpretational difficulties and discrepancies in the caselaw of ORG . ORG considered the relevant requirements of Article CARDINAL and their interpretation by ORG to be vague and subjective and , in practice , known exclusively to ORG but not to those who wished to lodge a cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , if the conditions for admissibility of a claim ( preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal ) were formulated in imprecise terms , the right of access to a court could not be exercised effectively because of the risk of arbitrariness of the assessing body .", "CARDINAL . In this context the court criticised , in particular , the practice of \u201c simplified reasons \u201d . It held that the use of open - ended concepts by the legislator could not be considered , in itself , as unconstitutional , as it allowed the courts a certain flexibility , to better - tailor their decisions to circumstances at hand . However , in such case the obligation to substantiate the legal norm was shifted to the stage of its application . This gave the courts a certain discretion which was not to be confused with an absolute freedom from external supervision . Consequently , a general and imprecise procedural clause required a strong justification and indication of specific circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The practice of formulaic justification in the preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal created a situation where nobody could identify how , if at all , ORG had performed the necessary assessment to substantiate those vague terms . The case - law providing guidance on their application was thus practically non - existent . The court informed the addressee of its decision that the requirements of the given article had not been met , but did not indicate any circumstances which justified this conclusion . As a result , a principle of trust has been breached . Moreover , it was impossible for lawyers in general to recognise ORG understanding of those requirements for the purpose of effectively lodging a cassation appeal in the future .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the \u201c pre - judgment \u201d did not guarantee procedural predictability to the party , who has lodged a cassation appeal meeting all formal requirements . The right of access to a court had thus been transformed into a pretence of this right .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless the Constitutional Court found that it was the practice of ORG that deserved disapproval and not the relevant provisions , and the wording of those provisions could not be considered unconstitutional . In this context the court observed that the practice was not uniform and certain chambers of ORG justified their decisions in a much more elaborate and substantive way . The court further observed that the challenged provisions had already ceased to exist prior to the delivery of the present judgment .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG refused to decide on the compatibility of those provisions with the LAW and discontinued the proceedings in this respect .", "CARDINAL .
