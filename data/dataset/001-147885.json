The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police issued a payment order fining the applicant CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) for CARDINAL traffic offences under Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of FAC . From the police \u2019s description of the facts and evidence it appears that on DATE at TIME while trying to overtake X \u2019s car , which had been improperly parked , the applicant failed to make sure that he could do so without endangering X \u2019s car and with the rear right end of his car he hit the rear left end of NORP \u2019s car . Allegedly , after the collision the applicant left the scene of the accident without submitting his personal data to X who was not present during the accident or notifying the police that he had been involved in an accident . X stated to the police that an unknown witness told him that the person responsible for the accident was driving a dark car with the number plate LJ DATE . On the basis of this information the police checked CARDINAL vehicles with number plates LJ DATE and LJ CARDINAL - CARDINALL. These vehicles did not show any sign of damage . On DATE X informed the police that he had found a dark car with the number plate KP LCARDINAL - CARDINAL . The police established that the owner of the car was the applicant . On DATE the police interviewed the applicant and checked his car . They found that the damage on the applicant \u2019s car corresponded to that of X \u2019s car . They further found that Y was present in the applicant \u2019s car during the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection . He argued that he did not detect any collision between the CARDINAL cars and that , accordingly , he had not informed GPE or the police of the accident ; that there had been many passers - by on the road who had witnessed how he had been manoeuvring the car but nobody had warned him of any kind of abrasion or dent caused to X \u2019s car ; that he lived at the address of the scene of the accident and would have never left the scene even if he had caused the damage ; that he had been informed of the accident only the following day when called by the police , and that together with the police he had checked his car visually and discovered a scratch of QUANTITY in length for which he did not know when it appeared . According to the applicant , due to X \u2019s improper parking any vehicle could have hit his car ; from the damage on X \u2019s car it was clear that the applicant could not have caused the damage with his car . The applicant reiterated that if he had detected the accident he would have reported it and this fact could have been proved by witness Y which was present in his car . He described in detail the events of DATE , namely approximately at TIME he drove out of the parking spaces , he wanted to turn to the right but CARDINAL cars prevented him from doing so because they were actually parked on the road ; the cars parked posed a threat to road traffic safety because the space between them would have not allowed an ambulance or any other emergency vehicle to pass ; in such a situation the applicant was forced to position his car at an appropriate angle to enable him to pass safely between the cars ; he had to fold both side mirrors ; otherwise he would not have been able to pass the CARDINAL parked vehicles without collision ; he manoeuvred his car at CARDINAL speed and was not aware that he had caused an abrasion or damage to any other vehicle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police issued a reasoned decision finding the applicant guilty of the abovementioned minor offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for judicial review . He complained that the police had not sufficiently established the facts ; he had not left or escaped the scene of the accident ; he had not been aware of any collision and , consequently , he did not inform X and the police thereof in accordance with LAW ) of FAC . He further stated that he wanted to turn right onto the carriageway but he was prevented from doing so by CARDINAL cars parked on the carriageway \u2013 on the left and on the right sides of the road . CARDINAL of the cars was X \u2019s car . When he wanted to drive out of the garage he could not do so and was forced to manoeuvre for quite some time to position the car at an appropriate angle and had to straighten the car almost completely to be able to pass freely between the CARDINAL cars . In order to do it safely he had to fold in both side mirrors because otherwise he would have not been able to pass the parked cars without colliding with them . During the manoeuvring he was not aware that he had caused an abrasion or damage to the cars . The manoeuvring speed was minimal . There were many passers - by who witnessed the manoeuvring but did not warn him of any accident . In order to prove these allegations the applicant proposed that he and Y be heard . He further stated that police had not considered the fact that he lived at the address of the scene of the accident and therefore he had no interest in leaving the scene . He drove to a filling station , went shopping and visited his parents . As evidence he submitted a fuel purchase receipt and a shop receipt and proposed the hearing of his parents . He further argued that if he had left the scene of the accident intentionally he would have concealed the scratches on his car . Even if he had collided with X \u2019s car he would not have been aware of it since his car was a diesel - fuelled car which tended to vibrate heavily . Moreover , his radio was always turned on which reduced the likelihood of noticing the collision . In order to prove this he proposed that he and Y be heard . He argued that he was not aware of the date when the scratch appeared on his car since the car was DATE and had many other scratches . Since X \u2019s car had been improperly parked any vehicle could have collided with it . The police did not clarify on the basis of which fact they had concluded that the scratch on his car corresponded to the damage on X \u2019s car . In the applicant \u2019s view X had been frenetically searching for the culprit and as soon as he found a black car", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for judicial review without holding a hearing . ORG held that it had no reason to doubt the findings of the police who conducted an interview with the applicant and a visual inspection of his car during which they noticed damage which corresponded to the damage on X \u2019s car . According to the court , it was clear from the documents of the case - file , in particular the photographs of X \u2019s car , that the damage had been caused by the applicant \u2019s car and the applicant \u2019s complaints in this respect remained general and subjective . In particular , the allegations that the accident would have been reported by passers - by or that the applicant would not have left the scene of the accident if he had noticed it were subjective and could not be verified . The applicant could not be released from his responsibility for the minor offence by stating that he had not been aware of the collision because this was , again , a subjective allegation . Every participant in road traffic , in the circumstances described by the applicant , was expected to be particularly alert and to detect the collision . Regarding the allegation that X \u2019s car was parked on the road and that it had endangered the traffic safety the court stressed that only the applicant \u2019s behaviour was at issue . It held that according to LAW ) of FAC a traffic offender who had left the scene of the accident should have immediately notified the injured party or the police the information referred to in that Section . The court therefore did not have to reply to the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had not left the scene to an unknown place as they were legally irrelevant . Finally , the evidence submitted by the applicant could not change the conclusions of the police and it was only an attempt to delay the proceedings since the motions for evidence did not comply with the required legal standards regarding the subject - matter about which the witnesses proposed might have testified .", "CARDINAL .
