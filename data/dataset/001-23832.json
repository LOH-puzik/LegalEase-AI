SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON G. ORG and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant , assisted by legal counsel , applied for disability benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . She claimed that she was in need of assistance for TIME and had extra expenses in the amount of MONEY ( SEK ) per year following operations which had removed part of her intestines . She submitted certificates from a medical doctor and a dentist .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE granted her a disability allowance as from DATE . The ORG found that she was in need of assistance for TIME and accepted additional costs amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL per year . Added together , these items corresponded to an allowance of PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , maintaining that she was entitled to an allowance of PERCENT of the basic amount . She submitted that she had further expenses due to her handicap which she had previously failed to state and that the total amount of the extra expenses was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . She further claimed that she should be given an allowance as from DATE .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case . At the hearing , the applicant claimed that her extra expenses amounted to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the ORG stated that it accepted SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL thereof .", "By a judgment of DATE the court rejected the applicant 's appeal in so far as it concerned the period from DATE . It found that SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL could be accepted as extra expenses for the applicant , but that these expenses and her need of assistance , taken together , did not make her eligible for an allowance with a higher amount than the one granted by the Office . As regards the period before DATE , the court referred the matter back to the ORG for a decision . It appears that no appeal was made against the court 's judgment .", "On DATE the ORG granted the applicant a disability allowance of PERCENT of the basic amount for DATE \u2013 November CARDINAL . In so doing , it accepted extra expenses for that period amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and thus considered that some of the extra expenses fixed by ORG had not existed before DATE .", "The applicant appealed against this decision and claimed an allowance of PERCENT , alternatively PERCENT , of the basic amount for DATE \u2013 November CARDINAL . She also requested that the ORG be ordered to explain its decision in several respects .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request for explanations from the ORG . It noted that the applicant 's appeal had been communicated to the ORG which thus had been given an opportunity to submit comments . The court further ordered the applicant to complete her appeal by DATE .", "The applicant made submissions to the court on DATE . She further requested that ORG hold an oral hearing in order to have clarified certain factual issues in the case . In this connection , she maintained that the ORG had failed to give satisfactory answers to her questions .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG found partly in favour of the applicant and granted her a disability allowance of PERCENT of the basic amount for the period at issue , DATE \u2013 DATE . The court considered that the circumstances relating to that period , in all important respects , were the same as for the period examined in the judgment of DATE . On the basis of a medical certificate submitted by the applicant , it further found that the extra expenses which the ORG had not accepted for the period in question had in fact existed since DATE . As regards the applicant 's claim that she was entitled to PERCENT of the basic amount , the court found no reason to change the assessment made in its earlier judgment .", "By the judgment ORG further rejected the applicant 's request for an oral hearing . It noted that it had ordered the applicant to make her final submissions in the case and that it had already held an oral hearing on DATE in the case concerning benefits for the period starting in DATE . As the circumstances in that case had been essentially the same and as the court had drawn the same conclusions with regard to the applicant 's entitlement to benefits for the CARDINAL periods in question , the court found a hearing unnecessary in the case at hand .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE and complained about ORG decision not to hold an oral hearing . She further claimed that , if the appellate court were to examine the case on the merits , it should hold an oral hearing .", "On DATE the appellate court refused the applicant leave to appeal . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) also refused her leave to appeal .", "According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to guidelines issued by ORG ( Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket ) , the total DATE costs of all extra needs due to the disability should come to PERCENT of the basic amount in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance . If the total costs reach or exceed that level , the individual is , pursuant to chapter QUANTITY , section CARDINAL of LAW , entitled to an DATE allowance corresponding to CARDINAL , DATE or PERCENT of the basic amount , depending on the level of the total costs . In DATE , when the applicant lodged her application with the ORG office , the basic amount was SEK CARDINAL .", "A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of ORG , ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party 's request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party 's understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
