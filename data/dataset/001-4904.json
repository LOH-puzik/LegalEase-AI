They informed the applicant that the investigating judge had issued a search warrant orally . A written copy of the search warrant was not served on the applicant until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) . He submitted that it was not clear in the circumstances whether a search warrant had been issued as claimed by the police officers . Thus , the search of his LOC lacked a legal basis and violated his right to respect for his home .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as being inadmissible . It found that the police had acted upon an oral search warrant from the investigating judge and the search of the applicant \u2019s premises was , thus , attributable to the court . Consequently , the review of its lawfulness did not fall within the competence of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , claiming that the search of his LOC violated his right to respect for his home . He submitted in particular that no written copy of the search warrant had been served on him within the statutory TIME time - limit .", "On DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as being unfounded . It noted that the court had conducted criminal proceedings against a number of persons on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors . In the course of these proceedings a letter was seized which proved that a certain PERSON dealt with pornographic material involving minors . Subsequently , since the applicant was identified as the person using the cover name PERSON , the investigating judge issued a search warrant for the applicant \u2019s LOC . At the time , a written copy of the search warrant was not issued and , thus , was not served on the applicant . ORG further noted that the search was carried out in the presence of the applicant who was first informed of the suspicion and was requested to hand over any pornographic material in his possession . As he refused to do so , the search was carried out and extensive pornographic material as well as business correspondence was seized .", "Having regard to its above findings , ORG concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion , as required by S. CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) , that objects which were of importance for specific criminal proceedings were to be found on the applicant \u2019s LOC . Moreover , the search had , in accordance with CARDINAL of the said Code , been ordered by a judicial search warrant . The failure to serve a written copy of the search warrant on the applicant , though contrary to the law , did not affect the lawfulness of the search itself .", "On DATE this decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel .", "PERSON Relevant domestic law", "DATE Protection of the Home Act ( Gesetz zum Schutz des Hausrechts DATE )", "PERSON of the CARDINAL LAW provides that a search of LOC may , as a rule , only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge .
