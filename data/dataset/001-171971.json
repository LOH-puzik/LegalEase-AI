The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Before the reunification of GPE he lived in the former GPE , serving in the police force from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE ( ORG convicted the applicant of \u201c criminal assault against the local bodies of the ORG \u201d ( \u201c verbrecherischer ORG gegen die \u00f6rtlichen GPE der Staatsmacht \u201d ) after he had attacked a member of the GPE parliament of the ruling ORG . He was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and served DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ( ORG Regional Court annulled the DATE judgment for its incompatibility with the principles of the rule of law and rehabilitated the applicant pursuant to LAW of LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Rehabilitierung und Entsch\u00e4digung von Opfern rechtsstaatswidriger Strafverfolgungsma\u00dfnahmen i m Beitrittsgebiet PERSON ) designed to rehabilitate and compensate prisoners of the GPE regime for deprivation of their liberty incompatible with the principles of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for compensation under LAW . The application form contained instructions that , according to LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice , CARDINAL and DATE below ) , such compensation could not be granted to a person who had offended against the principles of humanity and the rule of law . The applicant declared on the questionnaire that he had never acted in disregard of these principles and never worked for the former GPE \u2019s ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG . On CARDINAL DATE the President of the GPE ( ORG Regional Court , acting as the competent authority , awarded him compensation of MONEY , equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) , pursuant to LAW in conjunction with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after an amendment of the LAW , the applicant also applied for a special , incomerelated pension which benefits former victims of imprisonment ( monatliche besondere PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) . He again confirmed that he had never offended against the principles of humanity and the rule of law and never worked for the former GPE \u2019s ORG . On DATE he was granted a special DATE pension of LAW pursuant to Section CARDINALa of LAW , with the reservation that information held by the Federal Commissioner for ORG of the former GPE ( \u201c the Federal Commissioner \u201d ) must not contradict the applicant \u2019s statements . A respective request for information was submitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal Commissioner informed the President of ORG that the applicant , DATE and DATE , had been a secret informant of ORG while he was a member of the police force . This information was based on a number of documents , including CARDINAL handwritten reports allegedly drafted by the applicant and a declaration to commit to serve as a secret informant to the state security service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG , relying on LAW and CARDINAL sentence , no . CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON f\u00fcr ORG ) , withdrew the decisions granting compensation and a special pension and at the same time ordered the applicant to reimburse the amounts already received pursuant to LAW . The President considered that the decisions had been unlawful from the beginning as the prerequisites for either entitlement had never been met and that the applicant could not legitimately rely on these decisions being maintained , as he had obtained them by giving information that was substantially incorrect . Referring to LAW of LAW , he observed that the applicant , contrary to the statements in his applications , had worked as a secret informant for ORG and had produced CARDINAL reports for ORG in which he put at real risk the persons on whom he had informed .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant applied for judicial review of that decision and asked to be heard in person . He claimed that the information contained in the documents of the Federal Commissioner was incomplete and not accurate . The fact that at the time of recruitment he was DATE and had been severely traumatised when fleeing his home town in GPE in DATE and experiencing the bombing of GPE on DATE , followed by DATE of homelessness after the war had ended , also had to be taken into account . His father had returned , incapacitated for work , from NORP captivity only in DATE or DATE . While serving in the police forces he had not been aware of working for other government agencies . The written commitment to the state security service might have been dictated to him when he was under the influence of alcohol but he had no memory of it whatsoever . In any case , he ruled out that the wording was his own and that he had known that the reports were to be used by the state security service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ( ORG Regional Court , sitting as a chamber of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review , finding that his work as a secret informant for ORG was of such nature , scope and duration that it was reprehensible enough to justify ruling out the applicant \u2019s eligibility for compensation payments pursuant to LAW of LAW . Acknowledging that in a dictatorship which lasted for DATE , minor involvement with the regime was frequent , it considered that the applicant \u2019s position as a secret informant of the state security service did not itself suffice to trigger the application of that provision . However , compensation provided under the LAW was intended to benefit innocent victims only , but not those who had also participated in offences contrary to the principles of humanity and which were harmful to others or at least put them at risk . This could be assumed when a secret informant voluntarily reported on others and the reports could potentially cause persecution by the state security service . In that case compensation payments were ruled out , no matter how great the offender \u2019s own suffering had been . The courts were not to compare the extent of suffering involved .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant had penned a handwritten commitment to serve the state security service after he had already reported twice on others . Thus the applicant \u2019s submission that he had believed that he was reporting to police officers and not to the state security service was , in the light of that declaration , not credible ( \u201c nicht glaubhaft \u201d ) . Furthermore , the CARDINAL reports mentioned in the decision of the President of ORG , as well as CARDINAL more reports were capable of putting in danger the persons informed on . The applicant mainly reported on their contacts with GPE and GPE . An intention to leave the former GPE without permission , in particular , could have led to severe criminal persecution of the persons involved . The reports were not meaningless but contained valuable information for the state security service . The applicant \u2019s claim that some reports were unknown to him and factually incorrect and that he did not recognise the names of the superior officers was irrelevant to ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG also pointed out that it was unnecessary to hear the applicant in person . His personality at the time and the circumstances of his recruitment would have been relevant only if there were indications that the applicant acted under insupportable pressure . However , there were no such indications and the applicant had made no claims in this regard . He had reported twice on others , even before being recruited by the state security service . Further , the court could not see a connection between the applicant \u2019s experiences relating to the impact of war and the post - war period on him and his psychological strain at the time of recruitment on the one hand and his willingness to cooperate with the state security service on the other hand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , endorsing ORG reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without providing reasons ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
