The applicant is a registered association ( ORG ) in GPE and the publisher of a periodical called ORG . In the DATE issue of ORG , the following leaflet was published :", "\u201c PERSON , a ( new ) wall - newspaper against the trend towards the right wing ... \u201d", "\u201c Racism has a name and address", "The ORG [ ORG ] and its party officials are certainly interested in your opinion ! So , let 's call them and tell them what we think of them and their policy . Or let 's send them small gifts in response to their racist agitation .", "We have gathered a small selection of GPE ORG officials , ORG offices and of course PERSON in order to facilitate a little the unbureaucratic exchange of opinions .", "They will surely enjoy your phone calls , letters and parcels : ... \u201d", "The above text was followed by a list of addresses and telephone numbers of members and offices of ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE an opinion poll ( Volksbegehren ) under the heading \u201c GPE first \u201d ( \u201c PERSON zuerst \u201d ) took place which had been initiated by the ORG DATE . The opinion poll , on the issue of immigration , consisted of CARDINAL proposals , partly to amend legislation and partly to change administrative practices . It proposed , inter alia , the following :", "\u2013 to amend LAW by a provision stating that GPE was not a country of immigration ;", "\u2013 to stop immigration until a satisfactory solution to illegal immigration was found ;", "\u2013 to oblige all foreign workers to carry an identity card at their place of work , showing that they had a valid work permit ;", "\u2013 to increase the police force and create a separate border police ;", "\u2013 to limit the percentage of pupils whose mother tongue was not NORP to PERCENT and , if the percentage were higher , to create separate classes for foreigners ;", "\u2013 to deny foreigners the right to vote ; and", "\u2013 to require the immediate expulsion of and residence prohibition on foreign offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , leader of the ORG and at that time a member of ORG , brought civil proceedings for an injunction under LAW b\u00fcrgerliches PERSON ) against the applicant before ORG ( ORG ) . He requested that the applicant be prohibited from repeating the statement according to which he had incited people to \u201c racist agitation \u201d ( \u201c rassistische PERSON \u201d ) and any similar statements . He further requested that the applicant be prohibited from inviting people to \u201c send small gifts in response to their racist agitation \u201d , together with the publication of the names , telephone numbers and addresses of members of the plaintiff 's political party .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted that it had never identified itself with the leaflet at issue and had merely published it out of journalistic interest and in order to inform the public . Moreover , the words \u201c racist agitation \u201d were not a statement of fact but a value judgment , and were meant as a critical comment of the opinion poll \u201c GPE first \u201d which the plaintiff had initiated and which was directed against \u201c immigration without control \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the injunction . It found that the impugned statement about \u201c racist agitation \u201d was not a value judgment , but a statement of fact . Such a statement contained a reproach of a criminal offence , namely \u201c incitement to hatred \u201d ( LOC ) under LAW ) , and not only damaged the plaintiff 's reputation ( GPE ) but also amounted to an insult ( PERSON ) . In order to avoid the injunction , the applicant therefore needed to prove the truth of its statement . However , it had failed to do so . Even accepting that the plaintiff was , more or less , a right - wing politician , there was no evidence that he had attempted to incite hatred ( verhetzen ) against aliens or had attacked their human dignity .", "CARDINAL . As regards the invitation to \u201c send small gifts \u201d , the court observed that a part of the applicant 's readership was , for political reasons , prepared to use violence and anarchistic methods . In this respect the court noted that in the DATE issue of ORG a letter to the editor had been published which read as follows :", "\u201c ... we organised in TIME to DATE our first action against PERSON 's referendum and have smashed several windows of the ORG headquarters in GPE . This was only the beginning . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to another letter to the editor published in the DATE issue of ORG , an ORG party office in GPE had been \u201c visited \u201d , the words \u201c racism stinks \u201d had been sprayed on the walls , windows smashed and butter acid thrown into the office . ORG then quoted further letters of this kind which had appeared in various issues of ORG . The court found that against this background the invitation to \u201c send small gifts \u201d constituted an attack on the plaintiff 's personality rights ( Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrechte ) which had to be respected . Accordingly , the court granted the injunction in this respect also .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the appeal . It confirmed ORG view that the statement according to which the plaintiff had incited people to \u201c racist agitation \u201d was a statement of fact which the applicant had failed to prove . In this respect the court found as follows :", "\u201c But since DATE as we have already outlined in dealing with the complaint concerning the facts \u2013 the meaning of the term ' racist agitation ' could be established on the basis of general experience , and since the defendant has failed to submit any concrete allegations to the effect that the plaintiff had shown conduct corresponding to what is generally known as ' racism ' and ' agitation ' , the court of first instance \u2013 without there being a mistake of law \u2013 rightly concluded that the defendant was unable to prove the truth of its allegations . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's argument that this statement was covered by its right to freedom of expression , ORG found that the interests of the applicant and the plaintiff had to be balanced against each other . However , the applicant 's statement could not be justified by referring to freedom of expression , because the statement went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism by reproaching the plaintiff with a criminal offence . Moreover , the impugned statement was untrue and therefore not protected by LAW . ORG confirmed the decision of ORG in respect of both statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant introduced an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentliche Revision ) against ORG decision in so far as it concerned the prohibition to repeat the statement that the plaintiff had incited people to \u201c racist agitation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) declared the extraordinary appeal inadmissible as it found that the qualification of the statement at issue as a statement of fact was in accordance with its previous case - law .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( NORP b\u00fcrgerliches PERSON ) provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone who has suffered material damage or loss of profit because of an insult may claim compensation .", "CARDINAL .
