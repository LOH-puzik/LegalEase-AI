{"ITEMID": "001-4724", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "BALBONTIN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Ms. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE a boy , J , was born to the applicant and PERSON , an NORP national . The child 's parents were not married and separated towards DATE . The applicant maintained regular contact with J but at no time had a parental responsibility order . J lived with and was cared for by ORG", "On DATE the applicant issued an application for a parental responsibility order in ORG . He also requested a contact order , an order prohibiting ORG from taking J to GPE and an order that J be known by his correct name .", "On DATE ORG took J to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a direction that J be returned to the jurisdiction and that the matter be referred to ORG . On DATE ORG transferred the matter to ORG .", "On DATE there was an ex parte hearing before ORG . The applicant requested the court to grant him parental responsibility . The court observed that his parental rights had not been breached when PERSON took the child to GPE because the applicant did not have parental responsibility . Even if the court were to grant the applicant parental responsibility at that stage , this would not make the removal of the child unlawful ex post facto .", "The applicant also requested the court under LAW DATE to declare that J had been removed from the jurisdiction in breach of LAW of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction , because the applicant 's custody rights had not been respected . He submitted in this connection that the notion of \u201c custody \u201d should be interpreted broadly by reference to LAW . However , the court considered that the applicant did not have custody within the meaning of LAW . In particular , the court considered that the applicant did not have any formal rights of custody in LANGUAGE law and LAW had not been incorporated into domestic law .", "Finally , the applicant sought a declaration in wardship . This would have enabled the applicant to seek an order that J be returned to GPE and GPE . However , the court declined to make such a declaration on the ground that J had always lived with PERSON and it was inappropriate at that stage to demand that PERSON should return with him to GPE and GPE so that the applicant could visit him . The applicant was treated differently from married fathers because he did not have parental responsibility . The applicant could issue proceedings in wardship or under LAW DATE , serve them on the mother and promptly request the appropriate orders . However , the court stressed that , in the circumstances , it would not make any ex parte orders .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal . On DATE ORG refused his application . The applicant renewed his application before ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal reasoning as follows : The purpose of LAW was to ensure the speedy return , without lengthy proceedings or inquiries , of children who had been wrongfully removed from the person having their care . However , J was not cared for by the applicant . The applicant simply had contact with him . The applicant 's case could be also distinguished from cases where wards of court had been removed from the jurisdiction . In CARDINAL such case the court had ordered the return to the jurisdiction of a child that had been made a ward of court on DATE following its removal . Finally , the mere fact that the applicant had instituted proceedings before the NORP courts had not resulted in those courts acquiring custody powers over J. This could have happened only if the courts had made an interim custody order . As a matter of fact , the precedent relied on by the applicant in this connection concerned a case where the child had been removed by a mother in favour of whom the courts had previously made an interim custody order in contested proceedings . As a result of all the above , ORG considered that the applicant 's case was not an appropriate one for an ex parte order . However , the applicant had the possibility of making further applications in the context of contested proceedings .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Section CARDINAL of the Children Act DATE provides the following :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where a child 's father and mother were married to each other at the time of his birth , they shall each have parental responsibility for the child .", "( CARDINAL ) Where a child 's father and mother were not married to each other at the time of his birth -", "( a ) the mother shall have parental responsibility for the child ;", "( b ) the father shall not have parental responsibility for the child , unless he acquires it in accordance with the provisions of this LAW . \u201d", "It is within the inherent jurisdiction of ORG to make children wards of court ( wardship jurisdiction ) . Once a child has been made a ward of court , no important step in its life can be taken without the consent of the court .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE provides the following :", "\u201c ORG or Court of Session may , on an application made for the purposes of LAW by any person appearing to the court to have an interest in the matter , make a declaration or declarator that the removal of any child from , or his retention outside , GPE was wrongful within the meaning of LAW . \u201d", "", "LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides the following :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where", "( a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "( b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention .", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph ( a ) above , may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting ORG may , prior to the making of an order for the return of the child , request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the ORG of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of LAW , where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that ORG . ORG shall so far as practicable assist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
