CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Bjelovar . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , an advocate practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was a shareholder of the GPE banka d.d . , a joint - stock company incorporated under NORP law with its registered office in GPE ( \u201c the bank \u201d ) . The bank was entirely owned by private individuals and companies .", "On DATE ORG DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) adopted a decision appointing a temporary administrator to the bank . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , from the date of service of such decision , all powers of the management board , the supervisory board and the ORG general meeting were transferred to the temporary administrator . Subsequently , on DATE the ORG extended the temporary administrator \u2019s term of office for DATE .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the ORG had proposed to the Government that the process of recovery and restructuring of the bank be commenced , as provided for by the domestic legislation .", "In accordance with that proposal , on DATE the Government adopted the Decision on Recovery and Restructuring of the GPE banka d.d . ( \u201c the Decision \u201d ) . From that date , all shares held by the bank \u2019s shareholders were revoked and cancelled . Following the process of recovery , the bank was to issue new shares , all in the name of ORG for Securing Savings Deposits and ORG ( PERSON agencija za osiguranja \u0161tednih uloga i sanaciju banaka ) .", "In DATE and DATE CARDINAL shareholders of the bank , but not the applicant , filed CARDINAL separate petitions for review of the constitutionality and legality ( prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti i zakonitosti ) of ORG Decision of DATE . They complained that the Decision violated their constitutional rights as shareholders of the bank . They also claimed that the bank had been in good standing and that the ORG had therefore been unnecessary .", "On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) discontinued the proceedings because the statute on which the ORG was based had in the meantime been repealed .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil action for unjust enrichment ( or enrichment without cause ) in ORG ( PERSON u GPE ) against the bank , seeking repayment of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) . He relied on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The applicant explained that on DATE he had bought CARDINAL of the bank \u2019s ordinary shares for the above amount . However , on the basis of ORG Decision of DATE he had been deprived of those shares . He argued that the ORG had actually annulled the contract under which the bank had sold him its shares . That contract , being the cause on the basis of which he had paid HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the bank , had thus ceased to exist . It followed that the bank had enriched itself without cause , or more precisely , on the basis of a cause which had subsequently ceased to exist , and had therefore been bound to return to him the sum in question .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his action . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that ORG LAW DATE had annulled the contract under which he had acquired the bank \u2019s shares . Consequently , the court found that the cause on the basis of which he had paid HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the bank had not ceased to exist and that the bank had not been bound to return the sum demanded .", "Following an appeal by the applicant , on DATE ORG ( PERSON u GPE ) quashed the first - instance judgment on account of incomplete facts and remitted the case . It also instructed the lower court to verify whether the contract under which the applicant had bought the shares could be rescinded under LAW on account of the fundamental change in circumstances , having regard to ORG Decision of DATE .", "In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG ruled for the applicant , finding that the bank had indeed enriched itself without cause . The court again did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that the contract of sale on the basis of which he had bought the bank \u2019s shares had been annulled by ORG of DATE . It however held that , because of that ORG , the contract had lost one of the essential elements for the validity of every contract , namely its consideration , defined as the economic purpose of a transaction . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW , the court further found that , owing to the absence of consideration , the contract was null and void . Accordingly , the nullity of the contract had resulted in the disappearance of the cause on the basis of which the applicant had paid the bank the sum sought and the bank had been obliged to return that sum to him .", "Following an appeal by the respondent , on DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It found that ORG LAW DATE had not annulled the applicant \u2019s contract with the bank relating to the purchase of the shares . Moreover , the ORG could not in any other way have affected the validity of that contract because the parties had performed , and thereby extinguished , their contractual obligations before the LAW had been adopted ( the applicant by paying HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the bank , and the bank by transferring CARDINAL of its shares to him ) . It followed that at the relevant time ( during its existence ) the applicant \u2019s contractual obligation had been performed for consideration which could not subsequently have been removed by an event that took place after that obligation had already been extinguished . The contract in question had thus been valid . As that contract had been the cause on the basis of which the applicant had paid HRK CARDINAL to the bank , and had been valid , it could not be argued that this cause had ceased to exist and that the bank had been bound to repay him the amount sought . The conditions for rescission of the contract on the basis of a fundamental change in circumstances had not been met either , because under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW such rescission could not have been sought by a party who had already performed his or her contractual obligations .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance judgment , alleging breaches of ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his constitutional complaint .", "The relevant provisions of LAW ORG , ORG nos .
