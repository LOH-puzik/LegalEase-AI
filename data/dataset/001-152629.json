However , prisoner location is an operational matter which sits outside of ORG remit and is for the prison service and your offender manager to resolve .

NORP By letter dated DATE PERSON replied in the following terms :", "\u201c I acknowledge that your client \u2019s initial transfer to ORG was on compassionate grounds ... The fact that Mr PERSON elected not to return to GPE is a factor that must be considered when determining whether or not his progress through the prison service has been slow ... Although , I would argue that the prompt intervention of his newly appointed PERSON and the attempts he made to source a suitable course at ORG would indicate that ORG were not at fault for any delays to your client \u2019s progress .", "Your client is known to our Programmes team , is in the assessment process and his post tariff status will ensure that he is prioritised accordingly for the next GPE courses which should be delivered from DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
