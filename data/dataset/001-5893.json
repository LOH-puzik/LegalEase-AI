On DATE ORG instructed the lower prosecutors to prepare a reasoned decision regarding its refusal to investigate into the matter and to serve it to the applicant .", "It appears that on an unspecified date ORG prepared a decision stating that the CARDINAL employees of ORG who had entered the applicant \u2019s apartment had been authorised to do so under LAW of LAW in order to check on the applicant \u2019s electricity meter . Moreover , according to the available evidence they had been allowed to enter the applicant \u2019s apartment by his wife . The prosecution authorities also dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint for slander on the ground that there was no evidence that the alleged offence was made out . The applicant has not provided a copy of the decision .", "On DATE ORG quashed the lower prosecution authorities\u2019 decision and instructed them to investigate the matters in view of the applicant \u2019s statement that the employees had entered the apartment without his wife \u2019s permission . The decision also noted , in respect of the applicant \u2019s other grievance - concerning the alleged slander -that the manager had denied having used offensive words .", "On DATE ORG terminated the criminal proceedings against the manager , holding that the alleged offence of slander had not been made out since ORG found that the applicant had stolen electricity . It appears that administrative proceedings in that respect had been instituted against the applicant .

ORG found that the check carried out by the employees of ORG had been lawful and justified as the applicant \u2019s electricity meter had been tampered with . Moreover , they had been allowed to enter the applicant \u2019s apartment by his wife . In respect of the applicant \u2019s allegations about being slandered , the prosecutor found that the manager \u2019s statement had not been intended to humiliate the applicant , and that therefore the alleged offence had not been made out .", "On several occasions , the applicant complained to ORG about the termination of the investigation proceedings .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals on the ground that there was no evidence that the privacy of his home had been violated by ORG employees or that the offence of slander was made out .", "Article CARDINAL , as applicable at the material time , provides that an official who has committed slander against another person in the performance of his official duties shall be sentenced to up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Article CARDINAL , as applicable at the material time , provides that a person who has entered the home of another by use of force shall be sentenced to up to DATE imprisonment or DATE pro bono work .", "Rule DATE as applicable at the material time , provides that the authorised controllers of ORG may enter consumers apartments in their presence in order to check on the electricity meters ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
