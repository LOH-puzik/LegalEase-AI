It was represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company entered into a lease agreement with ORG ( \u201c the BSDC \u201d ) , a body of ORG , renting from it a ORG shop . It appears that the term of the lease agreement was periodically renewed until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant company submitted a proposal to ORG to purchase the shop under the preferential privatisation procedure available to lessees of ORG and municipality - owned properties , provided for in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declined the proposal . It reasoned that the conditions under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW had not been met , because the BSDC was not a ORG enterprise and real property included in its assets could not be sold or exchanged .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company applied for judicial review of ORG refusal . In a judgment of DATE , which was considered final , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and instructed the ORG to open a privatisation procedure . The ORG held that the shop was owned by the ORG and had been assigned to the ORG for use and management only .", "CARDINAL . Following that judgment , on DATE ORG opened a procedure for the shop \u2019s privatisation . On DATE its decision to that effect was published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the ORG submitted a petition for review ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430 ) of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to a CARDINAL - member panel of the same court . The CARDINAL - member panel noted that , notwithstanding the fact that the shop was owned by the ORG , it was not subject to privatisation because the ORG did not have the status of a ORG enterprise .", "CARDINAL . Following a fresh examination , in a judgment of DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of the ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s application for judicial review . However , on appeal , in a final judgment of DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of the same court quashed the decision of DATE and instructed ORG to open a privatisation procedure aimed at selling the shop to the applicant company . It considered , most notably , that the shop was the property of the ORG and that the BSDC \u2019s legal status was not an obstacle to the privatisation . It considered , in addition , that the applicant company met all the requirements to benefit from the preferential conditions under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following that decision , on DATE ORG wrote to the applicant company proposing a price for the shop , inquiring whether the applicant company accepted to buy the shop and inviting it to propose payment conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company informed ORG that it agreed to buy the shop at the price proposed . In addition , it suggested a payment scheme .", "CARDINAL . The signing of the privatisation contract was scheduled for DATE ; however , TIME before the meeting an employee of ORG informed the applicant company by telephone that it would be postponed .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG inquired with the GPE municipality as to whether there were any restitution claims in respect of the shop . On DATE the regional governor of PERSON replied that on DATE he had decided to transfer the shop to a third party in compensation for their expropriated property ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . It transpired subsequently that on DATE the ORG had transferred ownership of the shop to the GPE municipality . On DATE the GPE municipal council included it in the assets of the municipallyowned company managing municipal real properties . It is unclear whether ORG had been informed of those developments at the time .", "CARDINAL . It also transpired that on DATE a third party \u2013 the heirs of PERSON DATE had requested the transfer of the shop in compensation for expropriated real property . As already mentioned , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional governor granted their request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company applied for judicial review of that latter decision . However , on DATE ORG found its application inadmissible , holding that the applicant company had not been a party to the restitution proceedings and therefore had no standing to challenge the impugned decision .", "CARDINAL . The parties have not informed the ORG whether it was possible for the applicant company to challenge the transfer of the property from the ORG to the municipality , or resort to any other remedy directed against the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company sought judicial review of ORG failure to finalise the privatisation transaction in compliance with the judgment of DATE . However , on DATE the ORG rejected the application for judicial review as inadmissible , holding that the impugned failure to execute a final judicial act did not represent an administrative decision in itself and therefore was not subject to judicial control .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant company requested the assistance of ORG to finalise the privatisation transaction . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of Economy invited ORG to comply with the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In letters of DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE the applicant company also invited ORG to finalise the privatisation procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant company that the shop had been transferred to the GPE municipality and that the regional governor \u2019s subsequent decision to transfer it in compensation to a third party represented a new circumstance which impeded the finalisation of the privatisation transaction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company applied for judicial review of ORG refusal . In a judgment of DATE a threemember panel of the ORG quashed the refusal and instructed the ORG to transfer title to the shop to the applicant company . It reasoned that the applicant company had acquired the right to buy the shop and the ORG was therefore obliged to sign the privatisation agreement . However , upon an appeal by ORG , in a final judgment of DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of the ORG found the applicant company \u2019s application for judicial review inadmissible . It held that the ORG \u2019s refusal to sign a privatisation agreement had not amounted to an administrative decision because , at that stage of the privatisation procedure , the CARDINAL parties had been acting on an equal footing . Thus , the existing dispute between them could not be settled in administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought a civil action against ORG , seeking to have declared final the preliminary contract which it considered had been reached between them . PERSON and PERSON , heirs of PERSON , intervened in the proceedings with a claim for a declaratory judgment against the applicant company and ORG that they were the owners of the shop on the basis of the regional governor \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action of the applicant company and declared that PERSON and PERSON were the owners of the shop . Upon an appeal by the applicant company , on DATE ORG upheld that judgment . It considered , in particular , that following the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the applicant company and ORG had exchanged correspondence in which they had reached an agreement on the main conditions of the sale of the shop , which represented a preliminary contract . However , ORG had not been the owner of the shop , which meant that the preconditions for declaring the preliminary contract final had not been present .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments . It considered , in particular , that the correspondence between the applicant company and ORG did not represent a preliminary contract .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE a notary public , acting with the assistance of the police , put PERSON and PERSON in possession of the shop . It appears that by this time the applicant company , which was still holding the property , was no longer using it and it was in a state of abandon .", "CARDINAL .

It was superseded by other legislation in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act indicated the bodies competent to take decisions on privatisation . As concerns ORG - owned properties , the competent bodies were either ORG , or , for the most important objects , ORG . The body competent to decide on the privatisation of municipally - owned properties was the relevant municipal council .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , lessees of ORG and municipality - owned property could propose to buy the property rented by them , without a public auction or competition and for a price equal to the property \u2019s value assessed by certified experts in accordance with rules adopted by the ORG . Those preferential conditions were applicable to lessees of ORG and municipality - owned property who had concluded lease contracts before DATE and where the said contracts were still in force on the date of the respective privatisation proposal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , as worded after DATE , provided that where a refusal by the competent administrative body to initiate a privatisation procedure following a proposal by the interested party had been quashed by means of a final court judgment , the relevant administrative body was obliged , within DATE of the judgment becoming final , to initiate the privatisation procedure , prepare the privatisation of the property at issue and offer to sell the property to the entitled party .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW addressed different situations of conflict of competing privatisation and restitution interests . It provided , in particular , that in cases where a privatisation contract had already been concluded , the parties claiming to have restitution rights were to be compensated through shares in the companies which had acquired the property , if any such shares were owned by the ORG or municipalities , or through compensation bonds ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
