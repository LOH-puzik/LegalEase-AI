The licence was valid from DATE until DATE , with the name \u201c LOC \u201d . Mr PERSON was approved as its director .", "The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) of PERSON , claiming that the decision be annulled as , inter alia , PERSON did not meet the criteria for a director as required in the Decree on Driving PERSON ( ajokorttiasetus , k\u00f6rkortsf\u00f6rordningen ; GPE , amend .

In any case , the name of the licence - holder , \u201c QUANTITY \u201d should have been deleted and the number of training vehicles limited to CARDINAL motor vans and CARDINAL passenger cars . They contended that the establishment of a new driving school affected their rights as it would reduce their incomes and thus they had a right to appeal pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) of H\u00e4meenlinna held an oral hearing , in which it heard ORG , ORG and the applicants .

CARDINAL ) and the Decree on Driving Licences the licence for a driving school had to be granted if the applicant fulfilled certain criteria . The appropriateness of a new licence was not relevant to the decision - making .

The decision became a precedent ( KHO:CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW of Finland ( perustuslaki , grundlagen ; GPE ) provides that everyone has the right to have his or her case dealt with appropriately and without undue delay by a legally competent court of law or other authority , as well as to have a decision pertaining to his or her rights or obligations reviewed by a court of law or other independent organ for the administration of justice .", "Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act provides that any person to whom a decision is addressed or whose right , obligation or interest is directly affected by a decision may appeal against a decision .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( CARDINAL , as in force until DATE ) provided that a driving school licence was required for operating a driving school .

CARDINAL of DATE that a person operating a pharmacy in the neighbouring municipality did not have a right to appeal against a decision of ORG by which it issued a licence for the storing of medicines , as the applicant in question had not applied for the licence and as the granting of a licence to him ( being a pharmacist in another municipality ) did not affect his rights and obligations within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
