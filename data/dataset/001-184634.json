ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their successive former Agents , most recently Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered into a share - purchase agreement ( \u201c the SPA \u201d ) with ORG , a company incorporated under the laws of GPE ( \u201c the GPE company \u201d ) . By the terms of the ORG , the applicant acquired , for MONEY ( ORG ) , a PERCENT stake in ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the tobacco company \u201d ) , a company co - founded by the ORG company and incorporated under NORP law . PERCENT of the shares were owned by PERSON . ( \u201c the minority shareholder \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and Mr Y.A.L. , a duly authorised representative of the ORG company , both arrived in GPE in TIME of DATE with the specific purpose of signing the LOC . At FAC they were welcomed by Mr GPE , a friend of the applicant , Mr PERSON , a lawyer then authorised to act on behalf of the tobacco company and subsequently implicated in the unconfirmed allegations of and criminal proceedings related to the fabrication of a power of attorney on the applicant \u2019s behalf ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , and PERSON . , a notary public registered in GPE ( \u201c the first notary public \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Without leaving the airport building , the applicant and Mr ORG signed the ORG which was then certified by the first notary public . In addition , the notary certified a power of attorney by which Mr Y.A.L. was authorised to represent the applicant and to sign official documents on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a certain Mr GPE ceded to the applicant his claim against the tobacco company with a value of GPE CARDINAL ( approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The contract did not stipulate any obligations on the applicant \u2019s behalf in exchange for the said cession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr A.Y. ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) instituted proceedings against the applicant before FAC , indicating PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as the applicant \u2019s representative .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE claimed that on DATE he had entered into an agreement with the applicant according to which the former had ceded to the latter a claim to the tobacco company with a value of ORG ( EUR CARDINAL ) . He further asserted that in exchange for the cession , the applicant should have paid him \u201c a certain amount of money \u201d by DATE . Owing to the applicant \u2019s alleged failure to perform that obligation , PERSON GPE demanded the annulment of the agreement of DATE and the restoration of the situation existing before the alleged breach of the contractual duty .", "CARDINAL . At the main hearing of DATE Mr PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u2019s alleged representative \u201d ) presented a power of attorney authorising him to represent the applicant ( \u201c the power of attorney \u201d ) . The document was dated DATE and indicated the handwritten name \u201c PERSON \u201d together with the alleged signature of the applicant . It was certified by a notary public , PERSON ( \u201c the second notary public \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing of DATE , PERSON raised the value of his claim to CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Neither the revised nor the original claim contained any reference to supporting documentation . The applicant \u2019s alleged representative acknowledged the debt allegedly owed by the applicant to Mr GPE At the suggestion of Judge PERSON , the parties agreed to settle the case . As per the friendly settlement agreement , the applicant \u2019s alleged representative agreed to transfer the ownership of PERCENT of the shares in the tobacco company to Mr GPE The settlement was endorsed by LOC in a decision of DATE ( \u201c the decision of DATE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a writ of enforcement immediately , despite the statutory appeal period of DATE and on DATE Mr A.Y. was listed in ORG as the owner of PERCENT of the shares in the tobacco company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a purchase agreement was concluded between Mr A.Y. and the minority shareholder of the tobacco company ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) whereby the latter acquired the former \u2019s shares in the tobacco company by means of cancelling an outstanding debt stemming from a contract concluded between them on DATE . The minority shareholder consequently became the PERCENT shareholder of the tobacco company .", "CARDINAL . The property in question became the subject of various subsequent transactions among third parties . In DATE the applicant obtained an extract from ORG revealing that the minority shareholder had sold PERCENT of shares in the tobacco company to a certain ORG , a company registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an interlocutory complaint against the decision of DATE on account of not having been summoned to the hearing and having been represented by an unauthorised person based on a forged power of attorney . He argued that he had become aware of the dispute only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complaint was declared inadmissible by Judge PERSON The judge noted that there was no need to summon a party if a duly authorised representative were present . Additionally , the decision had become res judicata and no interlocutory appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the examination of the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was stayed on account of the non - payment of the court fees and he was asked to correct the error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was left unexamined owing to the failure to pay the court fees . The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision arguing that he had given the necessary sum to his representative who , for an unknown reason , had apparently failed to proceed with the payment . It does not appear that the applicant instituted criminal proceedings against the representative on that account . The applicant requested that the decision of DATE be quashed and that the examination of his complaint continue .", "CARDINAL . As a result of several interlocutory appeals and decisions , on DATE ORG remitted the case to the appellate court to consider the admissibility of the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal against DATE decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appellate court considered the interlocutory appeal lodged against its DATE decision and found it inadmissible . The court noted that the applicant had failed to pay the court fees at the time his appeal was lodged ; nor had he done so after receiving the court \u2019s notice and a deadline to correct the procedural error . The reason advanced by the applicant to justify the failure , namely that he had personally paid the sum to the representative , who had allegedly failed to execute the payment , was not considered a valid justification for the procedural shortcoming .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in a final decision ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision of CARDINAL DATE as inadmissible . It reasoned that the applicant had not alleged a violation of procedural rules by the lower courts in rejecting his interlocutory appeal and that his argument concerning the alleged misappropriation of the court fees by his representative was not valid grounds to set the domestic courts\u2019 decisions aside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with FAC to have the final decision of DATE quashed and the proceedings reopened owing to the court \u2019s failure to ensure the attendance of a party , as provided by LAW ( b ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Relying on a private forensic report dated DATE he further argued that the power of attorney presented by PERSON had been forged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court found the application inadmissible . It reasoned , among others , that the application to have the decision of DATE quashed had been time - barred . It referred to the DATE time - limit under LAW of the ORG , which had started to run after the applicant had become aware of the grounds for his application . The court found that , in view of the applicant \u2019s interlocutory proceedings on the matter instituted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he had become aware of such grounds well before the lodging of his application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s interlocutory complaint against the decision of DATE was declared inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG , sitting as a court of final instance , upheld the lower court \u2019s findings and declared the application inadmissible as time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG for the annulment of the purchase agreement of DATE by which Mr GPE had sold a PERCENT interest in the tobacco company to the minority shareholder in exchange for having his outstanding debt cancelled ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He argued that Mr A.Y. had not been authorised to manage the property , which he had got hold of illegally , and that the impugned agreement had been based on a fraudulent power of attorney .", "CARDINAL . After a series of decisions on procedure , jurisdiction , and postponements , the court of first instance dismissed the application on DATE . It found that the criminal proceedings which had been terminated on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had not confirmed the forging of the impugned power of attorney . That decision of the prosecuting authorities had been upheld by the first - instance and appellate courts on DATE and DATE respectively ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , the purchase agreement had been concluded by the lawful owner of the property [ Mr GPE ] , rendering the applicant \u2019s complaint unfounded . The applicant appealed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was asked by the appellate court to indicate the value of his claim and to pay the court fees accordingly . The latter requested that the value be designated as indeterminate . The appellate court indicated to the applicant that the interest underlying the impugned contract was determined and the court fees amounted to PERCENT of that sum , capped at CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL ) .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , on DATE , after sending the applicant a final warning concerning the consequences of non - payment of the court fees to the amount of GEL CARDINAL , and in the absence of further information from the applicant , ORG left the appeal unexamined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL applications for damages against Mr PERSON , Ms GPE . , Mr GPE , Mr GPE ( the latter \u2019s lawyer ) , and the minority shareholder ( Mr A.Ts . ) , as well as the tobacco company . It appears from the case - file and the applicant \u2019s submissions before the ORG , that these were subsequently abandoned in favour of his third application ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a third application for damages in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by criminal activities . The claim was based on the verdict of CARDINAL DATE reached as a result of the plea - bargain agreement between PERSON and Ms K.Ch . ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant applied for an exemption from the court fees under LAW ( c ) of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the application of DATE owing to the absence of a final conviction in a criminal case , as the criminal proceedings had been reopened ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the applicant to pay the court fees to have his appeal on points of law considered . On DATE the applicant submitted to the court a statement claiming exemption from the court fees under LAW ( c ) of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant was not entitled to the exemption owing to the absence of a final conviction in a criminal case and ordered the applicant to pay the fees within DATE . It does not appear that the applicant attempted to either comply with that decision or challenge it . His appeal on points of law was therefore left unexamined owing to the failure to pay the court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG , asking it to quash the decision of DATE and to reopen the civil proceedings under LAW ( a ) and ( c ) and QUANTITY of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in view of newly discovered circumstances . As such , the applicant referred to the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE , reached as a result of the plea - bargain agreement between Mr PERSON and PERSON . in relation to the falsification of the power of attorney of DATE that had enabled PERSON to cede the applicant \u2019s property on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application . It referred to the relevant criminal proceedings on the matter and reasoned that the decision to close the criminal case had become final on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , considering the absence of a crime confirmed by a final judgment , the grounds to reopen the case under LAW ( a ) and ( c ) did not exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld , in a final decision , the lower court \u2019s finding on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the finance police , the agency responsible for investigating financial crimes , and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He reported that he had never given Mr PERSON any authority to represent him and that the power of attorney presented to LOC on DATE had been forged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the finance police opened a criminal case concerning the allegation of fraud and misappropriation of the applicant \u2019s shares in the tobacco company . Various witnesses were questioned in the course of the preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , several forensic reports were commissioned by the applicant , the investigating authorities , and the defendants concerning the validity of the power of attorney . Specifically , CARDINAL forensic reports were carried out by ORG experts on the initiative of the investigating authorities , CARDINAL alternative forensic report was implemented by a private expert institution at the request of the defendant , and another alternative expert report was carried out on the applicant \u2019s initiative . The respective findings are set out below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert of ORG issued an opinion ( \u201c the first ORG forensic report \u201d ) , according to which neither the handwritten name \u201c PERSON \u201d nor the signature made in the name of the applicant on the power of attorney of DATE belonged to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert of ORG confirmed ( \u201c the second ORG forensic report \u201d ) the findings of the first forensic report . On DATE , the applicant was recognised as a victim and a civil claimant in the criminal case . The second notary public , PERSON . , was charged and remanded . Mr PERSON was charged as well , but , as his whereabouts were unknown , he was declared wanted by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . DATE an alternative expert examination was carried out on PERSON . \u2019s request . The private expert concluded ( \u201c the first alternative forensic report \u201d ) that whilst the signature did not belong to the applicant , the handwritten name \u201c PERSON \u201d did .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator of the finance police in charge of the criminal case ordered another graphological examination of the signature by a panel of experts from ORG and ORG in view of the findings reached by a private expert in the first alternative forensic report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic examination was conducted by the panel of experts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The experts assessed the authenticity of signatures on the impugned power of attorney and the notary public \u2019s related registry records retrieved from her office . They concluded ( \u201c the third ORG forensic report \u201d ) that whilst the signature did not belong to the applicant , the handwritten name \u201c PERSON \u201d on both , the power of attorney and the notary \u2019s registry records did .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a ruling declaring the prosecution of PERSON and PERSON . terminated and the criminal case closed in view of the inconclusive evidence . The ruling reasoned , inter alia , that the investigative steps which could have been taken in the course of investigation had been exhausted , as had the possibilities to collect any other evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s ruling of DATE and requested the resumption of the investigation which , according to the applicant , had been closed hurriedly and arbitrarily .", "DATE . On DATE a NORP forensic expert , following a request by the applicant , produced a forensic report concerning the impugned power of attorney of DATE ( \u201c the second alternative forensic report \u201d ) . It concluded that the applicant was not the author of the impugned signature dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant \u2019s complaint of CARDINAL DATE had been examined several times at various court instances , ORG annulled the ORG \u2019s ruling of DATE . It ordered the resumption of the criminal proceedings as the case had been closed hastily .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , another graphological expert report was ordered and carried out by the authorities . The experts concluded ( \u201c the fourth ORG forensic report \u201d ) that none of the signatures on the impugned power of attorney and in PERSON . \u2019s notary logbook belonged to the applicant . The following day , PERSON and PERSON . were once again charged with fraud .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE the deputy head of the finance police initiated friendly settlement negotiations between the parties , which failed when the applicant refused to agree to the terms of the settlement . No evidence except for the applicant \u2019s unanswered letter addressed to the finance police on that subject was submitted to the ORG in support of this claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG approved a plea - bargain agreement between the ORG and PERSON and PERSON . As a result of that judicial endorsement of the bargain , Mr PERSON and PERSON . \u2019s guilt became confirmed without a full examination of the merits of the case ( see paragraph DATE above ) . The latter were sentenced to a suspended DATE term of imprisonment , and fined GEL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , in accordance with the terms of the agreement and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The judgment became final after the statutory DATE time - limit for appeals had elapsed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL convicted persons , Mr PERSON and Ms GPE . , lodged an application with ORG for the restoration of the statutory time - limit to appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They first argued that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had only been served on them on DATE . Furthermore , relying on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure providing for a restoration of a time - limit for appeal based on a valid excuse , they stated that the decision to confess as well as their decision not to appeal in due time had been made under duress as their family had received serious threats by some unidentified persons . In a decision dated DATE the ORG reasoned that Mr PERSON and Ms GPE . had provided valid reasons for the restoration of the time - limit and allowed their application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms K.Ch . and Mr PERSON lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) arguing that the plea - bargain agreement and the related confession had not been a result of their free will but of duress . They maintained that their family had received serious threats from unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the application lodged by PERSON . and Mr PERSON The court heard PERSON . and Mr PERSON who noted that at the time of concluding the plea - bargain agreements they were detained and did not notify the investigative authorities about the threats , including one to kill PERSON . \u2019s young daughter , due to the fear that their declaration would have resulted in the fatal outcome for their loved ones . The court reasoned that the plea - bargain agreement and the related confession had been obtained under duress and was to be declared invalid as not concluded voluntarily . The case was therefore returned to the ORG for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared the prosecution of PERSON PERSON and PERSON . terminated . It reasoned that the findings of the forensic examinations were not consistent as some of them pointed to the applicant \u2019s involvement with the impugned document ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . The ORG also relied on the statement of an interpreter who confirmed having witnessed the applicant \u2019s signature on the document . Among other witnesses , CARDINAL of applicant \u2019s former representatives noted that the applicant was a fictitious owner of the shares , and that the real person behind him and the shares , Mr ORG helped the applicant find the private expert who would easily confirm the applicant \u2019s version of the events . Another witness , Mr. PERSON , the applicant \u2019s former public relations representative stated that he parted ways with the applicant after becoming aware of some shady arrangements between Mr ORG and the applicant . He also noted that the applicant had never explicitly denied having signed the power of attorney and instead had mentioned that at the time he signed numerous documents . The ORG also noted the existence of several domestic court decisions and judgments issued DATE in other sets of proceedings attesting to Mr PERSON \u2019s uncontested representation of the applicant based on the impugned power of attorney as a strong indication of the validity of the document and the applicant \u2019s awareness of its existence for DATE before contesting it in DATE . Finally , statements of the family members of PERSON and PERSON . attesting to the pressure placed upon the latter by unidentified persons to confess to the crime ( concerning which a separate investigation was pending ) were noted . The prosecutor concluded that the body of evidence did not warrant a conclusion concerning the existence of a crime of fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) with ORG against the reopening decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The appeal was rejected as inadmissible both by ORG and ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively on the grounds that the legislation did not provide for a victim \u2019s right to challenge judicial decisions relating to a plea - bargain agreement concluded between the prosecution and an accused . The applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal on this matter was rejected on DATE . ORG reasoned that the legislature \u2019s approach to limiting the right of victims to appeal against plea - bargain agreements was justified by the principle of efficient criminal justice and balanced by enabling the victim to challenge decisions of the investigating and prosecuting bodies before the judicial authorities , a right of which the applicant had availed himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s ruling to terminate the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court reasoned that no clear evidence had been obtained during the investigation that would confirm the guilt of the CARDINAL accused . It further noted that :", "\u201c ... the investigating authorities have correctly assessed the witness statements of [ CARDINAL persons ] that confirmed that Mr PERSON had been aware of the existence of the concerned power of attorney and that it had been signed by him . These arguments are further strengthened ... by the decisions obtained by the investigating authorities from courts of various levels of jurisdiction , according to which Mr PERSON had participated in court hearings as Mr PERSON representative based on the impugned power of attorney . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE and upheld , at final instance , the lower court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . The appellate court reasoned that :", "\u201c All possible investigative measures were carried out [ by the investigating authorities ] , persons directly ... or indirectly connected with the issuance of the impugned power of attorney were questioned . Several forensic examinations were carried out . ... All evidence available in the case must be assessed in its entirety in the context of whether it is sufficient to reach a conclusion concerning a person \u2019s guilt , [ and ] doubt concerning the authenticity and sufficiency of [ such ] evidence should be decided in favour of the accused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a disciplinary complaint against Judge PERSON of LOC with ORG , accusing the latter of various violations of procedural law , including the failure to ensure the attendance of a party at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE reached the following conclusions :", "\u201c Judge PERSON has violated LAW ... as he did not serve the legal claim and the supporting documentation to PERSON .", "The Judge has also violated Article CARDINAL [ of the Code ] , given that PERSON , the respondent in the case , was not informed by a court summons , of the time and venue of the hearing or of the decision to terminate the proceedings [ as a result of a friendly settlement ] ... in contravention of Article CARDINAL [ of the ORG ] ...", "...
