A lawyer by profession , he was at the material time a member of the executive committee of the LOC section of ORG ( \u201c the HEP \u201d ) . That party , which was represented in ORG , was dissolved by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the executive committee decided to distribute in the GPE constituency a leaflet criticising the measures taken by the local authorities , in particular against small - scale illegal trading and the sprawl of ORG camps around the city .", "The title of the leaflet , of which CARDINAL copies were printed , was \u201c To all democratic patriots ! \u201d , and the text read as follows :", "\u201c In DATE a campaign aimed at \u2018 DRIVING THE NORP OUT OF THE GPE has been launched in GPE against the NORP population by a combination of prefecture , security police and town hall . In this campaign GPE has been designated a pilot - city . The first stage was the operation [ against ] street traders , stallkeepers and mussel sellers , whom they tried to hide away on the ground that it was necessary to smarten up the city and ease traffic congestion . The purpose of this operation was to impose an \u2018 economic blockade\u2019 on our , mainly NORP , fellow citizens who make their living through these activities , condemning them to destitution and starvation . In this way the masses were to be frightened , oppressed and compelled to return to their province of origin .", "Before the \u2018 DRIVING THE NORP OUT\u2019 campaign began the organisational and psychological ground had already been prepared by leaflets signed by \u2018 NORP inhabitants of NORP and handed out in large numbers for DATE by \u2018 obscure forces\u2019 . These leaflets incited hostility against the NORP population in particular and stirred up anti - NORP feelings . This led to racist and chauvinistic anti - NORP attitudes through propaganda saying : \u2018 Do n\u2019t give employment or housing to the NORP . Do n\u2019t speak to them , do n\u2019t let your daughters marry them and do n\u2019t marry CARDINAL yourself . Smash the GPE That is how the psychological foundations were laid down , the preparations for the future offensives . Although these leaflets were handed out in broad daylight , those responsible \u2013 and nobody knows why \u2013 were never arrested .", "But the campaign was by no means limited to the operation against street traders , stallkeepers and mussel sellers . The second prong was \u2018 Operation shantytown\u2019 . The same combination of prefecture , security police and town hall launched the demolition of the ORG camps . It began in PERSON and PERSON and continued in PERSON , [ all ] shantytown districts inhabited mainly by NORP , who , before the elections , were regarded by the parties in favour of the status quo as a source of votes . Those who had encouraged the mushrooming of the shantytowns by dishonestly promising freedom to build in exchange for votes and those who , with the local mafia , had appropriated public land this time set about the ferocious destruction of these huts to oppress and intimidate the NORP and force them to go back home .", "The NORP and NORP proletarian people suddenly and without any warning saw the huts they had run into debt to build , with so many sacrifices made by cutting down on their children \u2019s food , collapsing about their ears . That is how they are trying to oppress the NORP and NORP people and drive them into distress and despair .", "IT \u2019S STATE TERROR AGAINST NORP AND NORP PROLETARIANS !", "It is certain that these demolitions , which began in PERSON and are still continuing in PERSON , will soon spread to GPE \u2019s other shantytowns . The ORG is testing the people \u2019s reactions and will to resist by causing various kinds of destruction . Passivity as a form of defence against this devastation has encouraged the ORG to commit further kinds of destruction .", "In conclusion : The \u2018 Driving - the - NORP - Out policy\u2019 forms part of the SPECIAL WAR being conducted in the country at present against the NORP people . It is one of the mechanisms of that war , the way it impinges on the cities . Because the methods used are the same , namely enslavement , violence , terror and oppression through compulsion . It is a psychological war .", "While , in the country , they are trying to oppress and silence the people through counter - insurgency tactics , special patrols , village guards , the ORG decree and every [ other ] form of ORG terror , in GPE they want to achieve the same aim by depriving our fellow citizens of their means of subsistence and in the end by knocking their houses down about their ears . The methods used , although different in form , are in the final analysis mechanisms serving the purposes of the special war . It is the urban form of the special war .", "TO ALL DEMOCRATIC NORP !", "The way to nullify these insults to the cities is to set up ORG BASED ON THE PEOPLE \u2019S OWN STRENGTH .", "We call on all NORP and NORP democratic patriots to assume their responsibilities and oppose this special war being waged against the proletarian people .", "LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS !", "STOP THE SPECIAL WAR BEING SPREAD INTO THE CITIES ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , accompanied by a copy of the leaflet in question , the president of the ORG informed the GPE prefecture of the executive committee \u2019s decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and asked for permission to implement it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE security police , to whom this request had been referred , considered that the leaflet contained separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences .", "On DATE they asked ORG attached to ORG ( \u201c the public prosecutor \u201d , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to state his opinion as to whether the contents of the leaflet contravened the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , a substitute judge of ORG issued an injunction ordering the seizure of the leaflets and prohibiting their distribution .", "The police searched the ORG \u2019s premises in GPE , first at the headquarters , where the party leaders handed over , without demur , CARDINAL copies of the leaflet which were still parcelled up , and then at the ORG district office , where CARDINAL remaining copies were seized .", "CARDINAL .

ORG ) . It noted in particular that the leaflet suggested recourse to resistance against the police and the establishment of \u201c neighbourhood committees \u201d , which it held to be illegal forms of protest . It further held that the offence had been intentionally committed , since the accused had not contested either the existence or wording of the text on which the charge was based .", "With regard to the severity of the sentence , it observed that although commission of the offence through the medium of print was an aggravating circumstance , it was necessary to take into account the accused \u2019s good faith and the fact that the authorities had been able to lay hands on the leaflets before they had been distributed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the other convicted persons appealed to ORG . In their notice of appeal they asked for a public hearing to be held and challenged ORG interpretation of the leaflet and its refusal to commute the prison sentence to a fine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE May ORG attached to ORG forwarded the case file together with an opinion couched in a standard form of words \u2013 which was not communicated to Mr DATE asking the court to uphold the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld all the operative provisions of the impugned judgment , after observing that , regard being had to the nature and length of the sentence imposed at first instance , it was not necessary to hold a hearing .", "CARDINAL .
