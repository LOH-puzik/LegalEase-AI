THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and live in GPE . They are represented before the Court by PERSON of GPE , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant purchased FAC ( \u201c the property \u201d ) , apparently with the assistance of a mortgage in favour of ORG . The property subsequently became the applicants\u2019 main residence . Although the second applicant claims that she used some of her funds to purchase the property , it was registered in the first applicant \u2019s sole name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant entered into a second mortgage with ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) . The total amount loaned was ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant fell into mortgage arrears in or DATE and ORG commenced possession proceedings against him in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Around this time , the first applicant \u2019s solicitor became concerned that he lacked the capacity to manage his own affairs . Medical reports indicated that he had ORG \u2019s Syndrome and a schizophrenic illness . On DATE , DATE after the claim form was issued in ORG by ORG , the solicitor applied to ORG for an order authorising her to act as an Interim Deputy for ORG ( \u201c Interim Deputy \u201d ) to defend , inter alia , the possession proceedings on his behalf . ORG made an order on DATE authorising her to take control of his property and affairs and to exercise the same power over them as a beneficial owner . In doing so , the court imposed a security bond requirement on the Interim Deputy in the sum of GBP CARDINAL in favour of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The Interim Deputy thereafter informed ORG that there was money available to pay the arrears and make advance payments .", "CARDINAL . The possession claim was heard on DATE . The first applicant did not attend and was not represented , although a letter from him was submitted to the court . The contents of that letter are not known . PERSON indicated to the court that the first applicant had made no payments on the mortgage since DATE . Consequently , the District Judge ordered that he give LAW possession of the property before DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Office of the Public Guardian commissioned a ORG to meet with the applicants and the Interim Deputy on DATE . The visitor was ( incorrectly ) told by the Interim Deputy that all payments on the mortgage were up to date . He also noted that the applicants\u2019 situation was \u201c very difficult and unstable \u201d and seemed to be \u201c on the edge of crisis \u201d as the second applicant was unwell and might not be able to continue to care for the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant complained to ORG about the conduct of the Interim Deputy . In particular , she claimed that the Interim Deputy had failed to use funds of GBP CARDINAL to discharge the mortgage arrears and that she had been on sick leave for DATE and was not dealing with her deputyship duties . ORG also complained about the Interim Deputy \u2019s conduct , both to ORG and to ORG . They claimed that they had discontinued possession proceedings after the Interim Deputy had verbally agreed a settlement with them but that she had subsequently reneged on that agreement by insisting , without foundation , that ORG pay her costs . Following the complaints , ORG launched an investigation into the activities of the Interim Deputy .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant subsequently withdrew her complaints against the Interim Deputy unreservedly . In a report dated DATE ORG found that there had been a dispute between ORG and the Interim Deputy which should be resolved between the parties . It also found that there had been a dispute between the Interim Deputy and her firm which resulted in her leaving the firm and working from home . Following a period of claimed ill - health , she had resumed activity in the affairs of the first applicant . ORG therefore closed its investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG obtained a warrant for possession from ORG . On DATE , a Notice of Eviction was sent to the first applicant \u201c and any other occupiers \u201d at FAC , stating that the eviction would take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By DATE an application had been made on the first applicant \u2019s behalf to suspend the eviction . A further application appears to have been made to \u201c withdraw \u201d the warrant of possession .", "CARDINAL . Both applications came before a district judge on DATE , on which date the first applicant appears to have been represented by the Interim Deputy . The applications were adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a report into the management and administration of the property and affairs of the first applicant by the Interim Deputy . The report was prepared by ORG and published on DATE . The report noted that on her appointment , the Interim Deputy had advised ORG that there was sufficient money in the PERSON \u2019s client account to pay their arrears . However , ORG informed ORG that the Interim Deputy had \u201c made no attempt to pay the outstanding arrears or to ensure that mortgage payments are going forward \u201d . In fact , she had entered into a verbal agreement to pay the arrears but then reneged on the agreement leaving ORG no alternative but to seek possession . The report concluded that the Interim Deputy was struggling with her general , day - to - day duties and that there was a worrying \u2013 and unexplained \u2013 disparity as to the disbursement of MONEY received into her employer \u2019s client account in DATE . Although ORG stated that all payments were up to date and that the GBP CARDINAL received in DATE had been used in paying the arrears of the mortgage , in DATE those funds were still in the client account . The report concluded that the first applicant \u2019s best interests had not been served by the Interim Deputy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the adjourned applications to suspend and withdraw the warrant for possession were heard by a district judge . Both parties were represented by counsel at the hearing . However , the applications were dismissed and the possession warrant was returned to the bailiff for a new eviction date to be set .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Interim Deputy \u2019s authority to act in the possession proceedings came to an end .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , it appears that the Interim Deputy filed an application for permission to appeal against the district judge \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE on behalf of the first applicant without any authority to do so . The application was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE at a hearing at which both parties were represented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were evicted from the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Interim Deputy made a further application to set aside the first applicant \u2019s credit agreement with LAW on the ground , inter alia , that he had not had the mental capacity to enter into it in DATE . This application was not made with the authority of ORG . On DATE second applicant applied to join the application on the ground that she had also been in occupation of the property , she had an interest in the property and she was left homeless after LAW were granted possession . She wrote to the court , setting out details of the first applicant \u2019s mental health problems and outlining her own health concerns ( including severe spondylosis , sciatica , heart disease , angina and depression ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG revoked the appointment of the Interim Deputy with immediate effect . However , she was appointed as the first applicant \u2019s Deputy limited to the single issue of making an application on his behalf for public funding to apply for judicial review of the decision of CARDINAL DATE . This appointment was to expire on DATE unless extended by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing at which the parties were represented by counsel , the ORG Judge dismissed the application to set aside the credit agreement and join the second applicant to the proceedings . The second applicant was ordered to pay ORG \u2019s costs of the application , which were assessed in the sum of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Permission to appeal was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants , through the Interim Deputy ( again acting without authority ) , sought to appeal against the order of the ORG Judge . In particular , they submitted that there had been no consideration of their rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave the applicants\u2019 daughter , PERSON , authority to act as the first applicant \u2019s litigation friend at the appeal hearing .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard on DATE . The judge found that the first applicant was not validly a party to the purported appeal as the Interim Deputy had not had authority to issue it . The second applicant and her representative were not able to attend the hearing owing to difficult weather conditions . Her appeal was dismissed as totally without merit and she was ordered to pay costs of GBP CARDINAL . The Interim Deputy was joined to the proceedings and was ordered personally to pay to ORG costs in excess of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , following the eviction the first applicant spent DATE without his maintenance medication , which caused a temporary deterioration in his condition . The applicants initially lived with their youngest daughter in a van before all CARDINAL moved to a tent in another daughter \u2019s garden . They stated that during this period the first applicant attempted suicide on CARDINAL separate occasions . The family later stayed in a hotel for DATE before moving into a rental property from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The medical evidence submitted to the ORG indicates that the first applicant has a history of mental illness and had made a number of suicide attempts prior to the eviction proceedings which are the subject of his complaint to ORG . While there is some evidence to support the assertion that he also attempted suicide following the eviction , this attempt appears to have taken place while he was in custody and psychiatrists were establishing his fitness to plead in respect of a prosecution for conspiracy to defraud .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL permits ORG to appoint a Deputy to act on behalf of a person who lacks capacity in relation to matters concerning either his personal welfare or his property and affairs . However , the powers conferred on the Deputy should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and the court may revoke the appointment of a Deputy or vary the powers conferred on him if it is satisfied that he has behaved , is behaving , or is proposing to behave in a way that contravenes the authority conferred on him by the court or is not in the protected party \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section DATE , the Deputy \u2019s powers extend , inter alia , to the discharge of the protected person \u2019s debts and obligations , whether legally enforceable or not .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that the Deputy is to be treated as the protected person \u2019s agent in relation to anything done or decided by him within the scope of his appointment .", "CARDINAL . The Office of the Public Guardian is an executive agency of ORG which implements LAW DATE by administering powers of attorney , supervising Deputies who manage the affairs of others and investigating and acting on allegations of abuse by attorneys and Deputies .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of The Lasting Powers of Attorney , PERSON of Attorney and ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE Regulations \u201d ) the court may order a person to give to ORG security in the form of a bond for the discharge of his functions .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Regulation CARDINAL of the DATE Regulations , the court may order the enforcement of the security .", "CARDINAL . Possession claims are governed by Part CARDINAL of ORG CARDINALA. With regard to land subject to a mortgage , ORG provides that at the hearing the claimant \u2019s evidence should include the amount of any rent or mortgage arrears and interest on those arrears . These amounts should , if possible , be up to date to the date of the hearing ( if necessary by specifying a DATE rate of arrears and interest ) .", "CARDINAL . If relevant , the defendant should give evidence of the amount of any outstanding social security or housing benefit payments relevant to rent or mortgage arrears and the status of any claims for social security or housing benefit about which a decision has not yet been made or any applications to appeal or review a social security or housing benefit decision where that appeal or review has not yet concluded .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where the mortgagee under a mortgage of land which consists of or includes a dwelling - house brings an action in which he claims possession of the mortgaged property , not being an action for foreclosure in which a claim for possession of the mortgaged property is also made , the court may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by subsection ( CARDINAL ) below if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage .", "( CARDINAL)The court\u2014", "( a ) may adjourn the proceedings , or", "( b ) on giving judgment , or making an order , for delivery of possession of the mortgaged property , or at any time before the execution of such judgment or order , may\u2014", "( i ) stay or suspend execution of the judgment or order , or", "( ii ) postpone the date for delivery of possession ,", "for such period or periods as the court thinks reasonable .", "( CARDINAL)Any such adjournment , stay , suspension or postponement as is referred to in subsection ( CARDINAL ) above may be made subject to such conditions with regard to payment by the mortgagor of any sum secured by the mortgage or the remedying of any default as the court thinks fit . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
