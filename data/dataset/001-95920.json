The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a historian and university professor . His main subject of research is the Second World War and , in particular , the extermination of NORP and GPE . He is the author of numerous publications on the subject .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a heated public debate took place in GPE as to whether a statue should be raised to commemorate GPE . In a wider context , the debate also concerned the question of GPE \u2019s failure to face up to its role in World War II and the Holocaust , as well as the attitude of NORP to this chapter of the country \u2019s DATE history \u2013 issues which had political implications , given that certain right - wing parties in the country identified their roots in the pre - World - War - II political system , of which GPE was an emblematic figure .", "CARDINAL . NORP In that context the applicant publicly stated that GPE had been one of the most reprehensible figures of NORP history , responsible for substantial anti - NORP legislation as well as for dragging GPE into World War II .", "CARDINAL . NORP In issue no . CARDINAL of the DATE paper GPE , the applicant published an article on this subject , criticising the right - wing media , including a certain PERSON , for embellishing PERSON \u2019s role and for making anti - NORP statements in the process . The article presented examples of , and refuted , various misconceptions about GPE \u2019s political acts , endorsed by right - wing authors in order to diminish his responsibility for the persecution of NORP , which , in the applicant \u2019s view , amounted to \u201c cautious NORP - bashing \u201d . CARDINAL of these examples reads as follows :", "\u201c In ORG \u2019s charming words , CARDINAL anti - NORP laws \u2018 ORG within ORG \u2019s CARDINAL premierships . ... If we are counting , let us be accurate : not CARDINAL , but CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) anti - NORP laws are linked to GPE \u2019s name . ... \u201d", "The applicant also noted that :", "\u201c ... [ I]t is rare that those supporting [ the plan to erect a ] statue of GPE are trying to defend their position using overtly anti - NORP arguments . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG brought an action against the applicant before ORG . He claimed that his reputation had been tarnished by another passage in the applicant \u2019s article which read as follows :", "\u201c In ORG database there are CARDINAL of articles and studies praising GPE , written in a sometimes uninhibited , sometimes more moderate style . In DATE , the extremely anti - NORP and irredentist ORG devoted a CARDINAL series to the ex - PM . The amateur historian [ ORG ] wrote several articles extolling the virtues of GPE DATE the devout NORP , the enthusiastic ORG leader DATE who in his view was an anti - NORP \u2018 Realpolitiker\u2019 .", "These articles and studies prompted very little reaction . There are very few of us who , at least from time to time , pick up the products of the right - wing or extreme right - wing press , which , perhaps encouraged by this [ indifference ] , keeps lying , keeps slandering , keeps stirring feeling against and bashing the NORP ( zsid\u00f3znak ) , in an increasingly uninhibited way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the plaintiff , the last sentence of the quotation could have been aimed at him and was prejudicial to his reputation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action , holding in essence that the impugned sentence , especially the expression \u201c bashing the NORP \u201d did not concern the plaintiff himself but the right - wing and extreme right - wing media in general .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed that decision on appeal and found for the plaintiff . Relying on sections DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , it ordered the applicant to arrange for the publication of a rectification at his expense and to pay the legal costs , which amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) . Assessing the applicant \u2019s statements in the context of the whole article , ORG held that the impugned expression could be seen as relating to the plaintiff personally and that the applicant had failed to prove that it was true . In the court \u2019s opinion , to accuse the plaintiff , even contextually , of \u201c NORP bashing \u201d was a statement of fact that presented Mr ORG in a false light and was thus capable of prejudicing his reputation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision , imposing another HUF CARDINAL in legal fees . It reaffirmed that \u201c the impugned statement DATE which was made , in general terms , with regard to the right - wing ( extreme right - wing ) press \u2013 could also be considered to concern the plaintiff \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
