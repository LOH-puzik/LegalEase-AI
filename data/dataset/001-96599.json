The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are heirs of Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON PERSON and PERSON Koleva who owned a house in GPE with a yard with a total surface area of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . By a mayor \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE , based on section CARDINAL of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) , the house and the yard were expropriated \u201c for embassy needs \u201d , but with a view to realising CARDINAL separate public FAC projects : ( a ) the construction of a block of flats and shops ( ORG ) ; and ( b ) the construction of an embassy ( Project B ) . The area designated for ORG ) was QUANTITY and the area designated for ORG ( Plot B ) was QUANTITY . The applicants\u2019 ancestors\u2019 house remained in DATE The value of the entire expropriated property was assessed at CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The mayor \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE also provided that for the expropriation of the property \u201c for embassy needs \u201d each of the ORG antecedents would be compensated with an apartment , situated in a building to be constructed by ORG ( \u201c the BSDC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL supplementary orders of DATE , based on section CARDINAL of the PERSON , the mayor determined the exact location , area and other details in respect of the future apartments offered as compensation . The CARDINAL apartments had a total value of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . A CARDINAL - room apartment of QUANTITY was designated for Mr PERSON , who had passed away on an unspecified date in DATE . By virtue of his will , the property was to be received by his grandson , the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , whose heirs were the first and second applicants , his son and wife , was to receive a CARDINAL - room apartment with an area of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . NORP And lastly , PERSON Koleva was entitled to a threeroom apartment of QUANTITY , which was to be received by her daughter , the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . The value of the expropriated property ( BGL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) was directly credited against the value of the apartments offered as compensation . As the latter sum was higher , on unspecified dates the applicants and their ancestors paid the difference , BGL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . By orders of CARDINAL and DATE Mr PERSON and the first applicant were provided with temporary housing in CARDINAL flats owned by the BSDC . It appears that after Mr PERSON death the second applicant continued to use the apartment provided for him .", "CARDINAL . Construction of the block of flats in which the apartments offered as compensation were to be located was never commenced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the entry into force of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants made a request to the mayor of GPE for the restitution of the entire property , because neither of the public works projects had commenced and the expropriated house was still standing . No response was received and on an unspecified date in DATE or DATE the applicants appealed against the tacit refusal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , most likely in DATE , the expropriated house was pulled down and the BSDC commenced the realisation of Project B ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the construction of a NORP embassy complex .", "CARDINAL . Upon the ORG appeal against the mayor \u2019s tacit refusal , on DATE the ORG found partly in their favour . It noted that their property had been expropriated for CARDINAL distinct public works projects DATE ORG , to be realised on Plot A , and ORG , to be realised on Plot B. In so far as the realisation of Project B had commenced on Plot B , this part of the property , namely QUANTITY of the site , could not be restored . However , as ORG had not commenced , the restitution of Plot A , amounting to QUANTITY , was possible .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court further noted that under the original expropriation and compensation orders ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) the applicants and their antecedents had been provided with apartments as compensation in respect of the property expropriated \u201c for embassy needs \u201d ( Plot B ) and that the value of ORG had been credited against the value of the apartments . On this basis , the domestic court held that the restitution of ORG would be effective upon reimbursement of its value . On the basis of the original expropriation and compensation orders of DATE , it calculated that amount to be ORG . Apparently , the value of ORG was much higher than the value of Plot B ( which remained ORG ) as this was where the applicants\u2019 ORG house had been standing .", "CARDINAL . None of the parties appealed against this judgment and it entered into force . In order to effect the restitution , on CARDINAL DATE the applicants paid ORG which , owing to inflation and the depreciation of the NORP currency , equalled MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE municipality petitioned ORG to interpret its judgment of DATE in respect of whether it still owed the applicants CARDINAL apartments as compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to provide the interpretation sought , pointing out that its judgment was quite clear as regards the dispute examined , namely about the claimants\u2019 right to restitution of the property .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the ORG informed the applicants that following the judgment of ORG of DATE the apartments offered as compensation for the expropriation of the property were no longer due .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of GPE revoked the CARDINAL orders of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The applicants appealed again .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and the decision of the mayor of GPE of DATE . However , it based its conclusions on the finding that it had not been necessary for the mayor to formally revoke the CARDINAL orders of DATE ; they had been automatically revoked by virtue of the judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In particular , ORG held :", "\u201c The revocation of the expropriation , even concerning only part of the [ original ] property , in respect of which the requirements of [ the DATE LAW ] were met , resulted , by virtue of the [ judgment of ORG of DATE ] , in the revocation of the orders under sections CARDINAL [ of the PERSON ] , as it is to be considered that no expropriation ever took place . That is why the [ GPE ] mayor did not have to expressly revoke the orders under LAW [ of the PERSON ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not explain why it considered that the partial restitution of the applicants\u2019 property by virtue of the judgment of DATE had removed their entitlement to any compensation at all .", "CARDINAL . No apartments or other compensation have thereafter been provided to the applicants . Neither did the authorities ever reimburse the applicants for any of the payments they had made to the ORG in respect of ( CARDINAL ) the difference in the value of the apartments offered as compensation and the expropriated property ( BGL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , which the applicants and their ancestors had paid to the ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; or ( CARDINAL ) the value of Plot A ( BGL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , which had been credited against the value of the apartments promised as compensation and which the applicants had paid to the ORG in order to effectuate the partial restitution ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
