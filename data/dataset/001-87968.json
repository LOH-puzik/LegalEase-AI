On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) decided to place the applicant in pre - trial detention on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences . The court also considered that , given the likely severity of the penalty , it was probable that the applicant would interfere with the course of proceedings and he might go into hiding . Moreover , the court considered that there was a risk that the applicant would bring pressure to bear on witnesses or his accomplices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ( PERSON ) extended the applicant \u2019s detention , finding that the original reasons for it were still valid .

Lastly , ORG examined the course of the proceedings before the trial court and found that their length had not been excessive , bearing in mind the number of accused involved and complexity of the case .
