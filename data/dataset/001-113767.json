Disciplinary proceedings were brought against PERSON for his attempted suicide but the disciplinary board decided not to impose a punishment . The board told him that \u201c he was setting a bad example to other inmates \u201d , and warned him that if he were to do \u201c such things \u201d again he would be treated more severely .", "CARDINAL . PERSON made another attempt to kill himself on DATE by taking an overdose . He was taken to hospital for treatment and then on DATE he was transferred to FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prisoner told the governor of FAC that PERSON had been \u201c behaving oddly \u201d , had talked about hanging himself , and his behaviour had been causing concern in the juvenile wing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was transferred from the juvenile wing of the prison to another wing which housed adult prisoners from his home town . According to a report drawn up by prison officers , this had been at the request of PERSON , who had claimed that \u201c although his identity card showed that he was DATE , he was actually older \u201d and could therefore be detained in an adult wing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON told the prison governor that he wanted to be transferred to another wing because he did not get on with the people in his wing .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE PERSON sent CARDINAL letters to the prison governor and the prosecutor of FAC stating that he urgently needed to see the governor to discuss his personal problems . On the few occasions on which his requests were granted he told the governor that he wanted to be transferred to another wing in the prison .

He also wanted the prison officers prosecuted for their failure to inform him promptly of his son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings were brought by the disciplinary board of the prison against CARDINAL prison warders who had been on duty in PERSON wing on DATE he committed suicide . On DATE the disciplinary board decided to give formal warnings to these warders . It was noted in the disciplinary board \u2019s report that the large number of cells in the wing had made it impossible for the warders to keep a constant watch on PERSON , who had been suffering from psychological problems . However , adequate precautions could have been taken by increasing the number of prison warders there , which would have ensured that he was under sufficient surveillance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both applicants , with the assistance of their legal representative , submitted a detailed complaint to the prosecutor claiming , inter alia , that the iron bars from which their son had allegedly hanged himself were too low - for a person of his height ( QUANTITY ) - to have been effective for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . The doctors who had examined the samples taken from PERSON body stated in their report of DATE that his death had been caused by hanging .", "CARDINAL .

That decision was communicated to the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicants wrote to ORG claiming compensation for the death of their son . In their letter the applicants argued , inter alia , that even assuming that their son had committed suicide , this was on account of the prison authorities\u2019 failure to take adequate steps to protect his right to life . When ORG failed to respond to their letter , the applicants brought an action against ORG before ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL to one , rejected the applicants\u2019 case , with the majority considering that the prison authorities could not be blamed for PERSON suicide , which had occurred as a result of his family problems . The dissenting judge , however , noted in his separate opinion that PERSON was being held in an adult wing of the prison in breach of the applicable domestic law , which required that he be kept in a juvenile wing . The judge argued that the possibility that his detention with adults had contributed to his psychological problems could not be excluded . He added that the fact that PERSON had repeatedly asked to be transferred showed that he had been having problems with the adult prisoners in his wing . The dissenting judge concluded by arguing that PERSON should have been kept under constant observation , at least on DATE when he had injured himself by hitting his head against the wall , TIME before he had succeeded in killing himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision . On DATE ORG quashed the decision and held that the file should be returned to ORG for reconsideration . In its decision ORG also referred to the prison disciplinary board \u2019s conclusion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and concluded that the decision adopted by that disciplinary board proved that the prison authorities had acted in breach of their duties by failing to ensure an adequate watch on PERSON , who had been suffering from psychological problems . It also held that the prison authorities\u2019 failure to inform the family in a timely manner of the death of their son must have contributed to the family \u2019s suffering .
