ORG for the ORG ( ORG CARDINAL(f ) ) further underline that , so far as is practicable , a court - martial is to be composed of officers from different ORG stations .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time ( DATE ) , ordinary members were randomly selected from a volunteer database for each court - martial . Individual officers were allowed to volunteer by completing a standard form or , alternatively , over the telephone . The information so provided would be entered on a computer database by the ORG . When members were required for a court - martial , the ORG looked for members in the database who were not excluded from participating in a court - martial . If volunteers could not be found in this way , a station would be selected from an alphabetical roster in each command using a separate database . The station would then be notified of those officers on that station , if any , who were on the volunteer database and the station would then be responsible for designating the officer(s ) and informing the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ordinary members remain subject to ORG discipline in the general sense since they remain ORG officers , but they are not reported on in relation to the carrying out of their duties as members of the court - martial and , in particular , in relation to their judicial decision - making . Attempting to influence , or influencing , a member of a court - martial amounts to the common - law offence of perverting the course of justice and/or to the offence of conduct to the prejudice of good order and air - force discipline ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . When the members have been designated and the court - martial has been convened , the members are sent ORG ( ORG ) briefing notes for court - martial members ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) along with a list of prosecution witnesses .

Deliberations of the court - martial members are confidential , a member being forbidden to reveal any opinion or vote . The members of the court - martial are required to speak during deliberations , and at the close of deliberations to vote on verdict and sentence in ascending order of seniority . Decisions on verdict and sentence are reached by majority vote ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . The casting vote on sentence , if needed , rests with the president ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) who , at the time of the applicant 's court - martial , gave the reasons for the sentence in open court . Under the present procedure , those reasons are given by the judge advocate ( Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Rules ) .", "CARDINAL . All guilty verdicts reached , and sentences imposed , by a court - martial must be reviewed by the reviewing authority within prescribed time - limits ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . Although ultimate responsibility rests with ORG , the review is , as a matter of practice , generally delegated to the ORG Secretary or to such officer who at that time is carrying out the duties of the Air Secretary ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Act ) . Post - trial advice is received by the reviewing authority from the Judge Advocate General , who advises whether or not the conviction or sentence should be altered in the convicted person 's favour . This advice is not binding , but is generally accepted by the reviewing authority . It is disclosed to the accused , who has the right to present a petition to the reviewing authority .", "CARDINAL . The reviewing authority may substitute a finding of guilt which could have been made by the court - martial and if the court - martial must have been satisfied as to the facts which would justify making that finding ( section CARDINALAA(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) , and it may also \u201c pass any such sentence ( not being , in the opinion of the authority , more severe than the sentence originally passed ) open to a court - martial on making such a finding as appears proper \u201d ( section CARDINALAA(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) . The reviewing authority also has the power to quash any verdict of guilt and associated sentence and to authorise a retrial ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) . It is then for the prosecuting authority to decide whether to seek a retrial . While the person concerned is not specifically heard by the reviewing authority on the question of retrial , the decision of the prosecuting authority to seek a retrial can be challenged by an accused as an abuse of process . If convicted following a retrial , an individual retains his access on verdict and sentence to ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . The reviewing authority gives a reasoned decision and , should it substitute a finding of guilt and/or sentence , that ruling is treated for all purposes as if it was reached or imposed by the court - martial itself .", "CARDINAL . The Courts - Martial Appeal Court is a civilian court composed of judges from ORG . A convicted person has a right of appeal to ORG against both conviction and sentence ( section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , as amended \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against conviction will be allowed where ORG finds that the conviction is unsafe , but dismissed in all other cases . The test of what is \u201c unsafe \u201d is the same as that applied in appeals against convictions by the civilian criminal courts . An appeal against sentence may be allowed where ORG considers that the sentence is not appropriate for the case ( section CARDINALA of the DATE Act ) . It has power , inter alia , to call for the production of evidence and witnesses , whether or not produced at the court - martial ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . It can also authorise a retrial ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( judgment of ORG of DATE ) , the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of absence without leave and was sentenced to , inter alia , DATE detention . The reviewing authority rejected his petition and Mr Justice PERSON gave the judgment of ORG . Having noted in detail the advice of the Judge Advocate General to the reviewing authority , he quoted as follows from a prior judgment of ORG ( NORP v. PERSON , judgment of DATE ) :", "\u201c In our judgment , the ORG has to bear in mind , in dealing with an appeal of this kind , ... the somewhat ' hybrid jurisdiction ' which [ ORG ] exercises ; in that it is clearly free to correct any injustice , but it nonetheless has to be mindful that those imposing and confirming sentences , particularly , it is to be said ... in relation to an offence of desertion , are particularly well placed and indeed better placed than [ ORG ] in assessing the seriousness of offending in the context of service life . \u201d", "Mr Justice PERSON continued :", "\u201c The offence of going absent without leave , as indeed the offence of desertion , is not one in respect of which any civilian parallel exists . The sentencing considerations involve factors that are particular to the armed services , in respect of which their judgment and experience are entitled to great weight . A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts - martial sentencing decisions , particularly where the Judge Advocate General has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here . The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency , the need for deterrence , the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay , which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere . Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when ORG is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere , and would justify caution in interfering with courts - martial sentences ; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere . \u201d", "NORP v. ORG ( judgment of ORG of DATE ) concerned a retrial following a decision of the reviewing authority . Lord Justice PERSON in ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c The Reviewing Authority directed ... that the Prosecuting ORG consider whether there should be a retrial . That was an inappropriate direction on the part of ORG because under section CARDINALA of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] the decision whether or not to order a retrial must be one for ORG itself and not for ORG , though of course ORG could , if so disposed , canvas the views of ORG , and of the proposed defendant , as to whether or not there should be a retrial . Following that , ORG was advised of the error of its approach and ... directed a retrial in the interests of justice ... If [ such a ] decision of ORG was to be challenged , it could only be challenged by means of judicial review ... \u201d", "In R v. PERSON and NORP v. PERSON ( judgment of ORG of DATE ) , the sentence of the court - martial was DATE detention and the reviewing authority substituted a sentence of DATE imprisonment . ORG quashed the latter sentence and replaced it with a sentence of DATE detention .", "CARDINAL . The briefing notes are sent by ORG to the members selected for a court - martial .

If someone has spoken to you and you have any doubts about your position in this respect , you must tell the Judge Advocate privately before the trial commences .", "CARDINAL . Mention has been made above of the President 's duties . Apart from that , the function of the President and the other officer members is to decide , on the evidence , whether the accused is guilty or not guilty ; and if guilty , then to decide , together with the Judge Advocate , the sentence to be imposed .

However , he should at this stage make sure the officers under instruction are aware of their duty not to do anything which interferes with the conduct of the trial \u2013 e.g. must not say anything or make gestures or imply they have any prior knowledge about the case or the accused , etc . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

While no doubt they are , as officers , answerable for any extra - judicial delinquency , as any judge might be , they are answerable to no one for the discharge of their decision - making function . The only factual matters on which [ the appellants ] could rely were the reports written on ORG who presided [ at CARDINAL of the ORG courts - martial ] ( there being no report on any army [ permanent president ] ) . It would in my opinion be preferable if no DATE report were written on officers serving as [ permanent presidents ] , but those on Wing Commander PERSON gave no support in substance to [ the appellants ' ] argument . While praising the wing commander 's efficiency and effectiveness as a [ permanent president ] , they made no allusion at all to the quality or outcome of any of his judicial decisions , but instead made express reference to the isolated , unsupervised and independent nature of his role . There is no substance in this challenge . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the role of the ordinary or junior members of the court - martial , Lord PERSON found as follows :", "\u201c It goes without saying that any judgment of ORG commands great respect , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE requires the ORG to take any such judgment into account , as it routinely does . There were , however , a large number of points in issue in GPE v. the GPE , and it seems clear that on this particular aspect ORG did not receive all the help which was needed to form a conclusion . It is true that the junior officers who sit on courts - martial have very little legal training , but that is also true of the [ permanent president ] whose presence was accepted [ in GPE ] as a guarantee of the rights of the accused . It is also true that junior officers sitting on courts - martial remain subject to army discipline and reports . But there is nothing to suggest that any report ever is or ever has been made on any junior officer 's decision - making as a member of a court - martial , and it is hard to see how any such report could be made given the prohibition on disclosure of the deliberations of the tribunal in the oath taken by the members . There is nothing to suggest that they remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision - making , and again it is hard to see how they could . It is true that there is no statutory bar on an officer being made subject to external army influence when sitting on the case . Any person seeking to influence the decision of a sitting member of a court - martial otherwise than at the hearing would , however , be at risk of prosecution either for perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice or under LAW of LAW . The officer members are drawn from a different command from the accused . Briefing notes sent to officer members of courts - martial before they sit enjoin them not to ' speak to any unit personnel and certainly not to any unit officer who may be attending the trial in an official capacity or as a spectator ' . They are instructed in writing not to talk to anyone about the case ( other than the other members of the court - martial , when all are together ) for as long as the trial continues , and this instruction is routinely emphasised by the judge advocate . The officers do not occupy accommodation at the unit of the accused and are told to be seen to avoid ' local unit influences ' . They are instructed ' not to associate with ORG personnel either professionally or socially until the trial is over ' . At the outset of the hearing the officers take an oath in terms quoted by ORG in [ paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment in GPE ] , swearing to try the accused ' according to the evidence ' and to ' administer justice according to the Army Act DATE without partiality , favour or affection ' . In considering the independence and impartiality of the [ permanent president ] both the [ ORG in the appellants ' cases ] and ORG in GPE ... attached weight to established convention and practice . In my opinion the rules governing the role of junior officers as members of courts - martial are in practice such as effectively to protect the accused against the risk that they might be subject to ' external army influence ' , as I feel sure ORG would have appreciated had the position been more fully explained . \u201d", "DATE . Turning to the criticism of the reviewing authority in GPE , Lord PERSON noted :", "\u201c Its role can certainly be seen as anomalous , since ordinarily a binding decision of any court can not be disturbed otherwise than ( exceptionally ) by itself or by a superior appellate court . It is however to be noted that the review of conviction and sentence carried out by the reviewing authority , whether the accused seeks such review or not ... can not work otherwise than to the advantage of the accused . The reviewing authority can not substitute conviction of a more serious offence , nor can it substitute a sentence which is in its opinion more severe ( section CARDINALAA(CARDINAL ) ) . This subsection does not confer a discretion , but calls for an exercise of judgment . It is essentially the same exercise of judgment as is required of ORG ... which has not given rise to difficulty in practice . If the reviewing authority were to substitute a sentence which the accused considered to be more severe than that imposed by the court - martial , it would be open to the accused to challenge the substituted sentence on appeal to ORG , and it is important to note that the intervention of the reviewing authority in no way diminishes the rights of the accused on appeal . It is difficult to see any analogy with the situation which ORG considered in GPE v. GPE ... where the applicant , with a final and irreversible judgment of a court in his favour , was deprived of the benefit of that judgment by a later decision in proceedings initiated by a party not involved in the earlier case . If a court - martial is not an independent and impartial tribunal for the trial of civil offences committed by service personnel in GPE and GPE , the reviewing authority could not be relied on to save it . But if it is , I find it difficult to understand how the role of the reviewing authority can undermine or reduce its independence and impartiality . [ The appellants ] recognised the difficulty of this argument and did not seek to sustain the judgment of ORG on the point . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellants had also generally argued that the whole culture of the services was such as to incline those who took part in courts - martial to attach excessive weight to the values of discipline and morale , to the point of rendering a trial unfair . It was argued that the ritual accompanying courts - martial was oppressive and unfair . Lord PERSON observed :", "\u201c I would for my part have no hesitation in agreeing that a court - martial is a court of law , not a parade , and its procedures ( while properly involving some formality ) should be those appropriate to a court of law and not the parade ground . I would also accept that officers serving on courts - martial will disapprove of those found to have acted in breach of the law governing their respective service . But judges and jurors in ORG will similarly disapprove of those found to have infringed the ordinary criminal law . There is no reason to think that in the former case any more than in the latter such disapproval will infect the tribunal 's approach to deciding whether the particular accused has broken the law in the manner charged . Officers will appreciate , better than anyone , that to convict and punish those not shown to be guilty is not to promote the interests of good discipline and high morale but to sow the seeds of disaffection and perhaps even mutiny . In the absence of any evidence at all to support it , I could not accept the suggestion that any modern officer would , despite the oath he has taken , exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON rejected the suggestion that , by its very nature , a trial of a civilian offence by court - martial was incompatible with LAW and he referred , in this respect , to this ORG 's judgment in PERSON and Others v. the GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and to PERSON ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Since the trial by court - martial did not in itself violate LAW , the decision as to whether the court - martial was to be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal depended on the safeguards which were in place . He noted generally in this respect :", "\u201c A submission of this kind requires CARDINAL , as a starting - point , to consider what is meant by the requirement that a tribunal should be independent and impartial . As ORG noted in GPE ... the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked . In the present cases , in substance , the court - martial must be guarded from the risk of influence by the prosecution and guarded from the risk of influence by the relevant service authorities , especially superior officers who might wish to secure some particular result , supposedly in the interests of the morale or discipline of the service or of some particular unit . As a result of the abolition of the role of the convening officer by LAW , no issue was raised in these cases as to the independence of the members of the tribunal from the prosecution . On the other hand , Article CARDINAL does not require that the members of the tribunal should not share the values of the military community to which they belong any more than it requires that the judge or members of the jury in a civil court should be divorced from the values of the wider community of which they form part . What matters is that , while sharing the values of the service community , the members of the court - martial should put aside any prejudices which they may have and act DATE and be seen to act DATE independently and impartially in deciding the issues in the case before them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to permanent presidents , Lord PERSON observed that , while there had been no appraisal reports on permanent presidents in the army since DATE , the ORG had continued the practice of preparing reports on permanent presidents . He was of the view that \u201c that practice [ was ] undesirable and , as the army experience show[ed ] , unnecessary . It would be better if it were discontinued \u201d . However , he went on to observe that such reports generally , and the ones completed in the case before him , commented on the manner in which the permanent president had tackled his role as a permanent president ( referring to the administrative aspects of the job ) and did not bear on his actual decisions when sitting in a court - martial . Indeed , Lord PERSON noted that the reports in question had recognised that the permanent president 's role was one in which the president was \u201c isolated and unsupervised and which GPE ] independence \u201d which the ORG Secretary \u201c honour[ed ] and respect[ed ] \u201d . The reports did not therefore give the slightest reason to doubt the permanent president 's independence . On the contrary , he considered that", "\u201c ... all involved in making these reports were well aware of the need not to intrude upon the decisions reached by him when sitting as president . Even had anyone wished to intrude , the oath of secrecy taken by the members of courts - martial would have made it impossible to investigate those decisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the other members of the court - martial , Lord PERSON noted the conclusion of ORG . He also observed , however , that \u201c for whatever reason ... ORG was given rather less information than the [ ORG ] about the safeguards relating to the officers serving on courts - martial \u201d . He drew parallels between the members of the court - martial and jurors , noting that , while jurors brought certain prejudices and experiences with them to a trial , the safeguards of an oath and the trial judge 's directions were considered by the domestic courts and by ORG to be sufficient to ensure that jurors put aside their prejudices and reached a just verdict on the evidence . The members of courts - martial took a similar oath and the judge advocate gave them the same kind of directions which a trial judge would have given jurors : there was no reason to suppose that members of a court - martial would be less faithful to their oath or less diligent in applying the directions given by the judge advocate than would jurors , particularly when \u201c trust and obedience to commands \u201d were important to the officers sitting on a court - martial .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , Lord PERSON considered that the steps taken to ensure that the members of a court - martial acted independently and impartially were , on CARDINAL view , even more strict than with a jury . Those steps had not , he noted , been outlined to the ORG in GPE . He went on to detail those steps . In this connection , he referred to the briefing notes sent to members of the court - martial and noted as relevant safeguards those matters outlined at paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of those notes . Lord PERSON commented on these safeguards as follows :", "\u201c The various provisions which I have quoted from the briefing notes for the members of courts - martial reinforce significantly the message , proclaimed in any event by the oath and the directions of the judge advocate , that the members are to act independently and impartially . In order to be seen to avoid local unit influences , the members are not to stay in public accommodation at the accused 's unit . They are not to speak to unit personnel and especially not to any officer who may be attending the trial DATE at the risk of being debarred from the trial or indeed of the trial being prejudiced . They are not to associate either professionally or socially with such personnel until the trial is over . There is a veto on the president briefing the other members of the court in the absence of the judge advocate . The members are to tell the court administration officer if they know something about the accused which could prejudice their impartiality or if they know someone who might be a witness in the case . The members are warned not to talk to anyone else about the case as long as it continues . They are not to look at any papers which are before the judge advocate , prosecutor or defence counsel , for fear of seeing something which they ought not to . When they deliberate on conviction or sentence , the most junior member is to give his opinion orally first \u2013 again , obviously , with the aim of ensuring that the junior members express their own personal view , uninfluenced by the more senior members . In terms of the members ' oath their deliberations are to be kept secret and this secrecy is further ensured by the instruction to the court orderly at the end of the proceedings to burn or shred all scrap paper . Again , the object is to prevent the members feeling , or coming under , any outside pressure during or after the trial by reason of their participation in the decision in the case .", "[ The appellants ] did not suggest that these were other than genuine instructions to the members which they were intended to observe . Nor was it suggested that the instructions were in practice ignored or that they had been ignored in these particular cases . But if they are indeed observed , I find it hard , if not impossible , to see how anyone either in the court or , more particularly , outside the court could improperly influence the members ' decision either on conviction or on sentence . Certainly , it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure that , while sitting in the court - martial , the officers act not as officers subject to command but as independent and impartial members of the court , reaching the verdict and determining the sentence according to law but according also to their own individual conscience . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON noted that there were , however , CARDINAL differences between members of a court - martial and an ordinary jury , differences which he concluded did not undermine the independence of the former :", "\u201c First , the routines , the periods of boredom and the pleasures , pains and pressures of service life would be unknown to most jurors DATE , although they would have been familiar to many of their fathers and grandfathers . By contrast , members of a court - martial know all about them and about the society in which the accused lives and works . [ The appellants ' counsel ] suggested that officers on a court - martial , imbued by their training with notions of rank and discipline , would always tend to believe the evidence of a fellow officer or a non - commissioned officer rather than the evidence of a private . By contrast , he said , members of a jury , who carried no such burden of preconceptions , would be able to see more clearly and judge purely on the evidence before them . Of course , this submission was really just a matter of assertion . There was , and could be , no evidence to back it up . Indeed , it was somewhat undermined by the conviction of [ CARDINAL of ] the appellants ... [ Those appellants ' ] conviction was based on the evidence of [ CARDINAL Guardsmen ] ... In accepting the guardsmen 's evidence , the court - martial must have disbelieved the evidence of their superiors in rank ... In any event , it is possible to fashion an argument \u2013 equally a matter of assertion \u2013 that officers who are familiar with service life and who are in close contact with service personnel of all ranks may well be less impressed by mere rank and better able to gauge the underlying realities than jurors confronted for the first time with officers or non - commissioned officers telling an apparently plausible tale . Viewed in this light , the specialised knowledge and experience of the members of a court - martial could be seen as a positive advantage rather than as a disadvantage . However that may be , I see no reason to think that , when duly directed by the judge advocate , officers on a court - martial can not properly assess the evidence and return a true verdict based on it . I therefore reject the appellants ' argument on this point .", "The members of a court - martial perform a role in deciding sentence which is no part of a jury 's function in GPE . I accept that , in determining sentence , the members will indeed have regard to such issues as the impact of the offence on service morale and discipline . They will , inevitably , be more aware of these effects than a civil judge would be . Therefore , while the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of the members should mean that they approach their verdict in much the same way as jurors in a civil trial , it can not be assumed that , when passing sentence , the court - martial will necessarily give exactly the same weight to these service factors as would a ORG judge . The sentences which a court - martial passes may therefore not coincide exactly with the sentences which a civil judge would pass on the same facts . In my view that does not call the decisions of the courts - martial into question , either generally or in terms of LAW . Any difference in sentencing does not mean that the members are not independent or impartial , but merely that , though both independent and impartial , they may assess the various factors differently ... There are ... CARDINAL additional points to bear in mind . The first is that the judge advocate advises the other members on sentence and also has a vote on sentence . He will be able to bring to bear his informed view as a lawyer on what sentence would be suitable . The second safeguard is that any sentence imposed by the court - martial is subject not only to review by the reviewing authority but also to appeal , on the ground that it is not appropriate , with the leave of the [ ORG ] . The members of the [ ORG ] are civil judges and are in a position to correct any inappropriate punishment that the court - martial may impose by reason of the members ' military background . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered that all of these matters had to be borne in mind when considering the particular characteristics of the members of the court - martial to which the Chamber attached importance in GPE . He went on to identify and disagree with the specific concerns expressed by the ORG in that case as regards the independence of the ordinary members :", "\u201c The first was that the officer members had no legal training . That applies also in the present cases and indeed must apply in virtually all cases . As the briefing notes show , officers who may be called upon to sit on courts - martial are given some training by being allowed to sit and observe proceedings , including the members ' deliberations . This should mean that , when they are eventually asked to sit , they should not find the procedures wholly unknown or strange , but it goes no further than that . While in GPE v. GPE ORG seems to have regarded the lack of formal legal training as a significant defect , as I have already noted , in PERSON v. the GPE ... ORG held that ORG was an independent and impartial tribunal , even though CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members were military officers with no legal training . Given the other safeguards which were in place in the present cases , I see no reason to conclude that the absence of legal training undermined the members ' independence and impartiality .", "ORG attached importance to the fact that the officers , other than the permanent president , remained subject to army discipline and reports . In so far as the members of the courts - martial in the present cases also remained subject to service discipline , they simply shared the characteristic of all serving members of the armed forces . It must have been equally true of the military members of ORG in PERSON v. the GPE . Moreover , the fuller information available to the ORG about the safeguards in place to protect the independence of the members of courts - martial shows clearly , in my view , that , just like the NORP officers in PERSON v. the GPE , the officers in these cases would not have been under the command of any higher authority in their function as members of the courts - martial . Indeed , as [ ORG ] pointed out , contrary to the assumption of ORG , there was even a formal legal bar to any superior officer trying to influence their decision , since this would have constituted the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice .", "It is true , of course , that , as in GPE v. GPE , so also in these cases , leaving aside the permanent presidents , the officers sitting on the courts - martial would have remained subject to reports . [ The appellants ] indeed drew attention to a number of such reports where mention is made of the fact that , during DATE in question , the officer concerned had sat as a member of a court - martial . In itself that must be unobjectionable since the information that the particular officer has had this experience may be relevant at some future date if , for instance , consideration is being given to appointing a permanent president . What would be objectionable would be any report which made reference , whether favourable or unfavourable , to an officer 's decisions when sitting on a court - martial . But [ the appellants ] could point to no report where this had been done . The only report which referred to an officer 's performance in relation to a court - martial was one relating to [ CARDINAL officer ] : ' Her foray into the court - martial arena has brought particular accolades for her thoughtful and incisive contribution to the legal process ' . The report showed that [ that officer ] had acted not only as junior member on several courts - martial but also as assistant defending officer to an airman tried by a general court - martial . It appears that the comment may well have related to this second role . In any event the report makes no comment on any decision reached by [ that officer ] when sitting as a member of a court - martial . Indeed counsel for the [ ORG ] showed the ORG a number of statements from officers concerned with personnel matters who had read CARDINAL of DATE reports and had never seen mention of such a thing . That being so , again with the benefit of this more detailed information , I would not share the view of ORG in GPE v. the GPE that the independence and impartiality of officers sitting on courts - martial are compromised by the fact that they remain subject to the system of DATE reports .", "For all these reasons I consider that those charged with administering the system of courts - martial have been at pains to put in place a series of practical safeguards which are designed to secure the independence and impartiality of those sitting on these courts . Nor is this surprising . There is not a little force in the point made by the [ ORG ] that , if service factors are to be seen as an aspect or function of the public interest , they will themselves require that the court - martial process should be , and should be seen to be , fair and impartial and , so far as possible , to achieve accurate results . Otherwise both servicemen and the public would lose confidence in it , with consequential effects on good order and discipline .", "Having regard in particular to the additional information which was not before ORG , I would therefore hold that the safeguards built into the system are indeed such that no fair - minded and informed observer who had considered them would conclude that there was a real possibility that the courts - martial in these cases lacked independence or impartiality in this respect . In other words they were , objectively , independent and impartial . I would accordingly reject the Article CARDINAL challenge based on the role of the officer members . \u201d", "DATE . Finally , Lord PERSON turned to the reviewing authority and to the finding in GPE that the role played by that authority constituted in itself a reason for finding that a court - martial had not been independent or impartial . Lord PERSON did not agree . Indeed , he noted that even the appellants before him had difficulty in supporting the ORG 's reasoning in PERSON on this point . He continued :", "\u201c The reviewing authority is , admittedly , an unusual institution . It does not operate like an ordinary court and , at a certain level of abstract theory , its existence could seem to be inconsistent with the charge against an accused being determined by only a system of ' tribunals ' . That appears to be the way in which ORG has treated it . But if , as the court indicates , the issue can also be characterised as relating to the independence of the court - martial , I find it difficult to see how the existence of this body affects that independence . It might , of course , be different if there were any suggestion that the decisions of the courts - martial were influenced by the existence of the reviewing authority , for example , because they tended to convict more readily or to impose heavier sentences in the knowledge that the reviewing authority could always quash them . But [ the appellants ] made no such submission and there is nothing whatever in the information before the ORG that would support it . On the contrary , [ the appellants ] accepted that the provision for review could only be to the benefit , and not to the detriment , of someone who had been convicted . In particular , it could provide a quick and simple means of correcting a mistaken decision by a court - martial .", "...", "In reaching its conclusion on this point ORG was particularly concerned by the fact that the decision as to whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court - martial would have been left to the discretion of the reviewing authority . When making this observation the ORG does not appear to have been referred to , or to have had in mind , the coda to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] which establishes , as a matter of law , the relative positions of particular punishments in the hierarchy of punishments set out in the subsection and which deals specifically with how detention and imprisonment are to relate to one another . Particularly when these provisions are taken into account , it is hard to see how , in reality , there is likely to be any scope for the reviewing authority to exercise the kind of discretion that appears to have troubled ORG . In truth , counsel could refer to no case where any problem as to the relative severity of CARDINAL punishments had arisen . If , by chance , however , the reviewing authority were to go wrong on the point , the person affected could ask the appeal court for leave to appeal .", "In all the cases under appeal except [ one ] , the reviewing authority did not intervene , but the appellants were granted leave to appeal to the [ ORG ] . Where they had other arguable grounds of appeal relating to conviction or sentence , the [ ORG ] dealt with them , as well as with LAW CARDINAL grounds , in their reasoned judgments . In these circumstances I am , with due respect to the decision of ORG in GPE v GPE , unable to see why the mere existence of the reviewing authority , or the reduction of [ a ] period of detention [ in CARDINAL case ] , should lead to the conclusion that the determination of the charges against the appellants was not reached by a ' tribunal ' that was ' independent and impartial ' for the purposes of Article CARDINAL . I would therefore reject the appellants ' Article CARDINAL argument based on the role of the reviewing authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
