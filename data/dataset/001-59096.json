On the other hand , the court found no reason to release the applicant on health grounds or on any of the grounds listed in LAW ( see also paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) because it considered that the applicant \u2019s continued hunger strike was aimed at compelling the court to make a \u201c favourable decision \u201d on his detention .", "CARDINAL .

The application was dismissed at first instance on DATE and , on appeal , by ORG , on DATE . Both courts held that there was no valid reason to release the applicant as his condition , even though serious , had been aggravated by the injuries which he had inflicted on himself . The courts also relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature .", "CARDINAL .

In view of that , the court cancelled a hearing listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unknown date , the applicant swallowed CARDINAL metal rods and CARDINAL pieces of wire .

On DATE ORG dismissed a subsequent application for release made by the applicant on an unspecified date . In its decision , the court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature . Finding that there were no special circumstances that might justify releasing him on health grounds , the court also took into account a medical certificate which stated that the applicant could receive medical treatment in prison .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , at DATE , the applicant had complained to the prison authorities about various ailments , in particular a cyst in his kidney and urinary problems . Several ultrasound examinations carried out at that time showed that the applicant had a cyst of a diameter of QUANTITY in his kidney .

On DATE ORG decided to apply to ORG for the applicant \u2019s detention on remand to be prolonged until DATE . That application was made in view of the fact that an amendment to LAW ( setting maximum statutory time - limits for detention on remand ) was to take effect on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and at the time the applicant \u2019s detention had already exceeded the relevant time - limit . In that application , the court relied on the following , principal reasons :", "\u201c The trial was set for DATE but it did not take place because the accused went on hunger strike for DATE . When the accused finished his hunger strike , he deliberately inflicted injuries on himself in order to compel [ the court ] to make a favourable decision to vary the preventive measure imposed on him . ...", "That made it impossible for that court to continue , or even to start , the trial .

It did not ( and does not ) emerge from the expert opinions that his state would endanger his life or health , especially as [ the applicant ] is under permanent medical care . At present , he is held in FAC .", "For these reasons the application for his detention to be prolonged is justified . His detention should be prolonged until DATE because , given his acts of self - harm , it is not known when the accused will be brought to trial . \u201d", "Since the relevant amendment did not come into force until DATE , that application was never lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred the applicant \u2019s application for release of DATE to ORG . On DATE the President of ORG transferred it to the Chief Judge of ORG of that court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting as ORG dismissed that application , holding that there were no circumstances concerning the applicant \u2019s health which might militate in favour of his release and that the bad state of his health had been caused entirely by his own conduct . The court considered that the applicant wanted to compel it to \u201c make a favourable decision on his detention \u201d and that the \u201c impossibility of bringing him to trial had diminished the chances of resolving his complaints \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on an unknown date , the applicant had complained to ORG about the length of his detention , which had already exceeded DATE . On DATE his complaint was referred to ORG . On DATE the Vice President of that court replied to the complaint .

He also stressed that there had been no indication that the applicant should have been released on health grounds because he was , and had been , under medical care in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court asked the authorities of FAC about the applicant \u2019s health . The Director of ORG replied on DATE . He stated that the applicant had some of the metal objects he had swallowed in his stomach but he had refused to undergo an operation in the prison hospital . In the Director \u2019s opinion , the applicant was fit to participate in his trial but unfit to be transferred to Bia\u0142ystok .", "CARDINAL . Later , the applicant asked ORG to release him in view of his state of health . That application was dismissed on DATE . The applicant appealed against the refusal , arguing that his detention on remand had meanwhile exceeded DATE and that his state of health was desperately bad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that appeal , finding that even though the applicant had been held in custody for DATE , the prolongation of his detention had been attributable to his behaviour alone . The court considered that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid . It pointed out that the further course of the proceedings exclusively depended on the applicant \u2019s behaviour . It suggested that a change in the applicant \u2019s attitude would result in the immediate examination of his case and that such a change might in turn have resulted in the court \u2019s \u201c altering its view on whether the detention should be continued \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The last instance of such behaviour took place on DATE . For that reason , he is unfit for a transfer . He can participate in his trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE or DATE the applicant made a subsequent application for release . On DATE ORG dismissed it in view of the high probability that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature . The court also found no circumstances militating in favour of releasing the applicant on health grounds , as defined in LAW . In that context , it pointed out that the applicant \u2019s health depended on himself , especially as its current state had resulted from his hunger strike and self - inflicted injuries . Finally , the court stressed that it emerged from medical evidence that his continued detention did not constitute a danger to his life or health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court asked the authorities of FAC whether the applicant could be transferred to FAC .

On DATE ORG dismissed his application , holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and that the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings militated against his release . The court also held that there was no reason to release the applicant on health grounds because the ailments from which he suffered did not constitute a danger to his life or health and had resulted from his own deliberate acts of self - harm .", "DATE . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG upheld that decision and held , inter alia :", "\u201c It is true that the accused is sick , although most of his ailments result from self - inflicted injuries . For that reason he is under constant medical observation in prison . He also consults doctors . The prison authorities have not indicated that his condition worsened so significantly as to result in his detention in the prison hospital being a danger to him .", "As to the second argument adduced by the accused , an argument which in reality amounts to his objection to evidence [ against him ] , it has to be noted that the trial court has at its disposal evidence gathered by the prosecution but has been unable to scrutinise it because the accused has been obstructing the conduct of the trial .
