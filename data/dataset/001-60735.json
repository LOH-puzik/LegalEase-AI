SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was born in DATE , applied for disability benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . He claimed that he was in need of assistance and had additional costs due to a speech impediment caused by a laryngectomy operation in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE rejected the application , finding that the applicant \u2019s needs or costs were not such as to make him eligible for disability benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to review its decision under LAW , section CARDINAL a of LAW . He claimed that he had failed to fully state his need of assistance and his additional costs in the original application . On DATE he asked the ORG , alternatively , to consider his request as a new application and to grant him benefits as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that there was no basis for a review of its earlier decision . Further , in regard to the applicant \u2019s alternative claim , the ORG noted that the applicant had reached DATE and that information relating to the time that followed could not be taken into account under the relevant rules . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s alternative claim was rejected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . On CARDINAL DATE the court gave judgment in his favour . It considered that the ORG \u2019s first decision had been based on insufficient information and that the ORG should therefore have reviewed that decision at the applicant \u2019s request . It noted that , according to the CARDINAL medical certificates in the case , the applicant had considerable additional costs due to his handicap . Consequently , he was entitled to disability benefits as long as his need of assistance and his additional costs , taken together , attained the level required under LAW . Accepting the information submitted by the applicant in this regard , the court found that that level had been attained and granted him a disability allowance as from DATE . The court did not hold an oral hearing nor , apparently , did the applicant request one .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket ; hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) appealed against ORG judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , requesting that the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE be confirmed . ORG claimed that the information in the case showed that , before DATE , the applicant had not suffered a functional impairment to such an extent that his need of assistance and extra expenses on account thereof had made him eligible for a disability allowance . Thus , the ORG \u2019s first decision could not be considered to have been incorrect due to it being based on incorrect or incomplete material . Consequently , there were no grounds for a review under LAW . ORG further requested the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the appealed judgment . The latter request was granted by a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made submissions in response to the ORG \u2019s appeal . On DATE he requested ORG to hold an oral hearing in the case during which the person in charge of the case at the ORG should give evidence relating to the meaning of its decision and the information on which it had been based . The applicant also asked the court to obtain the opinion of a medical expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both requests . In regard to the request for an oral hearing , the court , after having restated section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG , ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ; see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) , gave the following reasons :", "\u201c Having regard to the subject - matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case , [ the court ] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect .", "[ The applicant ] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within DATE after having been notified of this decision .", "The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and ORG made further submissions . The applicant maintained that ORG had failed to adequately explain the reasons for its appeal and posed several questions to ORG . He requested that the court order the ORG to clarify its position in the case . The court did not do so , however . The applicant \u2019s submissions were , however , forwarded to the ORG which replied that it maintained its position in the case . On account of the court \u2019s refusal to order the ORG to clarify its position and to hold a hearing , the applicant called into question the impartiality of the proceedings . By letters of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE he reiterated his request for an oral hearing , stating that a hearing would give him the opportunity to ask questions to ORG and to present judgments in similar cases in support of his application for disability benefits . Furthermore , in assessing his condition , the court would benefit from having met him in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s renewed requests for an oral hearing and gave judgment in favour of ORG . Thus , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , it quashed ORG judgment and confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . Without giving any further reasons , it considered that there had been no basis for a review of the ORG \u2019s first decision . The dissenting judges considered that the applicant was entitled to the disability allowance granted to him by ORG and that , for this reason , there were exceptional reasons to change the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) . He requested that the case be referred back to ORG for re - examination or , alternatively , that ORG confirm ORG judgment . He complained about the lack of an oral hearing in ORG and also requested ORG to hold an oral hearing . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a renewed request for a disability allowance . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found that he had special needs and costs due to his handicap which made him eligible for disability benefits under LAW . As an allowance could be given retroactively only for DATE preceding the application , the applicant was granted an allowance as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses . According to the ORG \u2019s guidelines , the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to PERCENT of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance . In DATE and DATE , when the applicant made his applications to the ORG , this corresponded to CARDINAL and MONEY ( SEK ) , respectively .", "CARDINAL . A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG . Appeals may be made against the ORG \u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review DATE , section CARDINAL a of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The latter provision enables the ORG to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision , provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court . Thus , the ORG must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error , miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason . The question of changing a decision under LAW a should , in principle , be raised within DATE from DATE the decision was taken . However , it may nevertheless be changed if it appears only after the elapse of this DATE period that it was based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or if there are other exceptional reasons . A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned .", "CARDINAL . The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p.
