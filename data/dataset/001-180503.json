The parties\u2019 submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present case are set out below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public demonstration entitled the \u201c DATE of CARDINAL \u201d was held in central GPE to protest against the allegedly rigged presidential elections . The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at FAC , which was supposed to end at TIME The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions , but when the marchers arrived at FAC it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue , allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting . To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers ; there were numerous clashes between the CARDINAL sides . At TIME the police ordered the meeting to finish early and began to disperse the participants . It took them TIME to clear the square .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE city department of ORG opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . On CARDINAL DATE the file was transferred to the headquarters of ORG for further investigation . On DATE an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder ( LAW ) . The CARDINAL criminal cases were joined on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of his arrest the applicant was a DATE student at ORG and worked part - time as a courier for an insurance company . According to him , on DATE he arrived at FAC to take part in the march and walked with other participants to FAC . Upon arrival there he discovered that the police cordon had blocked access to the square . When passage to the stage of the rally taking place along the embankment was opened , the applicant went in that direction . The police started to disperse the protesters , using excessive force and beating them with truncheons . In response , the protesters dragged metal barriers in place to protect themselves from the police . At CARDINAL point the applicant observed a protester in a green T - shirt , who CARDINAL or QUANTITY police officers were holding and beating with truncheons .

On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be placed in pre - trial detention until DATE .

According to that report , the applicant was an active member of organisations of a destructive character . If he were to stay at liberty , he planned to threaten witnesses , abscond and obstruct the investigation . The court concluded that those circumstances gave sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant was likely to flee to avoid the investigation and trial , destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the investigation of the criminal case , which was still at an initial stage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE charges were brought against the applicant under LAW ( participation in acts of mass disorder accompanied by violence ) . He was accused , in particular , of resisting police officers by pushing them away when they were arresting other protestors and by trying to liberate the latter .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the extension order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , essentially on the same grounds as earlier , noting that the circumstances justifying the detention order had not changed .

ORG upheld the extension order on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted another extension of detention in respect of CARDINAL defendants , including the applicant . It ordered their detention until DATE on the grounds of the gravity of the charges and the nature of the offences imputable to them . On DATE ORG upheld that extension order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held in GPE for the whole period of his pre - trial detention from DATE . According to him , the conditions of his detention had been poor . The applicant referred to cases against GPE in which the ORG had previously found a breach of LAW because of overcrowding in GPE in DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no .

He testified that the applicant had impeded him and CARDINAL other police officers from arresting a protester by grabbing T. \u2019s hand and pushing the officers away . The applicant had caused him pain but had not inflicted any injuries . During the hearing the applicant and his lawyers applied to deprive T. of victim status because no harm had been caused to him , but the court refused that request as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Zamoskvoretsky District Court of GPE found the applicant guilty as charged . It held , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c TIME on DATE ... at FAC ... unidentified persons ... called those present [ at the venue ] to move outside the agreed meeting venue , to defy the lawful orders of the police ... , to use violence ... which led to mass disorder accompanied by the use of violence against public officials in connection with the performance of their duties [ and ] the destruction of property .", "On DATE at TIME at the latest [ the defendants ] acquired the criminal intent to participate in mass disorder and to use violence against ... police officers ...", "Moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw chunks of tarmac , stones , sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body , and [ the defendants ] ... [ who ] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [ officials ] ...", "[ The applicant ] ... who was wearing a surgical mask to hide his face , together with unidentified persons ... tried to liberate those arrested by the police for a breach of public order and pushed the police officers away ...", "... [ the applicant ] used violence against Police Officer [ T. ] which did not endanger his life or health ...", "[ The applicant ] ... from TIME to TIME ... when unidentified participants of acts of mass disorder tried to break the police cordon , acting intentionally and using force , grabbed [ T. \u2019s ] hand and then pulled it off the person whom [ T. ] was arresting , thus impeding his apprehension , which caused [ T. ] pain .", "In addition , [ the applicant ] together with unidentified persons ... built a line of metal barriers blocking the police \u2019s movements , and ... tried to repel the line of police officers ... with the help of those barriers .", "[ The applicant ] pleaded not guilty and testified that ... he had decided to attend the public gathering on DATE ... for the purposes of personal security he wore a surgical mask ... [ The applicant ] was at the bridge when a blockage occurred . He did not see what was happening , but at CARDINAL point ... he had been able to proceed with the flow of people towards the stage . There [ the applicant ] saw the mass beating of people by police officers and participants of the rally starting to bring forward metal barriers ... and to put them close to the police officers , trying to protect themselves from the latter . [ The applicant ] was standing close to the barriers , taking his hands off when the police officers used their truncheons to hit over the barriers . Then ... [ the applicant ] saw a group of CARDINAL or QUANTITY police officers who were trying to seize a young man in a green T - shirt . They hit the man with their truncheons , and [ the applicant ] , considering that the man was in danger because the police actions were unlawful , tried to snatch him from the ORG hands . He grasped the young man \u2019s waistband , pulled it and turned his back to protect him from the truncheon blows . [ The applicant ] finds it conceivable that in this turmoil he might unintentionally have pushed someone and asks for attention to be paid to [ T. \u2019s ] statements that the latter did not feel any pain . Then [ the applicant ] was arrested and taken to a police vehicle .", "... the court considers the [ defendants\u2019 ] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be victims of the police \u2019s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
