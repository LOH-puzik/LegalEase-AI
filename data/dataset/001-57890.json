Upon the basis of this picture , which they had a part in painting , they enjoyed , for a time , an esteem or reputation which was highly valuable to them . CARDINAL applicant gave separate interviews to ORG , The DATE FAC and ORG . A further interview involving the brothers took place on DATE . In these interviews the brothers described a wealthy , distinguished and established family background . They gave a similar picture to their merchant banker , who accepted it and , acting on their behalf , conveyed that picture by a press release in DATE and in a television interview in DATE . There were other press interviews about the family background for which the applicants were responsible .", "They thus took active steps to promote their own reputations in the public domain . The acceptance of the brothers by GPE and by the Government was later considered to be crucial to an understanding of the events surrounding their takeover of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The takeover was vigorously but unsuccessfully opposed by ORG ( \" Lonrho \" ) and , in particular , its Chief Executive , PERSON , a former business associate , turned rival , of the applicants .", "From DATE , if not earlier , it had been ORG \u2019s wish to acquire ORG . In DATE , following a report from ORG the Secretary of ORG ( \" the Secretary of ORG \" ) had sought and obtained from ORG undertakings not to acquire or control any further shareholdings beyond its then level of PERCENT of ORG .

PERSON proceeded to launch an acrimonious campaign against the applicants . In opposing the applicants\u2019 bid for ORG , ORG had made submissions to Ministers concerning unfair competition and the undesirability of ORG falling into foreign hands . It was alleged that the applicants were fraudulently claiming that the funds for the acquisition were theirs personally . PERSON asserted that the brothers were lying about their money and themselves and that they should not be permitted to acquire ORG without a thorough inquiry . However , the ORG bid was cleared by ORG ( \" ORG \" ) and accepted by ORG . In DATE the Secretary of ORG decided , on the recommendation of ORG , not to refer the ORG proposed acquisition to ORG , as had been done in the case of the earlier bid by ORG . The decision of Government clearance was expressly described at the time by the ORG as having been influenced by the statements made and assurances given by and on behalf of the PERSON brothers about their bid . ORG nevertheless campaigned on through the media and other publications , and in particular through The ORG , a newspaper it owned .", "CARDINAL .

In particular , it was alleged that the applicants , by false statements about their financial capacity to acquire the share capital and develop ORG \u2019s business , had persuaded ORG to accept their bid and had convinced the Secretary of ORG not to refer their bid to ORG . It was claimed that the applicants had thereby tortiously interfered with ORG \u2019s right to bid for the shares or , alternatively , they had conspired against ORG .", "ORG unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal to refer the applicants\u2019 acquisition of ORG to ORG .", "CARDINAL .

They were also concerned about the veracity of the statements which the applicants made , or which they allowed others to make on their behalf , which had the effect of influencing people to act favourably towards them ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL ; and also chapter CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG During the course of the investigation , the ORG identified matters upon which they wished to receive evidence . If any uncertainty or issue arose in relation to the provision of such evidence , these were discussed in the course of meetings or through correspondence between the Inspectors\u2019 staff and the applicants\u2019 solicitors . Thereafter , information was provided to the ORG by way of memoranda , together with copy documentation . In addition , the ORG received oral evidence by interviewing witnesses on oath . Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were interviewed , in the presence of their lawyers , on DATE and again on DATE . All proceedings were conducted in private . There was no opportunity for the applicants to confront or cross - examine witnesses , it being well - established as a matter of LANGUAGE law that the Inspectors were not obliged to afford such an opportunity to anyone .", "CARDINAL . ORG It was agreed between the ORG and the applicants that , having assimilated the factual information supplied , the ORG would notify the applicants of the provisional conclusions they had reached and the material upon which they had relied in reaching such conclusions . The ORG would then consider such submissions as the applicants might make in respect of these conclusions .", "CARDINAL . Respect for personal privacy was known to be a matter of especial concern to the applicants . The Inspectors\u2019 approach to matters of privacy and confidentiality is summed up in their report ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) as follows :", "\" [ I]f private people incorporate a company , in which they become directors , and which makes public representations about their affairs , ORG who are appointed to investigate the truth of those representations must balance their concern to preserve the ORG privacy as far as practicable ... against their duty to do the job which they were appointed to perform .", "If the PERSON had chosen to say nothing this might have created evidential difficulties for us . But because they wished us to make findings in their favour they brought witnesses to see us ... and gave us evidence about their private affairs which it was then our duty to test . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG At the start of the investigation the applicants expressly accepted that the Inspectors were entitled to inquire into the accuracy of statements which had been made by them or on their behalf in DATE and DATE . These were the statements at the heart of the investigation . Only at DATE of the investigation , when they were confronted by the ORG with \" overwhelming evidence \" that they had been telling lies , did they resile from that stance and challenge the Inspectors\u2019 entitlement to look into certain aspects of their private life ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG rejected the challenge and gave their reasons for so doing ( see generally chapter CARDINAL of the Inspectors\u2019 report ) . The ORG were entitled to seek confidential information from third parties , but before doing so they gave the applicants an opportunity to satisfy them as to the accuracy of the statements \" in whatever manner was least obtrusive to their privacy \" ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL ) . The law did not permit them to compel the applicants to produce personal bank statements ( which would have gone far to confirm or refute the accuracy of the statements ) nor , save to a very limited extent , did the applicants consent to such production . The ORG considered that the applicants were in breach of their duty to give all the assistance which they were reasonably required to give . By virtue of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW could have certified this to a court , which could then have taken steps to sanction the applicants if , after hearing evidence , it was satisfied that they were in breach of their duty ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG were , however , of the opinion that they could complete their task without the need to resort to such a serious measure and chose to pursue the matter without making such a certificate . They made clear that if the applicants chose not to give evidence , they , the ORG , would be entitled to draw inferences from such failure .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE and thereafter ORG publicly criticised the conduct of the investigation by the ORG and sought DATE period in which to assemble and submit evidence to them . Through its lawyers , ORG argued that the rules of natural justice required the ORG to allow ORG access to the information the ORG had received from the applicants because ORG \u2019s commercial reputation would suffer if the ORG dismissed the complaints which it had made so publicly . The ORG dismissed ORG \u2019s application for access to the applicants\u2019 evidence , but permitted ORG to have a longer period in which to adduce evidence to them , relating primarily to the personal background of the applicants and their family . The applicants\u2019 solicitors in turn protested to the ORG vigorously about this latter decision . The written material provided to the ORG by ORG ran to CARDINAL of pages . The ORG accepted that ORG and its directors had pursued their ends in a remarkably single - minded manner , and they described the applicants and PERSON as \" bitterly antagonistic parties \" ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Inspectors\u2019 provisional conclusions , which exceeded CARDINAL pages of text and were , in large part , unfavourable to the applicants , were made available to the applicants on DATE . The ORG had previously made known to the applicants the gist of the adverse evidence received and the conclusions that they , the ORG , might be disposed to draw from that evidence .", "DATE and DATE there was no significant response from the applicants . On DATE the applicants\u2019 solicitors informed the ORG that they were not even in a position to discuss the procedural situation of the inquiry . The ORG told the ORG solicitors on DATE that by DATE the ORG would consider that they had had ample time to respond to the provisional conclusions . On DATE the applicants lodged detailed submissions running to CARDINAL pages and containing a mixture of factual analysis and legal argument and , quite often , new evidence . The argument sought to limit the scope of the inquiry very drastically . The applicants\u2019 solicitors requested the ORG , as \" the basic minimum which fairness required \" , to deal with certain questions raised and , if rejecting any of their principal submissions , to state reasons before issuing any report ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL and chapter CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG delivered their report to the Secretary of ORG , in broadly the same terms as their provisional conclusions . They explained that they had not acceded to the applicants\u2019 ultimate procedural request because they were of the view that otherwise the completion of their report might be indefinitely delayed :", "\" It appeared to us that the appropriate course for us to take would be to consider the written submissions we had received and to express our views on them when we submitted our report to the Secretary of ORG . Our findings would not be dispositive of anything , we had given ORG , ORG , the PERSON and their advisers ample time to make their submissions , which they had chosen to make in this way at this extremely late stage and we considered that it was in the public interest that we should now complete our work and submit our report . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG concluded that the applicants had dishonestly misrepresented their origins , their wealth , their business interests and their resources to the Secretary of ORG , ORG , the press , ORG and ORG shareholders and their own advisers ; that during the course of their investigations , the ORG had received evidence from the applicants , under solemn affirmation and in written memoranda , which was false and which the applicants knew to be false ; in addition , that the applicants had produced a set of documents they knew to be false ; that this evidence related mainly , but not exclusively , to their background , their past business activities and the way in which they came to be in control of enormous funds in DATE and DATE ( see especially Inspectors\u2019 report , chapter CARDINAL ) . The ORG were satisfied that the main thrust of ORG \u2019s attack on the applicants was well founded on a sound basis of substantiated fact ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "However , the ORG did not reject the entirety of the ORG evidence and praised part of their work . Thus the report included , for example , findings that \" the departure of the ORG directors and their replacement by the PERSON brought harmony to a board where previously discord had existed \" ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) ; and that \" the Fayeds\u2019 considerable ability to identify assets with a potential for capital appreciation has undoubtedly been an important element in their business success \" ( Inspectors\u2019 report , paragraph CARDINAL ) . In the final chapter of the report the ORG made complimentary findings of fact and expressed favourable opinions about ORG . They regarded the management of ORG since its acquisition as , subject to certain reservations , \" law - abiding , proper and regular \" .", "CARDINAL .

In the context of these proceedings the Director of ORG and ORG submitted affidavits in DATE stating their opinion that publication of the report would prejudice the criminal investigation and run the risk of preventing a fair trial in the event of criminal proceedings subsequently being brought against the applicants . ORG \u2019s application was ultimately rejected by ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE The Observer newspaper published a CARDINAL - page special DATE edition devoted solely to extracts from and comments on a leaked copy of the Inspectors\u2019 report .

It was appropriate to acknowledge that the Secretary of ORG , the [ ORG ] , the ORG , certain journalists and sections of the press , ORG , the regulatory authorities , and the applicants\u2019 professional advisers had been misled by the applicants . ORG considered that its interests and reputation had been seriously and adversely affected by the preparedness of the Secretary of ORG to allow the ORG bid to go forward in DATE without a reference to the [ ORG ] . ORG would have had a legitimate grievance if the explanation for this was suppressed without compelling reasons . There was a need to dispel continuing speculation as to the events which had given rise to the investigation . Rumours and speculation were rife . Publication of the report would provide employees and creditors with information concerning the way in which ORG and ORG had been run and might be expected to be run in future . ( The ORG were largely prepared to accept the sincerity of the ORG assurances for the future . ) The brothers had been prepared before the ORG to attempt to discredit ORG , PERSON , The ORG , its editor and others . It was deemed to be in the public interest to publicise both the fact that these attempts had been made and the conclusion of the ORG that they were ill - founded . \"", "CARDINAL .
