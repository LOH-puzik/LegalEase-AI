The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE until the time of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of killing and/or causing grievous bodily injuries to several individuals . On the following day the Pushkinskiy ORG of GPE remanded him in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE LOC extended the authorised period of the applicant 's detention for up to a total duration of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE GPE authorised further extensions of the applicant 's pre - trial detention until DATE . No appeal was lodged against the extension orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pre - trial investigation was completed and the applicant was granted access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE granted the prosecutor 's application for a further extension of the applicant 's detention until DATE , that is , for a total duration of DATE . ORG referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant , the existence of a reasonable suspicion of his involvement in the commission of the alleged offences and certain \u201c objective circumstances \u201d , in particular , the fact that the defendants had not yet finished studying the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant lodged an appeal against the extension order . Counsel pointed out that ORG had failed to identify any concrete facts to justify the risks of absconding , reoffending or obstructing justice . She alleged a violation of LAW . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the appeal , finding that the gravity of the charges could be taken into account when deciding to extend the pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the prosecution applied for a further extension of the applicant 's detention . It was submitted that he stood accused of a serious criminal offence and had not yet finished reading the case file . The defence objected to the extension and emphasised that the applicant had a place of permanent residence , no criminal record and positive references .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the extension sought by the prosecution , referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the medical findings that he did not have any health issues which could have required his release . The extension was granted until DATE , by reference to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant appealed against the extension order . She submitted that neither the gravity of the charges nor the fact that the applicant had not finished studying the file were relevant or sufficient grounds for extending his pre - trial detention . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . Neither the applicant nor his counsel were present at the appeal hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a further extension of the applicant 's detention until DATE , finding in particular as follows :", "\u201c The gravity and public dangerousness of the crimes imputed to Mr PERSON are such that an undertaking to appear would not be sufficient to guarantee his appearance before the investigator or in court or to ensure his law - abiding conduct . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the statement of appeal , counsel for the applicant pointed out that on DATE ORG had already granted CARDINAL extension for the purpose of studying the file and that LAW and CARDINAL of LAW did not provide for a possibility to grant repeated extensions for that same purpose . In her submission , a second extension of the detention period , such as the one authorised by ORG on DATE , was contrary both to the letter of Article CARDINAL and to its interpretation given in ORG judgments no . CARDINAL-O of DATE and no . ORG of DATE ( cited below ) , and was therefore arbitrary and incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appear in person before the appeal court . On DATE ORG refused him leave on the ground that the applicant had not submitted a separate statement of appeal and his presence would not therefore be indispensable . In the same hearing , ORG rejected the appeal against the extension order in a summary fashion . On the issue of the alleged unlawfulness of repeated extensions , it found as follows :", "\u201c The argument to the effect that the judge was not authorised to grant a second extension of the detention period for studying the criminal case file on the same grounds may not be taken into account because it is not founded on law , which was given an incorrect interpretation [ sic ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE granted a further extension of the applicant 's detention until DATE , noting that the preventive measure was lawful and justified , taking into account the gravity of the charges and \u201c information on [ the applicant 's ] character \u201d . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appear and rejected the appeal lodged by his counsel . It expressed the view that LAW permitted repeated extensions of the detention period when it was necessary to allow the defendant to finish studying the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG examined further requests by the prosecution for extensions of the applicant 's detention and granted the extensions requested . It held that the applicant could not be released on an undertaking to appear because of the gravity and \u201c public importance \u201d of the crimes imputed to him . It also expressed the view that further extensions were lawful within the meaning of LAW of the ORG since the requests for extensions had been made within the DATE time - limit mentioned in that provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant and the applicant himself submitted statements of appeal against the extension order of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant also sought leave to appear before the appeal court . Counsel pointed out that on DATE ORG had already granted a fourth extension in excess of the maximum eighteenmonth detention period , which was incompatible with the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL of the CCrP. By decision of DATE , ORG refused the applicant leave to appear , noting that his presence was not necessary because all the arguments were explained in sufficient detail in his counsel 's submissions . In the same hearing , ORG rejected the appeals against the extension orders , holding that counsel had \u201c incorrectly interpreted \u201d the provisions of Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE extended the authorised period of the applicant 's detention until DATE for the purpose of allowing the prosecution sufficient time for complying with the legal requirement that a case be submitted for trial DATE before the expiry of the detention period . As to the grounds for continued detention , ORG noted that the grounds for preferring a custodial measure still obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case against the applicant and other codefendants was referred for trial . On DATE ORG held a preliminary hearing , in the absence of the applicant and his counsel , and indicated that the custodial measure \u201c should remain unchanged \u201d . It did not set a time - limit for the measure or list any grounds for continuing its application .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG issued a decision by which it extended the detention period in respect of the applicant and CARDINAL other co - defendants for DATE . It referred to the gravity of the charges against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeals submitted by the applicant 's counsel against the extension orders of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE and rejected them . Counsel and the applicant did not take part in the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the period of detention in respect of all defendants for DATE , noting the gravity of the charges and continuing examination of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE convicted the applicant and his co - defendants of various violent crimes committed for racial motives . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment but relieved from serving the sentence owing to the expiry of the prescription period . The applicant was released from custody on DATE . He did not file an appeal , but CARDINAL of his co - defendants did . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE , while the applicant was legally a minor , he was held in a special wing of remand prison no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of GPE , popularly known as \u201c GPE \u201d , and in remand prison no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of PERSON in LOC . The applicant raised no complaints in respect of that period of detention .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , when he reached legal majority , the applicant was held together with adult detainees in various cells of remand prison no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Government produced , among other documents , CARDINAL statements of DATE from the director of remand prison no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , according to which all the cells in which the applicant had been detained , had measured QUANTITY and accommodated CARDINAL detainees , including the applicant . They also submitted disparate sheets from a certain register concerning transfers of detainees , all of which referred to a period prior to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the cells measured QUANTITY and were equipped with CARDINAL - tier bunk beds . The actual number of inmates ranged from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , including the applicant himself . The mandatory ventilation did not function and the toilet was not separated from the living area . Inmates used bed sheets to create a makeshift screen around it but warders considered it to be a violation of prison regulations and tore them down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the conditions of detention to a supervising prosecutor . On DATE the St GPE prosecutor sent a reply to his complaint , in which he acknowledged , in particular , that the personal space afforded to inmates in cell no . CARDINAL was below the legal norm of QUANTITY . m per person . On DATE the prosecutor ordered the director of the remand prison to remedy a violation of the law and discipline those responsible .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE , DATE and DATE the GPE prosecutor issued further warnings to the director of the remand prison , requiring him to improve the material conditions of the inmates ' detention and bring them up to the applicable standards .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to a new cell of the same size which he shared with CARDINAL detainee until he was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the initial pre - trial detention of an accused must not exceed DATE . It may be subsequently extended DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further extensions to up to DATE are possible only in relation to persons accused of serious or particularly serious criminal offences , in view of the complexity of the case and if there are grounds justifying detention . An investigator 's request for extension must be approved by the regional prosecutor ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An extension of detention beyond DATE and DATE may be authorised only in exceptional circumstances in respect of persons accused of particularly serious offences , upon an investigator 's request approved by ORG or his deputy ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Extension of detention beyond DATE is prohibited and the detainee must be immediately released , unless the prosecution 's request for an extension for the purpose of studying the case has been granted by a court in accordance with LAW of the CCrP ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon completion of the investigation , the detainee must be given access to the case file DATE preceding the expiry of the maximum period of detention indicated in DATE and CARDINAL ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If access was granted on DATE , the detainee must be released after the expiry of the maximum period of detention ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If access was granted DATE before the expiry of the maximum period of detention but the DATE period proved to be insufficient to read the entire case file , the investigator may request the court to extend the period of detention . The request must be submitted DATE before the expiry of the detention period ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Within DATE of receipt of the request for an extension , the judge must decide whether to grant it or reject it and release the detainee . If the extension is granted , the period of detention is extended until such time as would be sufficient for the detainee and counsel to finish reading the case file and for the prosecution to submit the case to the trial court ( \u00a7 CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . Examining the compatibility of LAW ( now replaced by LAW CCrP ) with LAW , on DATE ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c ... affording the defendant a sufficient time for studying the file must not result in ... his detention for a period of an unlimited duration . In that case such detention would amount to a sanction for using by the defendant of his procedural rights and thereby induce him to waive these rights ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a further clarification of its position ( decision no . CARDINAL-O ) , finding as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... the studying of the file [ by the defendant and his counsel ] is a necessary condition for extending the term of detention [ beyond DATE ] but it may not be , taken on its own , a sufficient ground for granting such an extension ... For that reason , in each particular case the prosecutor 's application for extending the period of detention beyond DATE ( LAW , CARDINAL of the RSFSR CCrP ) must refer not to the fact that the defendant and his counsel continue to study the file ... but rather to factual information demonstrating that this preventive measure can not be revoked and the legal grounds for its continued application remain ...", "CARDINAL . ... LAW RSFSR CCrP expressly provides that , on an application by a prosecutor , the judge may extend the defendant 's detention until such time as the defendant and his counsel have finished studying the file and the prosecutor has submitted it to the [ trial ] court , but by no longer than DATE . Accordingly , the law does not provide for lodging of repeated applications for extension of the defendant 's detention , even after an additional investigation [ has been carried out ] ... In the absence of an express legal provision for repeated extensions of detention on that ground , any other interpretation of [ LAW ] would breach the prohibition on arbitrary detention within the meaning of ORG decision of DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG confirmed its position , by reference to above - cited decision no . CARDINAL-O , that in the absence of an express provision to that effect , time - limits during the pre - trial investigation may not be repeatedly extended , particularly on the same grounds , in excess of the maximum time - limit set out in the CCrP.", "CARDINAL . In decision no . CARDINAL - O of DATE , ORG expressed the view that LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG was compatible with the LAW . Even though this provision did not define the maximum period within which an extension could be granted for the purpose of studying the case file , it did not imply the possibility of excessive or unlimited detention because , in granting an extension , the court should not rely solely on a well - founded suspicion that the defendant committed the offence but mainly base its decision on specific circumstances justifying the continued detention , such as his potential to exert pressure on witnesses or an established risk of his absconding or reoffending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
