THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Pieter Van Dijk", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of various drugs - related offences . He was subsequently charged \u2013 as co - actor ( medepleger ) in a group of CARDINAL persons DATE with trafficking \u201c hard \u201d drugs , preparation of the offence of drug trafficking , handling , and participation in a criminal organisation . In addition , he was separately charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial was due to start before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) on DATE . By that time , the applicant had become aware that a number of co - accused had already been tried and convicted by the same tribunal . In the proceedings against his co - accused CCARDINAL , CCARDINAL , CCARDINAL and CCARDINAL ORG had included the same president , X , and senior judge ( oudste rechter ) , Y , who were to sit on the bench that would deal with his case . Prior to the hearing , counsel for the applicant wrote a letter to the president of the trial chamber requesting him and the senior judge to stand down because of their involvement in the trials of those co - accused . X and Y did not stand down , and on DATE of the hearing a formal challenge application ( wrakingsverzoek ) was lodged on behalf of the applicant . ORG ( wrakingskamer ) dismissed the application , considering that the mere fact that CARDINAL members of the trial chamber had convicted a number of co - accused of offences relating to the offences with which the applicant had been charged did not as such entail that those members were biased in the criminal proceedings against the applicant . According to ORG , the arguments adduced by counsel for the applicant did not admit of the conclusion that the judges concerned had already formed an opinion on any role which the applicant might have played in the commission of those offences , and neither did they reveal any extraordinary circumstances indicating bias against the applicant on the part of those judges or indicating that the applicant \u2019s fear of bias was objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of the charges against him , except for the charge of handling of which he was acquitted . Taking into account that the applicant had not played a prominent role but rather a facilitating CARDINAL within the organisation , ORG sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) . In the course of these proceedings , the complete judgments rendered by ORG in the cases against the co - accused CCARDINAL and CCARDINAL became available , only abridged versions not containing the evidence relied on by ORG having been available at the time of the applicant \u2019s trial by ORG . The applicant referred to these complete judgments in support of his argument that ORG had lacked impartiality due to the fact that X and Y had participated in the trials against co - accused . ORG judgment concerning co - accused CCARDINAL included the following considerations :", "\u201c D was the linchpin ( spil ) of the organisation in the GPE , whose aim it was to import and export \u2018 hard\u2019 drugs . C , [ the applicant ] and W were D \u2019s confidants in this context , with the latter making use of the facilities and/or services with which these three could provide him ...", "As far as the export of amphetamine is concerned , D was also the organiser of this , and CCARDINAL the financier . CCARDINAL supplied the drugs , while K , [ the applicant ] and H carried out the actual work . \u201d", "The judgment concerning co - accused CCARDINAL included the following :", "\u201c The duo D - CCARDINAL constituted the linchpin of the organisation . ... C and [ the applicant ] were confidants of D , with the latter making use of the facilities and/or services with which these two could provide him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the course of a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s plea for the case to be remitted to ORG . Examining whether the applicant \u2019s fear of a lack of impartiality of judges X and Y could be objectively justified , it held :", "\u201c Contrary to what has been adduced by counsel , no such objective justification can be found in the earlier considerations of ORG . Those earlier considerations do not , after all , entail that the examination in the present case of the reproach made of [ the applicant ] in respect of participation in the same criminal organisation and of involvement in the import and export of \u2018 hard\u2019 drugs , in particular amphetamine , was anticipated . It is the normal statutory task of the judge ... only to rule on the basis of the indictment and further to the trial of the accused , excluding from his consideration his decisions reached in other cases of other accused .", "Special circumstances constituting a compelling indication to find that a fear held by [ the applicant ] may be objectively justified are not contained in counsel \u2019s arguments or in the circumstances that have otherwise become apparent . The finding relating to [ the applicant ] as expressed in the earlier judgments is not so specific and/or has not been reasoned in such a way as to lead to a different conclusion . ...", "It is also relevant that there is no indication that ORG has in any way felt itself bound by the findings of the previous judgments when dealing with and deciding on the case of [ the applicant ] . In particular it has not been argued , and ORG fails to see , that ORG has based its judgment in any way on any decision taken in those earlier judgments . On the contrary , it appears from the case file that ORG examined [ the applicant \u2019s ] case in its entirety , without even one of the questions which ORG had to answer being considered as having been dealt with in the earlier judgments . This is in particular also the case in respect of the questions whether [ the applicant ] participated in the criminal organisation referred to in the indictment and whether he was involved in the import and export of \u2018 hard\u2019 drugs and in particular of amphetamine . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on the merits of the case on DATE . Asked to state the reasons why he had lodged his appeal , the applicant replied that he had not been wrongly convicted but considered the sentence excessive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . It quashed the judgment of ORG and , deciding anew , convicted the applicant of being a co - actor in the offences of drug trafficking and participation in a criminal organisation . The conviction was based on the applicant \u2019s confessions before the police and in open court and on other evidence , namely transcripts of recorded telephone conversations , official reports of police observation and of the interception in transit of quantities of illegal narcotics , and statements of co - accused . The applicant was again sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , a differently composed bench of the same ORG , in the criminal proceedings against the applicant \u2019s co - accused CCARDINAL , accepted that CCARDINAL had an objectively justified fear of bias on the part of the first - instance court and remitted his case for retrial . That first - instance court \u2013 ORG \u2013 had held in its judgments relating to CARDINAL co - accused that CCARDINAL \u201c [ had ] maintained the contacts abroad and also provided the necessary finances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassation ) with the PERSON , the highest court of criminal jurisdiction . He submitted that the decision of ORG to dismiss his arguments relating to the lack of impartiality of ORG and the refusal to remit his case to ORG was contrary to LAW . He further contended that he had been deprived of the opportunity to have his case considered by an impartial tribunal at first instance , which made the trial as a whole unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON upheld the appeal on points of law because the length of proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time . It therefore quashed the judgment of ORG , but only in respect of the sentence , which was reduced by DATE and DATE . The PERSON rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments relating to the alleged bias on the part of judges X and Y.", "CARDINAL . An appeal can only be lodged against the first - instance judgment in its entirety , although cases joined at first instance can be disjoined at the appeal stage ( LAW ) . The appeal proceedings involve a complete rehearing of the case . Both the prosecution and the defence may ask for witnesses already heard at first instance to be heard again ; they may also produce new evidence and request the hearing of witnesses not heard at first instance ( LAW . The defence enjoys the same rights as it does at first instance ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Both the prosecution and the defence may challenge ( wraken ) judges on the ground of facts or circumstances that might be detrimental to judicial impartiality ( LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
