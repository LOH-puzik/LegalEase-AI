ORG The applicant , Mr. PERSON , was born in DATE . He is a NORP citizen resident in GPE and a car driver by profession . He owned , together with his brother Mr. PERSON , the properties PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL and TIME .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ( kommunfullm\u00e4ktige ) adopted an area plan ( omr\u00e5desplan ) with a view to the development of a housing estate in an area including the applicant \u2019s properties . On DATE , ORG decided to apply to the Government for an expropriation permit for this area .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant objected to the expropriation in respect of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL properties concerned , because , as he submitted to the Government , he doubted that they were needed for the development contemplated and , further , he wanted to live with his mother in his GPE home situated on CARDINAL of the properties . He claimed that , when working out and adopting the area plan , ORG had not taken his interests sufficiently into account , something that would have been possible within the framework of a somewhat modified plan . However , the Government , taking the view that ORG had shown the need to include the applicant \u2019s properties , concluded that the conditions laid down in LAW DATE ( expropriationslagen CARDINAL - \" the DATE LAW ) were satisfied . On DATE , they issued an expropriation permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG The decision indicated that the issue of the permit had to be followed by the institution of proceedings by the GPE before a real estate court not DATE . An action , the object of which was to settle the terms of the expropriation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was commenced on DATE before ORG at the Falun ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , his brother and the Municipality were involved in negotiations for a settlement until DATE . On DATE , before the main hearings started , they finally concluded an agreement : the applicant and his brother were to sell the properties to the Municipality , which was to lease back to the applicant for DATE , with a possibility of prolongation , a house situated thereon . On DATE , ORG struck the case off its list since , as a result of the settlement , the Municipality had withdrawn its claim for expropriation .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , after the present case had been brought before ORG , GPE concluded an agreement with the applicant for the repurchase by him of the properties for CARDINAL NORP crowns , the same amount as it had paid for them in DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( byggnadslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL - \" LAW \" ) is the main legal instrument governing planning in respect of the use of land for construction and urban development . It provides for the drawing up of a master plan ( generalplan ) , which establishes within a municipality the framework for other and more detailed plans , namely city plans ( stadsplaner ) and building plans ( byggnadsplaner ) .", "As in the present case , a municipal council may draw up an area plan , instead of a master plan . The manner in which area plans are elaborated and their content are not expressly governed by LAW but general principles of administrative law are , of course , applicable .", "CARDINAL . ORG The issue of expropriation permits is governed by LAW . Under LAW , LAW , such a permit is normally granted by the Government .", "For cases like the present , the grounds justifying the issue of a permit are stated in LAW , section CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW as amended by LAW ) , which reads as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Expropriation is allowed in order to enable a municipality to acquire rights over land which is needed , as a result of future societal requirements , for urban development ( t\u00e4tbebyggelse ) or constructions in connection with such development . ... Within areas of urban development expropriation is allowed only if there is reason to assume that , within a foreseeable time , the area will be subject to building or other construction activities which are deemed important in the general interest , or if there is an urgent necessity for the municipality to acquire rights over the land for the furthering of planned building or for any other similar reason . ... \"", "However , a permit must not be granted if the purpose of the expropriation can be attained by other appropriate means , or if the disadvantages of the expropriation would outweigh , from general and individual points of view , its advantages ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW , the sole effect in law of the issue of an expropriation permit is to confer on its holder an entitlement to acquire the designated property . Consequently , the issue of a permit leaves legally intact the owner \u2019s right to use , sell , let or mortgage his property ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and does not automatically lead to expropriation .", "Before the expropriation can be finalised , its terms - such as the compensation to be paid to the owner and the boundaries of the expropriated area - have to be settled in proceedings before a real estate court . Moreover , the expropriation is not completed until the compensation - in principle equivalent to the market value - has been paid .", "CARDINAL . ORG The proceedings before the real estate court have to be instituted by the holder of the permit within the time - limit which it specifies , failing which the permit will lapse ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW ) .", "The DATE Act is silent as to the length of this time - limit and as to the criteria upon which it is to be fixed . However , LAW , section CARDINAL , provides that it may be extended in special circumstances , or reduced if the owner so requests and establishes that the inconvenience for him in the expropriation remaining pending has increased significantly . No decision to reduce the time - limit can be taken until DATE has elapsed since the issue of the expropriation permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG Some reasons for restricting the time - limit and , hence , the duration of the validity of expropriation permits were stated in LAW , page CARDINAL , which led to the CARDINAL Act ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Naturally , the mere issue of an expropriation permit often places [ the owner ] in a state of uncertainty . In practice , his opportunities for disposing of his property by selling it , assigning the use thereof or having premises erected thereon are considerably restricted . He may also have difficulty in deciding whether to incur expenditure on upkeep or modernisation . The disadvantages resulting from an expropriation permit are evidently increased if the judicial proceedings are not set in motion for a long time . \"", "CARDINAL . Generally speaking , the NORP administration is not subject to supervision by the ordinary courts . Those courts entertain proceedings against the ORG only in contractual matters , on questions of extra - contractual liability and , under some statutes , in respect of administrative decisions .", "Judicial review of the administration \u2019s acts is therefore primarily a matter for administrative courts . These courts comprise CARDINAL levels : the county administrative courts ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tterna ) ; the administrative courts of appeal ( kammarr\u00e4tterna ) ; and ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) . They are composed of independent judges and enjoy , as a rule , wide powers which enable them not only to set aside administrative acts but also to vary or substitute them . There is , however , an important exception to this principle , in that no appeal may be made against decisions of the Government ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , section , CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( kommunallagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) provides for and regulates , in a general way , the right to appeal ( kommunalbesv\u00e4r ) against decisions by municipalities . This Act enables residents of the municipality to challenge , for instance , a municipal council \u2019s decision to adopt an area plan or apply for an expropriation permit .", "At the relevant time , this remedy was exercisable before ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) , but only on the following grounds : failure to observe the statutory procedures , infringement of the law , ultra vires conduct , violation of the complainant \u2019s own rights , or other unfairness . The appeal had to be filed within DATE from the date on which approval of the TIME of the decision had been announced on the municipal notice - board . ORG decision could , within DATE from its notification to the complainant , be the subject of an appeal to ORG .", "These provisions were slightly amended in DATE , with effect from DATE , in that the first appeal now has to be made to ORG and not to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG NORP law contains no provision for appeals to the ordinary or the administrative courts against the Government \u2019s decisions to issue expropriation permits . Accordingly , such decisions are in principle not subject to court review .", "However , there is a limited possibility to file a petition before ORG for re - opening of the proceedings ( resningsans\u00f6kan ) . Further particulars of this remedy appear in the GPE and PERSON judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW does not in principle provide for compensation for prejudice resulting from the length of the validity of , or failure to utilise , an expropriation permit . It does , however , contain CARDINAL exception ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) : compensation is payable for prejudice occasioned by the issue of an expropriation permit if the authority or person to whom it was granted has instituted , but subsequently abandoned , proceedings before a real estate court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW DATE ( skadest\u00e5ndslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , acts of public authorities may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault or negligence .
