The applicants , ORG , GPE and ORG , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . The first applicant is the mother of the second and third applicants . They were represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , a reserve colonel ( colonel \u00een rezerv\u0103 ) , was the first applicant \u2019s husband and the second and third applicants\u2019 father . On CARDINAL DATE he died in hospital , aged DATE , following an operation and a twoweek convalescence period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE developed symptoms of icterus ( a yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes , indicating excess a bile pigment in the blood ) and , together with the applicants , went to the military clinic for a consultation . He underwent some tests and was immediately admitted to ORG ( \u201c the hospital \u201d ) for further investigations and treatment . His diagnosis was \u201c cholestatic jaundice due to cholestatic calculus DATE left renal lithiasis clinically significant for DATE \u201d ( icter colestatic prin calcul colestatic DATE trei zile litiaz\u0103 renal\u0103 st\u00e2nga ) . Neither the patient nor his family was informed of the diagnosis .", "An ultrasound scan performed TIME in the hospital revealed a pancreatic tumour and the patient was prescribed treatment by the doctor on duty , PERSON After DATE of treatment , the jaundice disappeared . The treatment continued for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Dr GPE ordered further examinations of the patient \u2019s abdomen , pancreas and bile ducts . GPE thus underwent a computerized tomography scan ( a form of X - ray examination in which the X - ray source and detector rotate around the object to be scanned and the information obtained can be used to produce cross - sectional images by computer ) on DATE and an ultrasound endoscopy on DATE . An MRI test ( magnetic resonance imaging , a non - invasive method of examination of body organs by recording the responses to radio waves , or other forms of energy , of different kinds of molecules in a magnetic field ) was recommended but never carried out . Throughout this time , the applicants were at the hospital with the patient , but they were allegedly not given any information by the medical team .", "Dr GPE conferred with his colleague PERSON and decided , on the basis of the test results , that the patient probably had a pancreatic tumour of a kind requiring surgery .", "According to the applicants , neither the patient nor his family was properly informed of the diagnosis , the nature of the intervention , its risks , or its actual duration . The medical team told them that they were going to perform a \u201c routine \u201d operation lasting TIME , and which had a PERCENT chance of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr GPE , assisted by ORG , GPE , and GPE , and by the specialist anaesthetist PERSON , performed the surgery and removed the tumour along with parts of the patient \u2019s pancreas , stomach and duodenum . The intervention lasted for TIME .", "CARDINAL . The tests run after the surgery showed that the tumour had been benign .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed in the intensive care unit under the supervision of PERSON He remained there until his death .", "The family was not officially allowed access to the intensive care unit until DATE before the patient \u2019s death . For DATE after the operation , the patient \u2019s general state was stable . However , his general health started to deteriorate and he developed a high fever . He was prescribed broad spectrum antibiotics , which were provided by his family , pending the results of further blood tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE blood tests were ordered and the results revealed the presence of CARDINAL types of bacteria : klebsiella and meticillin - resistant staphylococcus .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , his health continued to deteriorate and he finally slipped into a coma . He was in this state when , on DATE , PERSON operated on him again to remove an abscess and some blood clots which had formed after the first operation .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants spoke with the anaesthetist on duty , who \u2013 in GPE absence \u2013 acquainted them with the patient \u2019s real diagnosis and informed them of the type of surgery he had undergone on DATE and of the suspicion of a bacterial infection .", "On TIME the patient died of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunctions ; he was taken to the hospital mortuary .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant signed a discharge form provided by the hospital , which read :", "\u201c ... [ we ] request that no autopsy be performed as the cause of death is known and we have no complaints concerning the treatment and care provided by the medical and paramedical personnel . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants collected the deceased \u2019s personal belongings and found that the medicine they had brought to the hospital had not been administered to the patient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while her father \u2019s body was still in the hospital mortuary , the second applicant brought the case to the attention of ORG . She sent her complaint to both the GPE branch and ORG , by e - mail and by normal post . She informed both associations that her father had contracted a bacterial infection while in the intensive care unit of the hospital and asked that an autopsy be performed before the burial , which was scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The disciplinary committee of ORG gave no reply to the request for an autopsy but opened an investigation into the patient \u2019s death , hearing evidence from the applicants and the doctors . It gave its decision on DATE , ruling that no medical errors had been made , but reprimanding PERSON for his failure to seek the patient \u2019s consent before the surgery , as required by PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicants objected to the committee \u2019s conclusions and their appeal was heard by the superior disciplinary committee of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Drs GPE and GPE from the medical team that had performed the surgery on DATE submitted written statements to the effect that together they had sought the patient \u2019s written consent before the intervention and that the consent form had been attached to the file . The statements were typewritten and identical . The head of the surgery department at the hospital submitted a written statement clarifying that no patients had been operated on in that period without a consent form being attached to their file . PERSON , a specialist doctor from a different hospital , was asked to comment on the treatment choices made by PERSON He gave his opinion on DATE , stating that , in general , icterus was a condition that required surgical intervention under any circumstances , and that DATE according to the guidelines \u2013 the surgery performed in Mr GPE \u2019s case had presented a certain risk , but one that had not been increased by the patient \u2019s age ; he also considered that the postoperative complication and ensuing death had fallen within the generally accepted risks for such an operation .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence presented , on DATE ORG terminated the disciplinary proceedings against PERSON Relying on the CARDINAL written statements given by the CARDINAL doctors , the authority considered it established that the patient \u2019s consent had been obtained but that the consent form had been lost .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged an action for the decision adopted on DATE to be quashed , pointing out that GPE and GPE ( the anaesthetist ) had disregarded the patient \u2019s rights and well - being in that they had failed to perform all the requisite tests before the operation , in particular an MRI scan , and had failed to inform either the patient or his family of the real diagnosis and the risks of the surgery and to obtain the patient \u2019s consent before the intervention ; she also contended that the postintervention care had been deficient . She reiterated that the patient had contracted a bacterial infection in hospital , which in her opinion had contributed to his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment in the case . It noted that a criminal investigation had taken place , that the medical experts consulted by the prosecutor had expressed the opinion that the patient \u2019s death had not been caused by medical error , and that on the basis of that opinion the case had been closed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It therefore dismissed the applicants\u2019 action and upheld the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against the decision delivered by ORG , but in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the findings of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the doctors who had treated her father , naming in particular the CARDINAL surgeons GPE and GPE and the anaesthetist , PERSON They addressed their complaint to the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and ORG and the GPE military prosecutor \u2019s office . As the doctors were career officers , the military prosecutor took over the case and opened an investigation into involuntary manslaughter .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON gave a statement before the military prosecutor . He maintained that the patient \u2019s death had not been directly caused by the surgery and that it had been impossible to establish the cause of death beyond doubt as the family had refused an autopsy . PERSON declared that the patient had received adequate treatment and his death had not been caused by medical negligence .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor sought the advice of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , asking it to explain the nature and cause of death , whether the treatment had been appropriate to the diagnosis , whether there had been errors of medical practice and conduct ( erori de tehnic\u0103 \u015fi conduit\u0103 medical\u0103 ) and , if so , how such errors had contributed to the patient \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an expert medical report regarding the case . It took into account the patient \u2019s medical log during his stay in the hospital and the opinion expressed in general terms about Mr GPE \u2019s condition by PERSON , a specialist surgeon at a different hospital from the one where the patient had been treated . It concluded that the cause of death had been multiple organ failure and sepsis occurring during the evolution of a post - surgical abscess . It considered that the treatment had been appropriately determined and administered and that there had been no medical errors at any stage ( diagnosis , medical treatment , surgery and post - surgical care ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the conclusions of the expert medical report , on CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor decided not to prosecute PERSON and GPE", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicant objected to the outcome of the prosecutor \u2019s investigation . They pointed out , in particular , that the expert medical report had failed to examine the question of the bacterial infection contracted in the hospital and that the prosecutor had not taken account of the absence of consent for the surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Prosecutor of ORG dismissed the above - mentioned complaints , finding , in particular , that the expert medical report had not confirmed the ORG allegations .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG ; as they became more familiar with the expert medical report , they raised several objections to it and asked that the case be remitted to the prosecutor for further investigation . On DATE the court dismissed their complaint as illfounded , on the basis of the medical report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against that decision . She contested the accuracy of the expert medical report , stating that PERSON was not an accredited medical expert , and that the conclusions of the report were flawed . She requested that a new expert examination be carried out . She also complained that at the hospital the applicants had been informed of a diagnosis that was different from that appearing on the official documents presented by the hospital as evidence , and that it had only been on the basis of the erroneous diagnosis that her brother had signed the discharge form concerning the autopsy . In any case , she considered that her father \u2019s death had been suspicious , as it had followed what appeared to be a good recovery ; moreover , since the presence of hospital bacteria had been identified , an autopsy should anyway have been performed with or without the family \u2019s endorsement . She also pointed out in this connection that as soon as they had become aware of the misrepresentation by the hospital , the applicants had appealed to ORG to demand an autopsy in the case .", "The second applicant emphasised the absence of informed consent from either the patient or his family before the operation and pointed out that that failure on the part of the hospital had prevented them from making informed decisions , for instance seeking a second opinion from a specialist doctor .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court referred to the conclusions reached by ORG , which , in its opinion , had given an exhaustive account of the facts and was better placed than the courts to give a specialist opinion .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the second applicant forwarded to ORG a copy of the complaint she had sent to ORG on DATE . ORG was responsible for the administration of the hospital . Later on she expanded the complaint , claiming that the hospital had also failed to provide the patient with clerical assistance when he was dying .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG replied to the second applicant \u2019s complaint . It informed her that the medical treatment given to her father had been adequate and that the surgery performed had fallen within the generally accepted range as regards the risk of complications and fatality , given the patient \u2019s age ( CARDINAL ) and medical history . It also stated that the procedures for sterilisation of instruments in the hospital were in accordance with the existing guidelines and beyond reproach .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) expressly states that there is an obligation to inform a patient about any surgical intervention proposed , the risks involved in the surgery , alternative treatment , and the diagnosis and prognosis ( Article CARDINAL ) . The PERSON also regulates the patient \u2019s right to seek a second medical opinion ( LAW ) .", "According to LAW , a breach of a patient \u2019s rights may result in disciplinary or criminal action , depending on the applicable law .", "CARDINAL . The judgment delivered in PERSON v. GPE ( no . GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) describes in detail the relevant domestic law and practice concerning the delivery of expert forensic reports and the authorities competent to issue them , as well as the relevant domestic law and practice concerning the civil liability of medical staff .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the hospital has to ensure adequate standards of accommodation , hygiene and food as well as the prevention of hospital - acquired infections , in accordance with the regulations issued by ORG . The hospital is liable for any damage sustained by patients as a result of the quality of the medical treatment or because of the standards of accommodation , hygiene , food and the prevention of hospitalacquired infections if such damage is established by the competent authorities . Under the same provision , where the damage is caused through medical fault , the liability lies with the person who committed the tort ( r\u0103spunderea este individual\u0103 ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
