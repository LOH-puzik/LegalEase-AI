{"ITEMID": "001-5383", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "IRL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "BARRY v. IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON O\u2019Sullivan , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The applicant is a medical doctor . In DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) was informed of a number of complaints against the applicant by QUANTITY female patients . In DATE the police informed the ORG that they were investigating allegations of indecent assault by the applicant . On DATE the ORG received written complaints from the CARDINAL patients to which the information of DATE referred . The complaints included allegations of sexual assault and blackmail .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Committee \u201d ) of the ORG decided that there was a prima facie case for the holding of an inquiry . On DATE ORG made an order restraining the applicant from practising medicine pending the outcome of the proposed inquiry . That order was not published . However , a further order of ORG dated DATE , removed the applicant \u2019s name from the register of practitioner \u2019s and restrained him from practising medicine pending the inquiry and all consequent proceedings . ORG also agreed that the ORG could make public the \u201c sequence of events \u201d including the orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . ORG issued a press release on DATE which included the applicant \u2019s name , the terms of those CARDINAL ORG orders and details as to how an individual can complain to the ORG about a medical practitioner . Further complaints were then received from former female patients of the applicant . The applicant also claims that the chairperson of the ORG also made public statements about the case and that newspaper articles appeared which could only have emanated from the ORG .", "On DATE the oral hearing before the ORG commenced . The applicant applied to have the inquiry held in public , stating that he wished to redress the damage done to his reputation by the publicity to which the case had already been subject . In exercising its discretion on the subject , the inquiry considered , inter alia , the necessity to ensure that members of the public could freely and without repercussions make complaints regarding their medical practitioners ; the necessity to protect the confidentiality of the doctor / patient relationship ; the nature of the allegations made ; the likely affect on the administration of justice of a hearing in public ; the powers of the ORG to protect the private lives of individuals even if the inquiry was held in public ; the protection against bias offered by a public hearing and the guarantees offered to the practitioner by the appeal to ORG . ORG found that the principles of natural justice and fair procedures required the inquiry to be held in private .", "The applicant sought leave to apply to ORG by way of an application for judicial review for an order of certiorari quashing the above decision of ORG . ORG refused leave . On DATE ORG gave leave to so apply to ORG on CARDINAL grounds . In the first place , to inquire whether the ORG was entitled to rule that the whole of the inquiry be held in private , the applicant arguing that this was contrary to ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , to the LAW and to LAW . Secondly , to enquire as to whether the proceedings were prosecuted , and the decision ( that the inquiry was to be held in private ) was made , in circumstances which were inconsistent with the objective separation of the functions of prosecutor and adjudicating tribunal . Included in this latter ground , were the propositions that the proceedings before the ORG were unfair and that the ORG \u2019s impartiality had been compromised .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application and awarded costs against the applicant . ORG noted in its judgment that , when it considers decisions of the ORG brought before it , it was not exercising an appellate jurisdiction as ORG will \u201c hear all the evidence as if it was a court sitting at first instance \u201d . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal by judgment dated DATE and costs were awarded against the applicant . In its judgment , that court noted that only ORG can decide to remove a practitioner \u2019s name from the register and that the applicant would be \u201c entitled to a full rehearing and possibly to a rehearing in public \u201d if and when the ORG \u2019s decision was brought before ORG , ORG adding that when the procedure has been exhausted in the ORG , in the ORG and in ORG , a final appeal would lie to ORG , but it was not the function of ORG to monitor the proceedings as they unfolded . Costs were awarded against the applicant .", "The proceedings against the applicant under LAW have not yet terminated and have been adjourned pending the determination of criminal proceedings against him .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "The Medical Practitioners Act DATE established the ORG and provided for the establishment of the ORG . It is the ORG which decides whether it is necessary to hold an inquiry into the conduct of a registered medical practitioner . If the ORG is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so , it may apply to ORG for an order that the registration of any practitioner shall not have effect pending that inquiry . On completion of the inquiry , ORG reports to ORG . Where it is found that the practitioner has committed acts of professional misconduct or is unfit to engage in the practise of medicine by reason of an alleged physical or mental disability , the ORG may decide that that person \u2019s name be erased from the register , that his or her registration be suspended for a certain period of time or that certain conditions be attached to the retention in the register of that person .", "In any of the above cases , the practitioner in question can apply to ORG to cancel the decision of the ORG and that court may either cancel the ORG \u2019s decision , direct the erasure or suspension of the practitioner \u2019s registration or attach such conditions to retention of the practitioner \u2019s name on the register as it thinks fit . In the absence of such an application by the practitioner , the ORG may apply to ORG for confirmation of its decision . In such circumstances , and unless it sees good reasons to the contrary , the High Court shall confirm the decision of ORG . A High Court hearing on such an application by a practitioner is conducted as an entire trial of the issues involved and is not a mere appeal from the combined decisions of ORG . The hearing , save in exceptional circumstances , is in public and the onus of proof lies on the ORG .", "Accordingly , the ORG \u2019s findings have no legal effect on the practitioner \u2019s right to practice and the ORG \u2019s decision has no legal effect until confirmed by ORG , which court may cancel the decision of the ORG or vary it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
