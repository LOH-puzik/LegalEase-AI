He remained silent and instead referred to a protective letter ( PERSON ) he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest , in which he claimed that the use of the chemicals was purely for scientific purposes .

If , as in the case at hand , the purpose of the substance could not be derived from objective criteria , consumer expectation or scientific assessment , the point of reference had to be the purpose pursued by the manufacturer , which in this case was the applicant \u2019s intention to develop substances with the same or similar effects as narcotic substances without falling within the scope of LAW as described in his protective letter .

ORG expressly acknowledged a violation of LAW ( inviolability of the home ) by the execution of the search warrant DATE after its issue . However , the court argued that the judgment had not been based on this violation because in the case at hand the violation of LAW did not entail the exclusion of the evidence obtained . The exclusion of evidence could only be considered if the procedural defects were severe , intentional or arbitrary . In the case at hand there was no intentional violation since it was DATE after the search that ORG had established a \u201c date of expiry \u201d for search warrants . ORG further argued that the overall length of the proceedings , while too long , was no reason for a discontinuation of the proceedings as submitted by the applicant .
