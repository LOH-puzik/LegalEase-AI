{"ITEMID": "001-71236", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "WYPYCH v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms Beata NORP , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was elected to ORG during the municipal elections of DATE and has served as a councillor since DATE . His term of office lasts DATE .", "On DATE amendments to the DATE ORG ( County ) Act , enacted in DATE , came into force . These amendments impose an obligation on local councillors to disclose information to the public concerning their financial situation and property portfolio . This is to be done through a declaration which is submitted to the president of the local council . These declarations are subsequently published in ORG , available to the general public via the Internet .", "In DATE the applicant asked the ORG to lodge a request with ORG to examine whether the provisions of LAW , as amended in DATE , were compatible with the LAW insofar as they imposed an obligation on local councillors to make detailed information available to the general public about their property and income . The applicant argued that the provisions of LAW had not previously provided for such a disclosure . He was of the opinion that this obligation was in breach with the DATE ORG . He argued that making such information publicly available would facilitate political harassment and could expose him and his family to the threat of theft or burglary . He could refuse to submit a declaration , but he would then be deprived of the DATE emoluments payable for his work as councillor . He drew the ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that , even in such a scenario , he would not be deprived of his office . In his view , this cast doubt on the effectiveness of the obligation to submit the impugned declaration . Insofar as declarations were designed to curb corruption , it was illogical that a failure to submit such a declaration would not result in removal from office .", "In his replies of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the ORG indicated that he was in receipt of voluminous correspondence drawing attention to various aspects of the transparency obligations imposed by the DATE amendments to LAW . His correspondents argued that the scope of the obligation to make publicly available details pertaining to the financial situation of various local politicians and officials was too extensive and breached the right to respect for private and family life . In the light of the public reaction to those amendments , the ORG was considering whether to ask ORG to examine their compatibility with LAW .", "Eventually , however , after analysing various provisions of the LAW , the ORG complained to ORG only about those amendments to LAW which imposed a wide - ranging obligation on certain local politicians to submit declarations about various aspects of the business activities of their close and extended families , in particular insofar as these activities concerned companies owned or co - owned by local municipalities .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG found certain of those provisions constitutional and declared others incompatible with LAW . However , it did not examine the obligation complained of in the present case , but only dealt with those obligations under LAW which related to the business activities of local LOC families .", "The applicant does not wish to disclose details about his income and property as required by LAW as amended . He has not submitted a declaration as required . Consequently , he has received no emoluments for his work as a councillor since DATE , these emoluments amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) per month .", "LAW reads :", "Every citizen shall have the right to obtain information on the activities of public bodies and of persons discharging public functions . This right shall also include the receipt of information on the activities of self - governing economic or professional bodies and other persons or organisational units in connection with fields in which they perform public duties and manage communal assets or property belonging to ORG .", "The right to obtain information shall guarantee access to documents and entry to the sittings of collective public bodies which have been formed by universal suffrage and shall include the opportunity to make sound and visual recordings .", "Limitations on the rights referred to in DATE and CARDINAL above may be imposed by statute solely in order to protect the freedoms and rights of other persons and economic subjects , public order , security or important economic interests of the ORG .", "The procedure for the provision of information referred to in DATE and CARDINAL above shall be specified by statute and , as regards the PERSON and the ORG , by their rules of procedure .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "Everyone shall have the right to legal protection of his private and family life and of his honour and good reputation and the right to make decisions about his personal life .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with principles to be specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or other normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision concerning his freedoms or rights or on his obligations as set out in the LAW . \u201d", "By a judgment of DATE ORG examined a request to examine the compatibility with LAW ( which was later replaced by the legislation complained of in the present case ) .", "In this request the complainants argued that the provisions of LAW insofar as they prevented members of executive boards of local councils and various other officials of local administration from conducting business activities on their own account were incompatible with the LAW . This was because , the complainants averred , they imposed undue restrictions on business freedom guaranteed by its LAW . It was also argued that these restrictions were in breach of the principle of equality guaranteed by its LAW .", "ORG recalled the history of legislation intended to limit the scope of business freedom of persons engaged in various bodies of local government since the first such law was adopted in DATE . It reiterated that these laws were to curb possible corruption by making it impossible for certain categories of public officials to combine their public functions with business activity .", "The ORG further considered that the provisions complained of could not be said to breach the principle of equality as guaranteed by LAW . This principle meant that all persons having the same legally relevant characteristics were to be treated equally , without differences to their advantage or disadvantage . However , this principle accepted that different classes or groups of persons be treated differently ( GPE ) .", "In this connection , it reiterated that the case - law of the ORG regarding restrictions of business activity of persons holding public functions was already established in that it had repeatedly held that such persons had to expect that such restrictions would be imposed on them . It recalled that these restrictions were meant to prevent public officials from engaging in situations and dilemmas of such a nature as to be capable of not only casting doubt on their personal honesty and integrity , but also of undermining authority of the ORG \u2019s bodies and of weakening the trust of the electorate and public opinion in their functioning ( W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG referred to its judgment given in DATE in which it had stated that the legislature was empowered to impose various restrictions on local councillors in respect of their professional activities , provided that such limitations would be reasonably linked to public interest they were intended to serve and that the scope of such limitations remained proportionate to the importance of such public interest ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the temporal scope of application of LAW , the ORG noted the ORG argument that the introduction of that Act adversely the legal situation of the public officials concerned in that it had extended during their mandate the scope of limitations applicable to them . The ORG considered that the prohibition on laws which harmed the position of individuals applied only to existing legal relationships within the area of civil , social insurance or administrative law . It could not be interpreted in such a way as to constitute a total ban on the introduction of new public law regulations which would be less advantageous for persons carrying out public functions during their mandate . It was of the view that such persons could not be considered as having any \u2018 acquired rights\u2019 in respect of the conditions of their mandate that could be compared to such rights within the meaning of this term for the purposes of civil or social insurance law .", "Under LAW ( c ) LAW of CARDINAL DATE as amended in DATE , local councillors , members of local government executive boards , executive secretaries to county councils and members of governing boards of legal entities with legal personality , such as companies owned or co - owned by local municipalities , are to submit declarations on their financial situation and property portfolio , hereinafter referred to as \u201c declarations \u201d .", "The declarations must cover their personal property and assets owned as marital property , and must list the following assets : savings and other liquid assets , all immovable property and shares and actions in public companies owned by both public - law and private - law persons . The declarations must also include information on property purchased by way of tender from any public - law entities and information about businesses owned or run by the persons obliged to submit declarations .", "The obligation to submit a declaration also covers information on income earned in the context of paid employment or any other income - generating professional or business activity . Further , information on all movable property exceeding PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL in value is to be included . Information on all loans of CARDINAL taken out by the individual concerned and the conditions under which these loans were granted is to be disclosed .", "Pursuant to LAW , the declaration must be submitted within DATE of the date on which a councillor makes a solemn oath to perform his or her duties honourably . ORG declarations are to be submitted to the President of ORG .", "Declarations are to be submitted for DATE until DATE of DATE at the latest , and also DATE prior to the end of a councillor \u2019s term of office .", "The declaration is to be accompanied by a copy of the DATE income - tax declaration for the relevant DATE .", "Declarations are to be submitted on a standardised form , provided in the LAW issued by the Prime Minister on DATE .", "The president of the local council is empowered to examine the declaration submitted by councillors and is obliged to transmit a copy to the local tax office .", "A copy of the declaration is to be kept for DATE in the local council \u2019s public records .", "Under LAW ( c ) \u00a7 CARDINAL , the local tax office is empowered to examine whether the declaration is compatible with the councillor \u2019s income - tax declaration for the relevant year . Where doubts arise as to its veracity , the president of the local council or the tax office may request the local tax inspectorate to institute a tax audit procedure in respect of the councillor .", "Pursuant to LAW , the president of the council is obliged to submit a report to the council by DATE , listing those councillors who have failed to submit declarations . This report should include information about any irregularities discerned in the declarations and about any measures taken in connection with these irregularities , such as those provided for in LAW ) \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act .", "Under LAW ( d ) , the information contained in the declaration is to be made public , with the exception of ORG home addresses and the address of other real estate that they own .", "Pursuant to LAW , a councillor who fails to submit a declaration will not be paid his or her DATE emoluments until such time as a declaration is duly submitted .", "Electronic copies of all submitted declarations are accessible to the general public through ORG , as provided for in the DATE LAW .", "Pursuant to LAW , a Public Information Bulletin has been created . It is an official publication and is accessible to the general public via the Internet . ORG is responsible for its creation and functioning . He or she is also responsible for ensuring that all public - law entities which are legally so obliged submit any information which is to be made public and that the ORG \u2019s home - page contains links enabling visitors to access all such information ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
