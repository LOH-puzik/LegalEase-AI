Furthermore , the psychiatrist in charge of the applicant 's care , PERSON , and a social worker gave evidence to the ORG stating that they were opposed to the applicant 's discharge . They proposed that the applicant should instead be transferred to hostel - type accommodation , under the care of a supervising consultant psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Dr PERSON wrote to the MHRT . He stated that the purpose of his letter was to give the ORG advance notice that his team was unable to meet the conditions set by the tribunal for the conditional discharge of the applicant . He explained that both PERSON and PERSON PERSON were agreed that it would be difficult to manage her should she be discharged directly to her parents ' home . He continued :", "\u201c In the circumstances , I believe it is highly unlikely that there will be another forensic psychiatrist willing to provide the supervision that is necessary to meet the conditions of the tribunal ... We continue to hold the view that it is not in her best interests to be discharged directly to her family but [ that she ] should go through a further period of rehabilitation in the community to prepare her fully for community living . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr PERSON again wrote to the MHRT informing it that he would write to the other consultant forensic psychiatrists in ORG ( \u201c the NLFS \u201d ) to enquire whether they would be prepared to supervise the applicant under the conditions laid down by the tribunal . As it transpired , none of those psychiatrists was prepared to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the health authority responsible for the area in which the applicant lived ( \u201c the health authority \u201d ) requested the director of the ORG to approach forensic colleagues working in the private sector to establish whether they might be willing to offer supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the health authority that the applicant 's new responsible medical officer , PERSON , was not satisfied that the applicant should return home . However , he had agreed to approach all local catchment area forensic consultant psychiatrists to determine whether they would be willing to provide after - care supervision for the applicant were she to be discharged to her parents ' home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the health authority to confirm that no consultant forensic psychiatrist from the ORG was willing to supervise the applicant in the community . Furthermore , it stated that it was not aware of any individual or organisation that would be suitably equipped to undertake such a task in the community . The letter noted that most private independent sector providers concentrated on acute and in - patient care only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr PERSON wrote to the MHRT to advise it that its conditions had not been complied with so far , and the reasons therefor .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the health authority wrote to the clinical directors of the forensic psychiatry services in GPE , GPE and GPE , identifying CARDINAL units in addition to the NLFS . They were asked to discuss the case urgently with their consultant colleagues to establish whether any of them was prepared to assess the applicant with a view to becoming her supervising consultant forensic psychiatrist under the terms laid down by the ORG . None was willing or able to assist .", "CARDINAL . The health authority subsequently wrote to both national and private institutions in GPE and GPE with the same request . Once again , no one was prepared to comply with the conditions set by the MHRT .", "CARDINAL . NORP The health authority concluded that there were no further steps that it could take .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr PERSON wrote to ORG , advising it of his opinion that the conditions imposed by the ORG were impossible to meet . He therefore requested the ORG Secretary to consider exercising his powers under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act to refer the applicant to an ORG . The Home Secretary complied with that request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued proceedings for judicial review of the decision of the health authority not to provide her with psychiatric supervision in the community in implementation of the conditions imposed by the ORG , which was preventing her discharge from hospital . She sought , inter alia , the quashing of that decision and/or an order to compel the health authority to provide her with the psychiatric treatment necessary to implement the conditions imposed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant permission to apply for judicial review . The Secretary of ORG declined to intervene in the proceedings , but made the following observations :", "\u201c LAW provides an established legislative framework in this and similar cases designed to safeguard the interests of patients . As part of this scheme Responsible Medical Officers are accountable in a way which clearly does not permit them to effectively deny the determinations of properly constituted ORG ... It is a matter for the ORG whether they decide to order a conditional discharge against the advice of the [ Responsible Medical Officer ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court judge ( Mr Justice PERSON ) heard the applicant 's substantive application for judicial review . The applicant argued that she was entitled to be discharged from hospital ; that the health authority was in breach of its duty under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act for failing to provide her with the necessary services to comply with the conditions of the ORG ; and that the failure to comply with those conditions within a reasonable period of time was in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judge rejected the applicant 's application . He held that , under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , the health authority was not under an absolute duty to implement the conditions of the ORG , but only a duty to take all reasonable steps to attempt to satisfy those conditions . The judge further held that , on the facts , the health authority had complied with that duty . He further rejected the applicant 's suggestion that any of the psychiatric consultants had \u201c thwarted \u201d the conclusions of the ORG , holding that doctors were both entitled and obliged to exercise their own professional judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the reference by the Home Secretary on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , a differently constituted MHRT considered the applicant 's case afresh . It concluded that the applicant should be conditionally discharged . The conditions were that the applicant should reside in accommodation approved by her responsible medical officer , that she accept to be supervised and take the medication prescribed by the latter , and that she accept to be supervised by her social supervisor .", "CARDINAL . The ORG gave the same answers as the first MHRT to the questions set out in paragraph CARDINAL above . It also deferred the discharge of the applicant until satisfactory arrangements had been made to meet the conditions it had imposed . It further expressed the following as part of its reasoning :", "\u201c ... we consider that it is appropriate that [ the applicant ] should remain liable to recall to hospital . The critical issue , we feel , is that Miss PERSON 's current good mental health is dependent , in our view , upon her continuing to receive her medication .", "Our hope and expectation is that the condition as to residence which we have imposed will be capable of being complied with within a relatively short period . We consider that , bearing in mind that Miss PERSON had a legitimate expectation DATE of being released into the community almost at once , her [ Responsible Medical Officer ] and the other responsible authorities should treat the finding of suitable accommodation for her as urgent . Having seen Miss PERSON , it is clear to us that she is a very personable woman and we find it difficult to conceive of any responsible body having any legitimate objection to accommodating her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was conditionally discharged from hospital to a resettlement project hostel in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG granted the applicant permission to appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE in her judicial review proceedings . It recognised that , in the light of the applicant 's conditional discharge , which had occurred subsequent to the judgment of ORG , the issues raised on appeal were , in CARDINAL sense , academic . However , permission to appeal was granted as a result of the importance of the issues raised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It agreed with the interpretation of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act that had been the basis of the decision of ORG judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In paragraph CARDINAL of his judgment , Lord PERSON set out the effect of an earlier judgment of ORG in NORP v. ORG , ex parte Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) as follows :", "\u201c Should , for any reason , it prove impossible to implement the conditions specified by a ORG , that ORG could not consider whether to impose alternative conditions or even to direct discharge of the patient without conditions . In such circumstances the patient would remain detained unless and until a fresh reference was made to a ORG . The patient was not entitled himself to initiate a reference for DATE . The Secretary of ORG was under no similar restriction , but in practice a considerable length of time would be likely to DATE before the matter came back before the ORG pursuant to a reference by the Secretary of ORG . The implications of this state of affairs were considered by ORG in PERSON v. the GPE ... \u201d", "At the time at which the facts in the present case arose , no separate relief was available to the applicant under LAW DATE ( which incorporated the Convention directly into domestic law ) . Nevertheless , Lord PERSON proceeded on the basis that , where there was no conflict with precedent , the correct approach had always been to interpret legislation in a manner that was consistent with the Convention . He therefore addressed the human rights issues in the case as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Does the legislative scheme , as interpreted in [ ORG ] , violate the right to liberty conferred by LAW ] ? In considering this question it is necessary to distinguish between CARDINAL different situations . The first is a case , such as the present , where the ORG concludes that the patient is mentally ill and requires treatment , but that under appropriate conditions such treatment can be provided in the community . The second is where , as in the case of PERSON , the ORG finds that the patient is no longer suffering from mental illness , is not in need of treatment but needs to be discharged into a controlled environment in order to reduce the stress involved , to make sure that the patient is indeed free of the illness and to reduce the risk that the illness may recur .", "CARDINAL . Where ( i ) a patient is suffering from mental illness and ( ii ) treatment of that illness is necessary in the interests of the patient 's own health or for the protection of others and ( iii ) it proves impossible or impractical to arrange for the patient to receive the necessary treatment in the community , it seems to me that the CARDINAL criteria identified by ORG in PERSON are made out . Whether or not it is necessary to detain a patient in hospital for treatment may well depend upon the level of facilities available for treatment within the community . Neither Article CARDINAL nor GPE jurisprudence lays down any criteria as to the extent to which member GPE must provide facilities for the care of those of unsound mind in the community , thereby avoiding the necessity for them to be detained for treatment in hospital .", "CARDINAL . If a health authority is unable , despite the exercise of all reasonable endeavours , to procure for a patient the level of care and treatment in the community that a ORG considers to be a prerequisite to the discharge of the patient from hospital , I do not consider that the continued detention of the patient in hospital will violate the right to liberty conferred by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Very different considerations apply to a factual situation such as that considered by ORG in GPE . Where a patient has been cured of mental illness , he is no longer of unsound mind and the exception to the right to liberty provided for by LAW ) does not apply . In ORG has recognised that , in such circumstances , it may nonetheless be legitimate to make discharge of the patient conditional rather than absolute and to defer , to some extent , the discharge to which the patient is entitled . The deferral must , however , be proportionate to its object and can not become indefinite . The decision in PERSON suggests that the statutory regime as interpreted in [ ORG ] , may not be consistent with LAW . If the ORG imposes a condition which proves impossible of performance , too lengthy a period may elapse before the position is reconsidered as a result of a subsequent referral .", "CARDINAL . The solution to the problem is not to interpret section CARDINAL in such a way as to impose on health authorities an absolute obligation to satisfy conditions imposed by Tribunals . I do not consider it appropriate in this case to attempt to provide a definitive answer to the problem . I would simply observe that the solution may well involve reconsidering the decision of ORG in [ ORG ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the course of his judgment , Lord Justice PERSON opined as follows :", "\u201c DATE . The effect of LAW of LAW ] is to entitle a person in the situation of [ the applicant ] to have the lawfulness of her detention decided by a body , within the system of the ORG that is detaining her , that has appropriate court - like characteristics . In the case of GPE , that court - like function is performed by ORG ( ORG ) . CARDINAL necessary characteristic of such a body , if it is to meet the requirements of LAW , is that its orders should be effective in securing the release of persons whose detention it rules to be unlawful : see ... PERSON v. the ORG Kingdom[judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ] ...", "CARDINAL . NORP In the present case , the ORG concluded that the detention of [ the applicant ] would be unlawful once the conditions upon which her release was contingent were put in place . Those conditions , in particular , included cooperation by [ the applicant ] with supervision by a forensic consultant psychiatrist ; and therefore , by necessary implication , provision of such supervision by the appropriate organ of the ORG . If that order were to be effective , as LAW requires , such supervision had to be provided .", "CARDINAL . Johnson ... , CARDINAL and DATE , seems to me to make clear , in accordance with that requirement of effectiveness , that a breach of LAW is committed by the ORG if , once the ORG has determined that a patient should be released , it imposes conditions to facilitate that release that in the event are not fulfilled , at least if the non - fulfilment can be attributed to another organ of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In applying that part of the ORG 's jurisprudence , I would not make the distinction drawn by [ Lord PERSON ] , in paragraph CARDINAL of his judgment , and based on the approach of ORG in PERSON , between cases where the PERSON concludes that the patient is mentally ill , but can be treated in the community , and cases ( such as PERSON itself ) where the ORG finds that the patient is no longer suffering from mental illness but nonetheless needs to be released into a controlled environment . In the latter case , the justification for the placing of continued restrictions on the subject relates , and can only relate , to the history of mental illness and , as in PERSON , to the prospect of recurrence . In both cases , there is continued detention ; the role of the ORG in both cases is to exercise the court - like functions required by LAW , and under the jurisprudence of LAW the national authorities are equally bound to respect and act on the determination of the ORG in either case .", "CARDINAL . There is also a practical difficulty in applying the Winterwerp criterion of whether the mental disorder is ' of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement ' to decisions that were not taken with that formulation expressly in mind . In [ the applicant 's ] case , the ORG answered ' Yes ' to the question : ' Is the ORG satisfied that the patient is not now suffering from mental illness ... of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for the patient to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment ? ' , but in their extended reasoning made it clear that any discharge must be subject to the provision of continuing treatment . That is not a clear - cut decision of the type that PERSON seems to assume .", "CARDINAL . However that may be , under the [ Convention ] jurisprudence ... once the ORG made a decision as to [ the applicant 's ] release that was contingent on the provision of forensic psychiatric supervision , it became the responsibility of the ORG to provide that supervision . Otherwise , if nothing was done , the situation would arise that was identified in paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment in PERSON , of indefinite deferral of the release that had been ordered by the ORG . That deferral would arguably entail a breach of the [ Convention ] . The issue would depend on whether , once the ORG had determined that her condition could and should be treated in the community , she was , in terms of the analysis in PERSON , suffering from a mental disorder of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement . I have already indicated the difficulty of this question . We received no submissions upon it , the argument being concentrated in another direction , and I certainly do not decide the issue here .", "CARDINAL . In raising the possibility that [ the applicant 's ] detention became unlawful I have not overlooked [ Lord PERSON 's ] view , set out in paragraph CARDINAL of his judgment , that such a conclusion may be controlled or affected by the availability of treatment facilities in the particular community involved ; but what matters in [ Convention ] terms is the ruling of the ORG , the determining body created by LAW . If the ruling of the ORG is frustrated , in a case where under LAW ] jurisprudence the subject should no longer be detained , then the subject is deprived of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL protection , as ( I think it to be clear ) the [ ORG ] would have held in PERSON had the issue not been determined already under LAW : see paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . I well accept that this conclusion entails a number of practical difficulties , not least that it might appear to lead to the release of a person who is or has been mentally ill without the support that the ORG thought necessary for that release . That may appear surprising , not only in common - sense terms , but also in view of the emphasis placed in the jurisprudence of the [ Convention ] upon the judgment of the national authorities : see for instance the observations of the [ Court ] in PERSON v. GPE [ judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ] at paragraph CARDINAL as to the relevance in this context of the doctrine of the margin of appreciation ; and the observations in paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment in PERSON as to the respect to be paid to the discretionary judgment of those responsible for dealing with the mentally ill . The problem in this case arises , however , from the rigidity of the required procedure of the MHRT that is identified in DATE and CARDINAL of [ Lord PERSON 's ] judgment . If the ORG indeed had the power to review its decisions in the light of practical circumstances , as was envisaged by PERSON in [ GPE ] , then difficulties of the present order would not arise ; and provided that the national authorities made all reasonable efforts to comply with provisional decisions of the MHRT I very much doubt that any objection to such a procedure would arise under the [ Convention ] . That , however , is not the present state of domestic law : the decision of the ORG being once and for all , that is the decision that LAW requires to be respected .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... [ the applicant ] may have a complaint under LAW to the whole circumstances that led to her continued detention : including , in particular , that the ORG having ruled that her continued detention was not justified , the implementation by the ORG of that order in the event caused her to continue to be detained . The ORG is responsible for the whole of these circumstances . That , presumably , is why the ORG was found to be in breach in PERSON from the original date of the ORG 's decision : see the last sentence of paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment . The circumstances of [ the applicant 's ] case might , therefore , by the same token found a successful complaint in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON , during the course of his judgment , expressed the following view ( in DATE ) :", "\u201c ...

The case , similarly to that of the applicant , involved a patient who was suffering from a mental illness , but CARDINAL which was in remission . It was decided subsequently to the applicant 's domestic case and was brought under LAW DATE .

If , having made a decision that a patient is entitled to a conditional discharge , subject to specific conditions which necessitate deferral of the discharge , the ORG can not revisit its decision , the patient is liable to find himself ' in limbo ' should it prove impossible to put in place the arrangements necessary to enable him to comply with the proposed conditions . That period ' in limbo ' may last too long to be compatible with LAW and may result in the patient being detained in violation of LAW . \u201d", "Lord PERSON therefore determined that the decision in GPE needed to be reviewed in the light of the requirements of LAW .

The guidelines comprised specific steps that could be taken by an ORG should problems arise with making arrangements to meet the conditions of a conditional discharge . Those steps included the possibility of deferring for a further period , varying the proposed conditions to seek to overcome the difficulties , ordering a conditional discharge without specific conditions or deciding that the patient had to remain detained in hospital for treatment .

Following an appeal to ORG , on CARDINAL DATE , Lord PERSON , in his judgment with which the other members of ORG agreed , held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The key to a correct understanding of PERSON is to appreciate the nature of the case with which the ORG was dealing . It was that of a patient who , from DATE , was found not to be suffering from mental illness and whose condition did not warrant detention in hospital . The ORG 's reasoning is not applicable to any other case .", "...", "CARDINAL . I do not accept that , because the tribunal lacked the power to secure compliance with its conditions , it lacked the coercive power which is CARDINAL of the essential attributes of a court . What LAW ( e ) and CARDINAL require is that a person of unsound mind compulsorily detained in hospital should have access to a court with power to decide whether the detention is lawful and , if not , to order his release . This power the tribunal had . Nothing in DATE suggests that discharge subject to conditions is impermissible in principle , and nothing in the Convention jurisprudence suggests that the power to discharge conditionally ( whether there are specific conditions or a mere liability to recall ) , properly used , should be viewed with disfavour . Indeed , the conditional discharge regime , properly used , is of great benefit to patients and the public , and conducive to the LAW object of restricting the curtailment of personal liberty to the maximum , because it enables tribunals to ensure that restricted patients compulsorily detained in hospital represent the hard core of those who suffer from mental illness , are a risk to themselves or others and can not be effectively treated and supervised other than in hospital . If there is any possibility of treating and supervising a patient in the community , the imposition of conditions permit that possibility to be explored and , it may be , tried .", "CARDINAL .

It occurred because the tribunal , having made its order , was precluded by the authority of the NORP case from reconsidering it . The result was to leave the appellant in limbo for a much longer period than was acceptable or compatible with the Convention . I would accordingly endorse ORG decision to set aside the ORG ruling and I would adopt the ruling it gave in paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment quoted above . Evidence before the ORG shows that that ruling is already yielding significant practical benefits . ...", "CARDINAL . There was no time DATE and DATE when the appellant was , in my opinion , unlawfully detained , and there was thus no breach of LAW ( e ) . There is a categorical difference , not a difference of degree , between this case and that of PERSON . PERSON was a patient in whose case the PERSON criteria were found not to be satisfied from DATE . While , therefore , it was reasonable to try and ease the patient 's reintegration into the community by the imposition of conditions , the alternative , if those conditions proved impossible to meet , was not continued detention but discharge , either absolutely or subject only to a condition of liability to recall . His detention became unlawful shortly after DATE because there were , as all the doctors agreed , no grounds for continuing to detain him . The present case is quite different . There was never a medical consensus , nor did the tribunal find , that the PERSON criteria were not satisfied . The tribunal considered that the appellant could be satisfactorily treated and supervised in the community if its conditions were met , as it expected , but the alternative , if these conditions proved impossible to meet , was not discharge , either absolutely or subject only to a condition of recall , but continued detention . ...", "CARDINAL . The duty of the health authority , whether under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act or in response to the tribunal 's order of DATE , was to use its best endeavours to procure compliance with the conditions laid down by the tribunal . This it did . It was not subject to an absolute obligation to procure compliance and was not at fault in failing to do so . It had no power to require any psychiatrist to act in a way which conflicted with the conscientious professional judgment of that psychiatrist . Thus the appellant can base no claim on the fact that the tribunal 's conditions were not met . ...", "CARDINAL . I do not consider that the violation of LAW which I have found calls for an award of compensation since ( a ) the violation has been publicly acknowledged and the appellant 's right thereby vindicated , ( b ) the law has been amended in a way which should prevent similar violations in future , and ( c ) the appellant has not been the victim of unlawful detention , which LAW is intended to avoid .", "For these reasons ...
