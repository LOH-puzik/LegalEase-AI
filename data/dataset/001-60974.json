On this occasion I can assure you , however , that I have not bowed to the high representatives of the former political system and , in particular , the [ former ] ORG agents who paid at least as much attention to my person as you do now .

I went to the aforesaid office on DATE . After I had rejected an \u2018 agreement\u2019 which was proposed to me , [ the investigator ] , a former ORG agent , accused me of having stolen [ goods from H. ] in DATE . Thus [ P. ] has been unwilling to bring proceedings against [ H. ] since DATE , and has arranged , through a police investigator who can easily be blackmailed , for proceedings to be brought against me in revenge for the justified complaints I had lodged against him . [ P. ] did so contrary to [ the relevant provisions of LAW ] because so far ... there is no evidence before [ the relevant authorities ] from which to conclude with sufficient certainty that I stole anything from [ H. ] Subsequently I realised that my telephone , which was also used by my detective agency , had been tapped contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Of course , money paid by [ H. ] with a view to covering up his fraudulent activity also played a role in the matter .

In ORG view , the applicant had failed to show that he had a justified reason to make such statements . The court did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that he had doubts about the past and qualities of the public prosecutor because the latter had studied socialist law , had failed to take appropriate action on the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint of DATE , and initiated criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL .
