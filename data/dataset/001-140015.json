NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life)", "JUDGES": "Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik M\u00f8se;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE . The first applicant is a musician and the second applicant is an actress . They are both known to the public in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants married in a private ceremony which took place outdoors on an islet in the municipality of PERSON in the GPE fjord , QUANTITY south of the capital .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the DATE magazine Se og ORG , hereafter \u201c the magazine \u201d , published a CARDINAL - page article about the wedding , accompanied by CARDINAL photographs . CARDINAL photograph showed the bride , her father and her bridesmaids arriving at the islet in a small rowing boat ; another showed the bride being brought to the groom by her father on the islet , surrounded by people ; and yet another photograph showed the bride and the groom returning to the mainland on foot by crossing the lake on stepping stones . In the last photograph , the bride was barefoot with her wedding dress raised above her knees to avoid getting the dress wet . There was also a photograph of a couple and their baby who were wedding guests . Finally , there were CARDINAL old photographs : CARDINAL of the applicants framed in a heart and CARDINAL of the second applicant and the applicants\u2019 young son attending a musical festival DATE .", "CARDINAL . The article described the ceremony , the applicants and some of the guests . It stated , inter alia , that the ceremony was touching ; that several guests could not hold back their tears when the bride arrived at the islet and a male voice choir starting singing the song \u201c To live is to love \u201d ; and that a party took place after the ceremony in the garden of a named guest house . It also stated that the ORG manager had informed the magazine that the applicants did not wish to comment on their wedding .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought compensation proceedings against the magazine before ORG ( GPE tingrett ) and invoked , among other things , the right to respect for private life under LAW and LAW . It was not in dispute that the magazine was not invited to the wedding and that the photographs were taken without the applicants\u2019 knowledge QUANTITY from the islet .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the applicants and ordered the magazine to pay them each MONEY ( ORG ) . In addition , the editor responsible was ordered to pay each applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the journalist and the photographer were ordered to pay each applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The magazine appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , which by judgment of DATE upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The magazine appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) , which by judgment of DATE found against the applicants , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice U. gave the following reasons , which in the main were endorsed by the CARDINAL other members of the majority :", "\u201c I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed .", "( DATE ) In DATE ORG has considered legal questions relating to violation of privacy in the judgments Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( Big Brother ) and Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( GPE ) . My argument is based mainly on these judgments . As follows from the judgments , section CARDINAL of LAW concerning redress for violation of privacy must be read in conjunction with LAW . The provision in section CARDINAL refers , at any rate primarily , to violation of section CARDINAL . In my view , there is no need to consider whether , as contended by [ the applicants ] , there may be cases that are covered in principle by LAW but not by \" privacy \" under LAW . Nor will I examine whether this is a discussion of terminology or of facts .", "( CARDINAL ) I have already described the content of the article . There is no doubt that the case concerns information \u2012 which I am using as a general term to refer to both text and pictures \u2012 that taken as a whole is relevant to the issue of privacy . There is no reason for me to evaluate individual elements on the basis of whether or not they impinge on the concept of privacy . The article as a whole contains information about the couple and their child in addition to information about the wedding . The relationships within the family and between the family and their friends are clearly of a personal nature .", "( CARDINAL ) Thus the question under consideration is whether a violation of privacy took place , cf . section CARDINAL of LAW . There would have been no question of violation of privacy if consent to publication had been obtained , cf . paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment in the Big Brother case . In this case it has been clearly established that the couple had not been informed beforehand that there were plans to publicise the wedding , nor were they asked for their consent . However , the journalist , PERSON , contacted [ the first applicant \u2019s ] manager on DATE , immediately before the article went to press . The manager said that the couple did not wish to comment on the wedding . A little later the same day Se og PERSON was contacted and informed that the couple did not consent to publication , but the reply was that the magazine was already in the press . It has thus been clearly established that the article was published without the couple \u2019s consent . I would add that I see nothing in the article indicating that the couple had given the magazine permission to report on the wedding in return for payment . On the contrary , the article stated at the end that the CARDINAL celebrities did not wish to comment .", "( DATE ) The next question is whether the article was unlawful . This question must be decided on the basis of an overall evaluation of the article , cf . paragraph CARDINAL of the Big Brother judgment with further references . In my assessment of legality I also refer to the Big Brother judgment , citing , as was done in the GPE judgment , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL :", "\u2018 ... When the penal provision applies to violation of privacy , this necessarily implies that the issue that arises is that of legality . This again implies that the publication must be assessed as a whole , in the actual context and situation , where protection of privacy must be weighed against freedom of expression , cf . ORG , Part DATE , page CARDINAL , of LAW and comments , and further references .", "... LAW is incorporated into internal NORP law in LAW . Both Article CARDINAL relating to respect for private and family life and Article CARDINAL relating to the right to freedom of expression are central to the present case . The principles that must be weighed in this case are similar to those that must be weighed under section CARDINAL , first paragraph , of LAW and LAW , and in the present situation these provisions should be interpreted in such a way that their content is in compliance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW Rights.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) Reference is also made in paragraph CARDINAL of the Big Brother judgment to the summing up by ORG in the von GPE judgment :", "\u2018 ... The conclusion must naturally be read in conjunction with the rest of the judgment . The issue throughout is the balancing of the right to privacy against the principle of freedom of expression . The central issue with respect to protection of privacy is therefore whether the published article contributes to a debate of public interest . In other words , the particular importance of protection under LAW lies in the relevance of the information in question to public debate . With respect to publication of details referring exclusively to an individual \u2019s private life , and particularly to the private relationship between QUANTITY persons who do not occupy positions in politics or in society , this is clearly outside the area that the provisions relating to freedom of expression are intended to regulate.\u2019", "( DATE ) Both [ applicants ] are well - known figures , but neither of them has had a prominent role either in the public administration or in any other public body . Thus the provisions of LAW have no particular weight with respect to the magazine article in question , which clearly has a purely entertainment value . In the assessment of legality , protection under LAW is the most relevant principle to be weighed .", "( CARDINAL ) I will now examine the circumstances in the present case in relation to the issue of legality . As mentioned above , an overall assessment of the magazine article shows that it concerns the subjects\u2019 private life , and the question is whether in spite of this there are grounds for saying that it does not constitute a violation of privacy . A wedding is a very personal act . At the same time it also has a public side . A wedding is a public affirmation that QUANTITY persons intend to live together , and has legal consequences in many different sectors of society . Thus information about a wedding does not in itself involve a violation of privacy if it is given in a neutral form and based on a reliable source , cf . paragraph CARDINAL of the Big Brother judgment .", "( CARDINAL ) The judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON and the subsequent judgment of ORG in the Big Brother case have LOC that seem to go far in support of protection against the use of pictures and texts concerning an individual \u2019s private life . It is therefore necessary to examine the facts on which the judgments were based . Paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON case concerns a series of photographs of the aggrieved party . In its evaluation of the application of the law in the case at hand , the court stated in DATE and CARDINAL :", "\u2018 ... The ORG finds another point to be of importance : even though , strictly speaking , the present application concerns only the publication of the photos and articles by various NORP magazines , the context in which these photos were taken \u2012 without the applicant \u2019s knowledge or consent and the harassment endured by many public figures in their daily lives can not be fully disregarded ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the present case this point is illustrated in particularly striking fashion by the photos taken of the applicant at ORG tripping over an obstacle and falling down ... It appears that these photos were taken secretly at a distance of QUANTITY , probably from a neighbouring house , whereas journalists\u2019 and ORG access to the club was strictly regulated ...", "... The ORG reiterates the fundamental importance of protecting private life from the point of view of the development of every human being \u2019s personality . That protection \u2012 as stated above \u2012 extends beyond the private family circle and also includes a social dimension . The ORG considers that anyone , even if they are known to the general public , must be able to enjoy a \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d of protection of and respect for their private life ... \u2019", "( DATE ) LAW states :", "\u2018 Furthermore , photos appearing in the tabloid press are often taken in a climate of continual harassment which induces in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) Thus the way in which the photos were published and the constant photographing \u2012 often by photographers who followed her around \u2012 constituted harassment of the aggrieved party and also an invasion of privacy . The situation was similar to some extent in the Big Brother case . Se og ORG ran several articles featuring photos taken from different sources together with speculation and gossip . The magazine also described the relationship between the parties during their life together , which was an invasion of their private life as a couple .", "( DATE ) The right to protection of privacy is no weaker for well - known cultural personalities than it is for others , despite the fact that their photos are published in magazines and newspapers and on the internet in connection with their professional lives . It could be said that in the case of such individuals it is even more important to ensure that their private lives and personal relationships are protected .", "( CARDINAL ) A wedding is a very significant personal experience for the bridal couple , an experience that includes their families , friends and other persons close to them . The wedding ceremony and celebrations are therefore clearly part of private and family life and thus in principle should be protected . However , in my opinion this consideration is CARDINAL aspect of the case .", "( DATE ) As mentioned above , a neutral description of CARDINAL NORP wedding is not unlawful .", "( CARDINAL ) Neither the text nor the photos in the disputed magazine article contain anything unfavourable to the couple . The article contains no criticism , nor is there anything in the content that could weaken their reputations .", "( CARDINAL ) Furthermore , although the couple \u2019s relationships with close friends are part of their private life , I can not see that in this context the naming of a few of the participants constitutes a violation . Nor is it particularly unusual to write that the ceremony was \u201c moving , and several of the guests could n\u2019t hold back their tears when a men \u2019s choir sang ... \u201d .", "( DATE ) The article contains no photos of the actual wedding ceremony . It is therefore not possible for me to have any views on whether such photos , including close - ups , would have to be regarded in a different light from those featured in the article . Photos in such a situation would clearly have more personal significance than photos showing the bridal couple arriving at or leaving the place where the marriage took place .", "( CARDINAL ) I shall now examine more closely the way the wedding was conducted . The bride arrived at the islet in a rowing boat , with CARDINAL bridesmaids on board . There she was greeted by her future husband and by a men \u2019s choir singing a hymn . After the ceremony the bride and groom had to step from rock to rock in order to reach the shore , which the bride accomplished in bare feet . As pointed out in paragraph CARDINAL of the von GPE judgment , the concept of private life is comprehensive , and includes \u2018 a zone of interaction of a person with others , even in a public context , which may fall within the scope of \u2018 private life\u2019 . However , a certain amount of weight must be given to the fact that the wedding was organised in a very unusual way , and took place in an area that is accessible to the public under LAW and that is easily visible . As already mentioned , the photos do not show the most personal part of the wedding , the actual marriage ceremony .", "( CARDINAL ) As mentioned above , the photos were taken of a wedding in a place accessible to the public . It can be assumed that even in DATE there are large numbers of people on PERSON , which is one of the most popular locations for holiday cottages and recreation in GPE . Furthermore , many of the arrangements were such as to attract attention from third parties , for example the arrival of the bride in an open boat and the presence of a men \u2019s choir singing a hymn on the islet . The arrangements were also spectacular in themselves . In spite of the fact that all individuals , including celebrities , are entitled to protection against being photographed even in public places , I consider that this must be taken into account in the assessment of legality .", "( DATE ) The photos were taken from a headland QUANTITY from the islet where the ceremony was being held , and a CARDINAL to CARDINAL zoom lens was used . For the bridal couple , however , the situation would not have been any better if the photography had taken place somewhere closer , or from a place where the photographer and journalist could have been seen by the wedding party . This could have disturbed the whole wedding . Nor was the photographing in the nature of a breach of confidence , as it would have been if for example any of the participants had published personal photos taken during or in connection with the wedding . The situation would also have been different if the photos had been taken of events taking place in a closed area where the subjects had reason to believe that they were unobserved , cf . paragraph DATE , second sub - paragraph , of the PERSON judgment .", "( CARDINAL ) The article contained a photo of [ the second applicant ] together with the couple \u2019s under - age child . During the proceedings the focus has been on the photos related to the wedding , and it has not been contended that the use of the photo of the under - age child puts the case in a different light . The photo had previously been published in GPE , and it has not been contended that consent was lacking on that occasion . For these reasons I shall not examine the particular questions raised by the use of a photo of an under - age child without the necessary consent of the parents .", "( DATE ) Thus it must be concluded that the article did not involve unlawful violation of privacy .", "( DATE ) [ The applicants ] have contended as an alternative that the photos were used in a way that conflicts with the provisions of section DATE of LAW relating to the right to control the use of one \u2019s image . In my view these provisions should also be read with the reservation that there could be a conflict of principles and in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The conclusion would then be the same as that of my principal assessment .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG therefore allows the appeal . However , the case raises difficult and uncertain legal questions , clarification of which is in the public interest , cf . section DATE , third paragraph , a , of the Code of Civil Procedure . No award of costs should therefore be made . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON gave the following reasons which in the main were endorsed by the other member of the minority :", "\u201c ( DATE ) I am substantially in agreement with the first - voting judge \u2019s general interpretation of section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW . However , when weighing the right to privacy against the principle of freedom of expression in this specific case , I have arrived at a different conclusion , since I consider that in the present case the appellants have violated the right to privacy under LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) I will first examine whether the subject of the article in PERSON og PERSON can be considered to be \u2018 a personal matter\u2019 in the meaning of section CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) I agree with the first - voting judge that information that a marriage has been contracted CARDINAL named individuals can be published without being in conflict with the provisions of section CARDINAL of the Penal Code . However , this is not the issue in the present case . The article in ORG also describes in words and pictures details of the arrangements in connection with the wedding ceremony .", "( CARDINAL ) Weddings have always been a subject of general interest in the sense that those close to the bridal couple consider them important and wish to participate . It is also usual for the couple to wish to share the event with others . For these reasons there should in principle be no reason why the press should not report a wedding ceremony that takes place in full public view , and where no special arrangements have been made to indicate that the ceremony is private .", "( CARDINAL ) However , DATE it is not unusual for the couple to wish to share their wedding and its arrangements only with those closest to them , and often to give the event a personal touch . They are entitled to protect themselves from publicity in such cases as well , and this includes withholding permission for the press to publish the event . In my view the desire to hold a private wedding should be respected in the sense that the wedding ceremony should be regarded as a personal matter within the meaning of section CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) A private wedding ceremony may take different forms . For example , a wedding held in a private home provides a clear signal to third parties that the marriage is a personal matter that may not be reported in the form published by ORG without the bridal couple \u2019s prior consent .", "( CARDINAL ) In my view all the relevant circumstances indicate that in the present case the wedding was a private event . The wedding party was held at a hotel on PERSON , which in this context is clearly a private area . The islet where the events reported by ORG , and the marriage itself , took place is a relatively short walk away and directly linked with the hotel \u2019s property . In my opinion the fact that there is a general right of public access to the islet under LAW does not prevent this part of the wedding from also being of a clearly private nature . It follows from the von GPE judgment that protection of privacy also applies to places to which the public has access . Furthermore , consent to the use of the islet had been obtained from the landowner . Thus the arrangement as a whole indicated that the couple wished to restrict the wedding to themselves and their guests . From this perspective the event must be considered to be a personal matter within the meaning of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) For these reasons I consider that ORG published in words and pictures a number of details relating to a personal matter . Firstly , the magazine published details of the arrangements for the ceremony , which have been described more fully by the first - voting judge . I regard these as the personal touch that the bridal couple had wished to give their wedding and that in my view underlines the private nature of the wedding . Secondly , the article included a description of the guests and the couple \u2019s families , together with the names of well - known figures . In this connection the names of guests with children were also given , and pictures were shown of the children and their parents .", "( CARDINAL ) Like the first - voting judge , I consider that it has been clearly demonstrated that the opposite parties\u2019 consent had not been obtained .", "( CARDINAL ) The next question is whether the publication is legal and justified despite the fact that the subject of the article is a personal matter . It follows from paragraph CARDINAL of Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL that the main question to be weighed is whether \u2018 the article contributes to a debate of public interest . In other words , the particular importance of the principle of protection under LAW lies in the sphere of public debate\u2019 . I agree with the first - voting judge that this wording can not be interpreted in such a way that it does not rule out that the publication of personal matters is justified in cases where it does not contribute to public debate . However , when matters of a personal nature such as those in question here are published , they must have at least a minimum of public interest if the invasion of privacy is to be considered legitimate . In the present case the publication was a celebrity article written for the sole purpose of entertainment . Although the desire to entertain is in itself legitimate , its nature does not justify overriding the affected parties\u2019 desire to protect their privacy . In this connection I place special emphasis on the fact that getting married is a very significant occasion in a person \u2019s life , and that therefore the activities celebrating it \u2012 the marriage ceremony and the wedding party \u2012 will for most people be one of the most important events of their lives , and will often be associated with strong emotions .", "( DATE ) The fact that the opposite parties are well - known cultural figures in GPE has no bearing on the assessment . Well - known persons also have the right to respect for personal matters of the kind we are dealing with here . I find support for this view both in Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , cf . paragraph CARDINAL , and in the von GPE judgment ... , cf . paragraph CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) Although this has not influenced my view of the case , I would also like to comment on PERSON H\u00f8r \u2019s use of a zoom lens . The zoom lens enabled the journalist and the photographer to take close - up pictures of the bridal couple and their guests that make it look as if they were actually at the event themselves , when in fact they were hidden from those who were being observed . It seems likely that the reason for using this technique was that the journalist and photographer were aware that the bridal couple would have reacted to their presence on the islet and this might have resulted in the marriage ceremony being moved inside the hotel . Using a zoom lens because of the personal and private nature of the event resembles the use of a hidden camera , which is a factor that also weighs against the appellants .", "( DATE ) For these reasons I am of the opinion that the article in Se og ORG can not be justified on the basis of an assessment of legality , and that the opposite parties are entitled to redress for pain and suffering from the appellants . With regard to the amount of redress , the opposite parties have demanded that the amount decided by ORG should be maintained . I have no objections to the amounts decided on . Since I know that I am in the minority , I will not formulate a final conclusion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provision of the Penal Code reads as follows :", "Any person who violates another person \u2019s privacy by giving public information about personal or domestic relations shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL shall apply correspondingly .", "If the misdemeanour is committed in a printed forum , an order for confiscation may be made in accordance with LAW .", "A public prosecution will only be instituted when it is requested by the aggrieved person and required in the public interest ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
