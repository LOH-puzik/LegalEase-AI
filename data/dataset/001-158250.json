NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a LOC national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent at the time , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a LOC DATE newspaper , the ORG , published an article entitled \u201c The president of the court enabled his brother \u2019s unjust enrichment \u201d . The article , in substance , alleged that there were numerous failures ( propusti ) in ORG ( PERSON ) in ORG , most of which were attributable to the president of that court , ORG , against whom a number of criminal complaints had been filed . CARDINAL such complaint , filed by the applicant , as reported by the article , implied that ORG had abused his office . He had allegedly kept hidden an eviction claim filed by a private company X against his brother , PERSON , and his brother \u2019s company , thus enabling ORG unlawfully to make a profit of CARDINAL ( ORG ) on a DATE basis by using somebody else \u2019s property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE GPE and GPE each lodged a private criminal action against the applicant for defamation ( kleveta ) , claiming that the latter \u2019s statements were untrue and , therefore , harmful to their honour and reputation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) designated ORG in GPE as the competent court to process the actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a remittal , the applicant was found guilty of defamation ( kleveta u produ\u017eenom trajanju ) , fined MONEY ( ORG ) , and ordered to pay LAW for the court fees ( sudski pau\u0161al ) . The judgment specified that if the fine was not paid within DATE from DATE when the judgment became final , it would be converted into a CARDINAL-day prison term .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings the applicant confirmed that he had lodged a criminal complaint with the police and made a similar submission to ORG , but claimed that he had never given a statement to the PERSON relating to the allegations contained in the article . His intention was not to insult PERSON , but to draw the attention to the irregularities in the work of GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP The journalist who wrote the article maintained that his source of information was from ORG , whose identity he did not want to reveal , and that the article had been written on the basis of the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint only .", "CARDINAL . V.\u0160. , for his part , considered that the newspaper \u2019s source of information was the applicant . It was not true that he had kept the eviction case - file hidden and the only reason why the case had not been concluded earlier was due to an enormous number of cases pending before the said court , which was widely known . In any event , his brother was not a respondent party in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . D.\u0160. submitted that the applicant had made untrue statements in the article published in the ORG about his unlawful use of business LOC owned by X.", "CARDINAL . NORP The court established that the applicant \u2019s submission made to a number of judicial bodies alleged , inter alia , that FAC had acted contrary to LAW for DATE by not allocating the said eviction case to another judge . The remainder of the submission contained allegations relating to GPE only . It was further established that the newspaper article contained , inter alia , the allegations from the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint implying that ORG had abused his office by enabling his brother \u2019s unjust enrichment . The court took into account that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his claims as he did not have a final court judgment convicting ORG in this regard . The journalist \u2019s statement was held to be illogical and made with the aim of helping the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In view of this , the court held that the applicant had given untrue statements about the private prosecutors through the media or in a similar way and thus committed the said criminal offence . In particular , he had made a submission to ORG and other bodies , as well as an untrue statement to the ORG about PERSON and his involvement in the said eviction proceedings , which \u201c undoubtedly harmed the honour and reputation of the private prosecutors \u201d . The court , however , did not accept that the statements could have led to more severe consequences .", "CARDINAL . Without verifying the applicant \u2019s financial status ( imovinsko stanje ) , the court considered that the imposed fine was adequate and that the applicant would be able to pay it within the prescribed time - limit as \u201c he undoubtedly ran a private legal practice and obviously had clients given that he had asked for adjournment of some of the hearings in order to attend the proceedings in his GPE cases \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the applicant appealed . He maintained , in particular , that he had not given the said statement to the newspaper , which was confirmed by the author of the article himself . It was unacceptable that somebody be found guilty of defamation for submissions made in a criminal complaint filed against a public official . In addition , ORG himself had admitted that he had not allocated the eviction case file to another judge for DATE , and that he , the applicant , was not allowed to prove the veracity of his criminal complaint , namely that by doing so PERSON had enabled his brother \u2019s significant unjust enrichment .", "CARDINAL . He further submitted that he had requested the exclusion of the first - instance court single judge dealing with the case , but that she had rendered the judgment nevertheless . She had also drawn conclusions about his financial status without verifying it .", "CARDINAL . He finally proposed that the judgment be quashed and that the previous first - instance judge be excluded in the re - trial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment in substance , endorsing its reasoning , and held that none of the other allegations made in the appeal could lead it to decide otherwise .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the applicant paid the fine .", "CARDINAL . The average DATE income in GPE when the relevant domestic decisions were rendered was ORG CARDINAL in DATE and ORG CARDINAL in DATE . Financial brokers had the highest incomes , these being on average ORG CARDINAL in DATE and LAW in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application was communicated to the respondent Government . In their observations dated CARDINAL DATE the Government informed the ORG that on DATE ORG , following a request for the protection of legality lodged by ORG , had quashed the judgment of ORG rendered on DATE and had ordered a re - trial . The impugned judgment had been quashed on the ground that ORG had ruled only on the appeal submitted by the applicant \u2019s representative , but had failed to rule on the appeal submitted by the applicant himself . On DATE , in the re - trial , ORG had overturned the first instance judgment of DATE and dismissed the criminal actions lodged against the applicant ( odbija se optu\u017eba ) as the criminal prosecution had become time - barred in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . In his observations of CARDINAL DATE the applicant confirmed the above information .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Zakon o izvr\u0161nom postupku ; published in ORG no . CARDINAL ) provided that once the enforcement had taken place , the debtor could request the court to order a counter - enforcement and order the repayment of what he had paid , if the document on the basis of which the enforcement had been undertaken was quashed , overturned , annulled or ceased to be in force . This LAW was repealed by LAW on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
