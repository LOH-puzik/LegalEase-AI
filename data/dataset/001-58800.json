NORP In early CARDINAL Guinness was competing with another public company , ORG ( \u201c GPE ) , to take over a third public company , ORG ( \u201c Distillers \u201d ) . The takeover battle resulted in victory for ORG . ORG 's offer to the ORG ' shareholders , like ORG , included a substantial share exchange element and , accordingly , the respective prices at which ORG and GPE shares were quoted on the stock exchange was a critical factor for both sides . During the course of the bid the ORG share price rose dramatically , but once the bid had been declared unconditional it fell significantly . According to the third applicant the share price rose in line with the range of the company 's market sector and DATE was a consequence of normal market forces .", "CARDINAL . There were allegations and rumours of misconduct during the bid to the effect that the substantial increase in the quoted ORG share price during the bid had been achieved as a result of an unlawful share - support operation . This involved certain persons ( \u201c supporters \u201d ) purchasing ORG shares in order to maintain or inflate its quoted share price . It was alleged that supporters were offered secret indemnities against any losses they might incur and , in some cases , also large success fees if the ORG 's bid was successful . Such inducements , if true , would have been unlawful ( CARDINAL ) because they were not disclosed to the market under LAW on ORG and ( CARDINAL ) because they were paid out of ORG ' own monies in breach of LAW DATE ( the \u201c DATE Act \u201d ) , which prohibits a company from giving financial assistance for the purpose of the acquisition of its own shares .", "CARDINAL . It was further alleged that supporters who had purchased shares under the unlawful share - support operation were indemnified and rewarded , and that some of those who had helped find supporters were rewarded by the payment of large fees which had also come from ORG funds . It was rumoured that in most cases payments were made using false invoices which concealed the fact that payment was being made in respect of the supporters ' or other recipients ' participation in the unlawful share - support operation .", "CARDINAL . These allegations and rumours led the Secretary of ORG on CARDINAL DATE to appoint inspectors pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act to inquire into the acquisition of ORG and to investigate the affairs of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the inspectors informed ORG ( ORG ) of certain matters and , on CARDINAL DATE , a note from the ORG solicitor recorded that there was concrete evidence of criminal offences having been committed .

The applicants maintain that they were never notified of these arrangements during their respective interviews .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Wood , who had been appointed head of legal services at the ORG , appointed a team of counsel to advise on the criminal aspects of the investigation .

The interviews focused on the way in which he was drawn into the support operation for the ORG bid and on the arrangements for the payment of the success fee to his company .", "The third applicant was interviewed by the inspectors on DATE . He was accompanied by his solicitor throughout these interviews during which he was pressed to answer a number of specific questions .

He stated that it was common ground that the interviews were capable of being \u201c confessions \u201d as defined in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PACE . He found that , as a matter of construction of the DATE Act , inspectors could ask witnesses questions that tended to incriminate them , that the witnesses were under a duty to answer such questions and the answers were admissible in criminal proceedings . He rejected the third applicant 's assertion that the inspectors should have given a warning against self - incrimination . He was satisfied that there was no element of oppression involved in the obtaining of the evidence and that the answers were not obtained in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render them unreliable in all the circumstances existing at the time .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the court held a further voir dire following the application of PERSON to rule inadmissible the ORG transcripts concerning the eighth and ninth interviews with him on the basis that they should be excluded either as unreliable under section DATE of PACE or pursuant to section CARDINAL of PACE because of the adverse effect the admission of the evidence would have on the fairness of the proceedings having regard to the circumstances in which it was obtained . ORG was placed on PERSON alleged ill - health at the time and on the fact that the CARDINAL interviews in question had taken place after he had been charged .", "CARDINAL . In his ruling of CARDINAL DATE Mr Justice PERSON rejected the defence argument as to Mr PERSON ' medical condition . He did , however , exercise his discretion pursuant to section DATE to exclude the evidence from the CARDINAL above - mentioned interviews which had taken place after Mr PERSON had been charged on the grounds that the latter 's attendance could not be said to have been voluntary . In his view , moreover , it could not be said to be fair to use material obtained by compulsory interrogation after the commencement of the accusatorial process .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were tried together with PERSON . The trial opened on DATE and involved DATE of evidence , DATE of speeches by counsel and a DATE summing - up to the jury by the trial judge .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial , PERSON was the only accused to give evidence . According to the applicants , the testimony of PERSON was irreconcilable with the evidence which each had given to the inspectors and prejudicial to their case that their involvement in the share - support operation had not been dishonest . The third applicant maintains that his participation in the operation was in line with City practice on takeovers , but that he was unable to obtain witnesses who would be prepared to testify to this for fear of repercussions engendered by the criminal proceedings . He claims that at the time of his trial the prosecution had in its possession extensive material arising out of other investigations into takeover bids which confirmed that share - support operations involving indemnities to the purchasers of shares were regarded as an acceptable practice in the City .", "CARDINAL . A large part of the evidence against the applicants consisted of evidence gathered by the ORG inspectors . In the course of the proceedings , evidence was further taken from the former finance director of ORG , PERSON , who had been granted immunity from prosecution . The prosecution also referred to the statements made by the applicants in the course of their interviews by the ORG inspectors . In the third applicant 's submission , the prosecution had acknowledged at the voir dire that this was in fact the only evidence against him .", "CARDINAL .

In the second set of proceedings concerning the other co - defendants , further challenge was made to the admissibility of the transcripts of the interviews on the ground , inter alia , that there was an abuse of process in that there was misconduct by the inspectors and/or the prosecuting authorities in the use of the inspectors ' statutory powers for the purpose of constructing a criminal case . In particular , it was alleged by CARDINAL of the co - defendants , Mr GPE , that there was a deliberate delay in charging the accused so that the inspectors could use their powers to obtain confessions .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling given on DATE , Mr Justice PERSON found that there was no prima facie case of abuse by either the inspectors or the prosecuting authorities . He had heard evidence from both the inspectors and the police officer in charge of the criminal investigation . In a ruling given on DATE , the judge rejected the application for a stay , finding that there had been no abuse of the criminal process in the questioning of the defendants or in the passing of Mr PERSON 's depositions to the inspectors to the prosecuting authorities or in their conduct of the prosecution . He saw nothing improper or sinister in the decision by Mr Wood not to involve the police until DATE . He concluded that proper use had been made of the statutory powers . The judge also refused an application to exclude the evidence of the interviews under section CARDINAL of PACE as constituting evidence which had such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG in a judgment dated DATE ( NORP v. GPE ) upheld the trial judge 's ruling as to the admissibility of the interviews before the inspectors . On DATE leave to appeal was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL applicants applied for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence . However , on DATE the first applicant withdrew his appeal on grounds of his precarious state of health . On DATE the first applicant 's knighthood was annulled .", "CARDINAL . The second and third applicants , like PERSON , were granted leave to appeal against conviction . Following a hearing , ORG gave its judgment on DATE . It held , inter alia , that while there were some blemishes and infelicities in the judge 's summing - up , it was in the main a masterly exposition . As regards the admissibility of the transcripts , it was held that the question had been decided , as far as it was concerned , by the decision given by another division of ORG in the case of NORP v. GPE , which had held that such statements were admissible .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON ' appeal was rejected on all but CARDINAL count . ORG found that the judge had erred in his direction on CARDINAL count and quashed that conviction . It reduced his sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant 's appeal resulted in a moderation of his sentence in that the period to be served in default of payment of his fine was reduced and the time within which he was to pay the fine was extended .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant 's appeal resulted in a reduction of his sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The orders for costs made against the second and third applicants were reduced to GBP CARDINAL each . A similar order was made by ORG in favour of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the third applicant be expelled from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged an application ( no . CARDINAL ) with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants became aware for the first time of the existence of part of the material obtained by and available to the prosecution prior to their trial and which had not been previously disclosed . This evidence had been disclosed by the prosecution to the defendants in the second ORG trial on DATE . They maintained that this material showed that share - support operations had been undertaken in relation to a number of other takeovers and had been considered to be an acceptable practice by the professional advisers involved in them . The material also included the outcome of an investigation undertaken on the initiative of the ORG and concluded on DATE by ORG ( a former disciplinary body ) . ORG had taken the view that share - support operations were an acceptable City practice .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought disclosure of this material from the prosecuting authorities . In view of their failure to do so , they requested the Home Secretary to refer the case back to ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE . On DATE the Home Secretary referred the whole of the applicants ' and PERSON case to ORG . ORG stayed consideration of the admissibility of PERSON application pending the outcome of the referral proceedings . After the case was referred , the prosecution disclosed the remainder of the material . The hearing before ORG took place DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the first applicant 's appeal on all but CARDINAL count , quashing his conviction on CARDINAL of the conspiracy counts . The appeals by the second and third applicants and PERSON were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the argument that the use at trial of answers given to the ORG inspectors automatically rendered the criminal proceedings unfair . It pointed out that ORG had expressly and unambiguously provided in the DATE Act that answers given to ORG inspectors may be admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings even though such admittance might override the privilege against self - incrimination .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment the court noted that the interviews with each of the accused \u201c formed a significant part of the prosecution case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the allegation that it was unfair that those interviewed by ORG inspectors should be treated less favourably than those interviewed by the police under PACE , the court noted as follows :", "\u201c ... the unravelling of complex and devious transactions in those fields is particularly difficult and those who enjoy the immunities and privileges afforded by LAW and the Companies Acts must accept the need for a regime of stringent scrutiny especially where fraud is suspected ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relation to the argument that the difference between LAW and LAW regimes was anomalous , the prosecution contended that :", "\u201c ... the explanation lies in the very different regime of interviews by ORG inspectors compared with that of interviews either by police or the ORG [ ORG ] . ORG inspectors are investigators ; unlike the police or ORG they are not prosecutors or potential prosecutors . Here , typically , the CARDINAL inspectors were a Queen 's Counsel and a senior accountant . They are bound to act fairly , and to give anyone they propose to condemn or criticise a fair opportunity to answer what is alleged against them . ... Usually , the interviewee will be represented by lawyers and he may be informed in advance of the points to be raised . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held on this point :", "\u201c Whether or not these matters constitute a sufficient explanation and whether or not the distinction is ' an anomaly ' , the fact remains that the distinction exists because ORG has created it . When enacting section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , it would have been open to ORG to have amended section PERSON ) of LAW and other similar provisions so as to bring them into line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Their decision not to do so was no oversight . This is clear from the speech of PERSON during the passage of the DATE Bill ... He said the Government had deliberately not followed in that PERSON the precedent in the Companies legislation on this very issue ... ORG has made its intentions quite clear in section PERSON ) . It can not be right for a judge to exercise his discretion to exclude evidence of interviews simply on the ground that ORG ought not to have countenanced the possibility of self - incrimination ... However , ... a judge can , in our view , as part of the background setting , have in mind that under that [ statutory ] regime there is an obligation to answer the inspectors ' questions on pain of sanctions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also rejected an allegation that there had been an abuse of process in that the ORG inspectors were used wrongly as \u201c evidence gatherers \u201d for the prosecution or that there had been improper or unfair \u201c collusion \u201d , as follows :", "\u201c We have carefully considered the effect of the events of DATE in the light of all the documents . We conclude that to allow the inspectors to continue their inquiry and to bring in the police only in DATE was a proper course subject to CARDINAL essentials :", "( CARDINAL ) That the inspectors were left to conduct their inquiries and interviews independently without instruction , briefing or prompting by the prosecuting authority . We are quite satisfied that the inspectors themselves made that clear and abided by it . Counsel also laid down those ground rules correctly and they were observed ...", "( CARDINAL ) That the interviews were conducted fairly and unobjectionably . It was not suggested to the trial judge or before us that the inspectors could be criticised on this score . These were carefully structured sessions of proper length in suitable conditions . The appellants , experienced business men of high intelligence , were each represented either by counsel ( usually ORG ) or a senior solicitor . The questions were put scrupulously fairly and the Code laid down in the PERSON case ... was observed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also rejected the allegation that non - disclosure prior to the trial of the material alleged to indicate abuse caused any unfairness to the applicants . It further rejected the second applicant 's complaint that there had been an improper delay in charging him . The court held :", "\u201c ... it has been argued that the documents which we have seen , or at least some of them , should have been disclosed at the trial . The [ applicants ] claim that they , by counsel , raised an issue as to the delay in bringing in the police ; that being so , disclosure should have been made . Instead a ORG [ ORG ] certificate ... was put before the judge . Again complaint is made that the judge did not look behind the ORG certificate and examine the documents himself ...", "... Upon a bare assertion that the police should have been brought in earlier , we do not consider that the [ applicants ] were entitled at trial to the cornucopia of privileged documents before us . The ORG certificate fairly and accurately summarised the principal documents to which it referred and we consider it was properly made . No party invited the judge to go behind it and examine the documents himself . At that time ORG had not laid down any guidelines requiring the judge to do so .", "In any event , having seen all the documents , we have ... reached the conclusion that there was no abuse of process or improper collusion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicants ' complaint on the non - disclosure of certain material by the prosecution . It concluded on this point :", "\u201c In the case of all CARDINAL appellants , whilst we have held that the undisclosed material should have been disclosed , we are satisfied that the procedural irregularity which occurred as a result of non - disclosure in fact occasioned no prejudice to them . The verdicts of the jury would inevitably have been the same had disclosure been made . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
