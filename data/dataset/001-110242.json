NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant applied for early retirement , after having worked for ORG . His DATE pension amounted to MONEY . The legislation in force at the time , namely PERSON no . CARDINAL on State military pensions , allowed early retirees from the armed forces to apply for jobs in both the public and private sector , the status of retiree and that of employee being compatible .", "On DATE the applicant was appointed by the mayor of ORG , a small town in GPE , to work as a head of department within ORG . His DATE salary amounted to MONEY , to which an additional allowance of PERCENT of his basic salary was paid on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , following the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on rationalisation of public expenditure , which introduced certain conditions for the concurrent receipt of a pension and of a ORG - paid salary ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant was notified by his employer that in view of the fact that his pension exceeded the national average gross salary of CARDINAL lei ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he was obliged to choose within DATE between having his pension suspended for the duration of his employment contract , or having the employment contract terminated .", "The applicant refused to make such a choice , allegedly considering that the legal provisions preventing him from receiving concomitantly a pension and a salary were unconstitutional and in breach of NORP legislation and of the human rights treaties .", "Consequently , on DATE the mayor issued a decision confirming that from DATE the applicant \u2019s appointment as head of department was revoked , pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contested the mayor \u2019s decision before ORG . He asked to be reinstated in his previous post and to be paid the corresponding salaries , retroactively , for the period since DATE . The applicant mainly claimed that the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL were in breach of LAW and of LAW , as they infringed his right to work and to have his possessions , namely DATE income , protected .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on DATE . It noted that the applicant did receive both a pension and a salary from a public institution , even though his pension exceeded the level of the national average gross salary , which was CARDINAL lei for DATE . Therefore , it held that section CARDINAL of Law no CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which had already been declared constitutional by ORG , was relevant to his situation and justified the termination of his employment in a public institution .", "Concerning the alleged breach of the applicant \u2019s right to work , the court held that he was still entitled to receive a salary if he were employed in the private sector ; furthermore , the contested measure was not discriminatory , since it applied equally to all persons that were in the same situation as that described in the legal instrument .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this judgment , invoking also a breach of his rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW CARDINAL of the Convention , Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL to LAW CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . His appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG . The court reiterated that the provisions of the disputed law had been declared constitutional by ORG , its decision being final and binding . In so far as the applicant \u2019s criticism of the law coincided with the arguments already assessed and taken into consideration by ORG in its reasoning , the court was bound to follow ORG approach . It followed that the mayor \u2019s decision to terminate the applicant \u2019s employment was lawful and in compliance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Law no CARDINAL/CARDINAL , concerning the reorganising of public authorities and institutions , rationalisation of public expenditure , provision of support for the business field and compliance with the agreements signed with ORG and ORG , came into force on DATE . Its chapter PERSON was dedicated to \u201c Measures regulating concurrent pension and salary entitlements , aimed at reducing public expenditure \u201d .", "DATE Anyone entitled to receive a pension , under either the ORG pension scheme or another pension scheme , who is also entitled to receive a salary pursuant to an employment contract or act of appointment within a public institution , whether national or local ... , shall be allowed to combine the pension with the salary if the pension received is lower than the national average gross salary , as validated by LAW .", "DATE The provisions of paragraph CARDINAL shall be applicable to persons who :", "( a ) at the time of the entry into force of this chapter , are retired and enjoy concurrent pension and salary entitlements ( pensionari cumularzi ) ;", "( b ) after the entry into force of this chapter , begin to enjoy concurrent pension and salary entitlements .", "CARDINAL \u2013 Persons who are retired and fall under the provisions of section PERSON ) ( b ) and who practise a profession pursuant to an employment contract or an act of appointment shall have an obligation , within DATE following the entry into force of this chapter , to express in writing their choice between having the payment of their pension suspended while they practise that profession or having their employment / appointment terminated , in the event that the amount of their net pension exceeds the national average gross salary , as validated by LAW ...", "Refusal to comply with the obligation to express a choice within the deadline set out in section CARDINAL ... shall constitute justification for the termination of employment , whether it was based on a contract or on an act of appointment .", "If the choice is expressed within the time - limit set out in section CARDINAL ... , the payment of the pension shall be suspended from DATE .", "Any payments received unduly shall be recovered from the retiree , in compliance with the general rules on the statute of limitations / negative prescription .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned provisions of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL have been subjected to the scrutiny of ORG , both before its promulgation ( pre - legislative review ) and after its entry into force ( postlegislative review ) , as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL NORP MPs seised ORG of a request for pre - legislative review of constitutionality concerning sections CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE , finding that the impugned legal texts were in compliance with LAW .", "While stating from the outset that the provisions of the impugned law could not apply to persons whose mandates were provided for by LAW ( for example , high - ranking officials ) , the court mainly stated , on the issue of concurrent pension and salary entitlements , that no constitutional provision prevented the legislature from prohibiting the concurrent receipt of both pension and salary , provided that such a measure was applied in an equal manner for all citizens , and that any potential differences in treatment were proved to have a legitimate aim . At the same time , the context in which the impugned measure was taken was an exceptional one , having regard to the global crisis on a financial and economic level .", "ORG further stated that the legislation allowed , as a rule , the concurrent receipt of pension and salary , if the pension was lower than a certain level ; the level taken into account was expressly prescribed by law , and was thus predictable and determinable , while at the same time reasonable . The exception to the rule of combining both incomes was justified by the exceptional economic circumstances and applied only to those who were employed or appointed in the public sector , for the purpose of rationalising public expenditure , while also securing a certain level of income DATE estimated as reasonable \u2013 for everyone . In so far as the measure applied equally to all those concerned by the legal instrument , it could not be regarded as discriminatory .", "In conclusion , the court held that the legislature had full discretionary power to institute such measures as imposing a certain level of secured income , in so far as they were reasonable , proportionate and justified by a public interest .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG was seised of several other complaints regarding the alleged unconstitutionality of sections CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL . In its decisions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , ORG upheld its previous reasoning and confirmed that the law was in compliance with LAW . At the same time , the court reiterated that the measure could not be regarded as discriminatory , in so far as the employees in the public sector were not in a similar situation to those working for private employers , essentially owing to the fact that their incomes were dependent on the ORG budget ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
