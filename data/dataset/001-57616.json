Over DATE , always with reference to current needs , further properties were removed from the sphere of freely negotiated rents , determined by supply and demand . A relaxation was followed by the re - introduction of tighter controls ( Rent LAW , ORG No . DATE ; LAW , ORG . PERSON ) , which led to a situation in which the legislature considered fundamental reform to be necessary .", "The legislature therefore restricted agreements on the basic rent for LOC covered by the new legislation generally to the amount regarded as reasonable with reference to the size , type , layout , location , fittings and condition of the LOC and for the sake of greater clarity laid down maximum limits for the most common types of apartments ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . At the same time , it regarded the fundamental aim of the transitional provisions as being to achieve the gradual and smoothest possible adjustment of existing leases to the new rules . In this connection , it was recognised that this adjustment would be at once the most problematic and at the same time the most urgent part of the transitional arrangements . ...", "...", "Undeniably this constitutes an interference with existing leases . Indeed this was the legislature \u2019s declared intention .", "In this connection it must not be overlooked that the obligation to pay rent for an apartment constitutes a continuing obligation and that in general such obligations are not entirely immune to certain adjustments and changes . ...", "Existing legal rights are not covered by the general protection afforded under LAW ( VfSlg [ FAC ORG ] CARDINAL/CARDINAL : \u2018 There is no provision in LAW which in principle prevents ordinary legislation from interfering with lawfully acquired rights\u2019 ) . The new provisions are entirely consistent with the legislative policy of bringing existing leases into line with the general system of the reform of the rent legislation and are intended to keep the hiatus between the old and new systems to the minimum . LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provide an appropriate mechanism for this adjustment . They also enable the landlord to receive PERCENT more rent than he could charge if the tenant gave notice and he had to re - let the apartment . These provisions are intended merely to prevent the sitting tenant from paying an \u2018 unduly high rent\u2019 in relation to what is considered the reasonable square metre rent , if he is unable or unwilling to terminate the lease and rent another apartment . As the tenant can terminate the lease at any time , the right to obtain the fully agreed rent is in fact limited to the effective duration of the lease . When drafting the transitional provisions in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the legislature was guided by the existing rules in LAW , which were already in force when the existing leases were entered into , and by the ideas underlying LAW ... , and , accordingly , allowed rent to be reduced to CARDINAL times the amount of the newly established reasonable rent ... . This power to take the initiative vested in the tenant must not be regarded in isolation but must be seen in the whole context of the new legislation . In granting it , the legislature has neither acted arbitrarily nor exceeded its powers . It has remained within the bounds of the freedom to form legislative policy which , in case of doubt , it must be assumed to have . To place too many limits on this freedom would lead to inflexibility with regard to legal situations and hamper innovations even where necessary .", "The possibility available to tenants of applying for a reduction in rent under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW is clearly disadvantageous to landlords who have concluded an agreement on the amount of rent to be paid by the tenant under existing legislation and now find that their confidence in the law has been misplaced . It should however be recognised that this is counterbalanced by a series of provisions as a result of which rent is no longer frozen at the DATE level ( e.g. section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . In addition the possibility of charging maintenance contributions under LAW of LAW is a measure which facilitates the adjustment of existing leases .", "Of course the new system may bring more disadvantages for some landlords and more advantages for others . However , at all events , it is merely a restriction on the right of property ( PERSON ) since the rent for a sitting tenant may still exceed the amount chargeable under the new legislation by PERCENT . The legislature may authorise an expropriation only if such a measure serves the public good and the general interest ( see , inter alia , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE ; DATE ) . LAW provides that an expropriation may be effected only if it is justified in the general interest ( see , inter alia , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE ) . Although the first sentence of LAW does indeed apply to restrictions on the right of property , the legislature can lay down such restrictions without fear of acting in breach of the LAW , provided that they do not threaten the very substance of the fundamental right to the inviolability of property or otherwise violate a constitutional principle binding on the legislature ( ORG ; CARDINAL etc ) . But this is not the case of the transitional provisions contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the act which were required by the public interest and for the common good , because they fit into the balanced structure designed to cater for the adjustment of the old system to the new one and are part of the necessary harmonisation leading to the desired objective . Under LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) to ORG , restrictions on the right of property must be in accordance with the general interest . In its decision of DATE ( G CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG confirmed the principle laid down in previous decisions that restrictions on the right of property which take account of these principles are not unconstitutional . \" ( ORG DATE , No .
