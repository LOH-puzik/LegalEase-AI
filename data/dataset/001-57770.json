Distressed by her feminine character , she suffered from attacks of nervous depression until DATE , when she was treated in hospital for DATE . The doctor who treated her from DATE observed a hypotrophy of the male genital organs and prescribed feminising hormone therapy , which rapidly brought about development of the breasts and feminisation of her appearance .
