The applicant was born in DATE and is currently being held in LOC ( GPE , ORG , GPE ) . Prior to his arrest , he was the leader of the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was expelled from GPE , where he had been living for DATE . He arrived DATE in GPE , where the NORP authorities asked him to leave NORP territory within TIME and refused his application for political asylum . On DATE the applicant travelled to GPE in an aircraft that had been chartered by the NORP secret services . His application for political asylum in GPE was accepted by the PERSON , but the NORP Prime Minister did not implement that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to GPE , where he made an application for political asylum . The NORP authorities initially detained him but subsequently placed him under house arrest . Although they refused to extradite him to GPE , they also rejected his application for refugee status and the applicant had to bow to pressure for him to leave GPE . After spending either CARDINAL or DATE in GPE , he returned to GPE , probably on DATE . The following day ( DATE ) , the applicant was taken to GPE . He was met at FAC by officials from the NORP embassy and accommodated at the ambassador 's residence . He lodged an application with the NORP ambassador for political asylum in GPE , but never received a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG announced that PERSON had been on board an aircraft that had landed in GPE on DATE and had entered NORP territory accompanied by NORP officials without declaring his identity or going through passport control . It added that the NORP Minister for ORG had summoned the NORP ambassador in GPE in order to elicit information about the applicant 's identity . After initially stating that the person concerned was not PERSON , on being pressed by the NORP authorities the NORP ambassador had gone on to acknowledge that it was in fact him . The NORP Minister for ORG had been informed by the NORP ambassador that the authorities in GPE had agreed to arrange for Mr ORG departure from GPE .", "The NORP Minister for ORG also stated that NORP diplomatic missions abroad had been the target of terrorist attacks and that the applicant 's presence in GPE constituted a major security risk . In those circumstances , the NORP government was surprised that GPE , a ORG with which it enjoyed friendly relations , could knowingly have put GPE in such a difficult position , exposing it to suspicion and the risk of attacks . Referring to the NORP ambassador 's role in the events , the NORP government indicated that it had serious reservations about his credibility and requested his immediate recall .", "The NORP Minister for ORG added that the NORP authorities had played no part in the applicant 's arrest and had had no say in the choice of his final destination . The Minister had not been informed of any operations by NORP forces at the time of the applicant 's departure and there had been no consultations between the NORP and NORP governments on the subject .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of his stay in GPE , the applicant was informed by the NORP ambassador after the latter had returned from a meeting with the NORP Minister for ORG that he was free to leave for the destination of his choice and that the GPE were prepared to accept him .", "On DATE NORP officials went to the NORP embassy to take PERSON to the airport . The NORP ambassador said that he wished to accompany the applicant to the airport in person and a discussion between the ambassador and the NORP officials ensued . In the end , the applicant got into a car driven by a NORP official . On the way to the airport , this car left the convoy and , taking a route reserved for security personnel in the international transit area of FAC , took him to an aircraft in which NORP officials were waiting for him . The applicant was then arrested after boarding the aircraft at TIME", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts had issued CARDINAL warrants for ORG arrest and a wanted notice ( Red Notice ) had been circulated by ORG . In each of those documents , the applicant was accused of founding an armed gang in order to destroy the territorial integrity of ORG and of instigating various terrorist acts that had resulted in loss of life .", "On the flight from GPE to GPE , the applicant was accompanied by an army doctor from the moment of his arrest . A video recording and photographs taken of PERSON in the aircraft for use by the police were leaked to the press and published . In the meantime , the inmates of \u0130mral\u0131 Prison were transferred to other prisons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was kept blindfolded throughout the flight except when the NORP officials wore masks . The blindfold was removed as soon as the officials put their masks on . According to the Government , the blindfold was removed as soon as the aircraft entered NORP airspace .", "The applicant was taken into custody at ORG on DATE . On the journey from the airport in GPE to FAC , he wore a hood . In photographs that were taken on the island of NORP in GPE , the applicant appears without a hood or blindfold . He later said that he had been given tranquillisers , probably at the NORP embassy in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the applicant was interrogated by members of the security forces . On DATE a judge ruled on the basis of information in the case file that he should remain in police custody for a further DATE as the interrogation had not been completed .", "CARDINAL . Judges and prosecutors from ORG arrived on the island of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL lawyers instructed by his family applied to ORG for permission to see him . They were informed verbally that only CARDINAL lawyer would be allowed access . Lawyers who went to GPE ( the embarkation point for the island of ORG ) on DATE were told by the administrative authorities that they could not visit the applicant . The applicant also alleges that his lawyers were harassed by a crowd at the instigation of plain - clothes police officers or at least with their tacit approval .", "CARDINAL . As soon as the applicant 's detention began , the island of ORG was decreed a prohibited military zone . According to the applicant , the security arrangements in his case were managed by a \u201c crisis desk \u201d set up at GPE . It was the crisis desk that was responsible for granting lawyers and other visitors access to the applicant . According to the Government , special measures were taken to ensure the applicant 's safety . He had many enemies who might have been tempted to make an attempt on his life , and it was for security reasons that lawyers were searched .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG questioned the applicant and took a statement from him as an accused . The applicant told the prosecutor that he was the founder of the ORG and its current leader . Initially , his and the ORG 's aim had been to found an independent NORP State , but with the passage of time they had changed their objective and sought to secure a share of power for the NORP as a free people who had played an important role in the founding of the LOC . The applicant confessed that village guards were a prime target for the ORG . He also confirmed that the ORG had used violent methods against civilians , in particular from DATE onwards , but that he was personally opposed to such methods and had tried in vain to prevent their being used . He told the prosecutor that the warlords who wanted to seize power within the ORG had exerted part of their pressure on the NORP population ; some of these warlords had been tried and found guilty by the ORG and had been executed with his personal approval . He acknowledged that the NORP government 's estimate of the number of those killed or wounded as a result of the ORG 's activities was fairly accurate , that the actual number might even be higher , and that he had ordered the attacks as part of the armed struggle being waged by the ORG . He added that he had decided in DATE to declare a ceasefire , acting on a request by the NORP President , PERSON , which had been conveyed to him by the NORP leader PERSON . The applicant also told the prosecutor that after leaving GPE on DATE he had gone first to GPE and then to GPE and GPE . When the latter CARDINAL countries refused to grant him the status of political refugee , he had been taken to GPE by the NORP secret services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before a judge of ORG , who ordered that he should be detained pending trial . The applicant did not apply to ORG to have that decision set aside . Before the judge he repeated the statement he had made to the prosecutor . He said that decisions taken within the ORG were submitted to him as founder and leader of the organisation for final approval . In the period from DATE , the ORG 's activities had been political . In DATE and DATE , the ORG had organised armed attacks on the a\u011falar ( major landowners ) . In DATE , following a visit by the applicant to GPE , the ORG had begun its paramilitary preparations . Since DATE , the ORG had carried on an armed struggle within GPE . The regional leaders decided on armed actions and the applicant confirmed the general plan for such actions . He had taken the strategic and tactical decisions for the organisation as a whole . The units had carried out the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE after the applicant 's arrival in GPE , his NORP lawyer , Mr PERSON , asked to visit him . He was prevented by members of the security forces from leaving the premises of ORG and was subsequently arrested together with CARDINAL other lawyers .", "CARDINAL . At FAC on DATE , PERSON , PERSON and their partner Mr PERSON were refused leave to enter GPE to visit the applicant , on the grounds that they could not represent him in GPE and that PERSON past history ( she was suspected of having campaigned against GPE 's interests and of having taken part in meetings organised by the ORG ) created a risk of prejudice to public order in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was able to talk to CARDINAL of the QUANTITY lawyers who had asked to see him , Mr PERSON and Mr H. GPE . The first conversation took place in the presence of a judge and of members of the security forces wearing masks . The latter decided that it should not last longer than TIME . The record of that conversation was handed over to ORG . The applicant 's other representatives were given leave to have their authority to act before the ORG signed and to see their client later .", "CARDINAL . During the preliminary investigation DATE , when the applicant was arrested , and DATE , when the trial began , the applicant had CARDINAL meetings in private with his lawyers . The dates and duration of the meetings were as follows : DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) and DATE ( TIME ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , his conversations with his lawyers were monitored from behind glass panels and filmed with a video camera . After the first CARDINAL short visits , the applicant 's contact with his lawyers was restricted to CARDINAL visits per week , lasting TIME each . On each visit , the lawyers were searched CARDINAL times and required to fill in a very detailed questionnaire . He and his advisers were not allowed to exchange documents or take notes at their meetings . The applicant 's representatives were unable to give him either a copy of his case file ( other than the bill of indictment , which was served by the prosecution ) or any other material that would allow him to prepare his defence .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , no restrictions were placed on the applicant as regards either the number of visits by his lawyers or their duration . Apart from the first visit , which took place under the supervision of a judge and members of the security forces , the meetings were held subject to the restrictions provided for in LAW . In order to ensure their safety , the lawyers were taken to the island of ORG by boat after embarking at a private quay . Hotel rooms were booked for them near the embarkation point . According to the Government , no restrictions were placed on the applicant 's correspondence .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , delegates of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) visited PERSON . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the representatives of the Government , they indicated that the applicant was physically in good health and his cell was comfortable . The ORG drew the ORG 's attention to the fact that the applicant 's solitary confinement and his limited access to the open air could affect him psychologically .", "CARDINAL . The ORG delegates next visited PERSON , where the applicant is the sole inmate , as part of their mission to GPE from DATE . The delegates found that the cell occupied by the applicant was large enough to accommodate a prisoner and equipped with a bed , table , armchair and bookshelves . It also had an air - conditioning system , washing and toilet facilities and a window overlooking an inner courtyard . The applicant had access to books , newspapers and a radio , but not to television programmes or a telephone . However , he received twice DATE medical checks by doctors and , in principle , was visited by his lawyers once DATE .", "CARDINAL . On its visit of DATE , the ORG noted that visits to the applicant by his lawyers and members of his family were often cancelled owing to adverse weather conditions and inadequate means of transport .", "CARDINAL . In a bill of indictment preferred on DATE ( and joined to several others that had been drawn up in the applicant 's absence by various public prosecutors ' offices DATE ) , the public prosecutor at ORG accused the applicant of activities carried out for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory . He sought the death penalty under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The case file ran to CARDINAL pages and had been prepared by joining the files in CARDINAL sets of proceedings that were pending against the applicant in various national security courts . The applicant 's lawyers were given access to the case file and the bill of indictment on DATE . Since the judicial authorities had not been able to supply a copy of the file , the applicant 's lawyers had brought their own photocopier and finished copying the file on DATE . The prosecution had omitted to include certain documents in it , such as those concerning the applicant 's arrest in GPE and his transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL hearings , held in GPE on DATE and DATE in the applicant 's absence , were taken up with procedural matters , such as third - party applications to intervene in the proceedings or the measures to be taken in readiness for the hearings on the island of ORG and to enable the parties to take part in and members of the public to attend the trial . According to the ORG , allegations that the lawyers were harassed by the police when they emerged from the first hearing in GPE on DATE have been the subject of a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE , ORG held CARDINAL hearings attended by the applicant on the island of ORG . The applicant told the court , among other things , that he stood by his statements to the prosecutor and the judge . He confirmed that he was the most senior ORG agent and leader of the organisation and that he had instructed the members of the organisation to carry out certain acts . He said that he had not been ill - treated or verbally abused since his arrest . The applicant 's representatives argued that ORG could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of LAW . The applicant stated that , for his part , he accepted the court 's jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant said that he was willing to cooperate with ORG in order to bring to an end the acts of violence associated with the NORP question and promised to halt the ORG 's armed struggle . He indicated that he wished to \u201c work for peace and fraternity and achieve that aim within GPE \u201d . He observed that , while he had initially envisaged an armed struggle for the independence of the population of NORP origin , that had been in reaction to the political pressure the government had exerted on the NORP population . When circumstances changed , he had decided on a different approach and limited his demands to autonomy or to a recognition of the NORP ' cultural rights within a NORP society . He accepted political responsibility for the ORG 's general strategy , but disclaimed criminal liability for acts of violence which went beyond the ORG 's stated policy . In order to highlight the rapprochement between the ORG and the government , he applied to have the government officials who had conducted negotiations with the ORG examined as witnesses for the defence . That application was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's lawyers ' applications for the communication of additional documents or for further investigations in order to collect more evidence were refused by ORG on the ground that they were delaying tactics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyers complained to ORG about the restrictions and the difficulties they were having in conferring with their client . Their request to be permitted to confer with him during lunch breaks was accepted by ORG at a hearing on DATE .", "The lawyers did not appear at the hearing on DATE . At their request , transcripts of that hearing and copies of the documents placed in the file were given to them and the applicant on DATE . CARDINAL of the applicant 's counsel thanked ORG for having established a dispassionate atmosphere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution made their final submissions . They sought the death penalty for the applicant under LAW .", "The applicant 's advisers requested a DATE adjournment to enable them to prepare their final submissions . ORG granted them DATE , the statutory maximum allowed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE 's ORG amended LAW to exclude both military judges and military prosecutors from national security courts . Similar amendments were made on DATE to the law on national security courts .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , the judge who had been appointed to replace the military judge sat as a member of the trial court for the first time . ORG noted that the new judge had already read the file and the transcripts , in accordance with LAW , and had followed the proceedings from the outset and attended the hearings .", "Counsel for the applicant opposed the appointment of the civilian judge owing to his previous involvement in the case . Their application for an order requiring him to stand down was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing , counsel for the applicant set out the applicant 's substantive defence to the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing the applicant 's final representations , ORG found the applicant guilty of carrying out acts designed to bring about the secession of part of GPE 's territory and of training and leading a gang of armed terrorists for that purpose . It sentenced him to death under LAW . It found that the applicant was the founder and principal leader of the organisation , whose aim was to detach a part of the territory of GPE so as to form a NORP State with a political regime based on NORP - Leninist ideology . ORG found that it had been established that , following decisions taken by the applicant and on his orders and instructions , the ORG had carried out several armed attacks , bomb attacks , acts of sabotage and armed robberies , and that in the course of those acts of violence CARDINAL of civilians , soldiers , police officers , village guards and public servants had been killed . The court did not accept that there were mitigating circumstances allowing the death penalty to be commuted to life imprisonment , having regard , among other things , to the very large number and the seriousness of the acts of violence , the CARDINAL of deaths caused by them , including those of children , women and old people , and the major , pressing threat to the country that those acts posed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against the above judgment , which , on account of the severity of the sentence , was in any event automatically subject to review by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment adopted on CARDINAL DATE and delivered on DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of DATE in every respect . It held that the replacement of the military judge by a civilian judge during the trial did not require the earlier procedural steps to be taken again given that the new judge had followed the proceedings from the beginning and that the law itself required that the proceedings should continue from the stage they had reached at the time of the replacement . ORG also pointed out that ORG was empowered by law to hold its hearings outside the area of its territorial jurisdiction on security grounds , among other reasons .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , ORG had regard to the fact that the applicant was the founder and president of the ORG . It referred to the latter 's aim and activities , namely that it sought the foundation of a NORP State on a territory that GPE should be made to cede after an armed struggle and to that end carried out armed attacks and sabotage against the armed forces , industrial LOC and tourist facilities in the hope of weakening the authority of the ORG . The ORG also had a political front ( the ERNK ) and a military wing ( the ORG ) , which operated under its control . Its income was derived mainly from \u201c taxes \u201d , \u201c fines \u201d , donations , subscriptions , and the proceeds of armed robberies , gun - running and drug trafficking . According to ORG , the applicant led all CARDINAL of these groups . In his speeches at party conferences , in his radio and television appearances and in the orders he had given to his activists , the applicant had instructed his supporters to resort to violence , indicated combat tactics , imposed penalties on those who did not obey his instructions and incited the civilian population to put words into action . As a result of the acts of violence carried out by the ORG from DATE until the applicant 's arrest ( in all , CARDINAL armed attacks , CARDINAL bomb attacks , CARDINAL armed robberies and CARDINAL kidnappings ) , CARDINAL civilians , CARDINAL soldiers , QUANTITY police officers and CARDINAL village guards had died .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the ORG , founded and led by the applicant , represented a substantial , serious and pressing threat to the country 's integrity . It ruled that the acts of which the applicant was accused constituted the offence laid down in LAW and that it was not necessary , in order for that provision to apply , for the applicant \u2013 the founder and president of the ORG and the instigator of the acts of violence committed by that organisation DATE personally to have used a weapon .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , LAW was amended so that the death penalty could no longer be ordered or implemented other than in time of war or of imminent threat of war , or for acts of terrorism .", "By PERSON no . CARDINAL , which was published on DATE , ORG resolved , inter alia , to abolish the death penalty in peacetime ( that is to say except in time of war or of imminent threat of war ) and to make the necessary amendments to the relevant legislation , including LAW . As a result of the amendments , a prisoner whose death sentence for an act of terrorism has been commuted to life imprisonment must spend the rest of his life in prison .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG commuted the applicant 's death sentence to life imprisonment . It ruled that the offences under LAW of which the applicant had been accused had been committed in peacetime and constituted terrorist acts .", "ORG ( ORG \u2013 PERSON ) , a political party with representatives in ORG , applied to ORG for an order setting aside certain provisions of PERSON no . MONEY , including the provision abolishing the death penalty in peacetime for persons found guilty of terrorist offences . ORG dismissed that application in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Before the LAW was amended on DATE , Article CARDINAL provided that national security courts were to be composed of a president , CARDINAL other full members and CARDINAL substitute members . The president of the national security court , CARDINAL of the full members and CARDINAL of the substitute members were to be civilian judges , and the other full member and substitute member were to be military judges .", "CARDINAL . As amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , LAW provides :", "\u201c ...

Appointments shall be made for DATE by ORG , in accordance with procedures laid down in special legislation . Their terms of office shall be renewable ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

By the terms of provisional LAW no . CARDINAL , the terms of office of the military judges and military prosecutors in service in the national security courts were to end on the date of publication of that PERSON ( DATE ) .

CARDINAL ) the ORG observed that the application and imposition of capital punishment are governed by the principle that ' [ n]o one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life ' . Both LAW require strict observance of legal procedure and limit application of this penalty to ' the most serious crimes ' . In both instruments , therefore , there is a marked tendency toward restricting application of the death penalty and ultimately abolishing it .", "CARDINAL . This tendency , evident in other inter - NORP and universal instruments , translates into the internationally recognised principle whereby those GPE that still have the death penalty must , without exception , exercise the most rigorous control for observance of judicial guarantees in these cases .
