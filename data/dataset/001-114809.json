NORP The applicant , Mr F.A.K. , is a NORP national whose date of birth is stated as DATE . The President of the Section decided of his own motion to grant the applicant anonymity ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) and confidentiality of the case file documents ( Rule CARDINAL of ORG ) . He is resident in the GPE . His profession is given on the application form as imam . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. PERSON , and Deputy Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant applied for asylum in DATE . He was questioned about the reasons for his asylum request on DATE and gave the following account :", "The applicant gave his name as PERSON , born in DATE . He had travelled on a forged passport in the name of N.A.A. He had been a soldier from DATE until DATE . He had been trained for DATE at a military academy whose name he refused to divulge , such information being a military secret , passing out with the rank of corporal . In DATE he had been promoted to second lieutenant . He claimed to have been recruited as a member of ORG - al - Wattaniyya Libiya Li - l - Ingad ( Libyan National Liberation Front ) after his promotion to commissioned rank , by a colleague from his military academy DATE ; in this capacity he had distributed pamphlets in barracks . In DATE , following a failed coup attempt against the PERSON regime , he had gone into hiding ; during this time his house had been raided and searched by armed men who had taken all official documents with them . He had had no trouble leaving GPE because his brother was a member of the NORP border police . He had flown to GPE via GPE and GPE . He had met a NORP man in an GPE train station who had given him shelter and lodging until DATE , after which he had gone to GPE and applied for asylum . It had been this NORP who had advised the applicant to lodge an asylum request , it being impossible to obtain a regular residence permit . According to the report of the interview , the applicant was able more or less to describe the functioning of a PERSON rifle but did not know its calibre , and he was quite unable to describe any service pistol .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) gave a decision declaring the applicant \u2019s asylum request inadmissible on formal grounds . The applicant had produced no valid border - crossing document , having travelled on a forged passport ; and he had failed to report \u201c without delay \u201d after entering the country , having awaited DATE . A residence permit on humanitarian grounds was likewise refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an administrative objection ( bezwaarschrift ) on DATE . Since the objection did not have suspensive effect , he also submitted a request to the competent tribunal for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) aimed at securing a stay of expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister lodged a written statement in reply . It was stated that the applicant had not told the truth : a GPE visa in the name of N.A.A. had been requested at the GPE embassy in GPE by a man who had submitted a passport photograph remarkably similar to that contained in the passport the applicant had travelled on . Likewise , the applicant had stated that he had sought asylum on the advice of the NORP man who had told him that he would not succeed in getting a job and a regular residence permit . Moreover , it was admitted that the applicant \u2019s wife had sought a GPE visa , and travelled , under her own name . The airline ticket which the applicant had submitted did not correspond to the journey which he had allegedly made from GPE , and the applicant had not been able to offer proof of his military career . It was unlikely that the applicant had been involved in the coup attempt , since it had been betrayed and all the plotters were known to have been arrested .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch , on DATE . The applicant was allowed DATE to prove that he was PERSON , as he claimed , not N.A.A.", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE refusing to order the suspension of the applicant \u2019s expulsion . It found that the applicant had not submitted the required proof of his identity . At all events , he had admitted that he had taken the advice of the NORP man to seek asylum rather than a regular residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted to the Deputy Minister a letter from ORG ) dated DATE . This letter gives the applicant \u2019s name as ORG , ORG or ORG , depending on the transcription from LANGUAGE . It was admitted that the applicant had used an alias . It was stated that he had done so for fear that other speakers of LANGUAGE would betray him to the NORP secret service . He had neglected to tell his lawyer this , which he now acknowledged had been a mistake .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied to ORG for a suspension of his expulsion . He now gave his name as ORG ; the interrogating official was to blame for the mistaken mention of the name PERSON in the report of the interview on DATE . He also submitted various identity documents in the name , variously , of ORG and ORG As translated , these included a card with a passport photograph naming ORG as a deserter with effect from DATE ; an identity card in the name of ORG giving his profession as \u201c manual labourer \u201d ; an identity card naming ORG as \u201c a staff officer and a soldier \u201d ; an undated official report of the loss of a driving license in the name of ORG ; and a marriage certificate recording the marriage of ORG with ORG on CARDINAL DATE and the birth of their child on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection on the grounds stated in the statement of defence of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal well - founded . It noted the absence , in the decision appealed against , of any reference to the letter of CARDINAL DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and took the view that the applicant \u2019s account of the circumstances of his flight from GPE was not prima facie lacking in credibility .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister remitted the applicant \u2019s case to ORG ( PERSON voor vreemdelingenzaken ) , which heard the applicant and his wife on DATE . The applicant \u2019s wife stated that the applicant had always been an army officer , not a manual labourer . She and her husband had fled to GPE DATE after their home had been raided by the authorities . The papers recently submitted had been forwarded by her father - in - law . The applicant stated that his name had been taken down wrong by the interviewing official , in the absence of an interpreter ; the official had told him that it was no longer possible to correct it and that he , the applicant , would be in trouble if an attempt were made to do so . As regards the raid on his home , the applicant had driven past as it was in progress ; suspecting that the authorities were waiting to arrest him , he had driven on and gone into hiding . ORG decided to adjourn its hearing in order for the applicant \u2019s identity to be established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE experts of ORG ( ORG \u2013 the police force entrusted with guarding the borders ) reported that the passport the applicant had submitted was a forgery , the photograph having been replaced .", "CARDINAL . A letter dated DATE states that the applicant was involved in ORG of DATE . The letter is signed \u201c ORG \u201d . It bears an illegible signature without a name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed its hearing in sub - committee . The applicant gave his name as ORG The passport had belonged to the applicant \u2019s cousin PERSON , who looked like the applicant , and who had also applied for the visa . Confronted with the inconsistency of his having allegedly seen the raid on his home while having previously stated that he had been in hiding at the time ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant replied that he had driven on in a panic . After the raid he had spent TIME in his home from time to time , he did not remember precisely . The applicant \u2019s wife became unwell during the hearing and was unable to give pertinent answers to any questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife was granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted asylum in accordance with the so - called \u201c DATE policy \u201d ( driejarenbeleid ) , as in effect at the time , pursuant to which a residence title could be granted if a request for a residence permit had not been decided within DATE for reasons not imputable to the petitioner and provided that there were no contra - indications .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the entire family applied for GPE citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) produced a report specifically on the applicant . It had emerged that he had been appointed imam of a particular mosque , from where he preached jihad ( NORP holy war ) and martyrdom and called upon the faithful to resist NORP oppression . The autochthonous population of the GPE he described as pigs and dogs to be slaughtered . He was stated to show jihadist videos to young NORP . \u201c Unbelievers ( i.e. non - NORP ) , the autochthonous population and women \u201d were to be shunned . He refused to speak the NORP language and opposed integration . He had links to PERSON , or ORG , and jihadists based in the GPE including GPE ( the applicant in the case of NORP v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON \u2013 who at this time had taken the place and responsibilities of the Deputy Minister of Justice in matters concerning aliens ) announced her intention ( voornemen ) to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on the applicant . Mention was made of the ORG report and of inconsistencies found in the applicant \u2019s various statements made in the course of the asylum proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG ( PERSON ) had identified the applicant as a suspect of running a temporary employment agency that provided work to foreign nationals who did not possess the necessary work permit ( tewerkstellingsvergunning ) from a telephone shop and internet caf\u00e9 . An official police record dated DATE mentions forged identity documents but it seems that no further evidence of such dealings was found . However , known fundamentalists had been observed near the applicant \u2019s internet caf\u00e9 .", "CARDINAL . The same report contains a record of an interrogation of the applicant on DATE on suspicion of being a member of an organisation aiming to commit crimes for terrorist ends and recruiting persons for armed hostilities without royal permission . The applicant reportedly denied these charges : he stated that he had received religious training in GPE and espoused a tolerant form of ORG . Jihad , for him , was spiritual struggle against oneself . Accordingly , rather than inciting to violence , he had warned his congregation not to become involved with radical NORP whose religious views he condemned . The LAW information was therefore incorrect ; it probably emanated from NORP militants who had implicated him in order to deflect the unwanted attention of the authorities from themselves . He no longer ran the temporary employment agency , which had been unprofitable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a board of officials of ORG held a hearing in the matter of the applicant \u2019s application for GPE citizenship . The applicant did not turn up . Later a letter was found in which the applicant waived his right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister gave a decision withdrawing the applicant \u2019s asylum . She found that the applicant had not put forward any convincing evidence of a nature to contradict the ORG report . As to whether the applicant \u2019s expulsion to his home country would violate LAW , the applicant \u2019s failure to turn up for the hearing on CARDINAL DATE was mentioned ; moreover , the applicant had provided little evidence of the fate which he said awaited him in GPE , the story which he had spun at the time of his arrival in the GPE hardly being credible either .", "CARDINAL . The following day , DATE , the Minister announced her intention to deny the applicant GPE citizenship . The reasoning was derived primarily from the ORG report . In the alternative , it was stated that the applicant had not done enough to integrate into GPE society ; thus , an interpreter had been needed for a police interview on DATE ( no record of which has been submitted to ORG ) , which showed a lack of NORP language skills . Similarly , he had described the autochthonous population as \u201c pigs \u201d and \u201c dogs \u201d who would be \u201c slaughtered \u201d . It was also held against him that he had not bothered to turn up for the official hearing on DATE ; in so doing he had deprived himself of the opportunity to clarify matters .", "CARDINAL . The DATE the Minister issued an exclusion order based on the same grounds . In so far as it related to LAW , its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c In deciding whether or not the person concerned ( betrokkene , i.e. the applicant ) constitutes a danger to national security it has also been considered whether the exclusion order constitutes a violation of LAW ] . LAW CARDINAL of the LAW provides that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence . Pursuant to LAW there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others .", "It is considered that in view of what is set out above the exclusion order does not constitute a violation of the right to respect for family life as referred to in DATE .", "Given that the applicant \u2019s exclusion is ordered , he is denied the possibility to visit his family for a short time in the GPE ( ... ) . That being so , there is DATE as far as the exclusion order is concerned \u2013 an interference with the right referred to above .", "The interference is , however , justified in the interest of the protection of national security , an interest mentioned in [ LAW ] . After all , the person concerned constitutes \u2013 in view of the individual [ ORG ] report of DATE referred to above \u2013 a danger to national security . In so finding , the following is taken into account .", "The applicant states in his statement of points of view ( zienswijze ) that he has a wife and CARDINAL children , family members who have been legally resident in the country since DATE . That being so , there is family life between the person concerned , his partner and his children within the framework of LAW . Neither his wife nor his children have GPE nationality .", "If the interests at issue are weighed in the balance , it will be found in the instant case that it is reasonable to give greater weight to the general interest , which is served by the order excluding the person concerned , than to the personal interest of the person concerned which is served by the ability to exercise private or family life in this country with his wife and his CARDINAL children .", "In so doing , the so - called \u2018 guiding principles\u2019 [ LANGUAGE in the original ] taken from [ LOC v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX ] have been taken into consideration . These \u2018 guiding principles\u2019 have to be observed in considering whether a decision interfering with the right to family life is necessary in a democratic society .", "Observing these principles , the Minister has reached the conclusion that the interference is justified and does not contravene LAW . In this connection , the following is considered relevant .", "As is apparent from the above - mentioned individual official report by the ORG of DATE , it has appeared that the person concerned constitutes a danger to national security . Thus , it is stated DATE briefly summarised \u2013 in this report ( among other things ) that it has become known to the ORG from trustworthy sources that the person concerned has , in his sermons , called for resistance against the NORP oppressors ; that GPE nationals are described by him as \u2018 pigs and ORG ; that he has made pronouncements such as \u2018 we will slaughter the ORG ; that he has , in a private setting ( in huiselijke kring ) , shown jihadist videos to young NORP ; that he has encouraged jihad in his sermons ; that he has praised martyrdom ; and that he is in contact with , and maintains links with , ( international ) terrorist networks and organisations .", "What is stated about the person concerned in the said ORG report is so serious that the interest of national security must outweigh the interest of the person concerned in maintaining private or family life without interference .", "Prompted by the said individual report by the ORG , the Minister has concluded that the personal behaviour of the person concerned constitutes a present , actual and sufficiently serious threat ( een actuele , werkelijke en voldoende ernstige bedreiging ) , owing to which the person concerned should be denied residence in the GPE .", "There is no appearance of special circumstances of such a nature that the balancing exercise should lead to a different result in the present case . In this connection , the following is considered relevant .", "The Minister \u2019s refusal to allow the person concerned residence in the GPE does , however , prevent the continuation of family life ( familie- of gezinsleven ) between the person concerned , his wife and their CARDINAL children as it currently exists in this country . However , although the person concerned and his wife currently have an indefinite residence permit on an asylum basis ( vergunning tot verblijf asiel ) , they have never held a residence permit delivered on the basis of genuine ( daadwerkelijk ) refugee status in the sense of the [ DATE ORG relating to LAW , \u2018 the DATE Convention\u2019 ] and they have never had the status of refugee within the meaning of [ the DATE ] Convention . Even so , the advisory opinion of ORG of DATE [ containing the advice ] not to admit the applicant and his wife to the GPE as refugees but to award him [ sic ] a residence permit in connection with the so - called DATE policy has led to the delivery of unrestricted residence permits to the applicant and his wife . The residence permit ... was eventually transformed into an indefinite residence permit . Since the lapse of time had arisen in the asylum procedure , it was merely administered by us as an indefinite \u2018 asylum\u2019 residence permit .", "The applicant and his wife have DATE in view of DATE never entered into or been in the possession of a residence permit because they were refugees . It is true , however , ... that an indefinite asylum residence permit may constitute an objective impediment . The person concerned and his wife are thereby prevented from obtaining a GPE travel document which would allow them to travel to GPE ( their country of origin ) . Nonetheless , the person concerned , his wife and his ( minor ) children DATE in view of the above findings on refugee status \u2013 turn to the authorities of GPE ( their country of origin ) for a travel document . There is no appearance of any impediment in this respect . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted his statement of points of view against the intention to deny him GPE citizenship on DATE . On DATE he also lodged an appeal against the withdrawal of asylum , at the same time applying for a stay of expulsion . On DATE he lodged an objection against the exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted the grounds underlying his objection against the exclusion order on CARDINAL or DATE . He appended some sermons which he had given in DATE , giving his exegesis of the concept of jihad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the grounds for his appeal against the withdrawal of asylum and his application for a stay of expulsion . These were largely identical to those submitted in response to the exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection against the refusal of GPE citizenship . The main reason was that since the applicant \u2019s asylum status had been withdrawn , and since an exclusion order was in force , he was no longer lawfully resident in the GPE . For the remainder , she relied essentially on the ORG report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the State ( Landsadvocaat ) wrote to ORG informing it that the Minister had decided not to expel the applicant pending the outcome of the appeal against the exclusion order . He added that the applicant was not suspected of oppositional activities against the NORP leadership .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE a hearing before officials of ORG took place in the matter of the applicant \u2019s objection against the exclusion order . The applicant continued to insist that he preached a peaceful message , although perhaps some of his sermons might have been misinterpreted . He also claimed to have been filmed taking part in a demonstration in GPE protesting against a visit by the NORP leader Colonel PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against the refusal to grant his entire family citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing on DATE , the Provisional Measures Judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , decided to order the suspension of the exclusion order given that the applicant \u2019s expulsion was not imminent but the applicant nonetheless committed a criminal act by remaining in the country .", "CARDINAL . The very DATE the Minister gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s objection against the exclusion order . This decision was largely based on the ORG report , whose credibility the applicant had not managed to undermine . Absent proof of the applicant \u2019s participation in the demonstration in GPE , there was no evidence to suggest that the applicant was wanted by the NORP authorities , and hence no relevant risk for purposes of LAW ; moreover , although it was true that the applicant had been convicted of no crime , he remained a danger to society in the GPE and could be required to return to GPE , exercising his right to respect for his family life in that country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the withdrawal of asylum . It found that the appeal had become devoid of purpose , the exclusion order implying that it was not possible for the applicant to be lawfully resident in the GPE anyway .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing that ORG had failed to go into his complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . It agreed that ORG had failed to rule on the applicant \u2019s Convention complaints . However , these could be addressed in the proceedings concerning the exclusion order ; there was therefore no reason to allow the appeal , which was dismissed as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , held a hearing in the matter of the exclusion order on DATE . It delivered its decision on DATE , dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal . Having studied the documents on which the ORG report was based , ORG found the report credible and dismissed the suggestion that the applicant was at risk in the event of his return to GPE ; there was thus no issue under LAW . As to the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his family life , in so far as it was guaranteed by LAW , national security carried greater weight .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal with ORG , arguing not only that his removal to GPE would constitute violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL but also that the failure of the Minister to take cognisance of the information on which the ORG report was based , and the failure to allow him access to that material , violated LAW taken together with ORG and CARDINAL respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . It dismissed the applicant\u2019 suggestion that the Minister ought to have taken cognisance of the raw data used by the ORG to prepare its report , finding it sufficient that ORG had done so , and that it had done so itself . It then found it established in previous judicial decisions that the applicant \u2019s account of his military career and flight from GPE lacked credibility and that moreover the applicant \u2019s brother - in - law appeared able to travel to and from that country with no apparent difficulty . Letters and testimonials purportedly emanating from NORP opposition organisations gave no specific information as to either the applicant \u2019s actions , nor as to whether the applicant had attracted the active interest of the NORP authorities . As regards DATE , ORG referred to the ORG report and the information on which it was based ; taking these into account , it found no reason to overturn the decision of ORG . It went on to hold that the Minister had ruled , not without good cause , that the interference with the applicant \u2019s rights was justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regime of Colonel PERSON was overthrown in DATE . On DATE Colonel PERSON himself was captured and killed . ORG , the internationally recognised interim authority , declared the country liberated DATE . Parliamentary elections were held in DATE .", "CARDINAL .
