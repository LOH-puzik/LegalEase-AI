THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Brought promptly before judge or other officer;Conditional release)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The third applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and third applicants were arrested under section CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a police officer on DATE . They were detained at GPE police station on DATE . The first applicant was interviewed twice on DATE and once on DATE ; the third applicant was interviewed CARDINAL times on DATE and once on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of Public Prosecutions ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) made applications to ORG under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule QUANTITY for warrants of further detention in respect of both applicants in order to carry out questioning and to conduct forensic examinations . The first applicant gave evidence on oath in the course of the hearing . Following the hearing , the ORG Judge granted warrants authorising a DATE extension of detention .", "CARDINAL . Each of the applicants was interviewed on QUANTITY occasions in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made applications to ORG under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act for DATE extensions to the periods specified in the warrants for further detention . The extensions were sought in order to facilitate further questioning of the applicants once the results of additional forensic tests were obtained . At separate hearings on CARDINAL DATE a police Superintendent gave evidence on oath as to the necessity of the extensions and arguments were heard on behalf of the first and third applicants .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearings Her Honour Judge PERSON delivered a written judgment in respect of the first applicant and an ex tempore decision in respect of the third applicant . She granted both applications , authorising the first applicant \u2019s continued detention until CARDINAL on DATE and the third applicant \u2019s continued detention until CARDINAL on DATE . In her reasoning , Judge PERSON noted that the relevant forensic evidence was central to the investigation and that the investigation was being carried out diligently and expeditiously .", "CARDINAL . In the rulings Judge PERSON considered whether LAW or LAW gave the court deciding whether or not to grant an extension of detention an express or implied power to examine the lawfulness of the arrest or to grant bail . She concluded that it did not as LAW only gave the judge the power to decide whether or not an extension of detention was necessary . Consequently , she had to confine herself to the issue of whether or not it was necessary to extend detention beyond TIME for investigative purposes and any issue as to the lawfulness of the arrest would have to be determined by ORG in either Habeas Corpus or judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was arrested under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act on suspicion of involvement in the murder of CARDINAL soldiers at GPE , GPE , on DATE . He was detained at FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an application to ORG under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule QUANTITY for a warrant extending the second applicant \u2019s detention as the results of a number of forensic tests were pending .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE a ORG Judge granted a warrant authorising a DATE extension to his detention .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was interviewed on CARDINAL occasions in DATE . However , neither the interviews nor the results of the forensic tests provided any evidence linking the second applicant to the murders of the CARDINAL soldiers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an application to ORG under paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act for a DATE extension to the period specified in the warrant for further detention . The extension was sought as the results of further forensic tests which had been sent for analysis to a laboratory in GPE were expected to become available within DATE and detention was considered necessary to ensure that further questioning could take place and , if there was sufficient evidence , charges could be brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON granted the application , authorising the second applicant \u2019s continued detention until MONEY DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought permission to apply for judicial review of Judge PERSON \u2019s decisions of CARDINAL and DATE granting further extensions to the warrants authorising their detention . They submitted first , that Judge PERSON had been wrong to conclude that a court , in deciding whether or not to grant an extension of detention , was precluded from investigating the lawfulness of the arrest ; secondly , that the judge had failed to address the question of whether the detention of the applicants was required while the results of the forensic examinations were expected ; thirdly that the judge had failed to give reasons for her decision that detention was required ; and finally , that Schedule CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by the High Court of GPE on DATE and ORG heard the applications on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicants\u2019 first submission , ORG held that DATE and DATE of Schedule QUANTITY had to be read in conformity with the requirements of LAW as explained in the jurisprudence of the ORG . Thus , the review of the lawfulness of the detention had to embrace an examination of the basis of the arrest , otherwise a person could be detained under LAW for up to QUANTITY days without there having been any judicial review of the lawfulness of the original arrest and that could not be Convention compliant . ORG therefore found that Judge PERSON had been wrong to disavow any review of the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 arrest and , as a consequence , her decision to grant extensions had to be quashed . The court accepted , however , that a review of the lawfulness of the arrest need not involve a detailed analysis of the basis for the decision to arrest and should reflect the constraints that necessarily apply in many arrests for terrorist offences .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicants\u2019 second and third submissions , ORG found that although the judge had not focused directly on whether the applicants had to be detained rather than released pending the outcome of the remaining forensic examinations , she had not failed to have regard to the need for detention as the basis for the grant of the warrant . Moreover , although her reasons were pithily stated , they were sufficient to convey to the applicants the basis of her decision .", "CARDINAL . Consideration of the applicants\u2019 fourth submission , namely the compatibility of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act with LAW , was adjourned . In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG of GPE found no basis for the submission that Schedule CARDINAL was incompatible with LAW . In particular , the court held that although there was no doubt that the \u201c competent legal authority \u201d referred to in LAW ) was the authority having competence to deal with a criminal charge ( the Magistrate in the GPE ) , in GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL and PERSON v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALX the ORG had made it clear that the function of \u201c a judge or other officer \u201d for the purposes of LAW could be carried out by an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and did not necessarily have to be a person with power to conduct the trial of any eventual criminal charge ; that , although there was no express power to order release in LAW as required by LAW , such a power must be implied ; that , as paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act provided that there must be reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of a person was necessary , it therefore contained a requirement of proportionality ; that , there was no provision for conditional release on bail within the statutory scheme , an issue which did not arise in the present case but would need to be addressed in any future case in which it arose ; that , although paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL enabled a judicial authority to exclude an applicant or anyone representing him from any part of the hearing and paragraph CARDINAL permitted information to be withheld from the applicant or anyone representing him , there were a range of tools available to the court to preserve to the necessary extent an adversarial procedure and equality of arms ; and , finally , that there was no authority which supported the ORG contention that LAW that a detained person should be charged well before the expiry of the twentyeight day period contemplated in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE certified that it was satisfied that the decision given on DATE involved the following points of law of general public importance :", "\u201c ( a ) Whether paragraphs ORG ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of Part III of Schedule CARDINAL to LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) permitting extended detention for DATE are compatible with the PERSON \u2019s rights under LAW , PERSON ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( \u201c the Convention \u201d )", "If compliance with LAW can only be achieved by providing for a detainee to be brought before a judicial authority ( i ) other than the Magistrate \u2019s Court and ( ii ) without any charges having been preferred against him ;", "If Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Convention are required to be read together as linked provisions and understood as creating a scheme so that the \u201c judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power \u201d referred to in LAW and \u201c the competent legal authority \u201d referred to in LAW are one and the same ;", "If the \u201c judicial authority \u201d provided for in Schedule CARDINAL to the LAW is the \u201c judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power \u201d within the meaning of LAW ;", "If Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW can not be interpreted in such a way as to permit the detention of a suspect without charge for any period specified by ORG , subject only to the requirement of periodic judicial approval of the kind specified in LAW .", "( b ) Whether the absence of a power to allow for conditional release on bail rendered the scheme for extending detention set out in Part III of Schedule CARDINAL incompatible with Article CARDINAL ORG ; and", "( c ) Whether the procedure for granting an extension of detention , in circumstances where the suspect and legal representative have been excluded by the judge for a part of the hearing ( as per Schedule CARDINAL , para CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) and by reason of same information is made available to the judge but withheld from the suspect and his legal representative , ( Schedule CARDINAL , para GPE ) and ( CARDINAL ) is incompatible with the request for an adversarial hearing as required by LAW in light of Secretary of ORG for ORG ( ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
