It scrutinised the judgments made in the civil action lodged by PERSON and the results of the inquiry of the prosecutor \u2019s office ( of DATE ) and came to the conclusion that the facts related in the article were untrue . The court found no evidence that Mr Tkach , in his professional capacity , had exercised any undue influence on the courts . The court held :", "\u201c Therefore , having examined the evidence and assessed the contents of the article as a whole , including its title \u2018 Evil Flat of Prosecutor DATE , and having regard to the fact how a reasonable member of the society would perceive this message , the court comes to the conclusion that the author \u2019s account of the essence of the civil dispute and the author \u2019s expressed opinion do not reflect the actual situation .", "The word sequences and semantic units in the text , designated by the plaintiff V.N.Tkach , fall within the ambit of the concept of \u2018 untrue information\u2019 . The substantial and semantic contents of the texts in question also infringe the legally protected rights and interests of the plaintiff , in particular , his professional reputation .", "Under these circumstances the court considers that the claims lodged by Mr Tkach shall be granted . \u201d", "The court pointed out that the principle of equality of arms would prevent a prosecutor from resorting in the civil proceedings to the special powers conferred on the prosecutor \u2019s office . For this reason the court approved PERSON PERSON \u2019s decision to withdraw the CARDINAL actions which he had lodged on behalf of the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "The court also accepted the applicant \u2019s counterclaim and held that Mr Tkach \u2019s statement challenged by the applicant encroached on the applicant \u2019s protected journalistic rights .", "The court did not award compensation for non - pecuniary damage to either party .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment . On DATE the prosecutor of the Tsentralniy district , Mr S. Myashin , lodged a prosecutor \u2019s appeal ( \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442 ) in the interests of Mr Tkach .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE on procedural grounds and remitted the case for a new examination .", "On DATE ORG of FAC delivered a new judgment in the matter . In substance , the court followed the reasoning of the judgment of DATE . The court noted that the judgment made by the district court on PERSON claim had been subsequently upheld by ORG on DATE and also scrutinised by the prosecutor in charge of supervision over the lawfulness of court decisions in civil cases who reported on DATE that no violation had taken place . The NORP Regional prosecutor \u2019s office and the Presidium of ORG refused to lodge applications for supervisory review as no breaches were found and a request for review was therefore unsubstantiated . The court observed that PERSON PERSON \u2019s official position was in no way related to the substance of the civil dispute in question ; he was not a plaintiff or a party to the dispute and there were no evidence that he had exercised pressure on the court . Moreover , the first deputy mayor of FAC and the head of the LOC administration confirmed that neither Mr Tkach nor his spouse had ever applied for permission to reconstruct their flat or otherwise improve their living conditions at the expense of neighbours PERSON . On the other hand , the court had regard to the overwhelming evidence showing that neighbours PERSON . maintained the attic in a dilapidated state , flooded PERSON flat and refused access to the attic to housing maintenance workers .", "The court held that the information in the articles of DATE and CARDINAL DATE was untrue and damaging to the plaintiff \u2019s honour and professional reputation and caused him non - pecuniary damage . It awarded Mr FAC CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) payable jointly by the applicant and her newspaper .", "Having examined the applicant \u2019s counterclaim against Mr Tkach , the court found that the statement of claim of CARDINAL DATE had been indeed submitted on the prosecutor \u2019s office stationary , yet it did not specifically mention that the claim had been lodged in the ORG or public interests . The court held that the contested statement should be interpreted as a private person \u2019s position rather than as a prosecutor \u2019s injunction . An application to a court for the protection of one \u2019s rights containing arguments in support of the plaintiff \u2019s cause can not be held to infringe rights of others . Moreover , the court had regard to the decision of the district court of DATE whereby the contested statement of claim had been left without examination . The applicant \u2019s counterclaim was therefore dismissed .", "The court noted in the judgment that the representatives of the applicant , PERSON and PERSON , did not attend after a break , on DATE of the hearing , despite having been duly informed of the time and place of the hearing agreed between the parties . The court observed that they failed to show any valid reasons for their absence , the documents on the file were sufficient for examination of the merits and that the other party did not object to continuing the examination in their absence .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment . In her appeal the applicant submitted , in particular , that the judgment had been given without her or her representatives being present . She explained that the hearing had begun on DATE , DATE . At TIME the judge had announced a break . The applicant alleged that she had not been informed when the hearing would resume . On DATE , DATE , the applicant \u2019s representative arrived at the courtroom only to find that the judgment had been delivered on DATE . In her appeal the applicant also challenged the merits of the judgment .", "On DATE ORG upheld in substance the judgment of DATE . However , the court reduced the amount of the award to ORG ( EUR CARDINAL ) for the applicant and to RUR CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for the Citizen . The court reasoned its decision to reduce the award as follows :", "\u201c ... the extent of the applicants\u2019 liability for dissemination of untrue information is insignificant because the judicial dispute with PERSON and PERSON . concerning the attic had indeed taken place , and the dissemination of damaging and inaccurate information is a result of incorrect , erroneous evaluation of the circumstances of that dispute . \u201d", "The court also found that the applicant and her representative had been duly notified that the hearing would resume at TIME on DATE and their consent had been noted in the transcript of the hearing on DATE .", "On DATE and DATE Mr Tkach sent a request to the Head of ORG ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 ) to impose a disciplinary sanction on the editor - in - chief of the ORG and the applicant herself with a view of their future dismissal .

The prosecutor requested , inter alia , a decision to apply disciplinary sanctions on the applicant in connection with her having disseminated the information damaging the reputation of the prosecutor of the Moskovskiy district , Mr Tkach .", "On an unspecified date the applicant , her former representative PERSON PERSON and the editor - in - chief of the newspaper lodged a civil action against Mr Tkach for the protection of their honour , dignity and professional reputation and compensation for non - pecuniary damage . They submitted that at the oral hearing on DATE in ORG of FAC and in his written submissions to that court Mr Tkach referred to them as \u201c slanderers \u201d who \u201c badgered \u201d him by publishing \u201c ravings \u201d about a non - existent problem and wrote letters to the authorities insisting that the applicant and the editor be dismissed .", "On DATE ORG of GPE granted the defamation action lodged by the applicant and her colleagues and ordered Mr Tkach to pay RUR CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) to each of the applicant and PERSON PERSON .
