At the relevant time he was employed by ORG , a national DATE newspaper , working as a correspondent in his hometown of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the NORP education system , after the seventh or eighth grade , when pupils complete their primary education , they can continue either in an ordinary or in a specialised secondary school . The ordinary secondary ORG curriculum does not usually involve the intensive teaching of a special subject such as mathematics , foreign languages or engineering . Enrolment in them is on the basis of documents only and does not typically present a problem . The curriculum of the specialised secondary schools does include the teaching of such subjects , and pupils are admitted to them exclusively on the basis of competitive examinations , which take place in DATE ( DATE in GPE starts on DATE ) . Under regulations issued by ORG and ORG , pupils with certain medical conditions can be admitted to specialised secondary schools without an examination , as an exceptional measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the GPE education inspectorate , a territorial division of ORG and ORG , appointed a commission to select for admission to specialised secondary schools pupils with certain chronic medical conditions or special educational needs . The commission \u2019s members were CARDINAL employees of the inspectorate , PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr G.D. , and a paediatrician , PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL parents of children who were sitting competitive examinations to gain admission to specialised secondary schools wrote a letter to ORG and ORG . They said that CARDINAL and fiftyseven children had been admitted to specialised secondary schools in GPE on the basis of a medical condition and not following a competitive examination . Most of those were apparently the children of medical doctors , paramedical staff and teachers . The parents complained that whereas they were paying MONEY for private preparatory lessons , certain pupils had been bragging that they would be admitted to ORG in GPE in exchange for paying MONEY ( ORG ) ; indeed , DATE this had become a fact . They cited several examples of perfectly healthy children who had been diagnosed as suffering from serious chronic illnesses . They said that they were not blaming the admissions commission , which had merely been taking note of the prior conclusions of medical doctors and allocating the pupils to schools depending on the nature of their purported health problems . They insisted that the ORG should set up a special commission to investigate . A number of parents subsequently staged DATE public protests in front of the building of the GPE education inspectorate .", "CARDINAL . Following this complaint , on DATE the Minister of ORG and ORG appointed CARDINAL officials of ORG to inspect the work of the admissions commission . Having done so CARDINAL , the CARDINAL officials produced a fivepage report on DATE . The report , which was not made public , found that the commission had committed a number of violations of the school admissions regulations , such as admitting pupils who did not have the requisite medical conditions , making findings on the basis of invalid medical documents and poorly documenting its activities . It also said that there were indications that PERSON had been forging documents . The report \u2019s proposals included \u201c imposing disciplinary punishments on the commission \u2019s members , commensurate with the violations found and in line with the FAC \u201d . On DATE the Minister imposed on PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON the disciplinary punishment of a \u201c warning of dismissal \u201d , citing a number of violations and omissions in the school admissions procedures .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time after that the GPE regional prosecutor \u2019s office opened an inquiry concerning PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr G.D. On DATE it instituted a formal investigation against \u201c the implicated officials of the education inspectorate \u201d on suspicion of bribetaking . In the course of this investigation the authorities interviewed the CARDINAL officials , some parents who had complained to ORG and ORG and parents alleged to have given bribes to have their children admitted to \u201c specialised \u201d schools . In DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office decided to discontinue the investigation without bringing charges . It said that while the officials had indeed breached their duty and had been given a disciplinary punishment as a result , there was no evidence that they had done so as a result of bribetaking .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant learned about the story and decided to cover it in an article , which appeared on pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL DATE issue of ORG under the headline \u201c Bribes scandal in GPE secondary schools \u201d .

On DATE all the judges of ORG stated that they did not wish to take part in the examination of the case , citing public protests by journalists and the airing of allegations that they were all biased against the applicant .

The trial before ORG took place on DATE and DATE and on DATE and DATE . The court heard evidence from the applicant , the complainants and a number of witnesses called by both parties , including the supervisor of the CARDINAL complainants and the deputy regional governor of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of having , in the printed press , disseminated injurious statements of fact about PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , officials carrying out their duties , contrary to LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL taken in conjunction with LAW . The court acquitted the applicant of the charges of having imputed offences to them and of having committed the offence in public , contrary to LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Code . It applied Article CARDINAL of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and replaced the applicant \u2019s criminal liability with CARDINAL administrative fines of ORG CARDINAL each . The court further ordered the applicant to pay each of the complainants compensation for nonpecuniary damage amounting to ORG CARDINAL , plus interest from DATE until settlement , and dismissed the remainder of their claims . Finally , it ordered the applicant to pay BGN CARDINAL in court fees . The court described the facts set out above and continued as follows :", "\u201c To gather the information necessary for his article , [ the applicant ] had conversations with parents protesting in front of the [ GPE education inspectorate ] ... From them he learned about the alert which had triggered the appointment of the [ inspection commission ] . He talked to the head of [ the inspectorate ] , [ PERSON ] , and [ other journalists ] from PERSON ( whose names he did not disclose ) , from whom he learned that the inspection had revealed a number of violations and that it was expected that there would be a proposal to the Minister to impose stiff disciplinary punishments on the complainants . [ The applicant ] asserts that he [ also ] talked to the deputy regional governor in charge of education , [ Mr PERSON ] . [ However ] , at trial [ Mr PERSON ] testified that his conversation with the applicant had taken place after , not before , the article \u2019s publication .", "Another witness , ... a colleague of the complainants , [ testified that ] the article \u2019s publication had had a severe negative impact on [ them ] , leaving them very depressed , worried and unable to do their work with their usual confidence .", "On the basis of these findings of fact the court makes the following findings of law :", "According to LAW ] , the offence of defamation consists in disseminating injurious statements of fact about someone or imputing an offence to him or her . ... The complainants accuse [ the applicant ] of committing both forms of the offence \u2013 disseminating untrue injurious statements of fact and imputing an offence to them . The complainants and their counsel maintain that the imputed offence was the taking of bribes from children , [ contrary to ] LAW [ of LAW ] . Having read the article carefully , the court finds that [ the applicant ] did not impute an offence to the complainants . The article does not contain any allegation that the complainants took bribes . Its first part ( including the headings ) stated that the complainants would be punished with disciplinary dismissal for having taken bribes . [ The applicant ] did not comment on the appropriateness of the purportedly impending punishment , and in the second part of the article described in a relatively detailed manner what he considered to be the facts of the matter , which would form the grounds for the punishments . These facts did not include bribetaking . It is averred that the unlawful admission of pupils was made possible by Dr [ ORG ] \u2019s fabrication of false medical documents and that the complainants relied on these documents without checking their accuracy . Taken together these parts of the article lead to the conclusion that [ the applicant ] did not allege that the complainants had taken bribes . The court accordingly finds [ him ] not guilty of the charge of imputing an offence . It is therefore not necessary to discuss the evidence and the facts suggesting the commission of such an offence , or [ the applicant \u2019s ] certainty ... that it had taken place .", "[ The applicant ] did , however , commit the other form of [ defamation ] . In his article [ he ] disseminated an injurious statement of fact , namely that the complainants would be punished with disciplinary dismissal for having taken bribes for having children admitted to elite secondary schools in GPE . The injurious character of this statement is a metalegal characteristic . The law does not spell out the content of this notion . For this reason , whether or not a circumstance is injurious must be determined on the basis of [ public opinion ] . The dismissal of an individual from an official post for taking bribes is generally seen as a sign of that individual \u2019s poor morals . The court accordingly accepts that the disseminated statement is injurious .", "According to LAW [ of LAW ] , [ those making allegedly defamatory assertions ] are not to be punished if the assertions are found to be true . This means that defamation has been committed only if the injurious statements disseminated are untrue . In the instant case this is so . It has been established that the complainants were not dismissed but [ only ] warned that they could face dismissal and that this did not happen on DATE . It is , however , rather more important to point out that the grounds for the disciplinary punishments were not the taking of bribes but the violations described in the report of the inspecting commission and in the reasons for the orders imposing disciplinary punishments .", "The untrue injurious statement was disseminated through the publication of the article in ORG . It is well known and not disputed [ by the parties ] that this newspaper is circulated on the territory of [ the entire country ] . The court therefore accepts that the aggravating element of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL [ of LAW ] is present .", "The untrue injurious statement disseminated was connected with the performance of the ORG duties . As members of the admissions commission for pupils with chronic medical conditions and special educational needs they were \u2018 public officials\u2019 within the meaning [ of LAW ] . The court therefore accepts that the aggravating element of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL [ of the Code ] is [ also ] present .", "The untrue injurious statement was not disseminated in public . The fact that the offence was characterised [ as having been committed through the printed press makes it impossible for it to have been committed in public ] . An injurious statement is considered to have been disseminated in public if this was done in the presence of several persons , whereas the dissemination of information in the printed press ... involves no direct contact between the person imparting the information and those receiving it . The court therefore finds [ the applicant ] not guilty of [ disseminating the injurious statement in public ] contrary to LAW in conjunction with LAW [ of LAW ] .", "The defence disputes the existence of mens rea . It asserts that [ the applicant ] was not aware that the statements he made were untrue . What is more , according to the defence [ the applicant ] believed that the complainants had been taking bribes in performing their duties as members of the commission . This belief was based on objective facts . These arguments are inapposite and should not be addressed by the court , as in the impugned article [ the applicant ] did not allege that the complainants had been taking bribes . Seen from this perspective , whether or not [ the applicant ] believed that bribes had been taken is irrelevant . What matters is whether [ the applicant ] was aware of the untruthfulness of [ the assertion ] that on DATE of publication of the article the Minister of Education and ORG ... would impose on the complainants the disciplinary punishment of \u2018 dismissal\u2019 on the grounds that they had taken bribes from sick children . This is so because , [ according to ORG caselaw , ] \u2018 when [ a journalist ] has properly verified the truthfulness of the information in line with established journalistic practice [ and ] the internal nonbinding rules of the relevant newspaper or publishing FAC , by using the sources available in practice , [ he or she can be said to have acted ] in a professional manner and in good faith , which excludes criminal and civil liability for defamation ( [ citation ] ) . It has not been established that [ the applicant acted ] in a professional manner and in good faith . None of the sources used by [ him ] provided information to that effect . The information which [ he ] received from the head of the inspectorate , PERSON , and [ other journalists ] from PERSON indicated that at the close of the inspection the commission appointed by the Minister was to propose that the complainants be subjected to stiff disciplinary punishments ( on unspecified grounds ) . Before the publication of the article [ the applicant ] did not talk to the deputy regional governor , [ Mr PERSON ] . The conversations conducted with parents of children [ not admitted ] could not give [ the applicant ] reliable information either about the internal control measures envisaged by the Minister or about the grounds for taking them . At the time of publication there was not a single source indicating to [ the applicant ] that the complainants would be dismissed as a disciplinary measure or that the grounds given by the Minister for that would be bribetaking . The court therefore finds that [ the applicant ] realised the untruthfulness of the injurious statements he disseminated and that the offence was therefore intentional . [ The offence of defamation ] does not require the defamed persons to sustain damage . The antisocial consequences of such an act arise simply from the dissemination of the injurious statements . By publishing his article [ the applicant ] intended just that \u2013 to bring the untrue injurious statements to the knowledge of an unlimited number of people . The offence was committed with direct intent because [ the applicant ] was aware of the antisocial character of his act and wished its adverse consequences to occur ...", "In sum , the court finds that [ the applicant ] has committed with respect to each of the complainants an offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW [ of LAW ] . ( The CARDINAL offences were committed [ in a single act ] . ) The penalty for such an offence is a fine ranging from MONEY and public reprimand . [ The applicant ] has not been convicted of a publicly prosecutable offence ... and the offences have not engendered pecuniary damage . [ The case thus comes under ] Article CARDINALa [ of the Code ] , and [ the applicant ] \u2019s criminal liability should be replaced with an administrative fine of ORG CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL .", "To determine the amount of the fine , the court ... took into account the mitigating and aggravating circumstances . [ The applicant ] was not found to have committed other transgressions , i.e. he does not exhibit criminal tendencies and the level of risk he presents to society is low . Despite the existence of CARDINAL additional qualifying elements ( which is of itself an aggravating factor ) , the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the complainants as a result of the offence is negligible ( see below for more on this point ) . [ The applicant ] denies any wrongdoing , which is his right , but at the same time has provided detailed explanations about the case and practical cooperation in ascertaining the truth . For these reasons , the court finds that there is a preponderance of mitigating circumstances , and fixes the punishment for each offence at the minimum amount , namely BGN CARDINAL .", "The ORG claims for damages are wellfounded , because in all cases the dissemination of untrue injurious statements tarnishes the good name of the persons associated with the alleged facts . Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of the DATE LAW ] the compensation [ for nonpecuniary damage ] must be determined by the court in equity . The court finds that the sum of BGN MONEY claimed by each of [ the complainants ] would amount to just compensation for the nonpecuniary damage suffered by them as a result of the slur on their reputations . However , [ the applicant ] is not liable to pay the entirety of that sum . Apart from the untrue injurious statements , in his article [ he ] also reported true injurious facts , in respect of which he does not bear any criminal or civil liability . The article points out that the complainants committed violations which led to the unlawful admission of children to the abovementioned secondary schools . These facts were true . Their publication by [ the applicant ] was legal , because in publishing them he was exercising his constitutional right to seek and impart information , and helping other citizens to exercise their constitutional right to receive information ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ... of the LAW ) .", "The evidence gathered in the case leads to the conclusion that the reputations of [ the complainants ] have suffered chiefly as a result of the true injurious facts reported by [ the applicant ] . [ The relevant regulations ] lay down a procedure whereby the ORG [ in line with its constitutional obligations ] encourages education , creating conditions for the vocational training of children with special needs or medical conditions . Since this activity is a constitutional obligation of the ORG , its performance in strict compliance with the relevant rules is of paramount importance . Seen from a different perspective , when the performance of this activity has been marred by a series of serious violations and this has led to the unlawful admission of pupils to the detriment of other pupils who have recognised medical conditions or needs , these violations inevitably lead to the loss of the good names of the officials concerned . For these reasons , the court finds that the reputations of [ the complainants ] suffered as a result of their own illicit behaviour . When imparting information about this [ the applicant ] went too far \u2013 alongside the true injurious statement he made an untrue statement about the impending punishments and the grounds for them . As a result , [ the ORG ] reputations suffered additionally , but not materially , because even if [ the applicant ] had not said what punishments would be imposed by the Minister , [ the ORG ] reputations would have been greatly impaired anyway . [ The applicant ] is liable only for the nonpecuniary damage arising out of the dissemination of the untrue injurious statements . In view of the foregoing , the court finds that the equitable amount of compensation is ORG CARDINAL for each of [ the complainants ] . The remainder of the civil claims are groundless and are to be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay the ORG costs , amounting to ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the complainants appealed . The applicant argued , among other things , that the institution of criminal proceedings against the complainants on charges of bribery meant that there were grounds to suspect that they had committed such offences and that he had been justified in mentioning that fact in the article .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( GPE \u043e\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) heard the appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE it upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence , but increased the award of damages , ordering the applicant to pay ORG MONEY to each of the complainants . ORG also upheld the lower court \u2019s ancillary costs order . It held , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Concerning the arguments ... that the [ lower court \u2019s ] judgment is illfounded and in breach of substantive law : The appeal states that criminal proceedings were instituted against the complainants on charges of bribery in breach of LAW [ of LAW ] , and that for this reason [ the applicant ] can not be deemed to have intentionally made untrue and injurious assertions . It can however be seen from the reasoning of [ the lower court ] that [ the applicant ] was acquitted of the charge of imputing to the complainants the offence of bribery . The [ lower court \u2019s ] reasoning on that point is fully shared by this court and , accordingly , the objections that the [ lower court \u2019s ] judgment was unfounded or in breach of substantive law do not call for further discussion .", "The court finds that the punishments imposed on [ the applicant ] were properly fixed . [ The lower court ] correctly replaced [ the applicant \u2019s ] criminal liability [ under ] Article ORG of [ LAW ] with fines in the minimum amount allowed by the law , namely ORG CARDINAL for each of the offences , taking into account [ the applicant \u2019s ] lack of a criminal record or other antisocial acts , [ the ] lower level of risk [ he poses ] to society , [ and ] his detailed explanations about the facts of the case . In its reasoning the court said that the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the complainants was not significant . That view can not be shared by [ this court ] . Unlike pecuniary damage , the non - pecuniary damage caused through a criminal act should not be taken into account for the purpose of fixing the punishment . The nonpecuniary damage suffered by the victims of crime is strictly individual and should be taken into account solely for the purpose of fixing the amount of compensation , not the quantum and type of the punishment . Nevertheless , [ this court ] considers that the minimum penalties imposed on [ the applicant ] will [ be sufficient to ] further the aims of the punishment , as envisaged by [ LAW ] . The court therefore finds that this part of the [ lower court \u2019s judgment ] should be upheld .", "As regards the civil claims for compensation for nonpecuniary damage :", "The court finds unfounded the ORG requests to increase the amount of compensation to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each of them . It is true that the complainants sustained non - pecuniary damage \u2013 a blemish on their reputations , concerned as they are about their professional standing and good names \u2013 as a result of the offences against them . [ The lower court ] , however , correctly stated in its reasoning that [ the applicant \u2019s ] article had reported injurious facts which were true , namely that the complainants had committed violations in their work , which led to the unlawful admission of children to secondary schools , and which were more significant than the fact that the complainants would be dismissed . For this reason , the court considers that [ the lower court ] was right not to allow the civil claims in full . However , in [ this court \u2019s ] view , the awards [ it ] made are too small . The amount of ORG CARDINAL for each of [ the complainants ] can not make good their suffering resulting from the affront to their dignity . Regard being had to the way in which the offence was committed \u2013 circulation of the injurious assertions in a publication which is sold nationwide , thus bringing them to the attention of large number of people \u2013 , [ as well as ] the negative impact this had on the ORG mental state , health and capacity for work ... , this court finds that it would be just to award the complainants ORG CARDINAL each . This part of [ the lower court \u2019s ] judgment should therefore be modified , by increasing the amount which [ the applicant ] has to pay to the complainants to BGN CARDINAL for each of them in respect of nonpecuniary damage .", "Concerning the costs of the proceedings :", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE [ the lower court ] ordered [ the applicant ] to pay the complainants the amount of ORG CARDINAL for costs . [ The applicant ] was found not guilty of the charge of imputing an offence and of the charge under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 [ \u00a7 ] CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) [ and CARDINAL ] of [ LAW ] . Under [ the relevant provisions of LAW ] , he must accordingly bear the full cost related to the charges of which he was found guilty ... However , in this court \u2019s view , [ the lower court ] correctly ordered the applicant to pay the entirety of the costs in the case , because the complainants are also a private prosecuting party and it is the court \u2019s practice in such cases to award the costs in full . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
