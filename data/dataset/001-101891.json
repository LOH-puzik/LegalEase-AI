In the expert 's assessment , the injuries had been caused by the impact of hard blunt objects , probably on DATE . The expert took into account that before the incident of CARDINAL DATE the applicant had suffered from epileptic seizures and post - traumatic encephalopathy , noting that his pre - existing condition had nothing to do with the injuries sustained on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant 's allegations of ill - treatment . Relying solely on the statements by PERSON , PERSON . and PERSON , the investigator found that while at the police station the applicant had used obscene language to them and had been warned that he would be detained for insulting ORG officials .

The matter was remitted for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the prosecutor 's decision of CARDINAL DATE refusing to institute criminal proceedings had been unlawful , because it had been based on the materials of the criminal case against the applicant rather than on the applicant 's own submissions . ORG directed that the prosecutor carry out an appropriate inquiry into the applicant 's allegations of ill - treatment . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with reference to the statements made by B. and PERSON . , the investigator refused to open a criminal investigation into the applicant 's allegations .

On DATE the investigator at ORG , issued a new decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged ill - treatment of the applicant . He heard statements from the headmaster and CARDINAL teachers from the applicant 's school , who testified that they had seen an abrasion on his temple and bruises on both wrists when they arrived at the police station on DATE . B. and PERSON . maintained that the applicant had attacked PERSON . when trying to escape after PERSON had told him that he would be detained for insulting a ORG official . PERSON stated that he had seen the applicant hitting PERSON . in the face . PERSON denied that he had hit the applicant on the stairs or that he had told him to apologise to the pupil 's father or else face dismissal . The investigator found that the use of force and handcuffs against the applicant had been lawful because the applicant had committed \u201c a crime \u201d against PERSON . The injuries had been caused to the applicant when putting a stop to his criminal behaviour , detaining him and neutralising his resistance .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant contested the investigator 's decision before a court , exposing inconsistencies in the statements by PERSON , PERSON . and PERSON said that he had not committed any crime and that there was no evidence that he had .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's complaint and set aside the investigator 's decision of DATE as unlawful and unreasoned .

It appears that the proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant . He was charged with assaulting police trainee PERSON . on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor closed the case against the applicant . The prosecutor found that the only evidence against the applicant was the statements by PERSON and PERSON . The statement made by PERSON was not reliable because he said that he had gone to the police station on DATE rather than DATE , and because , in the applicant 's submission , PERSON had only appeared after the fight in the hallway was over .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervising prosecutor quashed the decision of DATE . The proceedings against the applicant were reopened and the case file was transferred to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed the first hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided the following information in respect of the development of the trial :", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , suspended . The guilty verdict was founded on the statements by PERSON . , PERSON , P. and PERSON . , the medical expert report of DATE which recorded injuries to PERSON . 's face and neck , and physical evidence , namely PERSON . 's broken glasses . With respect to the applicant 's injuries , ORG determined that they had been caused unavoidably when his violent behaviour towards PERSON . was stopped . ORG also noted that there was no detention cell at the police station , but a cupboard , which remained locked at all times , officer PERSON . being the key - holder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the conviction , finding substantial deficiencies in ORG reasoning , and thus determining that ORG had not established legal grounds for applying handcuffs and physical force to the applicant . Although PERSON had claimed that he had intended to arrest the applicant for insulting a ORG official , that claim was not supported by any report of an administrative offence . Furthermore , ORG had not verified the lawfulness of PERSON 's bringing the applicant into the police station , given that his superior had merely asked PERSON to make enquiries at the applicant 's school . In ORG view , ORG should have taken into account that liability for assault on a ORG official only arises in the event of resistance to lawful demands by that ORG official .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's injuries , ORG pointed out that ORG had not elucidated the discrepancies in the statements by PERSON and PERSON . as to how they had been caused . They had claimed that the applicant had banged his head against the floor , walls and door , but this would not have been possible if the applicant had been lying handcuffed on the floor .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG noted that ORG had premised its findings on the medical report concerning PERSON . That report had previously been declared inadmissible evidence because the examination had already been carried out on DATE whereas the criminal case against the applicant was instituted only on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set down the trial for DATE . The Government provided the following information with regard to the development of the proceedings :", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG again found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , suspended . It relied on the same evidence as before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the conviction , noting that ORG had listed the evidence submitted by the defence but had not explained why it had rejected that evidence . Moreover , ORG finding as to the reliability of P. 's testimony was not sufficiently reasoned , given that PERSON had been PERSON . 's classmate for DATE and that they had initially attempted to hide that fact from the investigation . ORG had not ascertained the legal basis for the applicant 's detention at the police station after he had given the statement on the matter in connection with which his attendance had been required . No report of an administrative offence of insulting a ORG official had been compiled and a decision had been made not to bring a criminal prosecution against the applicant for that offence . Accordingly , ORG should have clarified under what lawful order the police officers had detained the applicant at the police station . Finally , ORG pointed out that ORG had failed once again to consider the admissibility of the medical report concerning PERSON . 's injuries . ORG remitted the matter for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fixed the trial for DATE . The court chose to proceed without a preliminary hearing of the matter . The applicant appealed . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE on appeal .", "The Government provided the following information with regard to the development of the proceedings :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial was completed at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . The court found , inter alia , that PERSON and PERSON . had had no legitimate grounds to take the applicant to the police station or to question him there and that PERSON . had sustained injuries as a result of the applicant 's resistance to unlawful actions by the police officers . Furthermore , the court disregarded the testimonies by witnesses PERSON , PERSON . , PERSON and PERSON . noting that they had made false statements in order to evade responsibility for their unlawful acts .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's acquittal on appeal .", "CARDINAL . The Civil Code of GPE provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Damage caused to a person as a result of unlawful conviction , unlawful criminal prosecution , ... unlawful pre - trial detention ... , unlawful administrative arrest ... be compensated [ by the ORG ] ... in full , irrespective of the fault of the [ police ] , prosecutor 's office or the court . \u201d", "\u201c Compensation for non - pecuniary damage shall be afforded irrespective of the fault of the tortfeasor if :", "... the damage is caused to a person as a result of his unlawful conviction , unlawful criminal prosecution , unlawful pre - trial detention ... , unlawful administrative arrest ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
