It concurred with the lower court that the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement had not been respected and that the applicant was therefore entitled to redress , which had to be significant and substantial . It also had to be given in a clear and measurable manner . No reason had emerged not to impose a sentence . The court , however , found that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings as , at the time when the summonses were served , he had been abroad and thereby been difficult to reach . Nevertheless , the court stated that it would reduce the applicant \u2019s sentence by CARDINAL owing to the lengthy proceedings .", "Having noted the length of the standard sentence for the aggravated fraud in question and having as a mitigating factor taken into account that the sentence could have been imposed at the time of the imposition of the applicant \u2019s previous sentences ( which would have been more advantageous for the applicant ) and in that connection the so - called maximum sentence rule laid down by LAW , LAW , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen ; as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment would have been appropriate had the proceedings not been excessively lengthy . However , owing to the breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement , ORG sentenced him to an immediate term of CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . It applied LAW , article DATE , of LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which took effect on DATE ) . Having regard to the seriousness of the applicant \u2019s offence , the damage thereby caused and the considerable advantage pursued and achieved , the court considered that the maintaining of general obedience to the law required that the prison term be an immediate one .

That was , however , not the case here . In considering whether there were grounds for applying LAW , article DATE , of LAW , ORG held that it had to be decided in PERSON whether the duration of the proceedings ( here over DATE ) had been unreasonable . It concluded that , in this case , there were no grounds not to impose a sentence or to mitigate the sentence owing to the duration of the proceedings .", "In its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) ORG , applying LAW , article DATE , of LAW , reduced the sentence by DATE owing to the lengthy proceedings ( DATE ) . It imposed an immediate term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , finding that it was not justifiable to further mitigate the sentence by suspending the term of imprisonment .", "On DATE ORG delivered a judgment ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) in which , applying LAW , article CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , of LAW , it afforded redress for the breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement ( here the proceedings had lasted DATE ) by waiving the sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
