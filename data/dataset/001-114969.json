The CARDINAL applicants , PERSON , her adult son and her CARDINAL other minor children ( \u201c the applicants \u201d ) are NORP nationals . The President of the Section decided of his own motion to grant the applicants anonymity ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) and confidentiality of the case file documents ( Rule CARDINAL of ORG ) . The applicants , who had been granted legal aid , were represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON , and by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mother , born in DATE , and her husband were married in DATE . They have CARDINAL children : NORP , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE , NORP , born in DATE , NORP , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE and PERSON , born in DATE . In DATE the applicant mother suffered a stroke which paralysed her left side . She was able to return home from hospital DATE . During that time her husband took care of the children and the home . He continued to do so even after her return as she could hardly walk and usually used a wheelchair .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the oldest child NORP reached the age of majority .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the husband was killed in a car accident . The applicant mother and the children lived at first with her parents but moved back to their home in DATE . As of DATE and during DATE the applicant mother received considerable help from the social services . A team of CARDINAL to CARDINAL social workers worked with the family practically round the clock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a family worker made an evaluation of the situation in the applicant \u2019s family . According to the evaluation , the applicant mother used a wheelchair whenever she moved from CARDINAL place to another and managed to get into and out of the wheelchair independently . She was quite capable of writing but needed help with opening envelopes . As to everyday routines , the report noted that the applicant mother could eat her food independently if it was already portioned . For dressing and undressing she needed verbal support and also physical help and she could not button or zip up her clothes . She was able to go to the toilet independently . When washing herself she needed help only with washing her back and feet and rinsing her hair . Regarding the applicant mother \u2019s understanding and memory , the evaluation stated that the applicant mother lived in an imaginary reality and could not see the real situation of her family . She misunderstood things and could even understand some things quite in reverse . The applicant mother had problems with her memory and sense of time : she confused DATE of DATE and the children DATE and could not always remember when she had washed herself last , for example . The family worker reported that the applicant mother \u2019s mental ability varied from day to day and she easily became anxious .", "CARDINAL . The family workers found their work in the family challenging and tiring in all respects because each of the CARDINAL youngest children showed various symptoms due to their traumatic past . The applicant mother \u2019s parents took an active part in the everyday life of the family , and this caused occasional conflicts . The family workers also experienced threats from the applicant mother \u2019s eldest child , NORP , who disturbed their work . The family workers had said that they would not continue working with the family until the problems were solved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided , as a support measure , to place the children in foster care , either in family care or in support families , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . As there were a lot of problems in the family , on an unspecified date the social services asked a private firm to evaluate the parenting in the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL minor children were taken into emergency public care . These decisions were reasoned by the fact that the social workers could no longer cope with the family . The children were also afraid of their grandparents and feared that they would be kidnapped and taken abroad by them . The grandparents treated the children unequally and used corporal punishment . The grandfather drank a lot of alcohol . The children showed excessive sexual behaviour , and they had all wanted to stay in their support families rather than returning home . According to the preliminary results of the on - going evaluation by the private firm , the applicant mother was unable to meet the emotional needs of the children and they had suffered from insecurity for a long time . The children violated each other \u2019s limits sadistically but the applicant mother did not intervene . Before taking the decisions , S. , NORP and NORP had been heard and none of them opposed the taking into public care . All the children were placed in different families .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social welfare authorities received the evaluation made by the private firm . According to the evaluation , the children were , inter alia , left on their own , even when in the company of their mother . They tried as individuals to obtain attention and care from any adult but their mother was not the primary option for any of them . The mother was mentally and physically dependent on the social workers and she was not able to cope with the children \u2019s aggression or other feelings . She was not in practice capable of adequate parenting . The social workers had to bear too much responsibility for the children \u2019s safety . It was more important to provide an adult to care for each child than to keep all the siblings together .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant mother sought rectification of this decision and proposed that the grandparents could help her to take care of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the emergency taking into public care was maintained by the child welfare authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of social services submitted a request to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) for a care order for each of the children .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant mother appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request for rectification was rejected by the child welfare authorities . All of the children had integrated well in their foster families and were concerned about their possible return home . Taking into account what the children had said about their grandparents , they could not be considered as persons with whom the children could be placed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case . The oldest children PERSON and NORP were heard separately by the court and it met the youngest children , NORP , PERSON and PERSON , in their respective foster homes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the taking into public care and the placement of the children . CARDINAL of the children were placed in the same foster home . The court found that the taking into public care was needed due to the lack of parenting and the circumstances at home . The lack of care endangered seriously the health and development of the children . The aid provided in different forms by the social workers had proved to be insufficient . Taking the children into public care was in their best interest .", "CARDINAL . By letters dated DATE and DATE the applicant mother appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that an oral hearing be held . She claimed that the authorities had neglected to evaluate the role of the grandparents who were able and willing to take care of the children . The grandmother had previously worked in a children \u2019s day - care centre . Also , her brother had promised to help her with the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the emergency public care order was continued in the best interest of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local social welfare authority requested ORG ( maistraatti , magistraten ) , in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW , to appoint the children a guardian . From the documents submitted by the applicants it appears that such a guardian was appointed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for an oral hearing as well as the appeal . Concerning the former , it found that ORG had already organised an oral hearing and that a new oral hearing was not needed to clarify the matter . As to the appeal , it found that the criteria for taking into public care had been fulfilled and that there was no reason to change the outcome reached by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided to change the placement of the youngest child . This decision was based on the fact that the former foster family was exhausted and could no longer continue to cope with the youngest child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mother appealed against this decision to ORG , demanding that the child be placed with her . She also requested that an oral hearing be held . She referred , inter alia , to the LAW and demanded that the authorities actively work to reunite the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that it was not possible to place the child with his mother as he had no affectionate relationship with his mother . As the same difficulties as before still existed , it was not in the best interest of the child to place him with his mother . It was in his interest to be placed in another foster home which could provide him a model of normal family life .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant mother appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant mother \u2019s appeal , confirming the reasoning of ORG in its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The children have been able to meet each other only a couple of times during their placement . Since being taken into public care , they have been able to meet their mother only occasionally under supervision . There were no visits DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided that none of the children could meet their mother or otherwise contact her at all during the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . This decision was reasoned by the fact that forensic psychiatric examinations of the children were on - going and that they required the creation of stable and clear conditions . No meetings were held during the validity of the decisions . Letters or other mail or confidential messages sent by the children or addressed to them were withheld . The applicant mother appealed against these decisions to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant mother \u2019s appeals against the decisions of CARDINAL DATE . It found that contact restrictions were necessary due to the on - going forensic psychiatric examinations of the children and were in their best interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided that , during the period from DATE to DATE , CARDINAL of the children , PERSON , PERSON , could meet their mother DATE in the foster home for DATE at a time in the presence of the foster parent . The meetings for the CARDINAL other children , NORP and PERSON , were cancelled until DATE . The applicant mother appealed against these decisions to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided that , during the period from DATE to DATE , the youngest child PERSON could meet his mother under supervision for DATE at a time , DATE . The applicant mother appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities also prohibited contact between PERSON and his grandparents until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided the applicant mother \u2019s appeal against the decisions of DATE . As concerned PERSON , PERSON , the court quashed the decisions of DATE , finding that there had been no reasons to restrict contact of the applicant mother with PERSON , I. and L. between DATE and DATE . The court considered , however , that it had been in the best interest of the children to implement the visits under supervision . As concerned NORP , the court noted that he had repeatedly expressed his unwillingness to meet with the applicant mother . Given that NORP was already DATE , his opinion had to be taken into account . NORP had had severe symptoms and his behaviour had changed considerably after having met with his family members . It was thus in the best interest of NORP to have the underlying reasons for his symptoms examined so that adequate therapy could be provided . Therefore , the contact restrictions were necessary until DATE . Finally , as concerned the youngest child PERSON , the court noted that his excessively sexual behaviour called for forensic psychiatric examination . It was in his best interest to have the underlying reasons for his symptoms examined , and it was therefore necessary to keep his circumstances stable during the examinations . Interaction with his mother might have disturbed his physical and mental development and jeopardised the purpose of the foster care . Therefore , the court found that the contact restrictions applicable until DATE had been necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided to restrict the contact between the second youngest child PERSON and his mother until DATE on the ground that contact would endanger his health , development and safety as well as the fulfilment of the purpose of the foster care . The applicant mother appealed against this decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities also prohibited contact between PERSON and his grandparents until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided to continue restricting the contact between NORP and his mother between CARDINAL DATE and DATE on the same grounds as earlier and because NORP himself opposed meetings . On DATE the child welfare authorities also prohibited contact between NORP and his grandparents until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities ordered that meetings between S. and NORP and their mother were to take place under supervision . This decision was valid from DATE to DATE . On the same date the child welfare authorities also prohibited contact between S. and NORP and their grandparents until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant mother \u2019s appeals against the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the restrictions concerning the contacts between the applicant mother and PERSON were continued for the period of DATE to CARDINAL DATE . An additional ground for this was that contact with the mother could endanger L. \u2019s health because the meetings between them might cause psychological stress to L. and thus risk worsening his psychotic symptoms . The applicant mother apparently appealed only against the decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG which rejected her appeal on DATE . It is not known whether she appealed further against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the restrictions on contact between the applicant mother and NORP were further continued for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE due to NORP \u2019s child psychiatric examinations . During that period NORP met with his mother on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The applicant mother appealed against this decision to ORG where it is apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant mother \u2019s appeal against the decisions of ORG on DATE , DATE and DATE . The court found restrictions imposed between CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE in respect of all the children justified . As concerned the visits DATE and DATE , the court noted that the dispute concerned only , as far as S. , I. and L. were concerned , whether those meetings needed to be held under supervision . The court noted that , on DATE , the applicant mother had agreed on a visiting schedule , according to which she had met PERSON and NORP in the foster home and PERSON in the foster family at DATE intervals . Visits had been supervised by the staff of the foster home or a foster parent . The applicant mother had also had the possibility to telephone S. , NORP and PERSON , and they had had a possibility to make supervised telephone calls to the applicant mother . In addition , PERSON and NORP could send her letters . The court thus found that there had been legitimate reasons to keep the visits supervised . As concerned NORP , the court found that the restrictions on contact had been legitimate as such restrictions had been necessary due to NORP \u2019s forensic psychiatric examinations . Taking into account NORP \u2019s age , his severe symptoms and the fact that he had repeatedly expressed his unwillingness to meet his mother , the restrictions on contact had been essential for his treatment . Finally , as concerned PERSON , the court found that the restrictions on contact between PERSON and his mother had been essential for his treatment .", "CARDINAL . The supervised meetings between the applicant mother and PERSON and NORP have been quite regular . Since DATE there have also been regular supervised meetings with B. Since DATE the applicant mother has apparently met NORP five times and CARDINAL times under supervision . The last meeting with PERSON was on DATE . The oldest child NORP has apparently only been able to meet his CARDINAL younger siblings once since the emergency care order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social worker responsible for the children \u2019s affairs requested the police to investigate whether the CARDINAL minor children of the family had been sexually abused . Suspicion had been raised during the family work as some of the children had shown excessively sexual behaviour . Even after their placement , such behaviour had become more pronounced when the children had met with their mother or other relatives .", "CARDINAL . The criminal investigation concerning the alleged sexual abuse of the children was finalised in DATE , and the case was transmitted to the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the grandmother and the grandfather for having assaulted the children . The prosecutor decided not to bring charges against the applicant mother for aggravated sexual abuse of the children .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant mother requested the child welfare authorities to terminate the care or , alternatively , change the placement of PERSON and NORP As concerned PERSON , she stated in her application that PERSON \u2019s psychological well - being had been deteriorating in the current foster family . Also the cooperation between her and the foster family had been complicated . As far as NORP was concerned , the applicant mother stated in her application that the foster parent had isolated NORP from his biological family and manipulated him .", "DATE . On DATE the Director of ORG rejected the applicant mother \u2019s application . She found in her decisions that the applicant mother \u2019s situation had not changed and that the legitimate reasons for care continued to exist in relation to both PERSON and NORP Terminating the care at this stage or changing their placement would not have been in the best interest of either of the children .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant mother appealed against these decisions to ORG where they are apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslagen , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) stipulates , as regards the duration and termination of care , as follows :", "\u201c Taking into care is valid indefinitely . When the need for care and substitute care under section CARDINAL no longer exists , the municipal officeholder determined under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) must make a decision on terminating the care when the social worker responsible for the child \u2019s affairs has prepared the case .
