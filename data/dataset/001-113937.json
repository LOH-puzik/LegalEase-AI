HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1-f - Expulsion)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Helen Keller;Ineta Ziemele;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , brothers , were born in DATE and DATE respectively . When introducing the application , they were staying at FAC , located in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were transferred from the GPE to GPE under the GPE II procedure . They were handed over to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the competent alien policing authority , and interviewed with the assistance of a NORP interpreter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants related that they had left GPE illegally in DATE , travelled through GPE and GPE and intended to reach the GPE . They had arrived in GPE , also illegally , later in DATE and had immediately been intercepted by the police . They had applied for asylum on DATE . On DATE the asylum procedure had however been terminated because they had absconded . They had travelled illegally , apparently assisted by traffickers , to the GPE , where they had joined their father and applied for asylum . The GPE had started the GPE II procedure and GPE had agreed to their readmission . On DATE they had been transferred to GPE under this scheme .", "CARDINAL . They alleged that they had been persecuted in GPE because of their father \u2019s former service in PERSON army and their NORP ethnicity . They also claimed that they had no family members living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After the interview , the alien policing authority ordered the applicants\u2019 expulsion to GPE , also imposing a DATE entry ban . According to the decision , the expulsion was necessary because they did not fulfil the requirements of legal residence in GPE . The authority then requested ORG \u2019s asylum directorate to assess whether the principle of \u201c non - refoulement \u201d was applicable . It replied in the negative .", "CARDINAL . In the expulsion decision it was mentioned that the applicants\u2019 illegal entry and lack of residence permits constituted a threat to public order . Considering their age and family status , their expulsion would have no negative effect , since they had no connection to GPE , did not speak NORP and had no skills and therefore their livelihood was not secured and the chances of finding employment were low . It was also established that they did not have NORP or ORG national family members living in GPE , and although their relatives lived in the GPE , they also had some in GPE , so their social reintegration on return was possible . The applicants were entered into ORG \u2019s asylum registry , but the ongoing asylum procedure was not referred to when the reasons for expulsion were addressed . ORG concluded that the enforcement of immigration rules had priority over the personal and family interests of the applicants , and that expulsion was a necessary and proportionate measure .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , the execution of the expulsion was suspended by the ORG \u2019s alien policing authority because the means and conditions necessary for its enforcement were not secured , namely the applicants did not have any travel documents or tickets .", "CARDINAL . The alien policing authority ordered at the same time the applicants\u2019 alien policing detention for TIME , purportedly in order to secure their expulsion . The detention was based on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of FAC ( see below ) , according to which the immigration authority shall have the power to detain the person in question in order to secure the expulsion if \u201c he / she has refused to leave the country , or , based on other substantiated reasons , is allegedly delaying or preventing the enforcement of expulsion \u201d . However , no facts or personal circumstances were presented justifying such a conclusion . The applicants were committed to the LOC alien policing facility .", "CARDINAL . The asylum authority formally registered the applicants\u2019 asylum claim only on DATE , despite the fact that they had been asylum seekers from their very arrival in GPE , in that they had been transferred under the GPE procedure from the GPE ; they had explicitly mentioned at the interview with the alien policing authorities on DATE that they had left GPE because they had been persecuted and that they had already applied for asylum when they had first entered GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A preliminary interview was conducted , and on DATE the asylum applications were admitted to the in - merit procedure . Despite this fact , the applicants remained in alien policing detention although asylum seekers were entitled to accommodation in an open refugee reception centre . According to LAW ) of LAW ( see below ) , once the asylum application is admitted to the in - merit procedure , the alien policing authority shall , at the initiative of ORG \u2019s asylum authority , terminate the asylum seeker \u2019s detention . However , such an initiative was not taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the detention until the execution of expulsion was secured or DATE . Although the initial detention had been based ( see above ) on section CARDINAL ) of FAC , the court found that it had been lawfully ordered under LAW ( see below ) and that its prolongation was necessary . It held that sections DATE , CARDINAL ) and PERSON ) of that LAW were applicable in the case . In the reasoning , reference was made to the fact that the applicants had arrived in GPE illegally and applied for asylum in DATE then again in DATE , as well as to the contents of the expulsion order . No particulars relating to the ongoing asylum procedure were mentioned .", "CARDINAL . The detention was prolonged on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and finally on DATE , until DATE . On each occasion , ORG limited the reasoning to stating that the initial reasons for the detention given in the first court decision were still in place .", "CARDINAL .
