AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a law firm in GPE . ORG PERSON ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant who , at that time , was the Vice - Chancellor of GPE , brought proceedings under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) against ORG , a limited liability company which is the owner of the DATE \u201c Format \u201d , since it had published an article accusing her of corruption . The applicant was represented by counsel in these and the subsequent proceedings .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) found that the accusations voiced against the applicant amounted to defamation and ordered PERSON to withdraw the issue of \u201c Format \u201d , to publish the judgment and to pay compensation to the applicant . That judgment was upheld by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to impose a fine on ORG under LAW of LAW , arguing that it had not duly published the judgment of DATE . In particular , she claimed that , although the judgment had been published in \u201c Format \u201d on DATE , the heading had been incorrect and the publication was smaller and less visible than the incriminated article had been . Subsequently , the applicant filed further identical requests each time a new issue of \u201c Format \u201d was published without rectifying these shortcomings .", "By decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests , finding that the change of heading was irrelevant and that the publication of the judgment was equivalent to the impugned publication in terms of visibility . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal ORG quashed the decision on DATE . It considered that the change of heading was indeed misleading and that the judgment had therefore not been duly published as required by LAW . It ordered Verlagsgruppe News to pay the applicant MONEY ( ORG ) .", "On DATE GPE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s requests made after its initial decision of DATE . It ordered PERSON to pay EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant . PERSON appealed against this decision .", "On DATE ORG partly granted the appeal , dismissing those of the applicant \u2019s requests which had been made after the decision of DATE but before the service of the appeal judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , it reduced the fine to be paid to the applicant .", "Throughout the proceedings under LAW of LAW , the courts took their decisions sitting in camera . The applicant did not request a hearing nor did she complain about the lack of a hearing in her appeals .", "In cases in which publication of a judgment has been ordered but has not been duly and/or timely complied with , LAW of LAW provides that the court shall , upon the claimant \u2019s request and after having heard the media owner , impose a fine on the latter which is payable to the claimant .", "LAW does not provide for the holding of hearings in proceedings concerning the imposition of fines . The courts\u2019 practise is to take decisions under LAW of LAW in camera .", "In the light of the ORG \u2019s PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) ORG found in a judgment of DATE ( CARDINAL ) that the relevant provision , namely section QUANTITY of LAW , which required the courts to hear the claimant but was silent as regards the holding of a public hearing , had to be interpreted in conformity with the requirements of LAW . The courts were therefore required to hold a public hearing . In a judgment of DATE ( G CARDINAL ) ORG confirmed that such an interpretation of section QUANTITY of LAW was in conformity with the constitution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
