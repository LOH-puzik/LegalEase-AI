The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in FAC .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was convicted in CARDINAL judgments of offences including theft , robbery , extortion , assault and dangerous assault and spent DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of attempted murder . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention ( LAW , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in DATE the applicant and an accomplice had shot at CARDINAL policemen several times in order to escape arrest and criminal prosecution following the discovery of their plans to carry out an armed bank robbery using a stolen car . A psychological expert and a neurological expert consulted by the court , who had both examined the applicant in person , confirmed that the applicant was suffering from a personality disorder characterised , in particular , by antisocial conduct , which was , however , not serious enough to be classified as pathological . The court therefore considered that he had acted with full criminal responsibility . The applicant \u2019s preventive detention was necessary as , owing to his criminal tendencies , there was a risk that he might commit similar serious offences in the future and he was thus a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , imposed by the judgment of DATE of ORG , take place in a psychiatric hospital ( Article CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL and Article CARDINALa LAW , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) from DATE , when the applicant would have fully served his prison sentence . According to the report drawn up at the court \u2019s request by an external psychiatric expert , PERSON , the findings of whom the court endorsed , the applicant suffered from schizophrenia simplex characterised by autistic behaviour and from a serious personality disorder . The expert took the view that the applicant had not been diagnosed with that illness before DATE because it was characterised mostly by disorders concerning the affectivity , thinking or personality and less by hallucinations or delusional ideas . He should therefore be transferred to a psychiatric hospital as soon as possible for socio - therapeutic treatment and medication . Without such treatment , the applicant , owing to his tendency to commit serious offences , was a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , having fully served his prison sentence , was placed for the first time in preventive detention , in psychiatric hospitals in ORG and Straubing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention should take place in prison instead of in a psychiatric hospital ( Article NORP \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It considered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital was not helping to rehabilitate him .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the psychiatric expert , PERSON , whom it had consulted in DATE , had taken the view that the applicant \u2019s chronic schizophrenia could be better treated and his rehabilitation better furthered in a psychiatric hospital . A doctor at ORG had considered that the applicant suffered from an antisocial personality disorder and , possibly , from psychosis of a schizophrenic nature . The treating doctors at ORG had , however , taken the view that the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could not be furthered in that clinic as the applicant , who suffered from a schizophrenic - type disorder and antisocial conduct , had persistently refused any of the therapies offered . The Straubing prison authorities had opposed the applicant \u2019s transfer back to prison , arguing that the applicant \u2019s illness could only be treated in a psychiatric hospital . The court , having heard the applicant in person , endorsed the hospital \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the applicant has been detained in a separate wing of ORG for persons in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention in prison was ordered by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was to take place in a psychiatric hospital ( Article CARDINALa LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE ORG quashed that decision for lack of sufficient findings as to the illnesses or disorders from which the applicant suffered and as to the need to treat these in a psychiatric hospital and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the measure of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention be further enforced in prison . It underlined that for the applicant to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital under ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , it was only decisive whether the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could be better furthered thereby ; the preconditions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not have to be met .", "CARDINAL . ORG endorsed the findings of a psychiatric expert , PERSON , it had consulted . The expert had considered that the applicant most probably suffered from a serious personality disorder with antisocial and schizoid elements , but not from schizophrenia simplex . As he refused therapy and his conduct had not changed substantially since DATE he was liable to reoffend if released . The expert held that he should not be transferred to a psychiatric hospital under Article DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . His rehabilitation could not be better furthered by such a transfer , as required by the said provision , because the disorder from which he suffered could not be treated primarily by medication and he refused therapy . Expert PERSON \u2019s findings were contested by the medical director of the psychiatric wing of FAC , who maintained that the applicant suffered from an illness , schizophrenia simplex , which could be adequately treated only in a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue even after completion of DATE in such detention ( Article QUANTITY of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant was liable to commit further offences , in particular assaults and robberies , if released . It further considered that the applicant was not to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital under Article DATE LAW because his rehabilitation could not be better furthered thereby . It referred in this respect to the findings of the psychiatric expert it had consulted , ORG , who had found that the applicant refused treatment in a psychiatric hospital . The court noted that the fact that the applicant suffered from a mental illness and the particular nature of that illness was not decisive for its finding under Article CARDINAL LAW that the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could not be better furthered in a psychiatric hospital . Its view that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention should take place in prison was confirmed by the fact that the applicant \u2019s previous transfer to a psychiatric hospital had not yielded any success .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaching its decision , ORG had regard to the report dated DATE submitted by expert PERSON latter , who had examined the applicant in person , had taken the view that the applicant , an antisocial personality , suffered from a schizophrenic - type disorder characterised by noticeable problems in the person \u2019s conduct , thinking and mood , which gave the impression of schizophrenia , but without any symptoms indicating actual schizophrenia . He had considered that the applicant did not suffer from schizophrenia , a diagnosis made following several previous examinations and as maintained by the medical director of the psychiatric wing of ORG , L. , who still considered that the applicant could be adequately treated only in a psychiatric hospital . Expert PERSON noted that since DATE the applicant was no longer being treated in the psychiatric wing of FAC .", "CARDINAL . NORP The psychiatric expert had further considered that the applicant was likely to reoffend in view of his numerous previous convictions and the fact that he had committed his offences in DATE shortly after having been released from prison . Moreover , he had subsequently been convicted of assault ( in DATE ) and of a drug offence committed in prison ( in DATE ) . He hardly had any social contact outside prison . His personality disorder had not been treated as he had refused psychiatric therapy . He had also refused to apply for relaxations in the conditions of his detention and had announced that he would abscond if granted leave under escort . Measures would need to be taken to prepare his conditional release , such as finding contact persons outside prison , social training and relaxations in the conditions of his detention as soon as this appeared justifiable .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the applicant had served DATE in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it found that there was still a risk that , if released , the applicant , owing to his criminal tendencies , might commit serious offences , in particular assaults , robberies or thefts , resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . His continued preventive detention was therefore still proportionate .", "CARDINAL . ORG endorsed expert PERSON \u2019s finding that the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation would not have been better furthered by his transfer to a psychiatric hospital as he refused treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that his continued preventive detention after completion of DATE on the basis of the amended Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , which had entered into force after he had committed his offence , violated his human dignity , his right to liberty , the prohibition of retrospective punishment and the right not to be punished twice for the same offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the applicant \u2019s complaint had no prospects of success . The criminal courts had verified the continued danger posed by the applicant in accordance with the standards set by LAW . Article CARDINAL of LAW , as amended in DATE , permitted the continued preventive detention , for DATE if necessary , of incorrigible offenders who persisted in refusing any treatment and remained a danger despite their advancing age .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the preventive detention order against the applicant has been executed in a separate wing of ORG for persons in preventive detention . Persons in preventive detention have certain privileges compared with convicted offenders serving their sentence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , at the relevant time , persons in preventive detention had more wide - ranging possibilities to occupy themselves in their spare time ( TIME could be spent outside on DATE ; use of a well - equipped sports room ; additional private telephone calls ) . They had shorter lock - up TIME ( TIME less per day ) , more generous visiting times ( TIME month ) and more wide - ranging opportunities to purchase goods ( CARDINAL extra opportunities to buy a larger variety of goods ) . They further had the right to wear their own underwear , use their own bed linen and bath robes , and have more pocket money . They had bigger cells ( the applicant \u2019s cell measures QUANTITY . m ) which they could equip with bigger TV sets and additional furniture .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is considered by the Straubing prison authorities to be a nervous choleric person filled with hatred . Numerous disciplinary measures have had to be imposed on him , in particular for assaults on fellow prisoners and insults directed at the prison staff . He neither has contact with his fellow prisoners nor does he receive any visits from outside the prison . Since DATE it has no longer been possible to assign him suitable work in prison .", "CARDINAL . As regards the therapy offered to the applicant , he stopped taking medication shortly after having started treatment for schizophrenia simplex with which he was diagnosed in DATE . This led to disturbances in his thinking , insufficient energy and a risk of occasional hallucinations . The legal preconditions for the forced administration of medication have never been met .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was offered psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia simplex with which he had been diagnosed in ORG and Straubing psychiatric hospitals but he was unwilling to undergo treatment .", "CARDINAL . In Straubing Prison the applicant consistently refuses to accept the treatment offered or to meet the psychiatric experts who come to examine him in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue under Article CARDINAL of LAW . Endorsing the findings made by the psychiatric expert it had consulted , ORG , the court found that there was still a risk that the applicant , owing to his criminal tendencies , might commit serious offences if released . There was a risk , in particular , that he might commit assaults and robberies , resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . The court further considered that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention should not take place in a psychiatric hospital under Articles CARDINALa LAW and CARDINAL of LAW because , as had been convincingly shown by the expert , the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could not be better furthered thereby . The fact that the applicant suffered from a psychiatric illness was not decisive for the decision to be taken under the said provisions .", "CARDINAL . The expert consulted by the court , who had to draw up his report on the basis of the case file as the applicant had refused to submit himself for examination , found that the applicant suffered from an antisocial personality disorder , characterised by a lack of empathy , disregard for social rules , aggressive behaviour and a lack of feelings of guilt . He further suffered from a schizophrenic - type disorder , which was generally characterised by eccentric behaviour and abnormalities in the person \u2019s thinking and mood , which gave the impression of schizophrenia without any symptoms indicating actual schizophrenia : the applicant displayed eccentric and mistrustful behaviour , lacked social contact and experienced occasional hallucinations . It was , however , very unlikely that he suffered from schizophrenia simplex . The disorders from which the applicant suffered had still not been treated successfully and he continued to refuse therapy and medication . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation could not be better furthered in a psychiatric hospital , where a lack of disciplinary measures could lead to him displaying even more antisocial conduct . He considered that the applicant should be transferred to a psychiatric hospital under Article DATE LAW if he no longer refused to take the necessary medication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE not to order his immediate release in view of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) . It found that the applicant \u2019s objections had to be examined in different proceedings to be instituted ex officio under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The city of Straubing did not subsequently apply for the applicant to be placed in a psychiatric hospital under LAW NORP ( Mentally Ill Persons\u2019 ) Placement Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The psychiatric expert it had consulted , who had examined the applicant in person , had considered that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder with antisocial and schizoid elements , but not from a schizophrenic psychosis . The applicant \u2019s free will was not impaired by that personality disorder so that the requirements for a placement in a psychiatric hospital under the said Act were not met .", "CARDINAL . Following the leading judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG on preventive detention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , ORG initiated proceedings for a fresh review of whether the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was to be terminated in the light of the principles established in the said judgment . The psychiatric expert consulted in the proceedings had to draw up her report on the basis of the case - file as the applicant refused to have himself examined by her . She took the view that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder ( a schizophrenic - type personality disorder and a dissocial personality ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was his dissocial personality which contributed considerably to his dangerousness . In the expert \u2019s view , it was highly likely that the applicant would commit further violent offences if released . On DATE ORG , endorsing the findings of the psychiatric expert , decided not to declare the execution of the preventive detention order against the applicant terminated . The proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is currently still in preventive detention , imposed by the GPE ORG on DATE and taking place in a separate wing of ORG for persons in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which has not taken place immediately after the judgment ordering it becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is served prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special chamber of ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and applies a measure of probation ; supervision of the person \u2019s conduct ( GPE ) commences with the suspension .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the court ( that is , the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended and a measure of probation applied . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons in preventive detention , this timelimit is DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first period of preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provides that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the offender \u2019s conduct . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . Article DATE of the Criminal Code contains provisions on the transfer of detainees for the execution of a different measure of correction and prevention than the measure ordered in the judgment against them . Under Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL , read in conjunction with \u00a7 CARDINAL , of LAW , the court may subsequently transfer a perpetrator against whom preventive detention was ordered to a psychiatric hospital if the perpetrator \u2019s reintegration into society can be better promoted thereby . The court may quash that decision if it later emerges that no success can be achieved by placing the perpetrator in a psychiatric hospital ( Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The duration of the placement is determined by the provisions which apply to the measure ordered in the judgment ( Article NORP \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The detention of mentally ill persons is provided for , first of all , in LAW as a measure of correction and prevention if the detention is ordered in relation to an unlawful act committed by the person concerned . LAW provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court will order his placement \u2013 without any maximum duration \u2013 in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive assessment of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , pursuant to sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW on the Placement in an Institution of Mentally Ill Persons and Their Care of DATE ( NORP ( Mentally Ill Persons\u2019 ) Placement Act \u2013 Bayerisches Gesetz \u00fcber die PERSON LOC deren GPE ) a court may order a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital at the request of the authorities of a town or county if the person concerned is mentally ill and thereby poses a severe threat to public security and order . Such an order may only be executed as long as no measure under LAW has been taken ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on DATE , following the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) , LAW Gesetz zur Therapierung und PERSON gest\u00f6rter PERSON ) entered into force . Under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Act , the civil sections of ORG may order the placement in a suitable institution of persons who may no longer be kept in preventive detention in view of the prohibition of retrospective aggravations in relation to preventive detention . Such a therapy detention may be ordered if the person concerned has been found guilty by final judgment of certain serious offences for which preventive detention may be ordered under LAW of LAW . The person must further suffer from a mental disorder owing to which it is highly likely that he will considerably impair the life , physical integrity , personal liberty or sexual self - determination of another person . The person \u2019s detention must be necessary for the protection of the public .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and about the retrospective order of the ORG preventive detention respectively ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG stressed that the fact that the LAW stood above the LAW in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and NORP dialogue between the courts , but was , on the contrary , its normative basis in view of the fact that the LAW was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law ( v\u00f6lkerrechtsfreundliche GPE ; see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . It stressed that , in line with that openness of the LAW to public international law , it attempted to avoid breaches of the LAW in the interpretation of LAW ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-a", "5-1-c", "5-1-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
