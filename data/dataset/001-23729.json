FRANCE [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( departement of GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , of ORG . The respondent Government were represented by their agent , Mr PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant acquired parcels of land subject to a prohibition on building in the administrative district ( commune ) of PERSON on FAC ( Charente - Maritime ) . The applicant used the land for caravanning .", "By a ministerial order issued on DATE , the whole of FAC was included in the list of monuments and places of interest whose conservation or preservation was in the public interest from the artistic , historic , scientific , legendary or scenic point of view , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Law of CARDINAL DATE on the conservation of natural monuments and places of interest , as amended .", "The order was published in CARDINAL newspapers distributed in the administrative districts concerned : FAC ( on DATE ) and the DATE Sud - Ouest ( on DATE ) . It was republished in DATE edition of the former and the CARDINAL DATE edition of the latter . The order was also displayed in GPE - Flotte - en - R\u00e9 town hall on DATE and published in the FAC des actes administratifs du d\u00e9partement de la FAC ( ORG of the d\u00e9partement of GPE ) ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL of the consequences of listing was to render PERSON LAW applicable to the entire island . That provision made it illegal to camp or to park a caravan other than on authorised campsites or to create campsites on listed places of interest unless an exemption had been granted under sub - paragraph CARDINAL of the Article .", "On DATE the rural police officer of ORG R\u00e9 reported the applicant for illegally parking caravans .", "The applicant was summoned to answer the charges in ORG . He argued that the proceedings were unlawful , as he had not received individual notification of the listing order and the interference with his right of property was disproportionate . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's submission that the proceedings were unlawful , holding that there was no requirement for individual notification under section CARDINAL of the Law of CARDINAL DATE and ORG and CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE . It further found that the restriction placed on the applicant 's use of the land arose from a public easement that had been created in the general interest and which accordingly did not contravene LAW No . CARDINAL . It found the applicant guilty of parking CARDINAL caravans on his land , contrary to Articles LCARDINAL - CARDINAL , LCARDINAL - CARDINAL , LCARDINAL - CARDINAL , LCARDINAL - CARDINAL , ORG and ORG of LAW . The applicant was ordered to pay a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) and to reinstate the land within DATE , an additional penalty of ORG CARDINAL being imposed for DATE delay . ORG ordered publication of the judgment .", "The applicant appealed against that decision and the public prosecutor lodged a cross appeal . The applicant argued , firstly , that his prosecution was unlawful , as he had not received individual notification of the decision to designate the land , even though such notification was necessary before criminal proceedings could be brought according to an explanatory circular that had been issued on DATE . He added that there was no evidence in the case file that the notification procedure set out in the law of DATE had been followed . As to the merits , he asked ORG to rule on the lawfulness of the administrative decision . He further relied on LAW No . CARDINAL , arguing that he could not have committed an offence , as he had not been awarded proper compensation for the adverse effect the public easement had had on his vested rights and the situation prior to designation . He complained , lastly , that the failure to give him individual notification of the listing order had deprived him of effective access to a court .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the applicant 's preliminary objection that the listing order should have been declared unlawful inadmissible , as it had been made for the first time on appeal whereas it should have been made prior to any defence on the merits . It noted that the applicant had not denied being aware of the listing order 's existence or seriously contended that the notification procedure had not been followed , since he could not properly rely on a non - legally binding circular in the face of the unequivocal wording of LAW of CARDINAL DATE . Accordingly , it dismissed his plea that he had not been notified of the order and held that the authorities had been entitled to proceed by general announcement . ORG observed that creating a public easement in the public interest was not contrary to the LAW , but could entail a right to compensation which it was not for the criminal courts to quantify ; the applicant had not been deprived of effective access to a court , since the applicant had been given proper notice of the order and could either have asked the authorities to reconsider their decision or appealed . It therefore upheld the impugned judgment in its entirety .", "The applicant appealed on points of law against ORG judgment . He complained among other matters that he should have been given individual notification of the listing order , as , although LAW of CARDINAL DATE allowed notice to be given by general announcement rather than individually if CARDINAL landowners were affected by the listing of a place of interest , it also required listing orders that contained special directions to alter the state or use of the land to be notified to the property owner and accompanied by a formal notice . The applicant alleged that he had installed the caravans on the land before the designation decision DATE which made it illegal to park caravans on LOC was issued and had not received any individual notification or formal notice . In his submission , therefore , by wrongly relying in its decision on the fact that he had not denied being personally aware of the designation order , ORG had violated LAW .", "ORG ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law in a judgment of DATE , inter alia , on the following grounds :", "\u201c In finding the accused guilty of the offence , ORG found that the order of DATE did not constitute a designation decision within the meaning of the legislation introduced by the aforementioned PERSON , and in particular section CARDINAL thereof , but merely an order under section CARDINAL of that PERSON for the land to be included in the list of sites of natural beauty in the d\u00e9partement . Accordingly , since \u2013 as the courts below found \u2013 the order affected CARDINAL landowners , the authorities were entitled to use DATE and it is common ground that they did use DATE the general announcement procedure instead of the individual notification procedure prescribed by that section .", "ORG added that , since the Law of CARDINAL DATE and its subsequent implementing legislation did not require a formal notice to be given , such notice only being required when a designation decision was contested by the landowners ... , ' the authorities were entitled to give notice of the order of DATE by general publication ' .", "... in so holding , ORG justified its decision . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the PERSON provided :", "\u201c In each d\u00e9partement there shall be drawn up a list of the natural monuments and places of interest whose conservation or preservation is in the public interest from the artistic , historic , scientific , legendary or scenic point of view . ...", "Listing shall be effected by means of an order made by the Minister for ORG . The decree issued after consultation of the PERSON d'Etat shall lay down the procedure for notifying the listing to the property owners or for publishing it . Publication may replace notification only in cases in which the latter is made impossible by the large number of owners of CARDINAL and the same place of interest or natural monument , or if it is impossible for the authorities to ascertain the identity or address of the owner . On the land within the boundaries laid down in the order , listing shall entail an obligation on those affected not to undertake any works other than those relating to day - to - DATE agricultural use as regards rural land and to normal upkeep as regards buildings without having given the authorities DATE notice of their intention . \u201d", "The relevant provisions of the decree provided :", "\u201c Listing orders shall be notified by the prefect to the owners of natural monuments or places of interest .", "However , when the number of owners affected by the listing of one and the same place of interest or natural monument is greater than a CARDINAL , the procedure of individual notification may be replaced by a general public announcement as provided for in DATE .", "Recourse shall likewise be had to public announcements where the authorities are unable to ascertain the identity or address of the owners . \u201d", "\u201c The public announcements provided for in LAW ... shall be made at the instance of the prefect , who shall have the listing order published in CARDINAL newspapers , CARDINAL of which shall be a DATE newspaper that is distributed in the administrative districts concerned .

It will have the advantage of ensuring that the public are well informed before the listing order is implemented ... \u201d", "The relevant provisions of the Code provide :", "\u201c There shall be no right to compensation for easements created pursuant to this Code for public access , public health , aesthetic or other purposes and concerning matters such as the use of the land , the height of buildings , the proportion of developed and undeveloped land in each property , prohibitions on building in certain areas and along certain roads and the distribution of buildings between different areas .", "However , compensation shall be payable if such easements result in a violation of vested rights or a change in the previous condition of the land that causes direct , pecuniary and indisputable damage .
