He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A. Particular circumstances of the present case", "By judgment of DATE , ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE convicted the applicant of offences under LAW ( PERSON ) and membership of a criminal organisation and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and payment of a fine of ORG . CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings in the course of which hearings were held on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of participation in offences under LAW and membership of a criminal organisation and sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment and payment of a fine of ORG . CARDINAL .", "The evidence before ORG consisted of , inter alia , the verbatim records of the hearing on DATE of Mr Brand , head of the regional police force GPE , before the parliamentary commission of inquiry for investigation methods , statements made by the applicant in the course of the investigation and the trial proceedings , formal records ( proces - verbaal ) on the investigation , statements made by witnesses before the police and verbatim records of tapped telephone conversations .", "ORG rejected the arguments raised by the defence that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible on grounds that the fair trial principle within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Convention had been violated in that the prosecution had insufficiently disclosed information about the criminal investigation at issue and that evidence had been obtained by use of an unlawful method of investigation , i.e. allowing imported drugs to reach their destination . ORG held on these points :", "< Translation >", "\u201c Admissibility of the prosecution ...", "It has not appeared that ORG has refused to provide information or that acts have been performed or findings have been made in the context of the investigation of the facts at issue which have not been related in formal records . It appears clearly from the case - file that the investigation started with the interrogation of PERSON on DATE and DATE in GPE in GPE .", "O.G. made a statement about the involvement of \u201c M. \u201d in the importation of cocaine , as well as of ORG , owner of the sport school B. Gym in GPE . On the basis of this information , a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) was opened on DATE against PERSON and on DATE against PERSON , ORG owner of ORG in GPE . It appeared from these investigations that PERSON had close contacts with PERSON and that the latter had almost daily contacts with PERSON On the basis of this information , preliminary judicial investigations were opened on CARDINAL DATE against NORP and PERSON It appeared from these investigations that PERSON had regular contacts with inter alia a certain PERSON , whose name turned out to be J.W.A. PERSON . On the basis of this information , a preliminary judicial investigation was opened on DATE against PERSON .", "Chief Inspector PERSON , head of the PERSON - team , stated under oath in the first instance trial proceedings that in the course of the investigation no use was made of information from ORG ( Criminele Inlichtingen ORG : hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "Contrary to what the defence contend , it does not appear from the questioning by the parliamentary commission of inquiry of ORG that according to the latter other than normal methods of investigation were used in this case . Quite the opposite , since when Brand apparently speaks about the case at issue , he refers to it - insofar as the alleged importation of cocaine is concerned - as a case in which \u201c the traditional methods have been applied \u201d and - insofar as the alleged importation of marihuana is concerned - as \u201c a case in which we have applied classical methods of criminal investigation \u201d .", "The argument of the defence relating to a decision of non - prosecution ( sepot ) having been issued in the case against ORG has , following information obtained in the course of the trial proceedings , proved to be incorrect and not to be borne out by the facts . The Procurator General has been informed by the ORG public prosecutor dealing with that case that it is absolutely untrue that PERSON was an informer .", "The defence have insufficiently substantiated their contention that another informer besides ORG may have been used .", "Neither the formal records nor any other source give reason to presume that there may be a demonstrable direct link between any other ( criminal ) investigation than the CARDINAL described in the formal records and the present case . This is not altered by the fact that the police was said to have procured a position for themselves from where it was possible to obtain information in the period from DATE until DATE . ( \u201c PERSON anderszins blijkt van een ernstig vermoeden dat er een direct verband aanwijsbaar is QUANTITY onderzoek dan in het proces - verbaal is gerelateerd en deze zaak . De stelling dat de politie zich in de periode DATE tot begin DATE een informatiepositie zou hebben verworven doet daaraan niet af . \u201d )", "In view of the above , no indications can be found either in the case - file or in the facts and circumstances argued by the defence that the formal records in casu were incomplete and that LAW was contravened or that any methods of criminal investigation other than the usual methods were deployed .", "The fair trial principle ( LAW ) has in the ORG \u2019s opinion , therefore , not been violated .", "...", "Lawfulness of the evidence obtained", "Counsel has argued that there is a serious suspicion that use has been made of an unlawful method of investigation , namely the delivery of drugs ... ORG rejects this argument and refers to its considerations as regards the admissibility of the prosecution ... \u201c", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE under LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development .
