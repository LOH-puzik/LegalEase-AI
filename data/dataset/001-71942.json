POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for DATE in view of the strong suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL counts of burglary . It considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence , given the fact that he had only partly confessed . Further , the court referred to the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by going into hiding . In that regard , the court relied on evidence from CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - suspects , who had stated that , shortly before having been arrested , the applicant had tried to leave for GPE in order to evade serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been previously imposed on him . Finally , the court had regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of burglary . He confessed to CARDINAL counts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the investigation . On DATE he filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant had been indicted on CARDINAL charges of burglary and CARDINAL charge of assault . There were CARDINAL other defendants in the case . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE the trial court listed CARDINAL hearings ( for DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and CARDINAL January , DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . All those hearings were cancelled for various reasons , usually because the police had failed to bring the accused from prison .", "CARDINAL . The trial began on DATE . The subsequent hearings were held on DATE , DATE and DATE . At the hearing held on the latter date ORG fined CARDINAL witnesses who had failed to appear .", "CARDINAL . ORG several times prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention , holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and that , given his attempt to leave GPE and the resultant risk that he might go into hiding or tamper with evidence , as well as the fact that he had only partly confessed , keeping him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the anticipated penalty . Lastly , the court had regard to the fact that the applicant had a previous conviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant decisions were given on DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending his detention until CARDINAL DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging that period until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending his detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging his detention until CARDINAL DATE ) and on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal against the prolongation of his detention , ORG ( PERSON ) instructed ORG to take determined measures with a view to speedily terminating the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an application to ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) pursuant to LAW ( Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego ) , asking for the applicant \u2019s detention to be prolonged beyond the statutory time - limit of DATE . The court stressed that , due to the complex nature of the case , it had so far been impossible for it to open the trial and that the applicant should be kept in custody since the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It relied on the same grounds as previously invoked by ORG . It noted that the applicant had attempted to flee the country . Furthermore , ORG considered that the trial court had not been responsible for the delays incurred in the proceedings to date . In this respect , it referred , inter alia , to the fact that CARDINAL hearings had been cancelled since the police had failed to bring the accused from prison . On the other hand , it considered that prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE would give the ORG sufficient time to conclude the proceedings , provided that it accelerated its examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made yet another application under LAW of LAW , asking ORG to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It stressed that it had still been impossible for it to begin the trial and that the grounds previously given for keeping the applicant in custody were still valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly granted the application and ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE . It drew ORG attention to the fact that it had not stated any concrete reasons to justify the fact that the proceedings had not been terminated within the time - limit of DATE specified in LAW of LAW . In ORG view , the laconic statement of ORG that the trial had not been concluded for reasons which could not be attributed to it , was not sufficient . ORG also criticised the fact that DATE and DATE ORG had listed only CARDINAL hearings . A hearing scheduled for DATE was cancelled because not all of the victims had been properly summoned , while the hearing listed for DATE was cancelled due to the holiday of CARDINAL of the counsel . ORG further noted that on DATE a new judge had been assigned to the case . However , it noted that ORG had not taken any significant measures aimed at concluding the proceedings , as had been indicated in the earlier decisions of ORG and ORG . It lastly stressed that the case was not particularly complex and suggested that ORG should properly organise the trial and terminate it by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE . All the applicant \u2019s earlier applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention had been to no avail .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , defines detention on remand as CARDINAL of the so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) .

Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and , exceptionally , also in order to prevent an accused \u2019s committing another , serious offence ; they may be imposed only if the evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL lists grounds for detention on remand . It provides , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand may be imposed if :", "( CARDINAL ) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding , in particular when his identity can not be established or when he has no permanent abode [ in GPE ] ;", "( CARDINAL ) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [ witnesses or co - defendants ] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means ;", "CARDINAL . NORP If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of CARDINAL CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to CARDINAL CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Code sets out the conditions governing the continuation of a specific preventive measure . Article CARDINAL reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , in its relevant part , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The DATE Code not only sets out maximum statutory time - limits for detention on remand but also , in LAW , lays down that the relevant court \u2013 within those time - limits \u2013 must in each detention decision determine the exact time for which detention shall continue .", "Article CARDINAL sets out time - limits for detention .

Only ORG may , on application made by the court before which the case is pending or , at the investigation stage , on application made by ORG , prolong detention on remand for a further fixed period exceeding the periods referred to in DATE , when it is necessary in connection with a stay of the proceedings , for the purpose of a prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused or a prolonged preparation of an expert report , when evidence needs to be obtained in a particularly complex case or from abroad or when the accused has deliberately prolonged the proceedings , as well as on account of other significant obstacles that could not be overcome . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
