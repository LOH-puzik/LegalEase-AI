POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP nationals . The first applicant was born in DATE , the second applicant was born in DATE . They both live in GPE .", "They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "s , may be summarised as follows :", "The applicants are CARDINAL businessmen running a non - commercial partnership ( sp\u00f3\u0142ka cywilna ) . On an unspecified date in DATE a trustee of an estate of a certain insolvent company sued the applicants in ORG ( Commercial Division ) ( ORG ) for payment of a debt . On a further unspecified date the applicants filed a counter - claim .", "On DATE the court held a hearing . During the hearing the applicants requested the court to fix a new hearing date for the end of the fruit season . The court granted their request and listed the next hearing for DATE , which was duly recorded in the minutes . Subsequently , during the same hearing , the applicants also requested the court to synchronise this hearing with a hearing before the same court , which was to be held in another case to which the applicants were parties .", "On DATE the applicants were not present at the hearing as they considered that a summons should be served on them in order to confirm the hearing date . On DATE the court gave judgment ordering the applicants to pay the sum sought by the plaintiff . It rejected their counter - claim .", "A copy of the judgment was not served on the applicants . They became aware of the judgment and its content as late as DATE . On DATE they filed an appeal and a request to grant them retrospective leave to appeal out of time . They submitted that , to their understanding , on DATE the court had not definitely fixed a new hearing date and therefore they had waited for a formal notification . The applicants also requested the court to rectify TIME of the hearing of DATE by inserting the following paragraph : \u201c The court revises its order concerning the date of the next hearing and it will fix the date ex officio , synchronising it with a hearing in a case no . ... . The court shall notify the parties of that date . \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' request for leave to appeal out of time . The court found that TIME of the hearing had unambiguously indicated that the date of the next hearing had been fixed for DATE and the court had correctly considered that the applicants had been duly notified of the hearing . The court also took into account the fact that the plaintiff had had no doubts as to the date of the hearing in question . Moreover , the applicants had been represented by a lawyer and any potential misunderstanding could have not been considered as a plausible justification for their failure to appeal within the prescribed time - limit . The applicants appealed against this decision .", "On DATE ORG ( FAC ) upheld the contested decision . The court observed that a party to the proceedings was expected to act with all due diligence and if the applicants had had any doubts as to the definite hearing date , they could easily have verified them .", "On DATE a single judge , sitting as ORG dismissed the applicants ' request to rectify TIME of the hearing . The court based its decision on the same grounds as those contained in the decision dismissing the applicants ' request for leave to appeal out of time . On DATE the applicants ' further appeal was dismissed by the same court , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges .", "Subsequently , the applicants unsuccessfully requested the Minister of ORG for leave to file an extraordinary appeal . In letters of DATE and of CARDINAL DATE the Minister informed them that he would not examine the requests as both the proceedings concerning their request for leave to appeal out of time and the proceedings relating to their request for rectification of the minutes were still pending . In a letter of DATE the Minister informed them that he could not rule on their request for leave to file an extraordinary appeal in respect of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE because such a leave could not be granted in a commercial case after the expiry of DATE from the date on which the judgment had become final . In respect of the second decision , the Minister found that there was no basis for granting the applicants leave to file an extraordinary appeal .", "B.
