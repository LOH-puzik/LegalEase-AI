There is a group that is grabbing public attention because of the black robes [ c\u00fcppe ] worn by its members , the sticks they carry and their habit of chanting [ zikir ] . How can this group be described \u2013 it is called a sect [ tarikat ] , but is it really a community or group ?

We will also be phoning a number of guests to hear their views . On the subject of the black robes , we 'll be talking on the phone to PERSON , a stylist and expert on black clothing . We 'll also be hearing the views of PERSON and PERSON on NORP . As regards PERSON , we 'll be calling CARDINAL of its most important leaders . The GPE group DATE or sect \u2013 has views on religious matters as well . We 'll be discussing those with Mr Y. NORP , of ORG . And while we are on the subject , viewers may phone in with questions for the GPE ' leader , PERSON ... \u201d", "PERSON , a stylist taking part in the programme via a telephone link , asked PERSON a number of questions about women 's clothing .

It is a religion \u2013 that is , it is the name of a religion that has destroyed ORG and taken its place . Kemalism is a religion and secularism has no religion .

He stated :", "PERSON : \u201c A sect such as the CARDINAL you belong to may observe a religion . But concepts such as democracy , philosophy and free thought do not observe a religion , because they are not creatures who can establish a moral relationship with God . In a democracy all people are free to choose their religion and may choose either to adhere to a religion or to call themselves atheists . Those who wish to manifest their religion in accordance with their belief may do so . Moreover , [ democracy ] encompasses pluralism , liberty , democratic thought and diversity . This means that the people 's desire will be fulfilled , because the people may elect party A DATE and party B tomorrow and then ask for a coalition to be formed DATE . All that is dictated by the people . That is why , in a democracy , everything is free , and secularism and democracy are CARDINAL related concepts .

And you call that ' having no religion ' DATE that 's your problem . But in a law - based , democratic , PERSON and secular ORG all people are free to manifest their religion . Behind closed doors , they may practise their religion through chanting , worship or prayer ; they may read what they like , the Koran , the Bible or philosophy \u2013 that is their choice . So I 'm sorry , but your views are demagoguery . Kemalism has no connection with religion . It respects religion ; all people are entitled to believe in a religion of their choice . \u201d", "M.G. : \u201c Yes .

For example , the running of a province by a governor in accordance with the rules of the Koran is equivalent to a prayer .
