The applicant married PERSON in DATE . They had CARDINAL children . The marriage broke down and the applicant applied for divorce . PERSON left the marital home at DATE . The children remained with the applicant who , in DATE , had applied to ORG ( \u201c the CSA \u201d ) to obtain financial support from their father for bringing up the children . There had been an oral agreement that he pay GBP CARDINAL maintenance per week towards the support of the children . According to the applicant , some payments had been voluntarily made but they had rapidly ceased . She only had a limited income from a part - time evening job and child benefit and even when she obtained full - time secretarial employment in DATE she was struggling financially .", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not send a Maintenance Enquiry Form ( ORG ) to PERSON until DATE , which resulted in the applicant losing the opportunity to receive maintenance for the period prior to that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr K returned the ORG accepting paternity . Insufficient information was given to allow a full maintenance assessment to be made . An interim maintenance assessment ( ORG ) was issued with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr K \u2019s liability changed many times after DATE , inter alia as his employment changed and it proved difficult to obtain information .", "CARDINAL . According to the summary in the later High Court judgment , the key features were as follows :", "CARDINAL . By DATE arrears of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL had accumulated .", "CARDINAL . The ORG negotiated an agreement with PERSON that he would pay under the ORG , GBP MONEY per week plus GBP CARDINAL towards arrears .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a liability order was applied for because he had breached the agreement . The order was discontinued when regular payments were resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG issued an apology to the applicant for the inconvenience caused by the delay in issuing the ORG and paid her GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , comprising the amount of child support she might have received up to that point if the ORG had been sent at the proper time , namely ORG ( inclusive of interest ) , and ORG ex gratia compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG issued a further apology about the service which she had received and made an additional \" consolatory \" compensation payment of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE , the ORG paid the arrears not yet received plus interest for the delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a second application for a liability order was granted for GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , covering arrears from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . Payments were not made and bailiffs were instructed to levy distress , but were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the liability order was registered as a county court debt . Consideration was given to a committal order but the policy was to use this only as a last resort .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deduction of earnings order ( ORG ) was issued for GBP MONEY per month , increased to GBP CARDINAL on DATE . Following this Mr K again stopped paying . EOs on the company of which he was a director proved unsuccessful . In an interview with the CSA Mr K alleged that he had stopped paying as CARDINAL of the qualifying children had been living with him for DATE and a third had moved in recently , while the fourth had gone to live with the mother in GPE . The ORG was aware of the changed circumstances of the children and had taken this into account in assessments . Having established that the applicant was permanently resident in GPE the case was closed on DATE with effect from DATE . Arrears remained due however and the ORG continued to seek to enforce them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a committal hearing was held . Mr K admitted owing GBP CARDINAL for the period CARDINAL DATE to DATE and ORG for the period DATE until DATE . He agreed to pay the former sum by DATE and the latter sum at GBP DATE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Payment was not made in DATE . He was contacted on DATE and told that unless payment was made by DATE committal proceedings would be restored . A payment of GBP CARDINAL was made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings under LAW DATE ( ORG ) , seeking a declaration that the provisions of LAW DATE were incompatible with LAW as they denied a parent with care of children access to court in connection with disputes as to whether the absent parent had paid or ought to pay sums due under a maintenance assessment or as to the manner in which the obligations under the maintenance assessment should be enforced and seeking damages under LAW ORG based on the ORG \u2019s undue delay after DATE in taking steps to enforce the child maintenance assessments obtained in this case . She maintained that she had expended much energy and suffered much stress in attempting to get the ORG to obtain payments for her and had been repeatedly told that the dispute was between the ORG and Mr K and did not involve herself ; she believed that she would not have received a fraction of the money eventually paid if she had not continually pressurised the ORG and complained of their inaction and inability to obtain maintenance for her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr Justice Wall found that the applicant had a civil right to seek maintenance for her children from their father , such right being an autonomous substantive right , plainly recognised in LANGUAGE law and provided for by domestic legislation . The exclusion of the claimant from the enforcement process imposed a procedural bar on the prosecution / enforcement of the claim which engaged LAW . He found that the court was given jurisdiction by the ORG such that if the ORG had acted in any way incompatible with the claimant \u2019s LAW rights she could bring an action for damages under section CARDINAL , while any decision by the CSA not to enforce or any failure to enforce timeously or effectively would be subject to challenge by judicial review . On this basis the scheme under LAW was ORG compliant and she was not entitled to a declaration of incompatibility . He issued directions with a view to an eventual trial as to whether there had been undue delay and to determine any damages . This part of the order was stayed pending appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the Secretary of ORG \u2019s appeal and dismissed the applicant \u2019s cross - appeal . It held , as summarised in the head note :", "\" that LAW DATE introduced a new child support system , its self- contained nature being a critical feature of its effect in domestic law ; that the scheme was built firmly on the central premise that the assessment , collection and enforcement of maintenance orders should be in the hands of ORG and consequentially it redefined the rights and obligations of parents and those caring for children ; that there was no justification for departing from the general principle that LAW was concerned only with disputes recognisable as such under domestic law and founded on the existence of an underlying right ; that under the scheme the applicant had no legal right in domestic law to a child maintenance payment of any particular amount or at all ; and that , accordingly , she was unable to assert that she had an arguable civil right under LAW which entitled her to a determination by a court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further held that the judge had erred in finding that she had a right to damages to supplement her limited right of judicial review ; damages could only be awarded where the LAW was incompatible with LAW did not become incompatible because of a lack of entitlement to damages for its incompatibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE of PERSON stated in rejecting the appeal :", "\" [ CARDINAL ] That a caring parent in the position of PERSON was given no right of recovering or enforcing a claim to child maintenance against an absent or non - resident parent was not a lacuna or inadvertent omission in the DATE Act : it was the essence of the new scheme , a deliberate departure from the regime which had previously obtained . The merits of that scheme are not for the ORG in its judicial capacity to evaluate . But plainly the scheme did not lack a coherent rationale . The state has an interest , most directly in cases where public funds are disbursed , but also more generally that children should be adequately supported . It might well be thought that a single professional agency , with the resources of the state behind it and an array of powers at its command , would be more consistent in assessing and more effective and economical in enforcing payment than individual parents acting in a random and uncoordinated way . It might also be thought that the interposition of an independent , neutral , official body would reduce the acrimony which had all too frequently characterised applications for child maintenance by caring against absent or non - resident parents in the past which , however understandable in the aftermath of a fractured relationship , rarely enured to the benefit of the children . For better or worse , the process was deliberately changed .", "[ CARDINAL ] The DATE Act can not in my opinion be interpreted as conferring any right on a parent in the position of PERSON She is of course the person to whom child maintenance will be paid , directly or indirectly and subject to any deduction of benefit , as the person who incurs the expense of bringing up the children . But the right which she had enjoyed under the former legislation was removed , and the right to recover the maintenance has been vested in the CSA ... \"", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON of GPE , dissenting , found that prior to the DATE Act a father had , at common law , a duty to maintain his legitimate minor children which had always been unenforceable in the courts . However it had been expanded and reinforced by CARDINAL kinds of statutory obligation : a private law obligation to make the payments ordered by a court under various statutes ( e.g. matrimonial and family proceedings ) and a public law obligation to reimburse the ORG for benefits paid for the children . The new scheme which transferred the task of assessing and collecting maintenance from the courts did not however remove these obligations or the corresponding right of the child to benefit from them . The obligation of a parent to maintain his children and the right of the children to have the benefit of the parental obligation to maintain them were not wholly contained in the CARDINAL LAW . LAW left all previous law intact save precluding courts from using their powers in cases where the ORG was supposed to do it for them . Accordingly the children \u2019s civil right to parental support survived the DATE Act which acted not only as a limit to the extent of the obligation but also as a limit to its enforcement . Article CARDINAL was therefore engaged .", "CARDINAL . In assessing whether the limitations on enforcement of those rights was compatible with the ORG , ORG noted that there was undoubtedly a legitimate aim . Although the non - enforceability by the custodial parent in non - benefit cases was not a necessary feature of comparable child support schemes elsewhere in the common law world , the matter had been debated . That possibility was rejected as the ORG did not want to create CARDINAL law for the rich and CARDINAL for the poor . There were also cases where the parent with care was sometimes in receipt of benefits and at other times not . She concluded that this was just the sort of policy choice in a socio - economic field which the courts were usually prepared to leave to the judgment of ORG , which was best able to make the decision as to which scheme would most effectively secure the recognition and enforcement of the children \u2019s rights generally . It would be difficult to hold that the scheme as a whole was incompatible with the children \u2019s rights to a speedy determination and enforcement of their claims . That said , she considered that the public authority charged by ORG with securing those rights was under a duty to act compliantly with LAW . She would therefore have allowed the appeal and restored Mr Justice Wall \u2019s order .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , all money owed to the applicant was paid by DATE and her case was closed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
