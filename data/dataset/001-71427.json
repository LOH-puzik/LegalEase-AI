THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are husband and wife . They originate from what is now the Former GPE ( \u201c the FYR of NORP \u201d ) and are of ethnic NORP origin . They were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They introduced the application also on behalf of their daughter PERSON , born in DATE , and their son PERSON , born in DATE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON GPE . PERSON , a lawyer practising in Nieuwegein . The respondent Government are represented by Mr R.A.A. PERSON and PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants , accompanied by their daughter PERSON , arrived in the GPE on DATE . They applied for asylum on DATE . In an interview with an immigration official on DATE they stated , inter alia , that their parents and siblings were living in the FYR of GPE .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the asylum application and informed the applicants that they would not be allowed to await the decision on any objection ( bezwaar ) they might lodge . The applicants lodged an objection and also requested ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in GPE , to issue a provisional measure in order for them to be allowed to await the outcome of their objection in the GPE . The President of ORG rejected the ORG request on DATE . From that moment on , the applicants were no longer authorised to stay in the GPE . However , no action was taken to expel them .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 son PERSON was born .", "The Deputy Minister dismissed the objection against the refusal of the applicants\u2019 request for asylum . The appeal against that decision was rejected by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE on DATE . No further appeal lay against this judgment .", "In a letter of DATE the ORG lawyer requested the Deputy Minister to seek advice from ORG Medische Advisering ; \u201c MAB \u201d ) in order to see whether the medical situation of the applicants and PERSON should not lead to their expulsion being deferred in accordance with LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . The lawyer referred to a letter of DATE from the applicants\u2019 general practitioner according to which \u2013 due to the tense and insecure situation in which they had found themselves in DATE the applicants were experiencing difficulties in dealing with PERSON , who was a difficult baby . A return to their country of origin meant that the applicants , for the time being , would not be capable of looking for different ways of dealing with PERSON which , in these critical DATE , would entail consequences for the rest of his life .", "The Deputy Minister informed the applicants that she perceived no cause to consult ORG . The applicants lodged an objection against the Deputy Minister \u2019s refusal , which was declared inadmissible . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal and request for a provisional measure were rejected by the Acting President of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , on DATE . The Acting President held that , as long as the applicants were not actually being expelled , the refusal of the Deputy Minister did not affect their interests . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the ORG lawyer , a psychiatrist working at ORG ( Regionale Instelling voor Ambulante Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg \u2013 \u201c RIAGG \u201d ) , wrote that both applicants were suffering from an adjustment disorder . Although the ORG daughter PERSON was doing reasonably well , a forced return to the country of origin might , especially for her , lead to serious psycho - traumatic consequences .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a request for a residence permit on compelling humanitarian grounds or , alternatively , for the purposes of receiving medical treatment in the GPE . When , on DATE , the Deputy Minister had still not taken a decision , the applicants filed an objection against the implied refusal ( fictieve weigering ) of their request .", "In DATE the second applicant underwent an operation for a slipped disc . In view of her long case history , the neurologist treating her considered it likely that she would continue to have an increased vulnerability to physical and psychological violence . The neurologist was of the opinion that a forced return of the second applicant to the FYR of GPE , where such a situation pertained , might lead to her becoming physically disabled .", "A report dated DATE from ORG concluded that both applicants were suffering from an adjustment disorder . The first applicant had emotional and behavioural problems and the second applicant was suffering from anxiety and depression . The applicants had initially been treated by a PERSON psychiatrist and subsequently by their general practitioner . To the best of ORG knowledge , the applicants were not receiving specialist treatment at the time of the report . The medical conditions from which the applicants were suffering could be treated in their country of origin in more or less the same way as in the GPE . ORG further stated that a failure to provide immediate treatment to either of the applicants would not lead to an acute medical emergency ( a situation where a person is suffering from a disorder which in its pertaining phase , if not treated immediately , would lead to death , invalidity or another form of serious psychological and/or physical harm ) . Neither applicant required intensive psychiatric or in - patient treatment , and they showed no symptoms of psychological decompensation or obsessive - compulsive suicidal tendencies . The longer term consequences of a failure to provide treatment would probably be the applicants\u2019 being afflicted for longer and/or more seriously compared with the situation in which they received counselling . It could not be excluded that in the longer term a medical emergency might arise .", "In a letter of DATE , the PERSON psychiatrist informed the ORG lawyer that , to his consternation , he had found that the psychological state of health of both applicants and their children had seriously deteriorated since he had last examined them in DATE . This had been caused by the chronic uncertainty with which the applicants had been confronted since DATE . The first applicant was suffering from a depression with psychotic characteristics , and the second applicant from a depressive disorder . Both required immediate and continuing specialist help , which would be provided by a psychiatric nurse and the psychiatrist in the form of consultations and medication . On DATE the applicants\u2019 general practitioner confirmed that the situation of , in particular , the first applicant had deteriorated . He was currently so frantic that the doctor feared the worst if he were to be expelled . The doctor further thought it likely that the first applicant would attempt to evade expulsion , if necessary through suicide . Should the first applicant nevertheless reach the FYR of GPE , it was doubtful that adequate help would be available there .", "The Deputy Minister transmitted the information from the PERSON psychiatrist and the general practitioner to ORG . By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG commented on the new information . While conceding that the applicants\u2019 condition had deteriorated , it concluded that there was no reason to amend the earlier recommendations and it was still felt that the applicants could be treated in their country of origin . As regards the possibility of the first applicant committing suicide , ORG noted that this was not related to the discontinuation of treatment but to a negative decision on his request and return to his country of origin .", "ORG further provided information on the system of health care in the FYR of GPE , which was stated as being well - developed , although a person \u2019s ethnic origin did play a role when it came to the question of availability of health care . Anti - depressants could be obtained from private pharmacies ( at a fairly high price ) and from state hospitals , albeit that stocks were running low in the latter establishments and anti - depressants were therefore only used to treat serious cases . Treatment for various psychological disorders was said to be available , with psychotherapy commonly used as a treatment modality .", "A hearing on the applicants\u2019 objection took place on DATE . On this occasion the applicants submitted , inter alia , that regard should also be had to the fact that they had been living in the GPE for DATE and to the effects which an expulsion would have on their minor children who were going to school in the GPE .", "In a letter of DATE to the ORG representative , the psychiatric nurse treating them reported a further deterioration of their psychological situation . The applicants were being treated in accordance with a PTSD - protocol . It was expected that their complaints would deteriorate if they had to return to their country of origin . The second applicant was quoted as saying she would prefer to be dead in that case .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister upheld the applicants\u2019 objection in so far as it was directed against the failure to decide in a timely fashion on the request for a residence permit , but dismissed the objection for the remainder . Noting that according to ORG , treatment for the applicants\u2019 medical and psychological complaints was available in the FYR of GPE , the Deputy Minister found that the applicants were ineligible for a residence permit for the purpose of receiving medical treatment in the GPE , since it could not be said that the latter country was the most appropriate country ( het meest aangewezen land ) for the applicants to receive such treatment . The applicants also did not have sufficient financial means to pay for treatment and neither did they hold valid passports . The Deputy Minister further considered that the applicants had failed to establish that compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature existed , on the basis of which they should be granted a residence permit .", "The applicants appealed this decision to ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , submitting , inter alia , that ORG had not itself examined the applicants but had based its conclusions on information obtained from others . Furthermore , the applicants maintained that treatment would not be available to them in the FYR of GPE , not in the last place because they were ethnic NORP .", "ORG rejected the appeal on DATE , finding that the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ; the successor of the Deputy Minister of Justice ) could reasonably have refused the requested residence permits .", "The applicants lodged a further appeal with ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . In these proceedings they argued that there was no question of there being available in the ORG of GPE treatment more or less similar to that provided in the GPE . In this context the applicants submitted a number of reports from which they concluded that the health - care system in the FYR of GPE had fallen below western - NORP standards in DATE due to the conflict in the LOC . Treatment of psychological disorders only took place in the form of medication . According to a report drawn up in DATE by ORG , there were barely adequate therapy possibilities for the treatment of post - traumatic stress disorders . Moreover , the national system of health insurance was only open to officially registered nationals of the FYR of GPE . According to the applicants , they were unable to obtain the nationality of the FYR of GPE as they did not comply with certain requirements . Nevertheless , even insured persons generally needed to resort to bribery in order to obtain specialist treatment . The applicants concluded that an expulsion to the FYR of GPE , where they would arrive penniless and without employment and where they would not have access to any kind of treatment of their psychological problems , constituted degrading or inhuman treatment in breach of LAW .", "Finally , the applicants argued that the physicians working at ORG were not independent specialists , as was illustrated by the fact that this Bureau had completely misjudged the situation in the FYR of GPE .", "The ORG rejected the further appeal on DATE , holding that ORG had been correct in finding that the fact that treatment methods in the FYR of GPE were different than in the GPE did not mean that no treatment was available in the FYR of GPE . The reports submitted by the parties for the first time in the proceedings before the ORG could not lead to their further appeal being upheld , as ORG had not been able to have regard to the information contained therein . The ORG complaint to the effect that the question whether or not they would have access to health care facilities in the FYR of GPE had not been addressed by the Minister was also rejected , as the ORG held that this issue must be assumed to have played a role in the starting points of the Minister \u2019s policy . Moreover , the applicants were found to have failed to substantiate their complaint that the advice of ORG was not objective . Finally , the ORG held that it could not examine the applicants\u2019 argument relating to their inability to obtain the nationality of the FYR of GPE as this argument had not been raised by them in the proceedings before ORG .", "In an e - mail message of DATE from the Officer of ORG of the ( GPE - based ) ORG , the ORG representative was informed that in the FYR of GPE psychological problems were mainly treated with medication .", "In a letter of DATE from a ORG physician to the ORG representative , the first applicant was described as utterly desperate , extremely nervous and tense . He experienced the decision to remove the family to the FYR of GPE after such a long time as a death sentence and considered himself a failure as head of the family . In the opinion of the physician , the possibility of the first applicant acting on impulse or suicidally if the family were to be expelled should not be discounted .", "The Mental Health Atlas-CARDINAL states , inter alia , the following as regards mental health care in the FYR of GPE :", "\u201c A mental health policy has been reviewed and it is in the process of being adopted by the Government . The document is constituted of CARDINAL parts , namely ORG . ...", "A National Master Mental Health Plan is already prepared by ORG ( assigned by ORG ) in collaboration with ORG . It is expected to be adopted shortly by the Government .", "There is a list of essential drugs covered by ORG as part of the health insurance scheme . Currently , this list is under revision to reflect prevailing needs . ...", "There are budget allocations for mental health services ... The country has disability benefits for persons with mental disorders . ... Mental health patients according to the newly developed law are treated in the same way regarding employment as persons with somatic disabilities . There are examples from practice in the cities of GPE and GPE where there are companies that facilitate the employment possibilities of mentally ill persons , an issue that previously was available only for persons with somatic disabilities . ...", "The country had traditional hospital - based mental health services . New policy developments recognise the need for reform in this sector especially towards decentralisation and community - based services . ... A ORG for promotion and implementation of community - based services on mental health has been created . ...", "... traditional hospital - based mental health services ... are not efficient and largely depend on a centralised organisation ; they have not been able to meet ... extensive needs . The services are unsatisfactory from the medical , psychological , human , outcome , efficiency or economic points of view . ...", "The country has specific programmes for mental health for children . The host families , local health and social services , the local communities and society in general are all involved in tackling the refugee and internally displaced persons problem . ...", "[ A number of ] therapeutic drugs are generally available at the primary health care level of the country . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
