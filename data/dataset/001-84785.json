ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr Y. GPE .", "In DATE the applicant entered into a civil contract , agreeing to solicit clients for ORG , a private company . Following expiration of the contract in DATE , the ORG was to pay the applicant a certain percentage of the revenue brought by the clients referred by him . Additionally , under the contract the ORG was obliged to cover the applicant \u2019s travel and accommodation expenses , and , in the event the ORG would protract the payment , to pay default interest . By way of determining the method of calculating the default interest , the contract referred to a statute , which , in fact , did not exist . At the material time there existed , instead a ORG of Ministers regulation concerning calculation of the default interest , which was replaced by a statute in DATE .", "In DATE the applicant rented an apartment in GPE from Mr PERSON ( a private person ) . The lease agreement was not registered with the authorities and the parties settled the payments in cash .", "In DATE the applicant solicited for the ORG a contract with Z.E.M. , a commercial enterprise , which transferred the contractual payment directly to the ORG \u2019s NORP partner in NORP rubbles . The NORP partner transferred a certain payment back to the Company in karbovantsi ( a transitional currency of GPE in circulation at the material time ) .", "DATE a new NORP currency ( hryvnya ) was introduced .", "On DATE , following expiration of the applicant \u2019s contract with the Company , the parties co - signed an agreement on completion of the contract ( \u0430\u043a\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0442\u044f-\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0456 ) , in which the Company acknowledged that the applicant had referred to it a certain list of clients , including Z.E.M. , in pursuance of the contract of DATE , and fixed the amount of his remuneration in GPE , to be converted into the hryvnya currency at the time of settlement .", "By DATE the Company had paid the applicant only a fraction of the payment due .", "On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the Company , seeking various payments . In particular , he claimed the balance of remuneration under the agreement of CARDINAL DATE and default interest allegedly accrued on this payment pursuant the contract . In the course of the ensuing proceedings , the applicant recalculated the amount of the compensation claimed on some CARDINAL occasions , taking account for the lapse of time , modifications of applicable financial and banking regulations and exchange rates . He further maintained that he had a labour relationship with the Company and sought salary arrears and various compensations based on labour law .", "The Company lodged a counter - claim , maintaining that Z.E.M. had defaulted on its payment , hence causing significant damages , which should be covered by the applicant , as he had solicited a contract with Z.E.M.", "On DATE the ORG of Kyiv ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ; ORG \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 PERSON ) disjoined the applicant \u2019s claims based on labour law from his civil ones . There is no information on the outcome of the labour limb of the proceedings .", "As to the civil limb , the case was re - examined by the courts several times .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim for payment of commission balance and default interest . The court found that , having signed the agreement of DATE , the Company had undertaken a lawful obligation to settle the payment . The court further dismissed the counterclaim as unsubstantiated .", "The Company appealed in cassation , referring , inter alia , to numerous inconsistencies between the agreement of DATE , the contract of DATE , applicable legal norms and the ORG financial and other documents and arguing that the agreement as such was not final and could not serve as a source of a civil law obligation . It further disputed the method of calculation employed by the applicant . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ; GPE \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 ) quashed this judgment and remitted the case for a fresh consideration , instructing ORG to explore further whether , in light of all the evidence adduced , the Company could be obliged to pay the remuneration as fixed in the agreement of CARDINAL DATE .", "In DATE the applicant amended his statement of claim , additionally seeking compensation of his rental expenses under the lease agreement with Mr K.", "On DATE the court ordered an auditor \u2019s assessment of the financial documents submitted by the parties and Z.E.M. , to clarify various inconsistencies between them . By DATE the assessment was completed .", "On DATE ORG awarded the applicant commission balance in respect of all clients , listed in the agreement of DATE , except for Z.E.M. The court found that the applicant \u2019s contract with the ORG made him ineligible to a commission in respect of a non - paying client . The court further found that the applicant could not claim default interest , since the relevant contractual language lacked requisite clarity and the ORG could not claim damages on account of Z.E.M. \u2019s default , since the applicant had not been responsible for it . Lastly , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for rental expenses , noting that the lease agreement had not been registered with the authorities as required by law and no documentary evidence of the rental expenses having in fact been incurred was available . The applicant appealed in cassation .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment to the extent that the applicant \u2019s claims had been dismissed and remitted the case for a fresh consideration in this regard . The court instructed ORG , in particular , to determine whether the contractual language making the applicant \u2019s remuneration conditional on the receipt by the Company of payment from the clients could be deemed fair under applicable law .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claims . In particular , the court noted that the applicant had wilfully accepted a contractual term conditioning his remuneration on the receipt of payment from clients and that he had not brought an express claim seeking to annul this provision . In other regards , the court essentially relied on the reasoning adduced in its judgment of DATE .", "The applicant appealed in cassation . In his cassation appeal he emphasized , inter alia , that Z.E.M. had transferred the payment to the ORG \u2019s NORP partner and that the ORG itself had never attempted to institute judicial proceedings against Z.E.M. to collect the alleged debt . He maintained that the signing of the agreement of DATE constituted sufficient basis for payment of the commission .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal and remitted the case for a fresh consideration , in particular , having found unpersuasive ORG analysis as to the fairness and lawfulness of the conditions concerning the remuneration , in particular , in view that the Company had never claimed Z.E.M. \u2019s debt by way of judicial proceedings .", "On DATE ORG found that the contractual provision making the applicant responsible for the GPE non - payment significantly undermined his lawful interests and , consequently , awarded the applicant compensation on account of having solicited a contract with Z.E.M. The court further found it unfair to make the applicant responsible for his landlord \u2019s failure to register the lease and ruled that the applicant \u2019s claim for rental expenses was sufficiently substantiated by witness testimonies and other evidence . The ORG appealed pursuant a newly introduced appeal procedure .", "On DATE ORG quashed this judgment , having remitted the case for a fresh consideration . In particular , the court instructed ORG to give further regard to certain inconsistencies between various documents and witness testimonies and to determine to what extent the parties\u2019 dispute concerning the default interest could be covered by the new statute of DATE .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this decision with ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "On DATE ORG awarded various payments to the applicant . In particular , the court attached weight to the fact that Z.E.M. had transferred the payment to the ORG \u2019s NORP partner . It further found that , although the parties had mistakenly referred in the contract to a non - existing statute in determining the method of calculation of default interest , the subsequent relevant legislation could be applied in the present case . Lastly , it found that the applicant could not be held responsible for his landlord \u2019s failure to register the lease agreement with the authorities , especially since the relevant legal rules had also changed after the lease had been signed . The Company appealed .", "On DATE ORG reversed the judgment . Dismissing the applicant \u2019s claims , it gave weight to the fact that the Company itself had never received Z.E.M. \u2019s payment . If further ruled that the calculation of the default interest had to be governed by the regulations in place at the time , when the contract had been concluded , which gave the applicant no entitlement to the payment claimed , and that the failure of the parties to the lease agreement to register the lease , coupled with lack of documentary evidence of settling the payments , made it impossible to award the claimed reimbursement . The applicant appealed in cassation before ORG .", "On DATE the panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG heard the merits of the case and , having disagreed with both previous judgments ( of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) , remitted the case for a fresh consideration . In particular , ORG found that ORG had unfairly disregarded the fact that Z.E.M. had made the payment to the ORG \u2019s NORP partner and that ORG had incorrectly calculated the final award due to the applicant , taking into account various currency exchange issues .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claims in part . It found him entitled to the commission on account of having solicited a contract with Z.E.M. and calculated the amount due in hryvnya based on the dollar award previewed by the agreement of DATE . It further awarded the applicant rental expenses , but dismissed his claims for default interest as lacking proper basis on either statutory or contractual provisions . Both parties appealed .", "On DATE ORG amended the judgment , having dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims for reimbursement of rental expenses . The court further diminished the amount of the commission due to the applicant , having taken into account the amount of Z.E.M. \u2019s payment in NORP rubbles to the ORG partner , the amount of payment in karbovantsi received by ORG in return , and a respective hryvnya rate . The applicant appealed in cassation .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "Subsequently , the applicant unsuccessfully sought to re - open the proceedings and have his claims reconsidered ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
