The number of such stands would thus be raised from QUANTITY , an increase of PERCENT .", "The total cost of building the new shed and adapting the existing one came to MONEY .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Head of ORG forwarded the applicant \u2019s claim to ORG ( directeur voor de landbouw en voedselvoorziening ) of the province of GPE - Brabant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The latter rejected it on DATE , on the ground that the applicant had failed to show \" that it had always been his intention to increase the number of stands for milch cows as stated in his claim \" .", "CARDINAL .

The increase thus fell well short of the minimum of PERCENT required by the DATE Ordinance ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to ORG ( College van Beroep voor het GPE ) ( \" the ORG \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE .

ORG After a public hearing , the President of the ORG , in a letter dated DATE , asked the Minister to indicate whether he was prepared to reconsider his decision . By a letter dated DATE the Minister replied that he saw no reason to do so and that the interim measure requested by the applicant should be refused . The Minister discussed the question of the increase in the number of stands and maintained his previous position . He submitted in the alternative that the applicant \u2019s investments referable to that increase fell short of the required minimum of NLG CARDINAL . The Minister estimated that the total investment had been worth ORG and the price per square metre of the new shed had been NLG MONEY ; calculating on the basis of the surface taken up in the old shed by the new stands for milch cows and cows in calf , he concluded that the amount involved in the increase had been NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL at the most .", "CARDINAL .

He argued firstly that the Minister was estopped from using this argument , which had never been invoked as a reason for rejecting the applicant \u2019s original claim ; in the alternative , the Minister \u2019s calculations were wrong . He claimed , with reference to a list of the costs concerned drawn up by his accountant , that his total investment had in fact been NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and criticised the method of calculation used by the Minister . In his view , PERCENT of the total investment was referable to cow stands in the new shed for heifers , of which PERCENT replaced similar stands in the old shed that were now to be used for milch cows and cows in calf ; the sum relating to the relevant increase was therefore NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the President of the ORG gave a decision refusing the interim measure requested , holding that it was not prima facie likely that the ORG itself would overturn the Minister \u2019s decision . In his view , the Minister had not erred in rejecting the applicant \u2019s claim . The President did not find it necessary to address the question of the increase in the number of stands for milch cows and cows in calf , since he accepted the Minister \u2019s alternative argument concerning the applicant \u2019s investment . He rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that the Minister was estopped from relying on that ground , holding that section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( LANGUAGE administratieve rechtspraak bedrijfsorganisatie , PERSON ( Official Bulletin ) DATE , CARDINAL , as amended - \" LAW \" ) entitled him to supplement his arguments while the applicant had not only had sufficient possibility of replying to the Minister \u2019s alternative submission but had in fact done so . Accepting the method of calculation used by the Minister and the total investment submitted by the applicant , the President arrived at a figure of NLG CARDINAL referable to the increase in the number of stands in the old cowshed , and that figure was insufficient .", "CARDINAL . ORG By a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the registrar of the ORG the applicant stated that he wished to continue the proceedings . Commenting on the President \u2019s decision , he discussed extensively his own method of calculation . Like the Minister , he took as his starting - point the investment involved in building the new shed for heifers . Starting from the figure which he gave before the President - NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) - he calculated a price per square QUANTITY of NLG CARDINAL . On that basis he arrived at a figure of NLG CARDINAL for the investment referable to the increase in the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf in the existing cowshed . In the alternative , if the Minister \u2019s calculations were to be followed , he submitted that the Minister had based them on incorrect LOC ; if applied correctly , the Minister \u2019s method resulted in a figure referable to the extension of stands for milch cows and cows in calf of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , which was sufficient since the applicant had carried out the physical work involved in building the new cowshed himself ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Minister filed a written statement in reply on DATE . A public hearing was held on DATE , during which the applicant again contested the Minister \u2019s method of calculation and argued that , should the ORG accept it nevertheless , the price per square metre calculated by the Minister was in any case too low ; it was not NLG CARDINAL - the Minister \u2019s figure - but NLG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG delivered its judgment on the merits on DATE . Adopting the same approach as the President , it did not decide whether the increase in the number of cow stands had been sufficient ; indeed , it explicitly declined to address this point . It likewise accepted the Minister \u2019s method of calculation ; applying it to the figures submitted by the applicant in response to the decision of its President ( a price per square QUANTITY of NLG CARDINAL , the new stands covering a surface of QUANTITY ) , the ORG arrived at an investment of NLG CARDINAL referable to the increase in the number of stands . The ORG refused to consider the price per square metre put forward by the applicant at the hearing , on grounds of belatedness , holding :", "\" The applicant \u2019s statement first made at the hearing to the effect that the price per square metre is in reality NLG CARDINAL.CARDINAL will not be taken into account in reviewing the decision appealed against , in view of the rule laid down in LAW para .
