On DATE , under the rules on family reunification , ORG ) granted the applicant a residence permit to join her husband in GPE . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant entered the country on a valid passport issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , ORG decided to withdraw the applicant 's residence permit on the ground that the applicant and her husband had separated . This decision was confirmed by ORG ( NORP for PERSON , ORG ) on DATE and the applicant was ordered to leave GPE no later than DATE . The applicant did not challenge this decision before the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum in GPE . In support of her application she submitted that her marriage had been arranged , and that once she had arrived in GPE her husband had taken her passport and been abusive by beating her and depriving her of food . After DATE , she had fled to a women 's shelter . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE her husband was convicted of abuse and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . Her passport had been returned . Subsequently , on CARDINAL occasion when she had seen him on the street , he had threatened to kill her . He came from a wealthy family in GPE with good connections to the authorities and the military and she was afraid that he had told GPE authorities DATE as a soldier for ORG , hereafter the ORG . She had participated and been injured in battle . Having contracted malaria , in DATE she had had to leave the organisation . DATE , she had moved around because of the instability in the country . In DATE she had settled in GPE where she had worked as a carer for an elderly gentleman . In DATE she had met her husband and agreed to marry him to secure her future . She had a sister in GPE but had heard no news from her since the tsunami in DATE . She had no other relatives in her home country .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the applicant was convicted for CARDINAL incidents of malicious damage to her husband 's car and flat , and sentenced to DATE fines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected her application for asylum . It found that the grounds invoked by the applicant were not such that she would face a real risk of persecution or ill - treatment if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) , the applicant explained , among other things , that her mother died when she was DATE and her father died when she was DATE . After her father 's death she had been sent to a boarding school . She could only stay at school until she turned DATE . She did not have any relatives or others with whom she could stay . When she was DATE , she had joined the ORG . She had been in combat on CARDINAL occasions when she was DATE and had been hit by shell splinters . Consequently she had a small shell splinter under the skin by her left eye and part of CARDINAL finger was missing . The ORG had accepted that she leave the organisation after she contracted malaria . She married on DATE , in GPE . Her husband was an ethnic NORP resident in GPE . Prior to her entry into GPE she became pregnant . Her spouse 's family took her to a clinic and forced her to have an illegal abortion . Her spouse 's family treated her very badly prior to her entry into GPE . Her spouse was an alcoholic and beat her every day . After she left her spouse , he had threatened to have her sent back to GPE where she would end up in the street . If she were to return to her country of origin she feared her former spouse 's family who lived in GPE . She had neither family members nor a place to stay in GPE . Her former spouse 's family had a good relationship with the GPE army . She also feared the authorities , should she return to GPE , as persons who had been attached to the NORP were not allowed to leave the country without the permission of the authorities . She feared that her former spouse would inform the Sri NORP authorities about her return and that she would be arrested at the airport as a result . On the basis of her scars the authorities would be able to conclude that she had been attached to the NORP .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused to grant the applicant asylum . It first noted that the applicant had arrived in GPE on a passport which was still valid and that she had had no problems with the authorities before she left GPE .", "CARDINAL . The fact that she had been a member of the NORP at a very young age could not in itself justify the granting of asylum . Moreover , she had not held any prominent position in the organisation and her attachment to the NORP ended after she had developed malaria . She had had no problems with the NORP since she left in DATE and she had not in any way attracted attention to herself .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant 's problems with her former husband were of a private nature and there was no indication that the Sri NORP authorities would be unable or unwilling to help and protect her if necessary .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG therefore found that on her return to GPE she would not run any particular risk of persecution within the scope of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , or any real risk of outrages within the scope of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request to reconsider the case finding that no new essential information or aspects had been added to the case . The fact that on DATE the ORG had requested ORG to suspend the return of NORP from northern and eastern GPE had not given rise to a general suspension of the return of ethnic NORP to northern and eastern GPE , and ORG did not find either that it should give rise to a postponement of the time - limit for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a court order of CARDINAL DATE the applicant divorced . It appears that shortly thereafter the applicant married a NORP man who lived in GPE . Their daughter was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant again requested a reopening of her asylum case . In support she referred to the fact , inter alia , that the Sri NORP authorities had issued a birth certificate to her in DATE . Her friends had arranged for the certificate to be issued and had subsequently sent it to her in GPE . The authorities in GPE were thus aware of what she had told the NORP authorities in connection with her asylum application . She also referred to the fact that she had contracted a NORP marriage with a NORP man during her residence in GPE . She finally referred to her pregnancy and to having been hospitalised in GPE on DATE due to dehydration . By a letter of DATE she added that she had fled the NORP in DATE and hidden with her future husband 's brother in PERSON . From there she had gone to GPE to stay with her future husband 's sister . Subsequently , she heard that on several occasions members of the ORG had approached her brother - in - law in order to find her . Furthermore , the ORG had detained one of her brother - in - law 's children for DATE . She had only learned about this later on . Finally , her former spouse refused to return her national identity papers to her ; instead , he had passed her identity card to the Sri NORP army . She had received this information recently . Consequently , the military was waiting to arrest her in GPE where she was wanted . If she succeeded in going to PERSON she would be arrested by the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG again refused to reopen the asylum case , finding that no essential new information or aspects had been added in relation to the information which had been available when the case was considered by ORG in the first place . ORG did not find it probable that the Sri NORP authorities had become acquainted with the applicant 's statements given to the NORP immigration authorities since that information was private and covered by the regulations of LAW ( straffeloven ) concerning the professional secrecy of public authorities . The fact that the applicant was pregnant and had married in GPE had no bearing on her asylum case and therefore could not lead to a different evaluation of the matter . Her statement about recently having learnt that her former brother - in - law had been approached by the ORG seemed unreliable , notably because during the original asylum case hearing before ORG she had stated that she left the NORP because she had developed malaria . Consequently , this \u201c new \u201d information could not be taken into account . ORG could not take into account either the statement that her former spouse had passed on her identity card to the Sri NORP authorities as this information had been submitted at DATE and seemed fabricated for the occasion . Her problems with her former spouse were of a private law nature and thus could not lead to a different evaluation of her asylum case .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , once more the applicant requested that her case be reopened and submitted in support thereof a letter from ORG to GPE dated DATE requesting the latter to suspend the return of all NORP to GPE , and an e - mail of DATE concerning the suspension of deportation cases in GPE on the basis of the above - mentioned letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG again refused to reopen the asylum case . It stated that it was acquainted with the letter of DATE but found that the letter alone could not bring about a general suspension of cases concerning GPE nationals of NORP ethnicity . Nevertheless , the letter and the ORG 's recommendations formed part of the background material on GPE which was available to ORG and which was a constituent part of the basis for the ORG 's decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon the applicant 's request , ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that it was in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should not be expelled to GPE pending the ORG 's decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused the applicant 's application for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's passport expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , referring to the deterioration in the security situation in GPE and ORG the international Protection Needs of Asylum - Seekers from GPE from DATE , the applicant requested that ORG reopen her asylum case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , anew , ORG refused her request , concluding as follows :", "\u201c ... In DATE , ORG received ORG from GPE from DATE , which have been included in the background material of ORG . In addition , ORG has subsequently added the following reports to its background material : ORG , War on the Displaced , Sri Lankan Army and ORG , Abuses against NORP in the GPE , DATE ; GPE , ORG , GPE ORG , ORG Report - GPE , DATE ; ORG , DATE ORG : GPE , DATE ; GPE , ORG , GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note - GPE , DATE ; and GPE , ORG , GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note , DATE .", "It should be noted in that respect that ORG makes its decisions in asylum proceedings upon a concrete and individual assessment of the individual asylum - seeker 's statement about his asylum motive compared with the background information available at any time about the conditions in the asylum - seeker 's country of origin . It should also be noted that , as appears from ORG . v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG places substantial emphasis on the information of ORG about the situation in GPE . The Position Papers are necessarily broadly phrased and contain general descriptions about the varying risks for each of GPE ethnic groups . The views expressed in the Position Papers can not in themselves be conclusive evidence for the assessment by the national authorities or ORG the risk for ethnic NORP returning to GPE .", "ORG observes that the general conditions for ethnic NORP from northern GPE , including single women , do not in themselves justify asylum . It should be noted in that connection that ORG stated in ORG . v. GPE ( quoted above , LAW that , in the assessment of ORG , the deterioration in the security situation and the increase in human rights violations in GPE did not create a general risk to all NORP returning to GPE . The ORG further observed in \u00a7 CARDINAL that both the assessment of the risk to ethnic NORP of certain profiles and the assessment of whether individual acts of harassment would cumulatively amount to a serious violation of human rights could only be made on an individual basis .", "Your statement to the effect that your client may risk having an explanatory problem upon her arrival at GPE as a consequence of the scars acquired by her in connection with military operations against the government forces does not lead to a revised assessment of the case . In this respect , ORG refers to ORG written observations of CARDINAL DATE stating that your client had not been detained or subjected to outrages or to other acts contrary to LAW before her departure as opposed to the applicant in ORG . v. GPE . Nor had your client been recorded by the authorities in connection with detention , or photographed , fingerprinted or anything else so that the authorities might be presumed to know of her , and therefore your client could not be considered to be at risk of being subjected to outrages or other acts contrary to LAW upon her arrival at FAC in the same way as the applicant in the above judgment .", "Nor does your statement about your client 's affiliation with the NORP until DATE and not , as originally stated , until DATE , when your client left the NORP because she contracted malaria , lead to a revised assessment of the case . It should be noted in that connection that the new information appeared at a very late stage of the asylum proceedings after your client had been refused asylum , having had several opportunities to provide this information without having done so . ORG still finds that there is no reasonable explanation for her changed statement .", "In that connection , ORG has also placed some emphasis on the fact that your client only applied for asylum in GPE DATE and DATE after her entry into GPE and only after her residence permit under the family reunification rules had been revoked and she therefore had to leave GPE .", "Concerning your statement about your client suspecting her former spouse or his family of having disclosed information to the Sri NORP authorities about her , it should be noted that ORG finds that it has not been rendered probable that the Sri NORP authorities have gained knowledge of your client 's statements to the NORP immigration authorities . In this respect , it should be noted that the information given by your client in connection with the asylum proceedings is comprised by the rules of LAW on the duty of confidentiality of public authorities .", "The fact that your client was married at a religious ceremony in GPE and has given birth to a daughter is not relevant under asylum law and thus does not lead to a revised assessment of the case either .", "Against this background , ORG fully relies on its decisions of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE .", "No time - limit for departure is fixed as , on DATE , ORG suspended your client 's time - limit for departure for the time being . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG refused to reopen the applicant 's case as it found that the most recent general background information would not lead to a revised assessment of the case . More specifically in its letter to the applicant 's representative it stated as follows :", "ORG observes that as her asylum motive your client has stated , inter alia , that , in case of return , she fears outrages committed by the NORP because she left without permission . She also fears the Sri NORP military forces . Due to the injuries incurred by her during military operations , she fears that the Sri NORP army will suspect her of being a member of the NORP . Moreover , your client fears that her former family - in - law , with whom she is on bad terms and who live in GPE and have good connections with the GPE military forces , have informed on her to the GPE authorities and that she will therefore be unable to enter the country without becoming an object of interest to the authorities . Her former spouse living in GPE has her ID card , and she fears that he will travel to GPE and do something that may harm her . Finally , your client has stated that , as a single woman without family or social network , she will be unable to manage in her country of origin .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated , inter alia , that your client had left GPE in possession of her own national passport without problems and that she had not , prior to her departure , been subjected to outrages or the like of a nature to warrant asylum . ORG found that the fact that your client was affiliated with the ORG as a child soldier when very young did not in itself warrant granting asylum . In that connection , ORG emphasised the length of the time passed and the fact that your client was deemed not to have made herself stand out in any way . Moreover , the ORG found that the general situation for single women in GPE could not justify granting a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW . The ORG observed that your client 's problems with her former spouse were of a private law nature and therefore recommended that she seek the protection of the authorities in case of conflicts . ORG finally found that it had not been rendered probable that your client would be unable to seek the protection of the authorities and that therefore the information on her former family - in - law could not lead to a revised assessment .", "ORG still finds that your client 's fear of the NORP and the Sri NORP authorities and the conflict with her former family - in - law do not warrant a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "In that connection , ORG refers to your client 's statement during the asylum proceedings to the effect that she did not have any problems with the ORG at any time prior to her departure , including in connection with her leaving the NORP . On the contrary , she stated that the NORP accepted her leaving the organisation . ORG observes that DATE have passed since your client left the ORG , and therefore the ORG can not find as a fact that former ORG members would pursue her because she had left the country without permission from the NORP .", "Additionally , the GPE military forces defeated the NORP in DATE . Moreover , it appears from the background information available to ORG that it is hardly likely that former low - ranking members of the ORG or persons who have previously supported the ORG will risk reprisals from the NORP , see GPE , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE .", "The possibility that as an ethnic NORP from northern GPE your client risks being questioned and investigated by the authorities upon entry into her country of origin does not lead to a revised assessment of the case under asylum law .

In that connection , the ORG refers to your client 's statement during the asylum proceedings to the effect that she was an ordinary , rank - and - file member of the ORG and that she has not had any conflicts with the Sri NORP authorities at any time , or been registered in any way . She departed lawfully from GPE in possession of her own GPE national passport for the purpose of family reunification in GPE . Moreover , DATE have passed since your client carried out activities for the ORG . Against that background , ORG finds that it has not been rendered probable that the Sri Lankan authorities would take a special interest in your client upon return , regardless of her scars .", "In this connection , ORG refers to the fact that it appears from the background material available to ORG that , in general , individuals who have supported the ORG on a lower level are not of interest to the authorities . Thus , generally , only high - profile members of the NORP who are still active and wanted , or individuals wanted for serious criminal offences are of interest to the authorities , see GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE , and ORG to GPE , GPE CARDINAL DATE .", "Your client has also stated that her former family - in - law has good connections with the Sri NORP army and that she has reason to believe that the family has informed on her to the Sri NORP authorities . ORG does not consider this information a fact . The information is thus not substantiated in detail , and your client has not given a more accurate account of which member of her former family - in - law is involved and when that member has allegedly spoken to the authorities about your client .", "Nor does ORG find that the fact that your client 's former spouse has taken your client 's ORG card from her , and that she will have to have her national passport renewed and might thereby attract attention to herself , can lead to any other assessment .", "As in the previous decisions in the case , ORG still finds that the general situation in GPE is not of such nature as to warrant in itself the grant of a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "Thus , ORG fully relies on the decisions of CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .

However , the ORG has rebuffed the ORG , stressing that the issues that it has raised are internal political matters that should not be linked to trade . \u201c The ORG is not the only international body currently putting pressure on the government . GPE has also rejected the ORG 's appointment of a CARDINAL - member panel to examine possible human rights violations during the island 's civil war . The Sri Lankan authorities have warned that they will not provide visas for panel members to enter the country . \u201d", "...", "CARDINAL The ORG , ORG , GPE , DATE noted that : \u201c The decision by the ORG secretary - general , Ban PERSON [ on DATE ] , to appoint a panel to examine accountability issues stemming from the final stages of the island 's civil war , which ended in DATE , has prompted a strong reaction in GPE ...", "CARDINAL NORP On DATE ORG reported that \u201c Secretary - General Ban Kimoon has held his first meeting with the panel of experts set up to advise him on accountability issues relating to alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law during the final stages DATE of the conflict in GPE . \u201d The source also noted that the role of the experts was to examine \u201c the modalities , applicable international standards and comparative experience with regard to accountability processes , taking into account the nature and scope of any alleged violations in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . GPE on GPE of DATE ( \u201c the DATE ORG \u201d ) sets out a series of letters from ORG \u2013 hereafter \u201c LOC \u201d , GPE , on arrival procedures at GPE airport . In its letter of DATE , the ORG observed :", "\u201c [ T]he correct procedure for [ ORG and Emigration [ DIE ] ] officers is to record the arrival of these persons manually in a logbook held in the adjacent Chief Immigration Officer 's office . The name , date and time of arrival and arriving flight details are written into the log . It records why the person has come to their attention and how the case was disposed of . I have had the opportunity to look at the log , and it appears that the CARDINAL ways of disposal are to be passed to ORG [ ORG ] , or allowed to proceed .", "The office of ORG [ SIS ] is in the immigration arrivals hall and an officer from ORG usually patrols the arrivals area during each incoming flight . Invariably , if they notice a person being apprehended they approach IED [ ORG ] and take details in order to ascertain in [ sic ] the person may be of interest to them . Their office contains CARDINAL computer terminals , CARDINAL belonging to the airport containing flight information and CARDINAL stand - alone terminals . If an apprehended person is considered suitable to be passed to ORG , they are physically walked across the terminal building to the ORG offices . A ORG officer should then manually record the arrival of the person in a logbook held in their office ... often persons shown in the ORG logbook to have been handed to ORG are never actually recorded as being received in the ORG logbook . It is believed that ORG has allowed these persons to proceed and no action has been taken against them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The same letter also noted that ORG offices at the airport contained CARDINAL computers , which were not linked to any national database . Any checks on persons detained or apprehended were conducted over the phone with colleagues in central GPE . There were no fingerprint records at the airport . CARDINAL computer contained records of suspects who had been arrested and charged with offences , and court reference numbers . It continued as follows :", "\u201c Were a Sri NORP national to arrive at FAC having been removed or deported from GPE , they would be in possession of either a valid national NORP passport , or an emergency travel document / temporary passport , issued by ORG in GPE . The holder of a valid passport would have the document endorsed by the immigration officer on arrival and handed back to him / her . A national passport contains the national ORG card number on the laminated details page . I have made enquiries with the DIE at FAC , and with ORG who meet certain returnees at the airport , and both have confirmed that a person travelling on an emergency travel document is dealt with similarly . They too have the document endorsed by the immigration officer on arrival and returned to them . Before issuing an emergency travel document , ORG in GPE will have details of an applicant confirmed against records held in GPE and will thus satisfactorily confirm the holder 's nationality and identity . If a returnee subsequently wishes to obtain a national identity card , they have to follow the normal procedures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the ORG reported that an official had spent TIME observing the return of failed asylum seekers from GPE , including those who were in possession of emergency travel documents , issued by ORG in GPE . In the official 's opinion , the fact that certain returnees had been issued with emergency travel documents by ORG in GPE did not seem to make any difference to their treatment upon arrival .", "CARDINAL . The Report of Information Gathering Visit to GPE on DATE , conducted jointly by ORG and ORG ( \u201c the Report of Information Gathering Visit , DATE \u201d ) , concluded that all enforced returns ( of whatever ethnicity ) were referred to the ORG at the airport for nationality and criminal record checks , which could take TIME . All enforced returns were wet - fingerprinted . Depending on the case , the individual could also be referred to the ORG and/or ORG for questioning . Anyone who was wanted for an offence would be arrested .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report set out that those with a criminal record or ORG connections would face additional questioning and might be detained . In general , non - government and international sources agreed that NORP from the north and east of the country were likely to receive greater scrutiny than others , and that the presence of the factors below would increase the risk that an individual could encounter difficulties with the authorities , including possible detention :", "- Outstanding arrest warrant", "- Criminal record", "- Connection with the LTTE", "- Bail jumping / escape from custody", "- Illegal departure from GPE", "- Scarring", "- Involvement with media or NGOs", "- Lack of an ORG card or other documentation", "CARDINAL . GPE on GPE of DATE set out the following :", "CARDINAL The ORG letter of CARDINAL DATE went on to observe that : \u201c At DATE , partly due to the large numbers of NORP being returned from around the world and causing logistical problems , ORG procedures were relaxed in that they no longer had to detain returnees until written confirmation was received from the local police . All returnees are still interviewed , photographed and wet fingerprinted . The main objective of these interviews is to establish if the returnee has a criminal record , or if they are wanted or suspected of committing any criminal offences by the police . The photographs are stored on a standalone computer in the ORG office at the airport . The fingerprints remain amongst paper records also in the ORG office at the airport . Checks are initiated with local police , but returnees are released to a friend or relative , whom ORG refers to as a surety . This surety must provide evidence of who they are , and must sign for the returnee . They are not required to lodge any money with ORG . \u201c The main ORG offices at FAC , which are housed on the ground floor adjacent to the ORG embarkation control , are currently undergoing a complete refurbishment funded by the NORP government . The CARDINAL completed office suite has CARDINAL purpose built interview rooms , and facilities where returnees can relax and eat meals . \u201d", "...", "CARDINAL A NORP High Commission letter of DATE reported : \u201c There is strong anecdotal evidence that scarring has been used in the past to identify suspects . Previous conversations with the police and in the media , the authorities have openly referred to physical examinations being used to identify whether suspects have undergone military style training . More recent claims from contacts in government ministries suggest that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently . At the very least it appears that the security forces only conduct these when there is another reason to suspect an individual , and are not looking for particular scars as such , but anything that may indicate the suspect has been involved in fighting and/or military training . There is no recent evidence to suggest that these examinations are routinely carried out on immigration returnees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Tamilnet reported that CARDINAL NORP youths were taken into custody by ORG of the Sri Lanka Police at FAC in CARDINAL separate incidents whilst trying to leave GPE . It was also reported that since DATE , special teams of ORG and police had been deployed in the airport to monitor the movement of NORP who try to go abroad .", "CARDINAL . The Report of Information Gathering Visit , DATE , stated that the frequency of cordon and search operations had not reduced significantly in DATE , though there were fewer large - scale operations than in DATE . In general , young male NORP originating from the north and east of the country were most at risk of being detained following cordon and search operations , with the presence of the risk factors set out above increasing that risk . Those without employment or legitimate purpose for being in GPE were also likely to be seen as suspect . The same report also noted that most sources agreed that there had been few , if any , abductions or disappearances since DATE . There was not a great deal of available information about the profile of NORP targeted for abduction , although it appeared that people linked to the media might be more vulnerable . Police did not generally carry out effective investigations . It went on to note that most sources agreed that there had not been any significant reduction in the number of checkpoints in GPE , whose stated purpose remained to detect and prevent terrorist activity . In general those most likely to be questioned were young NORP from the north and east ; those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the West . However , most sources said that arrests at checkpoints were rare and none had been reported since DATE . It was reportedly fairly likely that someone would be stopped at a checkpoint en route from the airport to GPE . Finally , it clarified that people who wished to live in GPE but did not originate from there must register with the local police station with a national ID card or full passport , and details of planned length and purpose of stay . In theory , whilst anyone was entitled to register to stay in GPE , some sources suggested that young NORP men originally from the north or east of the country could encounter difficulties and face closer scrutiny . The presence of any of the risk factors set out above would also attract greater attention from the police .", "\u201c The significant majority of reported cases of human rights violations in GPE involve persons of NORP ethnicity who originate from the LOC and LOC ... In Government - controlled areas , NORP who originate from the LOC and the LOC , which are , or have been under ORG control , are frequently suspected as being associated with the NORP . For this reason , NORP from the LOC and the LOC are at heightened risk of human rights violations related to the implementation of anti - terrorism and anti - insurgency measures . While this risk exists in all parts of GPE , it is greatest in areas in which the ORG remains active , and where security measures are heaviest , in particular the LOC and parts of the LOC , and in and around GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The country of origin information that ORG has considered indicates that NORP from LOC continue to face a significant risk of suffering serious human rights violations in the region ( and elsewhere in the country ) because of their race ( ethnicity ) or ( imputed ) political opinion . NORP in the LOC are still heavily targeted in the security and anti - terrorism measures described in LAW . Wide scale detention and confinement of NORP from the LOC remains a serious concern . ORG paramilitary elements also continue to operate with impunity against NORP in the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG from GPE of DATE , which superseded the DATE Guidelines contained information on the particular profiles for which international protection needs may arise in the current context . It was stated that :", "\u201c given the cessation of hostilities , NORP originating from the north of the country are no longer in need of international protection under broader refugee criteria or complementary forms of protection solely on the basis of risk of indiscriminate harm . In light of the improved human rights and security situation in GPE , there is no longer a need for group - based protection mechanisms or for a presumption of eligibility for NORP of NORP ethnicity originating from the north of the country . It is important to bear in mind that the situation is still evolving , which has made the drafting of these LAW particularly complex . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
