The applicant is a limited liability company with its registered seat in GPE . It is the owner and publisher of the DATE magazine News .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an article in News in which it reported about pending investigations on suspicion of large scale tax evasion against PERSON , the managing director of a well - known enterprise producing pistols . The article was accompanied by a picture of PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP The report informed the reader that PERSON premises had been searched in TIME of DATE . He was suspected of having evaded taxes of MONEY ( MONEY ) . The article stated that News was in the possession of numerous documents ( letters from PERSON lawyers , a court file from GPE , costs calculations and lists of clients of the PERSON company , etc . ) concerning this suspicion which it claimed to have obtained through its own intense research . The most important documents were letters from PERSON lawyers from which it followed that an attempt to murder PERSON had taken place in GPE in DATE , which had not come to the attention of the NORP authorities or of the media at the time . The attempt had possibly been made at the instigation of CARDINAL of PERSON business partners who , according to his lawyer , had acted as a trustee for him . The article then assumed that the attempt was somehow linked to PERSON network of companies which had been scrutinised by the tax authorities . It quoted an anonymous tax official as saying that according to the investigations dubious companies with a seat abroad had issued invoices for \u201c organisational services \u201d to the PERSON company in order to reduce its gains in GPE . Still according to that tax official the complex structure of interrelated companies had been chosen to dissimulate the fact that PERSON was their owner and to avoid the legal consequences of that fact . The article finally said that PERSON also had close links with ORG ( ORG ) , of which it gave a few examples , and that thus , the case also had a political dimension .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently PERSON ( \u201c the claimant \u201d ) brought proceedings under LAW ) against the applicant company , requesting that the latter be prohibited from publishing his picture in connection with reports both on the pending tax evasion proceedings against him and on the attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , granting the request in part , issued a preliminary injunction ( einstweilige GPE ) against the applicant company prohibiting it from publishing a picture of the claimant in the context of reports on charges of tax evasion against him , in so far as he was not described as a suspect , but as having committed the offence , until a final decision would be taken in the main injunction proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court noted that , when assessing whether a person was entitled to protection of his or her picture under LAW in the context of criminal proceedings , the respective interests had to be balanced in the light of the criteria developed in Sections ORG and CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . The court noted that the applicant was a business magnate . His enterprise was the market leader in equipping police forces with pistols . Although the claimant was well - known in professional circles he was not known to the public at large and his picture had only been published in arms producers ' magazines so far . Nevertheless , the subject - matter , namely tax evasion proceedings pending against an industrial magnate whose enterprise was well - known and prestigious in GPE , was of public interest . Referring to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court considered that the public interest in receiving such information outweighed the claimant 's interest in the protection of his identity . The court concluded that reporting on this topic and publishing the claimant 's picture was in principle allowed , as long as it did not violate his right to be presumed innocent ( LAW of LAW ) as was the case for the passage of the article quoting the tax official which described the suspicion against Mr PERSON as if it were already proven .", "CARDINAL . Referring to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court dismissed the claimant 's request that the applicant company be prohibited from publishing his picture in the context of reports on the attempted murder of which he had been the victim . It found that there was a public interest in the reporting which was not outweighed by the claimant 's interest in the protection of his identity , since the report did not interfere with his strictly private life or lead to his public exposure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) upheld this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) , allowing the claimant 's appeal in part , widened the scope of the preliminary injunction to the extent that the applicant company was prohibited from publishing any pictures of the claimant in the context of reports on the tax evasion proceedings pending against him , irrespective of the accompanying text .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the lower courts had failed to take into account the nature of the offence which was at stake , when applying the above - mentioned provisions of LAW . It noted , in particular , that the claimant was a suspect of tax evasion , which was a lesser indictable offence ( PERSON ) , within the meaning of LAW ) of LAW , in which case the claimant 's legitimate interests were injured by a disclosure of his picture . In such cases , the claimant 's interest in a protection of his picture prevailed over the public interest in its publication .", "CARDINAL . ORG 's interest not to have his picture published in the context of reports on pending tax evasion proceedings against him outweighed the public interest to receive such information . In that context the court noted in particular that the investigations for tax evasion were not public and the officials of the tax authorities were bound by the fiscal secret . Thus , there was no public interest in receiving such information together with the picture of the suspect , irrespective of the manner in which the applicant had obtained the information . Even if the applicant had managed to obtain information on the tax evasion proceedings without inciting officials to breach the fiscal secret , the information was meant to be secret and there was no legitimate public interest in receiving it .", "CARDINAL .
