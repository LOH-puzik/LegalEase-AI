{"ITEMID": "001-23179", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "OLSSON v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In its tax return for value - added tax for DATE , ORG , a limited liability company owned by the applicant , claimed a right to deduct value - added tax ( ORG ) in the amount of MONEY ( SEK ) which had allegedly been paid in connection with the purchase of certain computer software rights .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE refused the deduction , considering that it was based on a fictitious transaction . The ORG also ordered the company to pay a tax surcharge ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability , claiming that the company had submitted incorrect information in its tax return . On the basis of this decision the ORG , on DATE , reported the applicant to the police authorities in GPE on suspicion that he had committed a tax crime ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c case A \u201d ) .", "As a consequence of the report , a preliminary investigation was opened on DATE . The applicant was questioned on DATE . The V\u00e4xj\u00f6 police authorities completed its investigation on DATE and the applicant received , on DATE , a copy of the file .", "Another preliminary investigation , initiated in DATE and involving , inter alia , the applicant , was being conducted by the special department for economic crimes of ORG ( \u00e5klagarmyndigheten ) in GPE ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c case B \u201d ) . As the CARDINAL investigations were considered to have much in common , they were joined and , as from DATE , directed by the prosecutor in GPE .", "In the tax proceedings , the applicant \u2019s company appealed against the imposition of a tax surcharge . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE found that , although there were circumstances in the case which justified the calling into question of the right to the claimed GPE deduction , there was not sufficient evidence to show that the transaction in question had been fictitious or that the information submitted in the tax return in this respect had been incorrect in any other sense . The court noted that the mere rejection , under taxation law , of the arguments made in support of a claim for deduction of tax could not in itself lead to the conclusion that incorrect information had been submitted . Consequently , the court quashed ORG decision in so far as it concerned the imposition of a tax surcharge . The ORG did not appeal against the judgment .", "The applicant alleges that , following ORG judgment , he and his legal counsel requested both ORG and ORG in GPE to observe it and to take action accordingly .", "During the criminal investigations it emerged that , in case A , the applicant , as representative of ORG , had bought computer software and certain related sales rights from ORG , a company which had previously been owned by the applicant \u2019s brother , GPE , and in which the brother was considered to have a continuing deciding influence . The latter company had , in its turn , bought the software from another company owned by ORG , ORG . Moreover , ORG purchase had been financed by ORG", "In case B , ORG had financed the purchase by an NORP company of certain licensing rights to computer software from a NORP company , ORG . That company had , in its turn , bought the rights from another NORP company , ORG , of which , inter alia , the applicant was a representative . The latter company had claimed to have purchased the rights from a NORP company which later turned out to be non - existent . A third NORP company , ORG , thus having a similar name as the one that had bought the licensing rights from ORG , had claimed in its tax return for the period DATE a deduction for ORG paid on the basis of that sales agreement , although it had not been a partner to the agreement and therefore not entitled to claim the deduction . It was suspected that the transactions in case B had been initiated by GPE and that he had had a deciding influence over the various NORP companies . Moreover , the computer software to which the licensing rights applied had been of insignificant value , according to an expert opinion , and it was suspected that the transactions had been carried out in order to fraudulently obtain ORG refunds . The applicant , ORG and a third person were suspected of tax crimes in relation to the ORG claim in case B.", "ORG concluded that the persons involved , the mode of action and the relevant time - periods were essentially the same in cases A and B and considered that the possibilities of indicting both the applicant and GPE were good . It was further considered that , in regard to both cases and thus in regard also to the suspicions against the applicant , it was necessary to hear ORG , who was living in GPE , GPE .", "In the beginning of the investigation into case B , ORG had expressed his readiness to be interviewed by the NORP police . GPE having later changed his mind , the prosecutor had , via ORG and ORG in GPE , in DATE requested legal assistance from the NORP authorities in obtaining information from a bank concerning certain documents submitted by ORG which were suspected to be forgeries . No information was forthcoming from the NORP police authorities in charge of the matter and further contacts via diplomatic channels were therefore taken in DATE and in DATE and DATE . By a decision of the public prosecutor of CARDINAL DATE M.O. was ordered to be detained on remand in his absence and a NORP warrant for his arrest was issued . In DATE and in DATE the public prosecutor again contacted ORG in relation to the mentioned request for legal assistance . At the time of the latter contact , ORG had upheld the decision on detention on remand and , as a consequence , an international warrant for ORG arrest was issued . The prosecutor also asked ORG to examine the possibilities of having GPE extradited from GPE . The efforts to get legal assistance from the NORP authorities continued . In DATE there was a further contact between the prosecutor and ORG concerning both the request for legal assistance and the extradition issue . At about this time , a NORP liaison officer temporarily staying in GPE and an employee of ORG had paid a visit to some high - ranking NORP police officers and had raised the problem of receiving legal assistance from GPE . The outcome of this meeting was considered positive and it was hoped that the requested information would arrive within DATE or CARDINAL . Apparently , however , this did not happen . On DATE ORG reported that the local police authorities were waiting for permission from ORG to put questions to the NORP bank . DATE , it submitted information from ORG in GPE , according to which ORG had moved and his new address was unknown . In addition to the above - mentioned measures , the NORP police was continuously searching for GPE , having received indications on several occasions that he would come to GPE .", "On DATE ORG decided to terminate the criminal proceedings in cases A and B on the ground that it could not be proved that a crime had been committed . The applicant was informed thereof on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , examining a complaint made by the applicant , concluded that there was nothing calling for further action and therefore decided not to make any inquiries in the matter .", "On DATE the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) , in reply to a request for damages made by the applicant , decided that there was no reason to assume that a crime had been committed by any public official and the applicant was therefore not entitled to damages . His request was consequently rejected ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
