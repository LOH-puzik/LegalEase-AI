POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was detained on suspicion of robbery and deprivation of liberty with aggravated violence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to remand the applicant in custody . He indicated that the crimes the applicant was charged with had been committed with exceptional cruelty and that there was a risk that he would influence the witnesses and his co - accused if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody for DATE . In its decision the court underlined that there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the crimes and , moreover , had done so soon after he had been released from prison . In addition , since the applicant was charged with a crime against a person who had refused to testify in his favour , the court considered that there was a reasonable fear that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention . In its reasons for this decision it stated , inter alia , that there was a need to extend the scope of the investigation in the applicant \u2019s case and at the same time to prevent him from contacting other suspects . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed on DATE . The ORG found that the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial was fully justified bearing in mind the severity of the charges , the likely penalty and the applicant \u2019s recidivism . The court agreed with ORG view that there was a possibility that the applicant would collude with his co - accused or try to influence witnesses . No grounds for release listed in LAW were established by the court .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation the suspects and CARDINAL witnesses were heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was closed and a bill of indictment against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons was lodged with ORG . The applicant was charged with CARDINAL offences . The prosecutor named CARDINAL witnesses to be summoned for the hearing and CARDINAL persons were identified as victims of the crimes . A local inquiry ( wywiad \u015brodowiskowy ) was concluded .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of DATE and DATE the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial was further prolonged . The courts stated , inter alia , that the grounds for applying this measure remained valid . They found that there was a need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , bearing in mind the severity of the charges against the applicant , his recidivism and the fact that he had committed the offences within DATE of his release from prison . The circumstances of CARDINAL of the offences - deprivation of liberty - pointed to the risk that the applicant would attempt to pervert the course of justice . No special circumstances dictated the lifting of the detention . The court also took into account the complicated nature of the case , which related to numerous persons and criminal acts . On DATE the decision of DATE was upheld by ORG . The court considered that the evidence gathered in the proceedings indicated a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the crimes with which he had been charged . In addition , the applicant \u2019s continued detention pending trial was found to be necessary , bearing in mind the seriousness of the charges , the severity of the anticipated penalty and the applicant \u2019s criminal record . His attempts to influence the testimonies of a witness in another case and the fear of the applicant expressed by some of the victims justified the perceived risk of collusion . At the same time the ORG underlined that the trial court should make every effort to conduct the proceedings promptly and swiftly .", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent decision of DATE prolonging the applicant \u2019s detention ORG indicated , inter alia , that despite the fact that the victims had already been heard there was still a risk of collusion and unlawful obstruction of the proceedings by the applicant , bearing in mind in particular his behaviour during the previous hearing . The court considered that police supervision would not be enough to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for the decision of DATE prolonging the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE , the court underlined , inter alia , that there was a risk that the applicant would influence witnesses , especially bearing in mind his aggressive attitude during the hearings , and that no other preventive measure would sufficiently secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The court also stressed the need to examine the witnesses requested by the applicant \u2019s defence counsel . The applicant appealed against this decision on DATE . On DATE the ORG upheld the decision and ruled that ORG had correctly indicated both the general and specific circumstances which justified the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial . At the same time the appellate court drew the trial court \u2019s attention to the need to accelerate the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the co - accused \u2019s request to undergo a psychiatric examination and at the same time decided to request ORG to prolong the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . Since the applicant had reacted violently and declared that he too was mentally ill and should therefore be examined by a psychiatrist , the court decided to order a psychiatric expert opinion to be prepared on him .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for the decision of DATE on prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention the ORG considered , inter alia , that the conditions laid down in LAW were met and that the prolongation of the detention pending trial was necessary in order to allow for the completion of the complicated procedure for the taking of evidence . It was also necessary because the applicant and the co - accused had deliberately prolonged the proceedings by requesting a psychiatric examination at a time when the proceedings had almost been concluded . The court also noted other important obstacles beyond the court \u2019s control , such as the illness of the referring judge and the need to conduct the proceedings again . In the court \u2019s opinion , ORG could not be held responsible for the excessive length of the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s defence counsel appealed on DATE . On DATE the ORG upheld the impugned decision .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , the applicant lodged several applications for the lifting of his detention pending trial or the imposition of a more lenient preventive measure . His applications were dismissed by the court on DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against these decisions .", "CARDINAL .

At a hearing held on DATE CARDINAL of the co - accused did not appear and in consequence it had to be adjourned . The court decided to remand the co - accused in custody for DATE . In addition , the court received information that one of the witnesses had moved away and it ordered that her new whereabouts be established . The court also refused to allow the motions of the applicant \u2019s and the co - accused \u2019s counsel to have their cases examined separately . It observed that all the offences were closely linked and that the co - accused had acted together and in concert . Consequently , conducting the proceedings separately for each of the coaccused would be contrary to the principle of promptness of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL robberies with which he had been charged and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL kidnappings and acquitted him of the charge of drug trafficking .
