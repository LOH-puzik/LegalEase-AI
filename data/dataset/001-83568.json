{"ITEMID": "001-83568", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "LEDERER v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr M. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the NORP Minister of ORG admitted the applicant to the Bar of the GPE ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ( ORG ) to practise as a lawyer ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant was also admitted to the Bar of ORG ( GPE ) and , on DATE , to the Bar of ORG .", "He was appointed as a lecturer in business and employment law at ORG ( Fachhochschule ) with effect from DATE , with the status of probationary civil servant ( ORG ) .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant indicated his wish to continue practising as a lawyer in accordance with the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "By orders issued on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the applicant obtained the relevant authorisations , valid for a specified period .", "The applicant was appointed as a permanent civil servant ( ORG ) with effect from CARDINAL DATE .", "By a decision of DATE , the President of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s name to be struck off the ORG roll in accordance with section GPE ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) on the ground that he had not had his name removed from the roll despite being appointed as a permanent civil servant . The President of ORG stressed that the relevant provision was mandatory and left no room for discretion . It was therefore neither necessary nor possible to make an exception for university professors and lecturers : the legislation was based on the principle that the distinctive status of permanent civil servants , and in particular the overriding importance of the public - law relationship between them and the ORG ( \u00f6ffentlich - rechtliche PERSON an den Dienstherrn ) was incompatible with the profession of lawyer . The occupation of university lecturer was not fundamentally different in that respect from that of any other serving civil servant .", "By a decision of DATE a division of the NORP Lawyers\u2019 Professional Practice Tribunal ( ORG ) upheld the decision to strike the applicant \u2019s name off the ORG roll , on the same grounds . It considered , additionally , that the applicant \u2019s work as a lawyer was only a secondary occupation and that the requirements in terms of compliance with the LAW were therefore less stringent than in the case of a primary occupation .", "In the view of the professional practice tribunal , the measure complained of also complied with the principle of proportionality as the legislature had sought to ensure the free exercise of the profession of lawyer in the public interest and in the interests of the proper administration of justice . Moreover , several factors made the interference less serious : removal from the ORG roll was required only in the case of judges and permanent civil servants , and a number of procedural provisions ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) permitted university professors and lecturers to act as representatives before the courts ( Prozessbevollm\u00e4chtigte ) and also to prepare expert reports . In view of the numerous provisions of this kind promoting the interests of professors and lecturers , ORG had always refused to allow an exception in their case to the general rule of incompatibility between the functions of permanent civil servant and lawyer .", "The professional practice tribunal also considered that the incompatibility rule was not in breach of the principles of equality and freedom to exercise the profession of one \u2019s choosing enshrined in Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL respectively of LAW see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) and that , notwithstanding the relative freedom enjoyed by university professors and lecturers , no specific regulations were needed to protect their interests , as the factors uniting them with other civil servants predominated . Hence , university professors and lecturers , like all civil servants , needed to obtain authorisation in order to carry on a secondary professional activity . Such authorisation was generally granted only if the activity did not account for more than a certain percentage of their DATE work . The authorisation granted to the applicant on DATE to \u201c act as counsel and representative in business - law and employment - law cases , in particular as a lawyer \u201d ( ORG in wirtschaftsprivat- und arbeitsrechtlichen ORG , insbesondere als Rechtsanwalt ) specified that his secondary activity must not account for DATE a week on average . Furthermore , any income in excess of a certain amount had to be declared to his employer , a requirement which was incompatible with the free exercise of the profession of lawyer .", "Finally , the professional practice tribunal considered that the fact that , in the new ORG , university professors and lecturers had the status of employees rather than civil servants had no bearing on the situation , as it was not a question of incompatibility between CARDINAL professions , but of the incompatibility which existed in principle between the status of civil servant and that of lawyer . That also explained why the applicant could have practised as a tax adviser ( PERSON ) under section ORG ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW ( Steuerberatungsgesetz ) , as the profession of tax adviser was a liberal profession different from that of lawyer .", "In conclusion , the tribunal observed that NORP law was not applicable in the instant case , as the matter was a purely internal CARDINAL within a member ORG ; the applicant was a NORP citizen who did not have a residence in another member ORG and had not obtained any qualifications in such a ORG . Member GPE were free to regulate access to professions by their own nationals , since there was no NORP directive governing access to the profession of lawyer . Finally , even if a national of another member ORG , such as GPE \u2013 where no such incompatibility existed between the occupation of lawyer and that of a university professor or lecturer who was a civil servant \u2013 wished to practise as a lawyer in GPE on the basis of the principle of free movement of services and freedom of establishment , there would be no discrimination . A non - national lawyer could intervene in proceedings in GPE only by working together with a NORP colleague , a restriction to which NORP lawyers were , of course , not subject . If a non - national lawyer actually wished to be admitted to the Bar of a NORP court , sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW would apply to him or her in the same way as to a NORP lawyer .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG dealing with matters relating to lawyers ( ORG f\u00fcr PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , referring to its settled case - law in the matter . It stressed in particular that , as the activity in question was a secondary occupation , the legislature had relatively broad discretion in restricting the applicant \u2019s ability to practise as a lawyer when he was already a university lecturer with permanent civil servant status .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal for adjudication on the ground that it was not of constitutional significance in principle and did not involve a breach of the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights .", "The relevant Articles of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c All persons shall be equal before the law . \u201d", "\u201c All NORP shall have the right freely to choose their occupation or profession , their place of work and their place of training . The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or pursuant to a law . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , of MONEY states that admission to the Bar is to be refused if the candidate is a permanent civil servant .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , states that lawyers are to be removed from the ORG roll on appointment as permanent civil servants .", "The first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) states that lawyers who are also civil servants DATE but without permanent status \u2013 may not practise as lawyers . However , the judicial authorities of the Land in question may allow the lawyer , at his or her request , to continue to practise if this is not prejudicial to the proper administration of justice .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) , section CARDINAL of FAC ( Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung ) , LAW ) , LAW ( relating to civil servants ) ( ORG ) and LAW of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) state that law professors and lecturers in NORP universities ( PERSON an deutschen LOC ) may act as legal representatives on the same basis as lawyers before the relevant courts .", "In cases before the civil courts ( LAW ) ) , university professors and lecturers must obtain authorisation on a case - by - case basis ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
