The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are unmarried sisters , born on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively . They have lived together , in a stable , committed and mutually supportive relationship , all their lives ; for DATE in a house built on land inherited from their parents in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The house is owned by the applicants in their joint names . According to an expert valuation dated DATE , the property was worth MONEY ( GBP ) , or GBP CARDINAL if sold together with the adjoining land . The sisters also jointly own CARDINAL other properties , worth GBP CARDINAL in total . In addition , each sister owns in her sole name shares and other investments worth MONEY . Each has made a will leaving all her property to the other .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that the value of their jointly owned property had increased to the point that each sister \u2019s CARDINAL share was worth significantly more than the current exemption threshold for inheritance tax ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE , inheritance tax is charged at PERCENT on the value of a person \u2019s property , including his or her share of anything owned jointly , passing on his or her death , and on lifetime transfers made within DATE of death . The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP CARDINAL for transfers DATE and DATE ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Interest is charged , currently at PERCENT , on any tax not paid within DATE after DATE in which the death occurred , no matter what caused the delay in payment . Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid , at the taxpayer \u2019s election , in CARDINAL equal DATE instalments , unless the property is sold , in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)-(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge . With effect from DATE this exemption was extended to a deceased \u2019s \u201c civil partner \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of LAW was to provide same - sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships , and to confer on them , as far as possible , the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage .", "CARDINAL . A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are ( i ) of the same sex ; ( ii ) not already married or in a civil partnership ; ( iii ) over the age of DATE ; and ( iv ) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship .", "CARDINAL . A civil partnership is , like marriage , indeterminate in nature and can end only on death , dissolution or annulment . LAW created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation , covering , inter alia , pensions , tax , social security , inheritance and immigration , intended to create parity between civil partnership and marriage for all purposes except in the very few cases where there was an objective justification for not doing so . The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil ORG property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage .", "CARDINAL . When LAW was passing through ORG , an amendment to it was adopted in ORG by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership , and the associated inheritance - tax concession , to family members within the \u201c prohibited degrees of relationship \u201d , if ( i ) they were DATE ; ( ii ) they had cohabited for DATE ; and ( iii ) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person . The amendment was reversed when the PERSON returned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the course of the debate in ORG , Lord PERSON , a ORG peer , stated :", "\u201c I have great sympathy with the noble ORG , Lady O\u2019Caithlin [ the NORP peer who proposed the amendment ] , when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative . Indeed , she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times DATE at Second Reading and in ORG \u2013and I have pushed the government very hard to look at this issue . There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with , but this is not the PERSON in which to do it . This PERSON is about same - sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings . \u201d", "During the same debate , Lord PERSON , a NORP peer , stated :", "\u201c There is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties . But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument . This PERSON is inappropriate for dealing with that issue . \u201d", "During the course of the debate in ORG , PERSON , Member of ORG , Deputy Minister for Women and Equality , stated :", "\u201c As I suggested on Second Reading , we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill \u2013 granting legal recognition to same - sex couples , ensuring that CARDINAL of couples living together in long - term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law , with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings .", "We heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that LAW is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives , not because those concerns are not important , but because the PERSON is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE entered into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c So far as it is possible to do so , primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides ( so far as relevant ) :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right , it may make a declaration of that incompatibility . ...", "( CARDINAL ) A declaration under this section ...", "( a ) does not affect the validity , continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given ; and", "( b ) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right .", "( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) does not apply to an act if", "( a ) as a result of CARDINAL or more provisions of primary legislation , the authority could not have acted any differently ; or", "( b ) in the case of CARDINAL or more provisions of ... primary legislation which can not be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights , the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions . ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies if", "( a ) a provision of legislation has been declared under LAW to be incompatible with a LAW right and , if an appeal lies \u2013", "( i ) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so ; or", "( ii ) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time ; or", "( iii ) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned ; or", "( b ) it appears to a Minister of the ORG or Her Majesty in ORG that , having regard to a finding of ORG made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against GPE , a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of GPE arising from the Convention .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section , he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the objective of giving the national courts the power under section CARDINAL had been to provide a formal means for notifying the government and ORG about a situation in which legislation was found not to comply with the LAW , and to provide a mechanism for speedily correcting the defect . Once a declaration had been made ( or once ORG had found a violation based on a provision of domestic law ) , there were CARDINAL alternative avenues for putting right the problem : either primary legislation could be introduced in ORG , or the minister concerned could exercise his summary power of amendment under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . When LAW passed through ORG on DATE , the Lord Chancellor explained that :", "\u201c [ W]e expect that the government and ORG will in all cases almost certainly be prompted to change the law following a declaration of incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL of the ministers with responsibility for LAW explained to ORG on DATE that :", "\u201c Our proposals [ for remedial orders ] safeguard parliamentary procedures and sovereignty , ensure proper supervision of our laws and ensure that we can begin to get the ability both to enforce human rights law and to create a human rights culture . They also ensure that we can do it in the context of not having to worry that if something is decided by ORG or by our courts that creates an incompatibility , we do not have a mechanism to deal with it in the quick and efficient way that may be necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to statistics provided by the ORG and last updated on DATE , since LAW came into force on DATE there had been CARDINAL declarations of incompatibility . Of these , CARDINAL had been overturned on appeal and CARDINAL remained subject to appeal in whole or in part . Of the CARDINAL declarations which had become final , CARDINAL related to provisions that had already been remedied by primary legislation at the time of the declaration ; CARDINAL had been remedied by subsequent primary legislation ; CARDINAL had been remedied by a remedial order under LAW ; CARDINAL was being remedied by primary legislation in the course of being implemented ; one was the subject of public consultation ; and CARDINAL ( relating to the same issue ) would be the subject of remedial measures which the government intended to lay before ORG in the DATE . In CARDINAL case , A v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC DATE , ORG made a declaration of incompatibility concerning section CARDINAL of the Anti - Terrorism , Crime and Security Act DATE , which gave the Secretary of ORG power to detain suspected international terrorists in certain circumstances . The government responded immediately by repealing the offending provision by LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . While in common law systems there has traditionally been freedom of testamentary devolution , in civil law systems the order of succession is generally established by statute or code , with some particularly privileged categories of heirs , normally the spouse and close relatives , being granted automatic rights to a portion of the estate ( the so - called reserved shares ) , which can not generally be modified by the decedent \u2019s will . The position of each heir depends therefore on the combined effect of family law and tax law .", "CARDINAL . From the information available to the ORG , it would appear that some form of civil partnership , with varying effects on matters of inheritance , are available in CARDINAL member GPE , namely GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Spouses and close relatives , including siblings , are granted statutory inheritance rights in virtually all member GPE . In a majority of member GPE , siblings are treated less favourably in terms of succession rights than the surviving spouse but more favourably than the surviving civil partner ; and only a few member GPE grant the surviving civil partner inheritance rights equal to those of the surviving spouse . Inheritance tax schemes usually follow the order of succession , although in certain countries , such as GPE and GPE , the surviving spouse is granted a more favourable tax exemption than any other category of heir ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
