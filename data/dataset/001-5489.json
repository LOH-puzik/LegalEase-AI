{"ITEMID": "001-5489", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ISL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "KONRADSSON v. ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by Mr PERSON , an advocate practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr ORG , Director ORG and ORG .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the domestic courts\u2019 judgments , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant drove his car along a country road up a slope , and met CARDINAL lorries travelling at short intervals in the opposite direction . As the applicant met the third lorry he lost control of his car which went off the road , which went unnoticed by the lorry drivers . The car went over a patch of stony gravel , came to a halt at a fence and was damaged . His head was knocked against the windscreen ; he lost consciousness and was taken to hospital .", "The applicant instituted proceedings against the company that owned the lorries and its insurance company before ORG and requested compensation for the damage to his car and the loss of its use , claiming that the third lorry was being driven unduly fast and very carelessly . According to the applicant when he noticed the lorries he reduced his speed from QUANTITY to QUANTITY . The third lorry drove so far over to the applicant \u2019s side of the road that the applicant had been forced to the edge and off the road . The applicant had stated that he drove on radial tyres of the so - called DATE type .", "The respondents disputed that the accident could be attributed to any facts for which they were responsible and challenged the applicant \u2019s assertion that the driver of the third lorry had failed to yield to the side and was travelling at high speed . While the lorry drivers had been travelling as slowly and carefully as possible under the circumstances , the applicant had himself acknowledged in the police reports that he had been travelling at QUANTITY . There was no evidence as to the position on the road of the respective vehicles when they met . In any event the applicant was in part responsible , as he had driven with summer tyres at a considerable speed on a slippery road .", "According to the applicant , during the proceedings before ORG he had submitted certain evidence , mainly police reports , in support of his statement of the facts of the case , which counsel for the defendant had stated was a correct presentation of the facts . Moreover , counsel for each party had the following declaration recorded :", "\u201c That they are in agreement to base their case on the statements given by witnesses as if they had been confirmed in court , should witnesses be unable to appear before it . \u201d", "By judgment of DATE ORG ordered the respondents to pay the applicant approximately ORG CARDINAL in compensation plus an amount for legal costs .", "In its judgment ORG observed that , while the applicant was driving up the slope at PERSON , he met CARDINAL lorries driving in succession down the slope in a southerly direction . According to the statements of witness PERSON , who was driving at a short distance in front of the applicant \u2019s car , and of witness PERSON , who observed the events at a distance of QUANTITY , the vehicles proceeded fast , in spite of the fact that the road was slippery and narrow compared to their size . The drawing made by NORP police indicated that the road was QUANTITY wide and flanked by gravel shoulders QUANTITY wide at the point where the applicant \u2019s car went off , while the rearmost lorry was QUANTITY wide . ORG further observed that the road was covered with a thin layer of snow and was slippery . The driver of the leading lorry stated that its speed was QUANTITY , the driver of the second lorry stated that its speed had been QUANTITY . Given the conditions at the scene and , in particular , the third lorry \u2019s width , its speed was deemed excessive . Considering witness PERSON \u2019s statement that the lorry had not been swung to the side to make room for the applicant \u2019s car and police officer PERSON \u2019s report to the effect that no evidence had been found to the contrary , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s assertion that its driver had failed to observe the relevant provisions of FAC . It found it not established that the applicant \u2019s car had been inadequately equipped . Nor could he be considered to have driven with such lack of care as to make him partly responsible for the accident .", "The company that owned the lorries and the insurance company appealed to ORG .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the appellant companies .", "In reaching this conclusion ORG observed that the facts of the case were not adequately described in the ORG judgment . It considered the various items of evidence in the case , notably the initial report of ORG , which quoted statements by the applicant and witnesses PERSON and PERSON , subsequent witness statements taken by the police from PERSON and PERSON and the latter \u2019s testimony to ORG , statements taken by the police in DATE from the CARDINAL lorry drivers , and a police report of DATE . ORG noted , inter alia , the following .", "In the initial police report it was indicated that the applicant \u2019s car was equipped with DATE tyres but that , according to his own statement he had been driving with radial tyres . The driver of the rearmost lorry had stated that he had proceeded as closely to the road edge as possible and that the applicant had done the same , that the estimated speed of the lorries was QUANTITY and that the slippery condition of the road was the only factor requiring caution . None of the lorry drivers had noticed the applicant \u2019s mishap . DATE after the accident witnesses PERSON and PERSON had made statements to the effect that they were unable to say where on the road the rearmost lorry had been while meeting the applicant \u2019s car , whereas in later statements they had indicated that the lorries proceeded on the middle of the road . DATE after the event witness PERSON had stated that the lorries proceeded at high speed , while witness PERSON had not , until ORG hearing , commented on the speed but without being able to do so with any accuracy . In the view of ORG , the above witnesses were in a poor position to observe clearly the events leading to the accident and exactly how the danger had developed ; this reduced the evidential value of their statements .", "Moreover , ORG noted a number of deficiencies in the initial police report ( of DATE ) and the drawing of the scene appended to it , including on such matters as tyre tracks , the absence of a scale , an indication of the time of the police \u2019s arrival at the scene and , in particular , the road dimensions . According to the road measurements reproduced in the police report , the width of the permanent road surface was QUANTITY , and the width of each road shoulder QUANTITY , making a total width of QUANTITY . The lorries had been QUANTITY wide , and the applicant \u2019s car QUANTITY wide . According to the drawing the vehicles thus had a surplus space of QUANTITY within which to pass . This made it clear to ORG that the road dimensions indicated could not be accurate and that the drawing had little evidential value as regards the circumstances at the scene .", "ORG concluded that the applicant should have been aware that it would be difficult and risky to pass so large and voluminous vehicles on the slope , as the road could be assumed to have been narrow and his car was not perfectly equipped for DATE driving . He should have stopped his car as close to the edge as possible and waited there until the lorries had passed , as he clearly was in a better position to yield and make room on the road . Instead he drove without hesitation up the slope , regardless of success or failure . By this conduct he had obviously endangered his own car and safety . He had failed to establish that the lorries proceeded too fast or unduly on to his side of the road and that the accident could be traced to any other cause than his own inadvertence .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to reopen the proceedings , which the latter refused on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
