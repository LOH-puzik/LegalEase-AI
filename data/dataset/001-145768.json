She always felt that she was a female in a male body but decided to cope with the situation . In DATE she married a woman and in DATE they had a child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started feeling worse in DATE , and decided in DATE to seek medical help . In DATE she was diagnosed as a transsexual . Since that time , she has lived as a woman . On DATE she underwent gender reassignment surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant changed her first names and renewed her passport and driver \u2019s licence but she could not have her identity number changed . The identity number still indicates that she is male , as does her passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the local registry office ( maistraatti , magistraten ) to confirm her status as female and to change her male identity number to a female CARDINAL as it no longer corresponded to the actual reality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local registry office refused the applicant \u2019s request . It found that , under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Transsexuals ( Confirmation of Gender ) Act ( laki transseksuaalin sukupuolen vahvistamisesta , lagen om fastst\u00e4llande av transsexuella personers k\u00f6nstillh\u00f6righet ) , confirmation of such status required that the person was not married or that the spouse gave his or her consent ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As the applicant \u2019s wife had not given her consent to the transformation of their marriage into a registered partnership ( rekister\u00f6ity parisuhde , registrerat partnerskap ) , the applicant \u2019s new gender could not be recorded in the population register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings in ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) complaining , inter alia , that her wife \u2019s decision not to give her consent , which she was perfectly entitled to withhold as they both preferred to remain married , meant that the applicant could not be registered as female . A divorce would be against their religious convictions . A registered partnership did not provide the same security as marriage and would mean , among other things , that their child would be placed in a different situation from children born within wedlock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint on the same grounds as the local registry office . Moreover , it found , inter alia , that the impugned decision of DATE was not contrary to LAW as same - sex partners had the possibility , by registering their relationship , to benefit from family - law protection in a manner partially comparable to marriage . Similarly , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Transsexuals ( Confirmation of Gender ) Act did not violate the constitutional rights of the applicant \u2019s child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds submitted before the local registry office and ORG . She also asked the court to make a request for a preliminary ruling to ORG of ORG , in particular on the interpretation of LAW . Referring to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant claimed that the ORG should not tell her that a registered partnership was appropriate for her , especially when this required that her wife become a lesbian . Their sexual identity was a private matter which could not be a condition for confirmation of gender . Transgenderism was a medical condition falling within the scope of private life . The ORG was violating her right to privacy every time the male identity number revealed that she was a transsexual . Moreover , she claimed that if her marriage were turned into a registered partnership , it would mean that she could no longer be a legal father to her child and could not be her mother either , as a child could not have CARDINAL mothers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to apply for a preliminary ruling and dismissed her appeal . It found that by enacting the Transsexuals ( Confirmation of Gender ) Act the legislature had not intended to change the fact that only a man and a woman could marry and that same - sex partners could have their relationship judicially confirmed by registering it . ORG had found , under LAW , that there were no acceptable grounds for denying transsexuals the right to marry but that the margin of appreciation in this respect was wide . It was not possible under NORP law for persons of the same sex to marry , but in such a case they could enter into a registered partnership . As to its legal and economic consequences , a registered partnership was essentially comparable to marriage . The question of transforming the institution of marriage into a gender - neutral one brought significant ethical and religious values into play and required the enactment of an Act of ORG . The current state of the law was within the margin of appreciation given to the ORG by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with ORG , requesting it to overturn its previous decision of DATE . She stated that she had undergone gender reassignment surgery on DATE and that she could no longer prove that she had been male as indicated by her identity number and passport . Even though , for marriage purposes , she would still be considered as male , the fact remained that she should not be discriminated against on account of her gender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the extraordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant also lodged a complaint with ORG ( NORP - arvovaltuutettu , PERSON ) , complaining , inter alia , that she had the wrong identity number .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ombudsman for ORG stated that she could not take a stand on the identity number issue as the matter had already been dealt with by ORG and the ORG was not competent to supervise the courts . Moreover , the matter was pending before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["12", "14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
