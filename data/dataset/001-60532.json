The first CARDINAL applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to consider an application by GPE for membership of ORG , ORG decided it would need very precise information on the issue of cannabis production in that ORG and the measures being taken to eradicate it , that being the avowed political aim of ORG in person . To that end , ORG requested the PERSON g\u00e9opolitique des drogues ( OGD \u2013 Geopolitical Drugs Observatory ) to prepare a report on drug production and trafficking in GPE . Investigations and reports by the ORG , which closed down in DATE , were considered authoritative . The GPE tribunal de grande instance and the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office were among the subscribers to its publications .", "CARDINAL . The ORG delivered its report to ORG in DATE . The report contained the names of people implicated in drug trafficking in GPE . However , the ORG asked the ORG for a revised version of the report , with the names of the drug traffickers deleted in order to make it more suitable for the discussions that were scheduled with the NORP authorities . This expurgated version of the initial report was published , notably in a book sold by the OGD entitled Etat des drogues , drogue des GPE ( \u201c State of drugs , drugs of GPE \u201d ) and containing a chapter on GPE . The book was referred to in the newspaper ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After initially remaining confidential , the original version of the report began to circulate . ORG learnt of its existence in the autumn of CARDINAL . The report contained CARDINAL chapters with the following titles : ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Cannabis in GPE \u2013 the historical background \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c General overview of Er Rif \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c The characteristics of cannabis growing \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c The socio - economic impact and areas of production \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c The increase in the land set aside for cannabis production \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c GPE \u2013 the world \u2019s leading exporter of hashish \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Drug - trafficking routes \u201d ; ( CARDINAL) \u201c The criminal networks \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c The emergence of hard drugs \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Drug money \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c The \u2018 war on drugs\u2019 \u201d ; and ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Conclusion \u201d . It related how , over a period of DATE , there had been a tenfold increase in the area of land that had historically been used for cannabis production in the region of PERSON and that current levels of production made \u201c the sharif kingdom a serious contender for the title of the world \u2019s leading exporter of cannabis \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG published an article by Mr Incyan giving details of the report .", "CARDINAL . The front page of the newspaper carried an introductory article under the main headline : \u201c GPE , world \u2019s leading exporter of cannabis \u201d , and a sub - heading : \u201c King PERSON entourage implicated by confidential report . \u201d The article , which was relatively short ( it ran to some thirty or so lines in CARDINAL columns ) , summarised the terms of the TIME \u2019s report . A more detailed article ( covering CARDINAL columns ) appeared on page CARDINAL under the headline : \u201c NORP government implicated in cannabis trafficking according to confidential report \u201d , and a sub - heading : \u201c The report , which was commissioned by ORG from ORG , says GPE is the world \u2019s leading exporter and the NORP market \u2019s main supplier . It points to the direct responsibility of the sharif authorities in these lucrative activities \u201d . A summary of the article also appeared in an introductory passage which read : \u201c Drugs \u2013 ORG has obtained a copy of a confidential report sent to ORG in DATE in which the ORG says that \u2018 in DATE GPE has become the world \u2019s leading cannabis exporter and the NORP market \u2019s main supplier\u2019 . The report casts doubt on the sharif authorities\u2019 determination to put an end to the trafficking , despite the \u2018 war on drugs\u2019 they declared in a blaze of publicity in DATE . Corruption guarantees the drug - trafficking rings the protection of officials \u2018 ranging from the humblest customs officer to the ORG \u2019s inner circle ... \u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG made an official request to the NORP Minister of ORG for criminal proceedings to be instituted against ORG . The request was forwarded to the Minister of Justice , who referred the matter to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , as required by section PERSON ) of the Freedom of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , the editor - in - chief of ORG , and Mr Incyan , the author of the article , were summoned to appear in ORG on charges of insulting a foreign head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found that the journalist had merely quoted extracts from what was undisputedly a reliable report , without distorting or misinterpreting it or making groundless attacks and , consequently , had pursued a legitimate aim . It accepted that he had acted in good faith and acquitted both him and Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The King of GPE and the public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , while recognising that \u201c informing the public about matters such as the international drug trade is obviously a legitimate aim for the press \u201d , found that the desire to draw the public \u2019s attention to the involvement of the royal entourage and to \u201c the authorities\u2019 accommodating attitude \u201d that pointed to \u201c tolerance on the part of the King ... was not entirely innocent \u201d , since it was \u201c tainted with malicious intent \u201d . The articles in question contained \u201c accusations of duplicity , artifice and hypocrisy that were insulting to a foreign head of ORG \u201d . The circumstances taken as a whole excluded good faith on the part of the journalist : he had not established that he had \u201c sought to check the accuracy of the ORG \u2019s comments \u201d ; instead , he had simply reproduced its unilateral account of events , thus \u201c propounding a theory that contained serious accusations \u201d , without leaving any room for doubt about the reliability of the source . Nor had he sought to check whether the DATE report remained valid in DATE . ORG noted that the journalist had not shown that he had \u201c contacted any NORP dignitaries , officials , public authorities or services for an explanation for the failure to match words with deeds or even to obtain their observations on the tenor of the ORG \u2019s report \u201d . In addition , he had refrained from mentioning the existence of the ORG published by the NORP authorities in DATE on \u201c GPE \u2019s general policy on the prevention of drug trafficking and the economic development of the northern provinces \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were therefore found guilty of insulting a foreign head of ORG and sentenced to fines of MONEY ( ORG ) each . They were ordered to pay King PERSON , who had successfully applied to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings , ORG in damages and ORG CARDINAL pursuant to LAW . ORG also ordered ORG to make additional reparation in the form of a report publishing details of the convictions .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed their appeal , approving ORG view that \u201c what [ made ] the article insulting [ was ] the suspicion with which ORG determination to put an end to drug trafficking in his country [ was ] viewed , and the charge that pernicious statements had been made to dramatic effect solely in order to preserve the country \u2019s image \u201d , especially as ORG had found that the charge of duplicity had been repeated twice and that the insistence on drawing the reader \u2019s attention to the King in person , in an article that portrayed GPE as the world \u2019s leading hashish exporter and alleged direct responsibility on the part of the NORP government and members of the royal family , was tainted with malicious intent .", "CARDINAL . The statutory basis for the offence ( d\u00e9lit ) of publicly insulting a foreign head of ORG is section CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) , which , at the material time , read as follows : \u201c It shall be an offence punishable by DATE imprisonment or a fine of MONEY or both publicly to insult a foreign head of ORG , a foreign head of government or the minister for foreign affairs of a foreign government . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That provision was amended by LAW of DATE , which removed the power to impose a custodial sentence for this offence .", "CARDINAL . The rationale behind making it a criminal offence to insult a foreign head of ORG is to protect senior foreign political figures from certain forms of attack on their honour or dignity . In that regard , the offence is similar to that established by section CARDINAL of the same Act of insulting the President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the case - law , the notion of insulting a foreign head of ORG is to be construed as meaning abuse , defamatory remarks , or expressions that are insulting or liable to offend the sensibilities of the persons the LAW seeks to protect . Thus , ORG has ruled : \u201c The actus reus of the offence of insulting a head of ORG ... is constituted by any expression of contempt or abuse or any accusation that is liable to undermine the honour or dignity of the head of ORG in his or her private life or in the performance of his or her functions \u201d ( ORG ( \u201c PERSON . crim . \u201d ) , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act established a specific legal procedure for the offence . LAW introduced a special legal rule by providing that a prosecution will only lie at the request of the person at whom the insults are directed . Requests must be sent to the Minister for ORG , who then communicates them to PERSON . Furthermore , unlike the position with criminal defamation , bad faith is not presumed . It is for the prosecution to prove malice . On the other hand , the defence of justification ( exceptio veritatis ) , which is available to a charge of criminal defamation , can not be pleaded on a charge of insulting a foreign head of ORG . Lastly , sections DATE and CARDINAL establish a system of different levels of liability , with editors - in - chief and editors being prosecuted as principals , and the authors of the offending articles as accomplices .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the NORP courts have restricted the scope of section CARDINAL by ruling that it is only intended to \u201c prevent abuses of freedom of expression \u201d ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) and have construed the notion of abuse of that freedom narrowly .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of section DATE , they consider that the offence created by that section does not preclude political criticism ( ORG , judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) . Section CARDINAL may only be relied on in the event of a personal attack on a foreign head of ORG . The insult must therefore be directed at the head of ORG and his or her reputation , not his or her policies ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts have also held that accusations concerning the conduct of the members of a reigning sovereign \u2019s family , even if excessive in tone , do not amount to an attack on the person of the head of ORG . They have likewise accepted that the intentionally insulting and sarcastic tone inherent in the satirical form used by the makers of a television programme did not violate the right of foreign public figures to respect for their private life ( ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) . Only particularly virulent attacks , demonstrating a deliberate intention to cause harm , could come within section CARDINAL ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the intention to cause harm , the NORP courts have consistently held that no presumption of an intention to insult arises . It is necessary to prove that the maker of the offending remarks intended the insult ( ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) . The defendant is entitled to present his defence in public in adversarial proceedings , without having to go through the complex process of seeking leave to tender evidence ( PERSON . crim . , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government said that in that respect the rules governing the offence of insulting a head of ORG contained more safeguards than those governing ordinary criminal defamation , for which bad faith was presumed . In determining whether there was an intention to cause harm , the courts would consider whether the journalists had made proper , objective inquiries ( ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) and whether there was evidence supporting the allegations ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) . The absence of a defence of justification , which was available to a charge of criminal defamation , was therefore compensated for by the manifestly liberal approach adopted by the courts when determining whether an intention to cause harm existed ( PERSON . , judgment of CARDINAL June DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have produced to the ORG a judgment of ORG ) of the GPE tribunal de grande instance dated DATE in criminal proceedings instituted at the request of CARDINAL NORP heads of ORG , Presidents PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , on charges of publicly insulting a foreign head of ORG through the publication by ORG of a book entitled Noir Silence . Qui arr\u00eatera la Fran\u00e7afrique ? ( \u201c Black silence . Who will stop PERSON ? \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The tribunal de grande instance held : \u201c The offence established by section CARDINAL of LAW and the manner in which that provision is applied in the courts does not satisfy all the requirements set out in LAW . \u201d It so found for CARDINAL reasons . Firstly , section CARDINAL had established in favour of foreign heads of ORG \u201c a special set of rules that PERSON ] on a particularly wide definition of the actus reus and PERSON ] any defence based on evidence that the allegations [ we]re true , to the point where commentators agree[d ] that foreign heads of ORG enjoy[ed ] a higher degree of protection in GPE than the NORP head of ORG himself or the head of the NORP government \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the tribunal de grande instance noted that the term \u201c insult \u201d was not defined in the LAW and was an elusive expression that was not easily construed . In support of that statement , the tribunal de grande instance referred to the definition of \u201c insult \u201d in the case - law : \u201c Any offensive or disparaging expression , or defamatory or abusive insinuation , which is liable to harm the honour , dignity or personal sensibility of the head of ORG in the performance of his or her functions or in his or her private life . \u201d It reasoned that such a general definition introduced \u201c a wide subjective margin of appreciation into the definition of the statutory element of the offence \u201d that prevented journalists and writers from determining the extent of the prohibition with sufficient certainty in advance . Even more significantly , the tribunal de grande instance considered that the distinction legal commentators had sought to draw between acceptable criticism ( that is to say criticism of the foreign head of ORG \u2019s political acts ) and unlawful insults ( that is to say insults directed at the foreign head of ORG personally ) was difficult to apply in practice , for , as the relevant case - law showed , the courts considered that \u201c insults proffered at political events necessarily affect[ed ] the person [ concerned ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the tribunal de grande instance found that the offence was not \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d , as any head of ORG DATE or anyone else \u2013 whose honour or character was undermined or who found himself insulted had a sufficient remedy through criminal proceedings for criminal defamation or proffering insults under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , with reference to LAW , it noted that defendants to a charge under LAW were impeded in their defence by the vagueness of the word \u201c insult \u201d ; likewise , their inability to adduce evidence of the truth of their allegations deprived them of equality of arms .", "CARDINAL . It is not possible to determine from the case file whether an appeal was lodged against that judgment , or the outcome of any such appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senator introduced a bill proposing the repeal of the offence of insulting foreign heads of ORG . Again , it is unclear from the case file whether that recent proposal will be implemented ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
