These CARDINAL applications challenge various bans on fox hunting and the hunting of other wild mammals with dogs in GPE .", "The first application has been lodged by Captain PERSON , a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He is referred to below as the first applicant . His application relates to his challenge to the ban on hunting in GPE and his challenge , in separate legal proceedings , to a similar ban in GPE and GPE .", "The second application has been lodged by ORG and CARDINAL other applicants whose details are set out in the appendix . They are all represented by PERSON . ORG is a non - governmental organisation , which seeks to influence legislation and public policy that has an impact on the countryside , rural people and their activities . At the time of the domestic proceedings set out below , it had CARDINAL ordinary members and CARDINAL associate members . The CARDINAL other applicants are NORP nationals who claim to have been affected by the ban in different ways . ORG and the CARDINAL other applicants in this application are referred to below as the second applicants . They sought to challenge the ban on hunting in GPE and GPE only .", "CARDINAL . NORP On the basis of the facts as stated in the domestic proceedings and by the applicants before this Court , the cultural and social background to hunting can be summarised as follows .", "Hunting with hounds has a long history in rural GPE . While it encompassed the hunting of deer , hare and mink , before the bans took effect , the principal quarry were foxes . These were traditionally hunted as vermin in order to protect farm stock . Over time , hunting of various quarries evolved such that the activity was organised in a particular area around a \u201c PERSON \u201d . The modern PERSON usually involves a pack of hounds , horseback riders and others who follow the hounds on foot . Any given PERSON now has its own particular customs and practices , including codes , dress , etiquette and hierarchy . The hunting season traditionally runs from DATE until DATE ; most PERSON go out twice a week in that period , though larger ORG may do so more frequently . Within each PERSON there is a Master of Hounds and other positions . Hunts are regulated by ORG . Various charitable , community and social events have grown up around GPE across the country . Members of the hunting community share the responsibilities for the organisation of the PERSON , for example caring for the hounds of a ORG ; those involved also have a common duty to repair any damage to the land on which the PERSON takes place .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her witness statement before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which was characterised by that court as \u201c largely unchallenged factually \u201d , the President of ORG , GPE , also stated that hunting was supported by the vast majority of farmers and land owners who allowed it to take place on privately owned land . She also averred that , in GPE and GPE , there were CARDINAL registered fox hunting packs , CARDINAL fox hunting club , CARDINAL beagle packs , CARDINAL harrier packs , QUANTITY , CARDINAL deerhound packs , CARDINAL minkhound packs and CARDINAL fell packs ( with CARDINAL affiliated fell packs ) . There were CARDINAL registered NORP gun packs and CARDINAL registered NORP hunting packs , although those registered with ORG were only a proportion of the total number of packs in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. the NORP Ministers ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG of ORG relied on a report prepared by ORG of ORG , which found that QUANTITY mounted hunts operated in GPE and that CARDINAL hunts based in GPE , GPE , regularly visited the NORP Borders region .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the Home Secretary asked a committee under the chairmanship of Lord PERSON to inquire into the various aspects of hunting and its impact . It was also asked to inquire into the consequences of any ban and how it might be implemented . After conducting hearings across GPE and GPE , ORG reported in DATE . It did not address whether hunting should be banned but said that it believed its report would help inform the debate that followed its publication .", "In DATE , the Government introduced LOC in ORG , which offered CARDINAL choices : regulation , supervision or prohibition of hunting . The PERSON was not enacted as ORG voted for prohibition and ORG voted for supervision , which meant the PERSON could not pass before the DATE General Election .", "A second PERSON was introduced by the Government in DATE which banned deer hunting and hare coursing but permitted fox , hare and mink hunting subject to registration . This was amended by ORG to reject registration in favour of a ban on hunting , subject to exceptions . The registration system was reinstated by ORG . In the following session of ORG , ORG passed a PERSON which banned hunting , again subject to exceptions . This PERSON became law ( LAW ) without the approval of ORG pursuant to ORG . For the provisions of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants challenged the legality of LAW by way of judicial review , arguing that it was incompatible with their rights under LAW . A separate but related challenge was brought based on ORG law and the freedom to provide goods and services under LAW and DATE of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Having reviewed the factual evidence before it , as well as ORG , ORG considered the impact the ban would have on the applicants . It stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We are distinctly cautious in assessing , so far as we have to , the short , medium or long term effects of a ban on hunting which is regarded as permanent . The evidence of individual claimants of the actual or anticipated effect on them is unchallenged , other than by general contentions whose force we find unpersuasive . There is bound , we think , to be a decline in riding to hounds . We hesitate to say how sharp that decline might be . ORG was similarly cautious . PERSON hunts will not , we suppose , all disband TIME . Still less will related social activities collapse immediately . On the other hand , we can not but suppose that there would be a substantial contraction of hunting related activities in the medium term . More importantly , for present purposes , we proceed on the scarcely contested basis that a significant number of individuals , of whom the individual claimants are representative , will suffer in a variety of tangible and economic ways and that some will lose all or part of their present livelihood . The extent to which they may be able to find alternatives is scarcely predictable . Some , no doubt , may not .", "...", "LAW will have a substantial general adverse effect on the lives of many in the rural community in GPE and GPE . It will have a direct effect on a significant number of individuals , of whom the individual claimants are representative . Some of these effects may not be immediate , but much of it is likely to happen in the short to medium term . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court found , however , that the ban did not interfere with the private lives of any of the claimants . Nor was there an interference with their right to respect for their homes with regard either to those applicants who had land over which hunts passed or those whose homes were tied to their employment or business insofar as their employment or business would be affected by the ban . There was similarly no interference with the applicants ' rights under LAW . It also found that LAW was not applicable since membership of the hunting community was not a personal characteristic amount to a status analogous with those contained in that Article . ORG was , however , prepared to accept that there was an interference with their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL , though that interference mainly , if not entirely , constituted control of use , not deprivation of property .", "CARDINAL . The precise nature of that interference was a matter of dispute between the parties . The applicants alleged that there were CARDINAL interferences with property , grouped under CARDINAL heads . First , in respect of land , there were interferences arising from : ( i ) the use of land to hunt by the owner ; ( ii ) permitting others to hunt over one 's own land ; ( iii ) the value of land ; ( iv ) expense associated with the removal of buildings and equipment which was of use only in the hunting industry ; and ( v ) the reinstatement of land which had been modified specifically for hunting with dogs . Second , in respect of the livelihoods of certain of the applicants , there were interferences with : ( vi ) an individual 's job and/or livelihood ; ( vii ) the benefit of an existing contract of employment or contract for services related to hunting and ( viii ) goodwill in and/or the value of existing businesses which were reliant on the hunting industry for a large proportion of their income or the viability of their business . Third , in respect of other property , there were interferences as regards ( ix ) dogs ; ( x ) horses and vehicles ; and ( xi ) miscellaneous hunting equipment .", "CARDINAL . It was conceded by the Government that LAW interfered with the property covered in ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( ix ) , ( x ) and ( xi ) above and that LAW would be engaged to the extent that the LAW had the indirect consequence of diminishing the values of land or other property or of damaging the goodwill of a business . The High Court agreed . In addition , \u201c livelihood \u201d was to be regarded as falling between the marketable goodwill of a business , which was a possession , and a loss of future income , which was not . To the extent that LOC of ORG in PERSON ( see below ) had regarded \u201c livelihood \u201d as a possession , ORG declined to follow its ruling on that point .", "CARDINAL . Having reached these conclusions on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG nevertheless examined whether LAW was justified under LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the LAW and whether it was proportionate under LAW No . CARDINAL . That examination was joined to its examination of whether the LAW was justified for the purposes of the restrictions it placed on the free movement of goods and services as guaranteed by ORG law . It found that , for Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , LAW pursued the legitimate aims of the prevention of disorder , protection of health or morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others and , for LAW No . CARDINAL and LAW ( if the latter were applicable ) , that it pursued \u201c legitimate objectives of public policy \u201d . The LAW was also in accordance with and prescribed by law for the purposes of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ; no claim could be made that it lacked legal certainty or adequate procedural safeguards .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants ' claimed that the LAW was disproportionate because ORG had adopted a more restrictive measure than that proposed by the ORG and , further , that the LAW itself promoted cruelty to foxes because it only allowed them to be shot , which , in certain cases , wounded but did not kill outright . ORG rejected this argument , and instead found there was sufficient material for ORG to conclude that hunting with dogs was cruel and that it was open to it to decide that legislative schemes other than a ban were unworkable . In ORG view , the balance to be struck between the legitimate aim pursued and the interference with rights and freedoms it engendered was : \u201c intrinsically a political judgment and a matter of domestic social policy , incapable of measurement in any scientifically calibrated scale , upon which the domestic legislature had a wide margin of discretion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that , contrary to the first applicant 's submissions , no issues arose in respect of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . Claims originally made under ORG and CARDINAL made by the applicants were not pursued before the court .", "CARDINAL . The High Court gave the second applicants permission to appeal in respect of their claims under LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL and refused the first applicant permission to appeal . The second applicants duly appealed to ORG and the first applicant renewed his application for permission to appeal before that court .", "CARDINAL . Further evidence and witness statements were provided to ORG . The Government submitted that since the passage of LAW , hunts had continued in alternative forms such as drag or trail hunting , where mounted riders and hounded pursued an artificial scent rather than live quarry ; the applicants adduced evidence that this was an inferior and unrealistic alternative .", "CARDINAL . In respect of LAW found that it was not engaged and added :", "\u201c We have reached the foregoing , clear , conclusions on the assumption that some at least of the consequences of LAW feared by the [ applicants ] will in fact eventuate ... But at the same time it is valuable to remind ourselves of circumstances in the real world . The new evidence adduced by the [ Government ] shows that things appear to have gone on very much as before , even if trail - hunting is regarded as a very inferior form of sport to the real thing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court reached a similar conclusion in respect of LAW :", "\u201c We entirely agree with both of our predecessor courts [ ORG and ORG \u2013 see below ] that it can not be said that LAW interferes with the right of the [ applicants ] to assemble . All that it does is to prohibit a particular activity once the [ applicants ] have assembled . Moreover , LAW has now been in force for DATE , and the hunts have been assembling in greater numbers than ever . If they choose at some time in the future to lose interest in trail hunting or in other activities that are not directly prohibited by LAW , that will be a matter for them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On LAW , ORG followed the approach of ORG in accepting that that provision would only be engaged to the limited extent conceded by the ORG . ORG also upheld the reasoning of ORG as to the legitimate aims pursued by LAW and its proportionality . That conclusion applied equally to LAW No . CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL if , contrary to its conclusions , those ORG were engaged .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the first applicant 's renewed application for permission to appeal , brought in respect of his separate claims under Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE , should be refused as it had no reasonable prospect of success . It also refused the second applicants permission to appeal to ORG . The second applicants then petitioned ORG and , on DATE , an ORG of ORG gave leave to appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Protection of Wild Mammals ( GPE ) Act was passed by ORG on DATE and entered into force on DATE . LAW prohibited the hunting of all wild mammals ( except rabbits and rodents ) with dogs ( see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph CARDINAL below )", "CARDINAL . Together with CARDINAL other petitioner , the first applicant , as a member of the PERSON , sought judicial review of the LAW , contending that it was not within the legislative competence of ORG , inter alia , because it was incompatible with ORG DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The petition was dismissed by ORG of ORG on DATE . The Lord Ordinary found that Article CARDINAL was not engaged : hunting was a complex social activity , carried on under public gaze , which clearly extended beyond the sphere of purely private life . He also dismissed the argument made by the first applicant and his copetitioner that Article CARDINAL was engaged because hunting was so intrinsic to their way of life as to be their primary characteristic . Their case had to be distinguished from the gypsy lifestyle at issue in GPE v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG DATE and the PERSON way of life at issue in PERSON and PERSON GPE , LOC FAC and ORG , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports ( DATE , p. CARDINAL . A person 's profession or recreation might assume great importance in his life but that was quite different from the situation where an activity was so closely associated with the way of life of a particular group that it fell to be regarded as integral to the individual personality of every member of that group . Furthermore , the hunting community could not be regarded as a distinct ethnic group .", "The Lord Ordinary rejected the applicant 's submissions that Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL were engaged but indicated that , had he found any of ORG DATE to be engaged , he would nevertheless have held that ORG was entitled to come to the view that the ban was necessary in a democratic society and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of morals .", "For the Lord Ordinary Article CARDINAL could not apply because hunters could not be regarded as having a personal characteristic or status for the purposes of that Article ; fox hunting was a common activity engaged in by a heterogeneous group of individuals . To the extent that the first applicant continued to rely on it before him , the Lord Ordinary did not regard Article CARDINAL as relevant to the case . The same consideration applied to LAW : it did not confer any rights on which the petitioners could rely .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of ORG . By this time , ORG had already given its judgment in PERSON the NORP Ministers , where , in a separate judicial review challenge brought by the NORP hunting community , it had found LAW to be compatible with LAW , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE , ORG refused the first applicant 's appeal . It found no reason to depart from the conclusions of ORG in PERSON or ORG in the present case that ORG DATE and CARDINAL were not engaged . It also upheld the Lord Ordinary 's ruling in respect of LAW was not pursued before ORG . The first applicant appealed to ORG ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment on the first applicant 's appeal from ORG of ORG and the second applicants ' appeal from ORG . It unanimously dismissed both appeals .", "CARDINAL . In the second applicants ' appeal , Lord PERSON of NORP found that LAW was not engaged , judging the applicants ' complaints to be \u201c far removed from the values which LAW existed to protect \u201d . PERSON - hunting was a very public activity and therefore no analogy could be drawn between it and any of this ORG 's cases where the notion of personal autonomy was found to underlie the right to respect for private life . Nor could any analogy be drawn with G and E , cited above , or PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , where the applicants belonged to distinctive groups , each with a traditional culture and lifestyle at issue that was so fundamental as to form part of its identity . The hunting community could not be portrayed this way . That certain of the applicants were prohibited from hunting on their land was not an interference with the right to respect for their home since , in ordinary usage , such land could never be described as home . For those applicants who complained that they stood to risk losing their homes from the hunting ban , this was not the necessary or intended consequence of LAW and none of them had been evicted or might ever be . Finally , the applicants relied on the case NORP and GPE v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII , as authority for the proposition that there would be an interference through loss of livelihood as a result of the ban but , for Lord PERSON , this was a very extreme case which could be distinguished on its facts .", "Lord PERSON was not content to treat LAW as inapplicable : the right to assemble was of little value if the applicants , having assembled to act in a certain way , were prohibited from carrying out that activity . He then took the same approach as ORG and ORG in considering whether LAW was justified under LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and , to the extent that LAW No . CARDINAL applied , whether the LAW was a proportionate interference with the right to property . He concluded that it was : respect had to be paid to the recent and closely - considered judgment of ORG . Finally , for Lord PERSON , no claim could be made under LAW as no personal characteristic of any of the applicants could be described as an \u201c other status \u201d under that Article .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope of PERSON and ORG of GPE agreed with Lord PERSON , save that neither found LAW to be engaged . For them , it was insufficient simply to find that LAW did not apply on the grounds that the effect of the ban was not to prohibit the assembly of a hunt but to prohibit a particular activity which the hunt might engage upon once it had assembled . Instead , Lord Hope found LAW to be inapplicable because that Article did not guarantee a right to assemble for purely social purposes . The applicants ' position was no different from that of any other persons who wished to assemble in a public place for sporting or recreational purposes . It fell well short of the kind of assembly whose protection was fundamental to the proper functioning of a modern democracy . ORG agreed : the kind of assembly protected by LAW had to be read alongside LAW and the democratic values those ORG sought to protect .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON - under - Heywood agreed that LAW was not engaged but stated his strong wish that it were otherwise and that the scope of LAW should be developed by ORG . He also agreed that LAW was not engaged but that LAW No . CARDINAL was . As to proportionality , Lord PERSON was prepared to accept that moral objection to hunting as expressed in LAW was sufficient justification for the \u201c comparatively slight \u201d interference with the applicant 's property rights . However , LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL he regarded the test to be much stricter and was unable to regard such an ethical objection to hunting as a sufficient basis for holding the ban to be necessary .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON agreed in particular with the reasons given by PERSON and also found that LAW was not engaged . He accepted that certain activities could be regarded as integral to a person 's identity and so form part of their private life for the purposes of LAW . He also considered the activities which PERSON had been photographed doing in public in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALV ( horse riding , riding her bicycle , playing tennis and going to the market ) and suggested that if photographing her doing these things interfered with her rights under LAW , then a law banning her from these activities would have constituted a greater interference . However , a distinction had to be drawn between , on the one hand , doing such activities simply for one 's own enjoyment and the development of one 's personality and , on the other , carrying out the same activity for a public purpose , where one could not be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone . In the latter , a person might still be developing his or her personality through the activity but would have left the sphere in which they would be entitled to the protection of LAW . He agreed with ORG of ORG in PERSON that a hunt took on the character of spectator sport and a public spectacle and thus that the applicants were not entitled to the protection of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's appeal was dismissed for the same reasons . Lord Hope delivered the lead speech with which the other CARDINAL law lords concurred , subject to their opinions in the appeal brought by the second applicants . He upheld the finding of the Lord Ordinary and ORG that Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL had no relevance to the first applicant 's basic argument that ORG ( Scotland ) Act was outside the legislative competence of ORG because it was incompatible with the Convention . He also upheld the lower courts ' findings that ORG and CARDINAL were not engaged . To the extent that it was necessary to consider the justification for LAW , Lord Hope considered that there was adequate factual information to entitle ORG to conclude that foxhunting inflicted pain on the fox and that it constituted cruelty . The question of necessity was \u201c pre - eminently one for the ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that a person commits an offence if he hunts a wild mammal with a dog unless his hunting is exempt . Classes of hunting which are exempt are specified in Schedule CARDINAL of the Act . Under section CARDINAL , it is a defence for a person charged with an offence under section CARDINAL to show that he reasonably believed that the hunting was exempt .", "Exempt hunting includes : ( i ) stalking a wild mammal , or flushing it out of cover , if the conditions in paragraph CARDINAL of the Schedule are satisfied . The conditions include : ( a ) that the stalking or flushing out is undertaken to prevent or reduce serious damage which the wild mammal would otherwise cause ; ( b ) that it does not involve the use of CARDINAL dogs ; nor ( c ) the use of CARDINAL dog below ground otherwise than in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of the Schedule . The conditions in paragraph CARDINAL include that the purpose of the stalking or flushing out is to prevent or reduce serious damage to game or wild birds kept for the purpose of their being shot ; and that reasonable steps are taken to shoot the wild mammal dead as soon as possible after it has been flushed out from below ground . Further exemptions , subject to conditions , are made for the hunting of rats and rabbits , the retrieval of hares which have been shot , for falconry , for the recapture or rescue of a wild mammal , and for research and observation of a wild mammal .", "Section CARDINAL creates offences by a person who knowingly assists hunting which is banned under section CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that hunting a wild mammal with a dog includes any case where a person engages or participates in the pursuit of a wild mammal and CARDINAL or more dogs are employed in that pursuit , whoever employs , controls or directs the dogs .", "Section CARDINAL bans hare coursing , which is defined as \u201c a competition in which dogs are , by the use of live hares , assessed as to skill in hunting hares \u201d .", "A person guilty of an offence under LAW is liable on summary conviction to a fine of MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Conviction may lead to the forfeiture of any dog , vehicle or other article used for the purpose of prohibited hunting .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act makes it a criminal offence deliberately to hunt a wild mammal , for the owner or occupier of his land to permit it to be used for that purpose and for the owner of a dog to permit it to be used for the same . By section CARDINAL rabbits and rodents are excluded from the definition of a wild mammal . Exemptions are made in sections DATE ( subject again to conditions ) for stalking and flushing from cover , falconry and shooting , retrieving and locating wild mammals . Section CARDINAL gives the NORP Ministers the power to specify further \u201c excepted activities \u201d , which will not constitute an offence under section CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) a person guilty of an offence under the LAW is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for DATE or a fine of up ORG MONEY or both .", "CARDINAL . The petitioners in this case sought to challenge LAW by way of judicial review , similarly relying on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL . They were unsuccessful at first instance before the Lord Ordinary in ORG of ORG . They appealed to ORG of ORG , which dismissed the appeal on DATE . ORG took note of an expert report submitted by the petitioners , which found that the end to traditional foxhunting would bring the \u201c collapse of an entire social and cultural world \u201d and result in \u201c profound and deeply felt social and cultural impoverishment \u201d in ORG . However , ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE were not engaged . For LAW No . CARDINAL , the ORG found that the LAW did not amount to de facto expropriation of possessions related to hunting ( in particular one of the petitioner 's hounds ) but rather control of the use of property and thus there was no requirement for the LAW to provide a scheme of compensation . It was accepted that LAW No . CARDINAL was engaged to the extent that the LAW restricted the use to which the petitioners put their land and hounds . The ORG also sustained the finding of the Lord Ordinary that CARDINAL of the petitioner 's economic interest in making his livelihood as a self - employed manager of foxhounds was a possession within the meaning of that Article . In doing so , it relied on this ORG 's rulings in ORG v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON and Others v. the GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL and the ORG 's decision in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , ORG and Reports ( DATE , p. CARDINAL . However , for that livelihood and the other possessions of the petitioners , ORG had struck an appropriate balance : it had conducted extensive inquiries before legislating and had acted within the scope of its discretion in judging that foxhunting should be prohibited ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
