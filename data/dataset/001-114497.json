NORP In the course of his trial the applicant was remanded in custody and the term of his detention was repeatedly extended . The relevant part of the requests , appeals and decisions is described below .", "CARDINAL . The requests for release of DATE and DATE were dismissed by ORG on DATE and , following an interlocutory appeal ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) by the applicant , by ORG on DATE , the final decision being served on the applicant on DATE . The proceedings leading up to the latter decision were found by ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) on DATE to have been short of the \u201c speediness \u201d requirement under LAW . Accordingly , ORG found a violation of that provision and awarded the applicant the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) in just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) ORG found that the procedure leading up to a decision of ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) of DATE to extend the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE had equally been incompatible with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . A separate violation of that provision was found and , in that respect , the applicant was awarded the equivalent of some LAW by way of just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . The request for release of DATE was dismissed on DATE and , following an interlocutory appeal by the applicant , also on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested release . He relied on different grounds from those submitted in his previous request , which at that time had not yet been determined . In particular , the applicant argued that in the proceedings leading up to the ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the last extension of his detention , he had been deprived of access to the case file and his observations had not been taken into account . This request has never been determined , which was found by ORG to be in breach of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . A further request for extension of the applicant \u2019s detention was dismissed on DATE , which is why the applicant was released , on DATE . In that decision , ORG observed , inter alia , that repeated requests for release and challenges for bias were the lawful right of the applicant and that , although they had undoubtedly had an impact on the length of the proceedings , they were no excuse in themselves for unjustified delays in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , the applicant sought the withdrawal of individual judges as well as the entire bench of ORG and ORG , on the grounds of bias . These challenges had the following outcomes :", "- A challenge concerning an assessor in the ORG chamber dealing with the applicant \u2019s case was dismissed as unfounded on DATE and , upon an interlocutory appeal by the applicant , also on DATE .", "- Further challenges were lodged on DATE , against all the judges of ORG and the presiding judge of ORG chamber dealing with the applicant \u2019s case .

NORP On DATE and DATE , respectively , the complaint was declared admissible and ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under the provision invoked .", "ORG acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s request for release of DATE was based on grounds other than those in his request of DATE . The applicant was thus not precluded by law from making the second request before the final determination of the first one . Nevertheless , it had to be taken into account that the grounds underlying the second request must have already been known to the applicant at the time of the first request .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further observed that , at the relevant time , ORG had to deal with a number of matters concerning the applicant \u2019s detention , including a request for its extension . However , in view of ORG , it had been for ORG to deal first with the applicant \u2019s request for release and only then with the other matters , and not , as ORG had done , the other way round .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s procedural actions , and especially their accumulation at the relevant time , had been obstructionist in nature and that , with the term of the applicant \u2019s detention nearing its end , as authorised at that time in the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant \u2019s intention in taking those actions had been to create a time constraint for the courts . However , this had had no impact on the substantive conclusion , but was to be taken into account in connection with the applicant \u2019s compensation claim . It was precisely for this reason that ORG concluded that the finding of a violation of the applicant \u2019s right was sufficient satisfaction for him . In addition , the applicant was awarded legal costs .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL .

Awarding appropriate financial compensation under LAW is an optional remedy in respect of a violation by a public authority of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and legal entities which has been found by ORG .

This provision is of particular relevance in correlation with the right to compensation for damage ( including nonpecuniary damage ) caused by a public authority under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The provision of LAW , which allows for an award of appropriate financial compensation , is a special and autonomous remedy , which is independent of LAW .
