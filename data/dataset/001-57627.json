CARDINAL and L. CARDINAL of ORG and LAW ;", "Secondly , an individual who has been personally proceeded against by the civil party seeking damages and in respect of whom ... the public prosecutor has requested that an investigation be commenced is a party to the proceedings and must consequently be regarded as a person charged with a criminal offence within the meaning of LAW ; such a person must , therefore , before any statement is taken by the investigating judge , be informed of the charges against him , of his right not to make any statement and of his right to the assistance of a lawyer ; the investigating judge accordingly can not , without infringing the rights of the defence , record such a person \u2019s telephone conversations without the person \u2019s knowledge ;", "Lastly , since what is at issue is a nullity that is absolute as a matter of public policy - unlawful telephone tapping being a criminal offence - , it is of little importance that the conversations recorded were not used as the basis for the prosecution . \"", "On pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the supplementary pleadings there were references to the PERSON and Others judgment of ORG DATE , Series A no .

ORG The striking development of various forms of serious crime - large - scale thefts and robberies , terrorism , drug - trafficking - appears in GPE to have led to a marked increase in the frequency with which investigating judges resort to telephone tapping . The courts have as a result given many more decisions on the subject than formerly ; telephone tapping has not been held to be unlawful in itself , although the courts have occasionally shown some distaste for it ( ORG , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , DATE , jurisprudence , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The vast majority of the decisions cited to ORG , or of which the ORG has had cognisance by its own means , are of later date than the facts of the instant case ( DATE ) and have gradually provided a number of clarifications . These do not all stem from judgments of ORG , and do not for the time being constitute a uniform body of case - law , because the decisions or reasons given in some of the cases have remained unique . They may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) empower investigating judges - and them alone , as far as judicial investigations are concerned - to carry out telephone tapping or , much more commonly in practice , to issue a warrant to that effect to a senior police officer ( officier de police judiciaire ) within the meaning of LAW ( see , in particular , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . no .

Telephone tapping is an \" investigative measure \" which may sometimes be \" useful for establishing the truth \" .

DATE , and ORG , DATE , F. et autre , ORG DATE , jurisprudence , pp .

CARDINAL ) - the senior police officer exercises \" all the powers of the investigating judge \" ( LAW ) . He exercises these under the supervision of the investigating judge , who by the fifth paragraph of LAW is bound to \" verify the information ... gathered \" ( see , among other authorities , ORG , judgments of CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE previously cited ) .", "The warrant apparently sometimes takes the form of a general delegation of powers , including - without its being expressly mentioned - the power to tap telephones ( Court of Cassation , Civil Division , second section , judgment of DATE previously cited , and ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE previously cited ) .", "( d ) In no case may a police officer tap telephones on his own initiative without a warrant , for example during the preliminary investigation preceding the opening of the judicial investigation ( see , among other authorities , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG , and DATE , ORG . no .

A failure of this kind , however , would not automatically nullify the proceedings such that a court of appeal could be held to have erred if it had not dealt with them of its own motion ; they affect only defence rights ( Court of Cassation , ORG , DATE , ORG , not yet reported ) .", "CARDINAL .
