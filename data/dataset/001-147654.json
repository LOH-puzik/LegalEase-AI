Document ORG contains the following passages :", "\u201c The ORG fully acknowledges the need to establish an efficient and operational administration of justice . However , the ORG has serious doubts about the reform model chosen , which concentrates these very large competences in the hand of CARDINAL individual person , the President of the newly established ORG ( ORG ) .", "States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when establishing a system for the administration of justice and a variety of models exist in LOC . However , in none of the member states of ORG have such important powers been vested in a single person , lacking sufficient democratic accountability . In countries where the Minister for ORG appoints judges , the Minister is directly accountable to ORG , has a shorter mandate and tends to be personally involved only in the most important cases .", "Even if most of the competences of the President of the ORG do not relate to decision - making in individual cases , many of the powers listed above are closely related to the position of the judge who makes these decisions . The President of the LOC is not only a strong court \u201c administrator \u201d , he or she also intervenes very closely in judicial decision making through the right of transferring cases to another court , his or her influence on individual judges and on the internal structure of the judiciary .", "In contrast , the President of the LOC has abundant competences and , hence , is the main actor in judicial administration . However , the mere fact that only judges are eligible as President of the LOC , does not make the latter an organ of judicial self - government . Instead , this would imply that the judges have a decisive vote in his / her election . Since the President of the ORG is elected by ORG , i.e. an external actor from the viewpoint of the judiciary , it can not be regarded as an organ of judicial self - government .", "Allocation of cases", "The allocation of cases is one of the elements of crucial importance for the impartiality of the courts . With respect to the allocation of cases , ORG - in line with ORG - holds that \u201c the allocation of cases to individual judges should be based on objective and transparent criteria established in advance by the law . According to the DATE \u2019s case - law , the object of the term \u201c established by law \u201d in LAW is to ensure \u201c that the judicial organisation in a NORP society [ does ] not depend on the discretion of the Executive , but that it [ is ] regulated by law emanating from ORG \u201d . Nor , in countries where the law is codified , can the organisation of the judicial system be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities , although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret the relevant national legislation . Together with the express words of LAW , according to which \u201c the medium \u201d through which access to justice under fair hearing should be ensured must not only be a tribunal established by law , but also one which is both \u201c independent \u201d and \u201c impartial \u201d in general and specific terms [ ... ] , this implies that the judges or judicial panels entrusted with specific cases should not be selected ad hoc and/or ad personam , but according to objective and transparent criteria .", "The order in which the individual judge ( or panel of judges ) within a court is determined in advance , meaning that it is based on general objective principles , is essential . It is desirable to indicate clearly where the ultimate responsibility for proper case allocation is being placed . In national legislation , it is sometimes provided that the court Presidents should have the power to assign cases among the individual judges . However , this power involves an element of discretion , which could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low - profile cases . It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others . This can be a very effective way of influencing the outcome of the process .", "Furthermore , Section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.b AOAC enables the President of the ORG to designate another court based on the vague criterion of \u201c adjudicating cases within a reasonable period of time \u201d . This relates to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act on Transitional Provisions of DATE , which were adopted on the constitutional level in order to overcome the annulment of a similar provision on the legislative level by ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE . ORG had found that provision contrary to ORG . The fact , that some courts in GPE are so small that the designation of such a court would effectively amount to the designation of a single judge or a special chamber , further adds to this . Even though the reasonable time requirement is part of both LAW and LAW , it is not absolute , but forms a field of tension with the often conflicting right to a fair trial with respect to the fact that having and exercising more procedural rights necessarily goes hand in hand with a longer duration of the proceedings . Taking into account the importance of the right to a lawful judge for a fair trial , the state has to resort to other less intrusive means , in particular to provide for a sufficient number of judges and court staff . Solutions by means of arbitrary designation of another court can not be justified at all .", "In order to prevent the risk of an abuse of the power to allocate and to bring the provisions in line with LAW , ORG recommends that the NORP authorities use other mechanisms for the distribution of cases , especially those outlined by ORG as follows : \u201c In order to enhance impartiality and independence of the judiciary it is highly recommended that the order in which judges deal with the cases be determined on the basis of general criteria . This can be done for example on the basis of alphabetical order , on the basis of a computerised system or on the basis of objective criteria such as categories of cases . The general rules ( including exceptions ) should be formulated by the law or by special regulations on the basis of the law , e.g. in court regulations laid down by the presidium or President . It may not always be possible to establish a fully comprehensive abstract system that operates for all cases , leaving no room to decisions regarding allocation in individual cases .", "There may be circumstances requiring a need to take into account the workload or the specialisation of judges . ... The criteria for making such decisions by the court President or presidium should , however , be defined in advance on the basis of objective criteria . Workload statistics provide objective statistical data , but they are not sufficient as a basis for the decision on transferral , since they do not contain criteria for the selection of certain cases for transferral or for the selection of the individual receiving court . In order to prevent any risk of abuse , court Presidents and the President of the ORG should not have the discretion to decide which cases should be transferred or to select the \u2018 sending\u2019 or \u2018 LOC courts . In addition , any such case allocation should be subject to review in order to take into account possible harsh situations where persons without the means to come to a court that is far away from their home town .", "There may therefore be a basis for an objective system ( even though it seems that in the present case , the CARDINAL cases were not assigned to CARDINAL of the least burdened courts ) . The real problem lies in the selection of some cases , which are transferred , and in the lack of any justification , why it was just these cases that were selected . The Commission delegation was indeed informed that CARDINAL of the cases transferred was a highly sensitive CARDINAL of alleged political corruption . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Document no .
