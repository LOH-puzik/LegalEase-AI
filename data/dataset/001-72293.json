The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He graduated from secondary school ( lyc\u00e9e ) in DATE and started sitting his university entrance examinations in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , in order to attend a university degree course in GPE , would - be students were required to pass a CARDINAL - tier , multiple - choice examination organised by ORG Centre for ORG ( GPE PERSON ve PERSON \u2013 \u201c the FAC \u201d ) , which was held only once a year . Students who were unsuccessful in the first stage of the examination had the right to re - sit it in subsequent DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant failed to pass the first stage of the university entrance examination in his first CARDINAL attempts DATE . He was not therefore allowed to proceed to the second and final examination during that time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attended a private course in GPE in order to prepare for the DATE examinations . He submitted that during this course he studied very hard and , on occasion , obtained the highest marks in his class in mock examinations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the first stage of the examinations in DATE , the applicant obtained CARDINAL points which enabled him to proceed to the second stage , the required minimum being CARDINAL points . After the second examination the applicant believed that he had been successful and that he would obtain sufficient points to qualify for access to CARDINAL of the university programmes he had selected in his application form . When the exam results were announced , the applicant found that his name was not on the list of successful students who were allowed to enrol at a university . When he contacted the FAC he was informed that he had obtained CARDINAL points in his second examination .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant asked the LAW why he had not been selected for a university place of his choice , given his good results .", "CARDINAL . The LAW , in its reply of DATE , informed the applicant that he had obtained CARDINAL of the highest results among the students who had sat the second examination , but that his exam results had been annulled on the advice of an academic council , consisting of CARDINAL professors , which had found that , given his poor results in DATE , his excellent achievement could not be explained . The letter of the LAW contained no indication that it suspected the applicant of any impropriety .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through the assistance of a lawyer , applied to ORG ( NORP ) and requested that \u201c the decision of the \u00d6SYM , which had no precedent \u201d , be suspended and annulled , otherwise \u201c his right to university education would be breached \u201d . He argued that the fact that his previous exam results were not good did not mean that he would never succeed in passing subsequent examinations .", "CARDINAL . According to the judge rapporteur of ORG appointed in the case , the decision of the \u00d6SYM was based on pure supposition and should be annulled as it was devoid of any legal basis . However , on DATE , ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL , rejected the application to annul the decision of the \u00d6SYM , finding that it was inexplicable for a student who had obtained very poor results in his previous exams to be so successful in subsequent examinations . The minority argued in their dissenting opinion that the authorities had a duty to organise the examinations properly and that it was their responsibility to prove , with adequate evidence , any impropriety such as cheating .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal , lodged on DATE , was dismissed by a majority of CARDINAL on DATE by ORG ( NORP PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant appealed and sought an injunction suspending the decision of the ORG while the appeal was being examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG began examining the applicant 's request for an injunction but decided to postpone the matter until after the conclusion of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was dismissed on DATE by ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL to CARDINAL . The majority concluded that the applicant had not achieved the result through his own knowledge and ability . The minority argued in their dissenting opinion that the FAC had a duty to take measures in order to ensure that university entrance examinations and the subsequent steps leading to selection for a university place were conducted properly . The FAC had the obligation and power to punish candidates who breached the laws and regulations , if so established on the basis of adequate evidence . According to the minority , the FAC could not hold the applicant responsible for the consequences of its own failures . It could only review its procedures and take measures to prevent the repetition of such situations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked for a rectification of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , which is the final remedy in NORP law in administrative matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application for the rectification of the decision was rejected by ORG .
