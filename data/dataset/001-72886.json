They can also render proper staff control extremely difficult , if not impossible ; more specifically , in case of prison disturbances , outside interventions involving the use of considerable force are difficult to avoid . With such accommodation , the appropriate allocation of individual prisoners , based on a case by case risk and needs assessment , also becomes an almost impossible exercise . All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level ; further , in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions .", "The ORG must nevertheless stress that moves away from large - capacity dormitories towards smaller living units have to be accompanied by measures to ensure that prisoners spend a reasonable part of DATE engaged in purposeful activities of a varied nature outside their living unit . \u201d", "\u201c An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation ; a lack of privacy ( even when performing such basic tasks as using a sanitary facility ) ; reduced out - of - cell activities , due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available ; overburdened health - care services ; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and prisoners and staff .
