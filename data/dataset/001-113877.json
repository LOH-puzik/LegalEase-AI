On DATE the applicants asked the Minister for Economy ( Minister PERSON ) to declare the DATE decision null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Economy declared null and void the DATE decision , finding that it had been issued in flagrant beach of the law since at the material time there had been no legal basis for the nationalisation of the applicants\u2019 property . In the course of the proceedings , the authorities obtained expert reports determining the enterprise \u2019s potential employment capacity on CARDINAL shift vis - \u00e0 - vis the technical equipment and its condition at the material time , bearing in mind war damage . It emerged from those reports that the plant had been partly destroyed and its potential production capacity had been severely limited due to the lack of electricity . This , in turn , justified the conclusion that its real employment capacity at the material time had been not more that CARDINAL people on CARDINAL shift , not from CARDINAL to CARDINAL as estimated for the purposes of the DATE decision . Consequently , nationalisation of the plant had been unlawful as , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) B of LAW , it could only be effected in respect of enterprises employing a minimum of CARDINAL persons on one shift .", "CARDINAL .

They stressed that , despite the fact that although by that stage DATE had elapsed from the date of entry into force of the DATE Act and despite the ORG \u2019s legal duty to implement fully its provisions , the ORG had not yet enacted the ordinance , thus making it impossible for the former owners to receive the promised compensation . They further maintained that the State authorities\u2019 failure to act amounted to a constitutional tort ( delikt konstutucyjny ) in the form of a legislative omission ( zaniechanie legislacyjne ) DATE for which both the former Prime Ministers of GPE and the current one had been responsible .

The matters regulated by [ LAW ] and [ to be regulated ] by the prospective ordinances relate to the constitutional right of property , a matter which is particularly designated for regulation in the form of a statute . It is therefore doubtful that any statutory authorisation to issue an ordinance could transfer [ to the ORG ] the entirety of the matters included in the authorisation , the more so as there are already in place and in force statutory provisions enacted after the entry into force of [ LAW ] .

Moreover , the statutory authorisation in [ LAW ] does not contain directions .", "In sum , it should be concluded that in the light of the above arguments , it would not be legally admissible to issue the ORG \u2019s ordinances on the basis of section DATE ) and ( CARDINAL ) of [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint under the provisions of the law of CARDINAL DATE on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) ( ustawa o Naczelnym S\u0105dzie Administracyjnym ) , alleging inactivity on the part of the Prime Minister in that the ORG had failed to issue an ordinance enabling the full implementation of the CARDINAL Act .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .

The contested provision was not a legal basis for the final decision examined by ORG . Accordingly , it was prevented from dealing with the merits of this part of the complaint .", "CARDINAL .

In essence , the reasoning was CARDINAL - fold . First , the Prime Minister found that it was inadmissible in law to regulate the public authorities\u2019 normative activity by means of administrative decisions . Such decisions could be given only in the context of the application of the law , whereas normative acts were created in the completely distinct sphere of lawmaking . Secondly , the public authorities\u2019 normative activity was their exclusive and , at the same time , sovereign competence and there were no grounds for interfering with this activity because , in his view , it would infringe the fundamental constitutional principles of the division of powers and the rule of law , as well as the competences of the constitutional authorities of GPE , namely the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

It also held the following :", "\u201c It should be stressed that ORG case - law underlines that the ORG \u2019s failure to discharge its duty arising from its competence to enact an ordinance ensuring the proper implementation of a statute infringes the constitutional principles of the functioning of a democratic state ruled by law ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) and , accordingly , may constitute a constitutional tort . ...", "This court is of the opinion that the proper judicial protection of the applicants\u2019 interests is secured in the provisions of LAW . LAW invoked in the appeal makes it possible [ for them ] to seek damages caused by the legislative omission of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) , alleging a number of procedural shortcomings on the part of the first - instance court and the Prime Minister and a breach of LAW in that the contested decisions had prevented them from pursuing their claim for damages arising from the state authorities\u2019 unlawful acts \u2013 most notably their failure to enact the ordinance implementing fully LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as lacking any legal basis .", "CARDINAL .

This opinion is supported by [ the fact ] that at the material time the ORG issued ordinances implementing other provisions of LAW . The same point of view was expressed by ORG in a resolution of DATE ...

This situation did not change after the entry into force of LAW on DATE , providing , in its ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , for ORG [ tortious ] liability , the scope of which did not encompass the State authorities\u2019 legislative activity .", "...", "By the same token , it can not be assumed that the defendant \u2019s civil liability for the consequences of the so - called legislative omission is based on Article CARDINAL , which , in contrast to what the plaintiffs tried to plead , does not embody the ORG \u2019s legislative activity .", "This situation did not change radically on DATE , the date of entry into force of the new LAW which , in LAW , proclaimed the right to compensation for any harm caused by an act of a public authority in breach of the law and the possibility of its direct application . While the above - mentioned provision of LAW undoubtedly refers to civil liability including the LOC normative activity ... , this liability can not be taken in the abstract from regulations concerning civil claims laid down in LAW and specific statutes and , accordingly , can not be an autonomous legal basis for this kind of claims .", "...", "In view of the foregoing , the plaintiffs\u2019 claims can not be justified under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW .", "...", "Article DATE of LAW , introduced ... on DATE and invoked by the plaintiffs could be a legal basis for their claim .", "This provision includes the defendant \u2019s civil liability for the consequences of the socalled legislative omission in case of a failure to enact a normative act , where there is a statutory duty to do so .
