The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his late wife PERSON , born in DATE , had lived together since DATE and married in DATE . DATE , PERSON had been suffering from total sensorimotor quadriplegia after falling in front of her doorstep . She was almost completely paralysed and needed artificial ventilation and constant care and assistance from nursing staff . She further suffered from spasms . According to the medical assessment , she had a life expectancy of DATE . She wished to end what was , in her view , an undignified life by committing suicide with the applicant \u2019s help . The couple contacted the NORP assisted - suicide organisation , GPE , for assistance .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON requested ORG ( NORP f\u00fcr NORP und Medizinprodukte \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to grant her authorisation to obtain QUANTITY of pentobarbital of sodium , a lethal dose of medication that would enable her to commit suicide at her home in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant her that authorisation , relying on section CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of GPE ( Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . It found that her wish to commit suicide was diametrically opposed to the purpose of LAW , which was aimed at securing the necessary medical care for the individuals concerned . Authorisation could therefore only be granted for life - supporting or life - sustaining purposes and not for the purpose of helping a person to end his or her life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife lodged an administrative appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and his wife , who had to be transported lying on her back on a stretcher , travelled for TIME over a distance of QUANTITY from GPE to GPE in GPE . On DATE PERSON committed suicide there , assisted by GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed its earlier decision . In addition , it expressed doubts as to whether a ORG - approved right of an individual to commit suicide could be derived from DATE . In any event , LAW could not be interpreted as imposing an obligation on the ORG to facilitate the act of suicide with narcotic drugs by granting authorisation to acquire a lethal dose of medication . A right to commit suicide would be inconsistent with the higher - ranking principle enshrined in LAW of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , which laid down the \u201c comprehensive \u201d obligation of the ORG to protect life , inter alia by refusing to grant authorisation to obtain a lethal dose of a drug for the purpose of committing suicide .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG \u201c informed \u201d the applicant that he had no standing to lodge an administrative appeal as he lacked the need for legal protection ( Rechtsschutzbed\u00fcrfnis ) . In particular , the applicant could not improve his own position through an appeal , as his legal position had not been the subject of the administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an action for a declaration that the decision of ORG had been unlawful ( PERSON ) and that it thus had a duty to grant his wife the requested authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) declared the applicant \u2019s action inadmissible . It found that he lacked standing to lodge the action as he could not claim to be the victim of a violation of his own rights . ORG refusal to grant his wife authorisation to obtain a lethal dose of medication did not interfere with his right to protection of his marriage and family life as guaranteed by LAW ( Grundgesetz \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . Any other interpretation would lead to the assumption that each infringement of the rights of CARDINAL spouse would automatically also be an infringement of the rights of the other spouse . That assumption would water down the separate legal personality of each spouse , which was clearly not the purpose of LAW . Furthermore , the contested decisions did not interfere with his own right to respect for family life under LAW , as they did not affect the way in which the applicant and his wife lived together .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant could not rely on his wife \u2019s rights , as the right to be granted authorisation to obtain the requested dose of drugs was of an eminently personal and non - transferable nature . Even assuming that there had been a violation of his late wife \u2019s human dignity by ORG refusal , according to ORG case - law ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) the refusal could not produce effects beyond her life as it did not contain elements of disparagement capable of impairing the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s image in the eyes of posterity .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court held that in any event the refusal of ORG to grant the applicant \u2019s wife the requested authorisation had been lawful and in compliance with LAW . In particular , any interference with her right to respect for private life was necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health and life and thus also for the protection of the rights of others . Referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of Pretty ( see Pretty v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , the court held that the domestic authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to assess the danger and risks of abuse . Therefore , the fact that the provisions of LAW permitted exceptions only for what was medically needed could not be considered disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the North - Rhine Westphalia Administrative Court of Appeal ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal . It found , in particular , that the right to protection of marriage and family life under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention did not confer a right to have the spouses\u2019 marriage terminated by the suicide of CARDINAL of them . Moreover , it considered that the decisions of ORG had not interfered with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention . Even if the right to die had existed , its very personal character would not allow third persons to infer from LAW a right to facilitate another person \u2019s suicide . Finally , the applicant could not rely on DATE as he had no arguable claim to be the victim of a violation of a right guaranteed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) declared a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant inadmissible as he could not rely on a posthumous right of his wife to human dignity . It held that the posthumous protection of human dignity extended only to violations of the general right to respect , which was intrinsic to all human beings , and of the moral , personal and social value which a person had acquired throughout his or her own life . However , such violations were not at stake in respect of the applicant \u2019s wife . Furthermore , the applicant was not entitled to lodge a constitutional complaint as legal successor to his deceased wife . In particular , it was not possible to lodge a constitutional complaint to assert another person \u2019s human dignity or other non - transferable rights . A legal successor could only introduce a constitutional complaint in cases , which primarily involved pecuniary claims and where the complaint was aimed at pursuing the successor \u2019s own interests .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that marriage and family enjoy the special protection of the ORG .", "Under LAW of LAW every person has the right to life and physical integrity .", "ORG has accepted the posthumous protection of human dignity in cases where the image of the deceased person had been impaired in the eyes of posterity by ostracism , defamation , mockery or other forms of disparagement ( see decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW governs the control of narcotic drugs . CARDINAL annexes to the LAW enumerate the substances , which are considered as drugs , including pentobarbital of sodium in GPE .", "According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW it is permissible to obtain the substances listed in GPE if they are prescribed by a medical practitioner . In all other cases , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that the cultivation , manufacture , import , export , acquisition , trade and sale of drugs are subject to authorisation from ORG .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL ) of the LAW , no such authorisation can be granted if the nature and purpose of the proposed use of the drug contravenes the purposes of LAW , namely , to secure the necessary medical care of the population , to eliminate drug abuse and to prevent drug addiction .", "Doctors may only prescribe pentobarbital of sodium if the use thereof on or in the human body is justified ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If a person is induced to kill by the express and earnest request of the victim the penalty shall be imprisonment from DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) Attempts shall be punishable \u201d", "Committing suicide autonomously is exempt from punishment under NORP criminal law . It follows that the act of assisting an autonomous suicide does not fall within the ambit of section CARDINAL of LAW and is exempt from punishment . However , a person can be held criminally responsible under LAW for having provided a lethal drug to an individual wishing to end his or her life .", "According to the case - law of ORG ( compare judgment of DATE , CARDINAL StR DATE ) the discontinuation of a lifeprolonging treatment of a terminally ill patient with the patient \u2019s consent does not engage criminal responsibility . This applies irrespective of the fact that the interruption of the treatment has to be effected by actively stopping and switching off the medical device ( ORG , judgment of DATE , CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The professional codes of conduct are drawn up by the medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities . The codes are largely similar to LAW for ORG , section CARDINAL of which provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Doctors may DATE prioritising the will of the patient \u2013 refrain from life - prolonging measures and limit their activities to the mitigation of symptoms only if postponement of an inevitable death would merely constitute an unacceptable prolongation of suffering for the dying person .", "( CARDINAL ) Doctors may not actively curtail the life of the dying person . They may not put their own interests , or the interests of third parties , above the well - being of the patient . \u201d", "Contraventions against LAW are sanctioned by disciplinary measures culminating in a withdrawal of the licence to practise medicine .", "In connection with the demand for doctor - assisted suicide , the CARDINALth German Medical Assembly of DATE resolved that doctors should provide assistance in and during the process of dying , but should not help patients to die , as the involvement of a doctor in suicide would contravene medical ethics .", "CARDINAL .
