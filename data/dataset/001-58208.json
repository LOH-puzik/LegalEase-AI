The LOC provincial found that neither the searches nor the monitoring had been decisive in establishing the applicant \u2019s guilt . The monitoring had revealed that some of the calls from his home telephone had been made to PERSON telephone number and that most of the calls complained of had been made from the company where both PERSON and the applicant worked . Nevertheless , it had not proved possible to determine the identity of the person making the calls because he had hung up as soon as the telephone was answered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , which ORG dismissed on DATE . It held with regard to the telephone tapping that , even if the court order allowing the applicant \u2019s telephone line to be monitored had been couched in general terms , the evidence thereby obtained had not been the only evidence on which the trial court had relied in convicting him and , in any event , the threats had also been made in writing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then filed an amparo appeal with ORG in which he relied on the principle of the presumption of innocence , on the right to respect for his private and family life and on the confidentiality of telephone communications ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That appeal was dismissed on DATE on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... Contrary to what is said by the applicant , there has been no breach of his right to make telephone communications in confidence in the present case , since the monitoring of his telephone line had previously been authorised in a reasoned court order made under LAW of LAW . It must nevertheless be noted that the monitoring failed to produce any decisive results enabling the conclusion to be reached that Mr GPE had been guilty of making the threats of which he was suspected , inasmuch as the only finding was that frequent calls in which the caller had remained silent had been made from his home to the home of the person receiving the threats , as the caller had hung up as soon as [ the victim ] answered . The decisive factor in this respect [ the finding that the applicant was guilty ] was the evidence as a whole including the amparo appellant \u2019s recent relationship with [ PERSON , the fact that he was the deputy head of personnel in the company where she worked , the fact that it had been shown that some of the calls had been made from that company \u2019s LOC , the fact that the photographs enclosed with some of the anonymous letters were from the company \u2019s archives to which only members of the personnel department had access , [ Mr GPE \u2019s ] reactions during the oral hearing , etc . That evidence , which was properly reviewed by the [ Audiencia provincial ] in a clearly reasoned judgment that was not illogical , may be considered to have been sufficient to rebut the presumption that the appellant was innocent ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c The rules relating to the fundamental rights and the freedoms recognised under LAW shall be construed in accordance with LAW and the international treaties and agreements concerning the same subject matter that have been ratified by GPE . \u201d", "\u201c Communications , particularly postal , telegraphic and telephone communications , shall be confidential unless the court decides otherwise . \u201d", "\u201c Properly concluded international treaties shall form part of the domestic legal order once they have been published in GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the concept of \u201c confidentiality \u201d did not cover just the content of communications , but also other aspects of them such as the subjective identity of the people communicating .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that the legislative amendment made by LAW no . DATE of CARDINAL DATE , bringing in the new wording of LAW , was not perfect . The court said that cassette recordings of telephone conversations should be put at the disposal of the judge with an accurate transcript , which was to be checked by the registrar for use at the trial if appropriate . It added that \u201c if the conditions laid down by LAW are satisfied , if the judge has reviewed the content of the evidence so obtained and has given leave for it to be used at the trial \u201d , evidence obtained from telephone tapping may be considered admissible .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( auto ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG construed the NORP legislation on the admissibility of evidence obtained by telephone tapping as it stood after Implementing PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE had come into force ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . It stated that \u201c the legislature [ had ] not specified any limitations according to the nature of the possible offence or the sentence it carried \u201d and emphasised that the deficiencies , inadequacies and vagueness of that legislation needed to be rectified by the case - law of the domestic courts and of ORG .", "In the light of the latter ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG reached the following conclusions in its decision :", "\u201c In summary , the violations that render evidence obtained from telephone tapping inadmissible and determine its effects are as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) Lack of evidence . Lack of sufficient reasoning", "Lack ... of evidence capable , in the judge \u2019s view , of justifying a measure restricting fundamental rights to the extent telephone tapping does ; mere suspicion on the part of the police , which in principle serves as the basis for the court \u2019s decision , can not suffice .", "( CARDINAL ) Lack of supervision", "There was an almost total lack of any form of judicial supervision of the actual monitoring of the telephone concerned , which must necessarily be effected in compliance with the proportionality principle , which indeed can only be established through the reasoning , by , for example , listening to conversations recorded over reasonable periods in order for progress in the investigation ( in this case a police investigation ) to be checked and a decision taken as to whether or not expressly to extend the measure / surveillance \u2013 which , moreover , should not be for more than a reasonable period \u2013 in accordance with the principles laid down by LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) Periodic review . Effects", "Once the conversations have been recorded on the tapes , the judge must periodically , in the manner he deems appropriate in the light of all the circumstances , examine them in the presence of the court registrar and , after hearing the recorded voices , decide on the proper course of action and , if appropriate , order that the monitoring continue , in which case he determines the appropriate guidelines to be followed by those responsible for implementing the measure .", "If he orders that the measure should cease , the person or persons affected by that measure must be informed of the operation that has ended ... so that they may henceforth take such action as they deem appropriate ...", "Only in exceptional cases can the measure remain secret until the end of the investigation so as not to frustrate the legitimate interest in pursuing it ... but it must cease to remain secret once the investigation has ended ...", "( CARDINAL ) Divergence between the monitoring and the investigation", "... There is a violation of the right to private life or , even more simply , the confidentiality of communications in general and of telephone communications in particular where ... , during the course of the originally authorised monitoring , it appears possible that one or more new offences may have been committed . At that point ... the police must , without delay , immediately inform the investigating judge who authorised / ordered the monitoring so that he may consider the question of his jurisdiction and the requirement of proportionality ... A blanket authorisation may not be given ; nor , without a fresh , express authority from the judge , can the measure / surveillance continue if the new presumed offence revealed on the telephone is found to be independent of the offence covered by the original authorisation . Such situations , if uncontrollable and not directly supervised by the judge , cause or are apt to cause a total failure to comply with the proportionality principle . It will never be known whether or not that principle was complied with in the present case ...", "( CARDINAL ) Production of copies rather than originals", "There will also be a violation where the measure fails to comply with the LAW and all the legislation ( LAW ) . The fact that the tape recordings produced to the court were copies , not originals , and moreover represented a selection made by the police without any judicial supervision , is a serious violation of the system . ... as the judge , in the registrar \u2019s presence , must select , in the manner he deems appropriate , what is relevant to the investigation ordered by him while the remaining recordings must be kept in the registrar \u2019s custody , thereby precluding any undesired or undesirable knowledge of conversations beyond the scope of the decision to monitor . The judge must order the immediate cessation of the measure when it is no longer relevant to the legitimate aim of establishing the commission of a serious offence , whose gravity must always be proportionate to what is , in principle , an intolerable interference with private life ...", "( CARDINAL ) Finding of proportionality", "On that basis , it is necessary to consider whether or not the preventive measures used were proportionate to the aim pursued ... The judge , who is the essential guarantor of fundamental rights and public freedoms , must consider each offence in the light of all the circumstances and decide whether the legitimate interests in investigation , prosecution and , where appropriate , conviction warrant in a given case the sacrifice of legal interests as important as the dignity , privacy and freedom of the individual ...", "( CARDINAL ) Determination of the measure and its limits", "\u2026 The judicial authority must state what form the measure is to take and ensure that it is implemented with the least possible harm to the person affected by it ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
