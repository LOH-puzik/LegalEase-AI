LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth in FAC ( a municipal enterprise , hereinafter \u201c the ORG hospital \u201d ) . Caesarean section was used , with the applicant \u2019s consent , because uterine rupture had occurred during labour .", "CARDINAL . In the course of that surgery the surgeon performed tubal ligation ( surgical contraception ) without the applicant \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after her attempt to achieve an out - of - court settlement with the hospital had failed , the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the hospital , seeking to recover damages for the unauthorised tubal ligation . In DATE her claim was upheld and she was awarded compensation in the amount of CARDINAL NORP lati for the unlawful sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the director of the ORG hospital wrote to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the MADEKKI \u201d ) , requesting it to \u201c evaluate the treatment received by [ the applicant ] during childbirth in accordance with the legislation in force in DATE \u201d . The PERSON initiated an administrative procedure on DATE . The administrative inquiry concerned the applicant \u2019s health care and in particular the gynaecological and childbirth assistance she had been provided from DATE . In the process of that inquiry the PERSON requested and received medical files from CARDINAL different medical institutions , containing detailed information about the applicant \u2019s health over that period .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG , a MADEKKI staff member , telephoned the applicant and informed her of the on - going inquiry . ORG invited the applicant to comment on the case , which she declined to do , referring the PERSON to her legal representative , PERSON , instead . During the conversation ORG allegedly admonished the applicant for wanting to sue the hospital for damages , and told her that she herself was to blame for her sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms PERSON asked the PERSON for information on the legal grounds for , and the factual circumstances of , the inquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON issued a report concerning the medical treatment given to the applicant during childbirth in DATE . The report contained medical details about the applicant of a particularly private and sensitive character . It concluded that no laws had been violated during the applicant \u2019s antenatal care or during childbirth . A summary of the findings of the report was sent to the director of the ORG hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON answered PERSON PERSON \u2019s questions concerning the administrative inquiry , setting out its opinion on the legal basis for it and providing information on the steps that had been taken in the course of the inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s representative lodged a claim with ORG , alleging that the PERSON had initiated the inquiry unlawfully , since in essence its purpose had been to help the ORG hospital to gather evidence for the impending litigation , which was outside the PERSON \u2019s remit . It was also alleged that the PERSON had acted unlawfully in requesting and receiving information about the applicant \u2019s health , as it had violated the applicant \u2019s right to respect for her private life . That right had been further violated when the PERSON unlawfully transferred the applicant \u2019s data to the ORG hospital . Lastly , the court was requested to annul an administrative act \u2013 the PERSON \u2019s report DATE since its findings were erroneous . Compensation in the amount of CARDINAL NORP lati was requested in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment by which it terminated the proceedings with regard to the request to annul the PERSON report , as in the court \u2019s opinion the report did not create any specific rights or obligations for the applicant and thus could not be considered an administrative act , and dismissed the remainder of the application as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant appealed and on DATE ORG adopted a judgment by which it upheld in full the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and endorsed that court \u2019s reasoning , essentially equating the activities of the PERSON with the provision of health care , which , according to domestic law , was a legitimate reason for gathering personal data .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , in which reference was made , inter alia , to LAW and to the cases of Z v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) and PERSON GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALIV ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG agreed with the lower courts that the PERSON report could not be considered an administrative act . It further considered that this report was not an action of a public authority ( faktisk\u0101 r\u012bc\u012bba ) and thus was not amenable to review in administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . It thus remained for the ORG to address the applicant \u2019s claims that the PERSON \u2019s actions in preparing the report had been unlawful . In this regard the ORG considered that LAW gave the PERSON the right to examine the quality of medical care provided in medical institutions not only upon receiving a corresponding complaint from a patient but also when a request for such examination had been submitted by a medical institution , which had an obligation to protect the interests of the society so that , should any irregularities be found by the PERSON , they might be eliminated and their recurrence with respect to other patients avoided in the future .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG agreed with the applicant that the processing of sensitive data concerning her constituted an interference with her rights guaranteed by , inter alia , LAW . The ORG then went on to summarise the findings of ORG in the CARDINAL cases invoked by the applicant , emphasising in particular that the Convention left to the GPE a wide margin of appreciation in balancing the confidentiality of medical data and the necessity to preserve ORG confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG further held that both LAW and LAW contained exceptions that permitted the PERSON to collect and process the otherwise confidential medical data . The former listed such exceptions explicitly ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , while the latter allowed processing of medical data for the purposes of medical treatment or the provision or administration of heath care services ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or if processing of personal data was necessary for a system administrator to carry out his legal duties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG continued as follows : \u201c according to [ the law ] the PERSON has a duty to control the quality of medical care . In order to carry out such control , the PERSON requires information about the patient and his care \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c Taking into account the aforementioned , the [ ORG ] finds that restrictions to a person \u2019s private life connected to gathering and processing of sensitive personal data are provided for by law . When regulating this question , the legislator has already assessed the aim and proportionality of such restrictions , as well as has provided for safeguards against unjustified disclosure of the above - mentioned data . Consequently [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument that ORG ought to have assessed the aim and proportionality of the restriction is unfounded .", "Additionally the [ ORG ] considers that ORG has correctly interpreted and applied the above - mentioned legal provisions and has come to the correct conclusion that the PERSON , in order to carry out the control of the quality of medical care , which it is competent to do , had a right to receive and process [ the applicant \u2019s ] sensitive data without asking for her consent and that the PERSON has acted within its sphere of competence and in accordance with the provisions of the law concerning the processing of sensitive personal data . The PERSON used the information it had collected about [ the applicant ] in order to carry out its functions , namely , to control the quality of the medical care provided to [ the applicant ] , while to the PERSON hospital it only handed over its conclusions concerning the legality of the LOC actions , which did not contain [ the applicant \u2019s ] sensitive data . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For these reasons the ORG decided to uphold the lower courts\u2019 decisions .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON likums ) at the relevant time provided that the PERSON was the institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care provided in medical institutions .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON \u2019s work at the relevant time was governed in more detail by its statute ( nolikums ) , which had been approved by ORG . The statute provided that the PERSON was a government institution , whose main functions were to inspect and monitor the professional quality of health care in medical institutions irrespective of their ownership status ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Paragraph CARDINAL of the statute listed the principal functions of the PERSON , such as to examine complaints in order to protect the rights of patients ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , to oversee and issue reports concerning the professional quality of medical care in the event of complaints ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , to issue reports on the quality of medical care in medical institutions ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and the like .", "CARDINAL . According to its statute the PERSON had a right to carry out scheduled ( \u201c pl\u0101nveida \u201d ) checks on the quality of medical care as well as to carry out the required checks in response to complaints and requests ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Paragraph CARDINAL authorised the MADEKKI \u201c to request from private individuals and officials documents and information concerning questions within its field of competence \u201d . If the ORG found that laws had been broken in the course of providing health care , it was authorised to apply administrative fines and issue warnings , as well as to give appropriate recommendations to doctors and administrators of medical institutions .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , section CARDINAL of the MADEKKI statute provided that its staff had to maintain confidentiality with regard to any information obtained in the performance of their professional duties .", "CARDINAL . The Personal Data Protection Law ( NORP personu datu aizsardz\u012bbas likums ) provides , in section CARDINAL , that the processing ( which is defined as any activities with personal data , including collecting , registering , using , and so on ) of sensitive personal data ( including information about a person \u2019s health ) is permitted only after having received written consent from the data subject . Without such consent personal data may be processed only in a limited number of situations , including \u201c if ... necessary for the purposes of medical treatment [ or ] the provision or administration of heath care services \u201d ( section GPE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG Law provided more generally that processing of personal data was allowed only if that law did not provide otherwise and if CARDINAL of the other conditions was present . CARDINAL of the additional conditions was that the processing of the data was necessary for a system administrator to carry out his legal duties ( section CARDINAL ) ) . A \u201c system administrator \u201d for the purposes of this PERSON was \u201c a natural or legal person who determines the aims of a data processing system and the means of processing [ of the data ] \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
