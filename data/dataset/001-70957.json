Subsequently F. \u2019s mother denied the applicant any contact with PERSON and the applicant asked ORG for assistance in this matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge S. of ORG , having heard F. and her mother , informed the applicant that contacts between him and his daughter should take place regularly DATE . He noted that PERSON was on very good terms with her father . However , further contacts would worsen the very strained relations between the parents and were presently not in the child \u2019s best interest . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON declared that she no longer wished to comply with the settlement of CARDINAL DATE , as she had been terrorised by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that PERSON had not complied with the terms of the friendly settlement of DATE . It observed that PERSON had failed to furnish evidence for her allegations that the applicant had threatened or sexually harassed PERSON or PERSON in several letters .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG , granting the applicant \u2019s motion , issued an interim injunction . Judge S. , sitting alone , ordered that the applicant had a right of access to F. once a week on a DATE and that PERSON should stay TIME from DATE until DATE TIME DATE . This order replaced the regulation of the applicant \u2019s right of access by the friendly settlement agreement concluded on DATE . The court considered that contacts between the applicant and PERSON , as provided for in the said agreement , were in the child \u2019s best interest . For DATE , PERSON had , however , advanced factual or personal pretexts to prevent contacts . The court noted that it had heard the parties on the question of access on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON objected to the interim injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a hearing before ORG , the parties arrived at a new settlement on the applicant \u2019s access to F. which replaced the court order of CARDINAL DATE . According to this agreement , the applicant was entitled to spend every second DATE and certain fixed holidays with F. This arrangement was subsequently only partly observed by PERSON , and the applicant asked for the enforcement of his right of access under the terms of the settlement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s motions to order PERSON to pay a coercive penalty , as PERSON had not deliberately failed to comply with the terms of the settlement dated CARDINAL DATE on the relevant occasion .

In DATE and DATE the applicant asked for the preparation of an psychological expert opinion concerning custody of and access to F. , to which PERSON objected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s first motion dated DATE to challenge the single ORG Judge S. for bias , inter alia because the judge refused to order a psychologiacal expert opinion about the question of access , was dismissed by ORG on DATE .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction granting him access to his child during the GPE holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a hearing in which the parties persistently cursed at each other and at the judge , ordered the preparation of a psychological expert opinion regarding the child . The expert notably was to address the question whether the applicant \u2019s access to F. should be broadened in order to secure permanent contacts between them .", "CARDINAL . The court - appointed psychological expert ORG rendered her report on DATE . According to the expert , it was in the child \u2019s best interest to limit contacts with the applicant to TIME every fortnight or even to exclude the applicant \u2019s access to F. for a year . She argued in particular that the applicant failed to realise his daughter \u2019s increasing objections against close physical contacts with him . In her view , the applicant was out of touch with reality and showed signs of querulance and delusion ; however , PERSON also tried to influence PERSON in her favour .", "CARDINAL .

Meanwhile , in a letter dated DATE , Judge S. , referring to all CARDINAL sets of proceedings , informed the GPE representatives that the files were out of control and that it was intended to deal with the parties\u2019 numerous motions soon . Judge S. also announced that the enforcement of previous agreements and decisions would be secured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with Judge S. sitting alone , held a further hearing on divorce , custody and related family matters . It notably heard the applicant and PERSON , assisted by their respective counsel , on the question of the applicant \u2019s contacts with PERSON refused to accept the court \u2019s proposal of a friendly settlement regulating , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s access to his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a motion for an interim injunction granting him access to F. on DATE every second DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the case , which had until then been processed by single Judge S. , was assigned to Judge H. , when PERSON fell ill and retired . H. subsequently explained that it was not necessary to render a decision upon the applicant \u2019s motion for an interim injunction granting access , as the case was altogether ready for decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant objected to the expert GPE on grounds of bias . He argued that the expert had accused him of having sexually abused F.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion objecting to the expert for bias as inadmissible . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that it had been lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . The hearing on DATE was preceded by a questioning of the child in which F. had indicated that she did not want to meet her father . At the hearing , which was attended by the applicant , PERSON and their respective counsels , the applicant challenged Judge H. on grounds of bias . The hearing was adjourned because of this motion . The applicant withdrew his motion on DATE . His repeated further motions of CARDINAL DATE , because of which another hearing before ORG had to be adjourned , and of CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE were to no avail . In its respective decisions , ORG found in particular that the delays in the proceedings had been caused by the applicant \u2019s various motions challenging ORG judge and the expert for bias . This had necessitated the adjournment of the proceedings before ORG until the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had fixed another date for a hearing on DATE , the applicant filed further motions for bias against Judge H. on DATE and on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . He argued , inter alia , that PERSON wanted to cover up PERSON \u2019s ill - treatment of her son , had refused to consult another expert and that her treatment of the case was comparable to offences committed by a former official of the GPE , from which ORG originated . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , having regard to Judge H. \u2019s official statement in which she had disqualified herself following the applicant \u2019s persistent allegations , decided that she was disqualified .", "CARDINAL . In a hearing in camera before Judge NORP of the Berlin Tempelhof - GPE ORG on DATE , F. indicated that she no longer wanted to visit her father . Confronted with her former positive statements about her father , she replied that she did not love him anymore and that she would not care if he died . She expressed the fear that her father might commit suicide and might kill her as well . She stated that she wanted to live together with her mother and that she felt happy with her mother , her mother \u2019s new partner and her brothers . She emphasised that she would refuse to see her father even if the ORG ordered her to do so . CARDINAL of her lifetime had been dominated by her GPE quarrel , and she was sick of constantly having to appear in court because of this .", "CARDINAL . NORP In letters dated CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant challenged Judge NORP for bias , inter alia because she had refused to order another expert report , and requested to adjourn the hearing . On DATE ORG , with Judge NORP sitting alone , dismissed the applicant \u2019s motions for bias against her as inadmissible , arguing that they had merely been lodged to protract the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , at which the applicant and PERSON were present , Judge NORP gave a copy of the minutes of F. \u2019s hearing on DATE to the applicant . The hearing then had to be adjourned following the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision on his motion for bias . In a statement of CARDINAL DATE , Judge NORP declared that she was not biased but that she was convinced that a settlement with the applicant was impossible . The applicant then lodged CARDINAL further motions challenging Judge NORP for bias .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE and his further motions challenging NORP On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeals against the decisions of ORG DATE and CARDINAL DATE as inadmissible , as no appeal lay against these decisions . In several further submissions to ORG , the applicant again requested the court to order another expert report , arguing that his daughter had been indoctrinated by PERSON , and again challenged Judge NORP for bias .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Berlin GPE - ORG , with Judge NORP sitting alone , held a further hearing attended by the applicant , PERSON and their respective counsel . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL motions challenging NORP for bias as inadmissible , as they were merely aimed at preventing a decision . It noted that the applicant , who was awarded the opportunity to lodge motions and comment on PERSON \u2019s motions , refused to make any statements at the hearing , but had set out his views in numerous detailed written submissions to the court . The applicant then requested to grant him custody of PERSON or at least an ample right of access .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted the divorce and awarded PERSON custody of PERSON and her CARDINAL - brother , born in wedlock but stemming from the relationship between PERSON and her new partner . The applicant \u2019s access to PERSON was suspended . In reaching its decision , the court had regard to the statements made by both parties at their hearings on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE before Judge S. , as well as to the hearing of PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards custody of PERSON , ORG noted that the applicant had not objected to PERSON \u2019s motion to be granted custody . It considered that PERSON , then aged DATE , had shown close links to her mother and her new family . There was no indication of any danger to her further development if she remained with her mother . It was , therefore , not necessary to take into account outdated expert reports or to hear witnesses .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s right of access , the court deemed it necessary , in the interest of the child \u2019s well - being , to prohibit any contacts with F. It noted that the persistent quarrel between her parents constituted a heavy burden on F. The child now attempted to cope with this conflict by suppressing her memory of meetings with her father and by seeking as much distance as possible from him . The court found that it could not ignore the determined wish of the child as expressed at the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . It was therefore obliged to suspend the applicant \u2019s access to F. It argued that a child \u2019s welfare was more important than a father \u2019s right of access .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further CARDINAL motions challenging Judge NORP for bias were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE with ORG . His requests on DATE and CARDINAL DATE for an interim injunction ordering access were , following hearings , dismissed on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively by ORG . That court found that , given PERSON \u2019s express resistance against meeting the applicant and the time which had elapsed since their last contact , a decision on the applicant \u2019s access to F. necessitated further findings of fact , notably the report of a psychological expert .", "DATE . On DATE ORG ordered an expert report on the question if and to what extent contacts between the applicant and his daughter were in PERSON \u2019s best interest . It appointed as expert PERSON , a certified psychologist acting as expert for different family courts since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG , following an oral hearing on DATE in the presence of the applicant , his counsel , PERSON \u2019s counsel and the expert PERSON , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG notably found that it was in PERSON \u2019s best interest to exclude the applicant \u2019s right of access pursuant to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In reaching this conclusion , the court relied on the report dated DATE , comprising CARDINAL pages , and the oral hearing on DATE of the psychological expert PERSON The expert had questioned and examined F. on CARDINAL occasions and each of her parents on CARDINAL occasions respectively . Given the refusal of both PERSON and PERSON to meet the applicant in the presence of the expert , the latter had questioned them all separately . Having regard to the findings of this expert , the court noted that PERSON , then aged twelve , had a negative attitude towards her father . The court , like the expert , considered that the negative attitude of the child towards the applicant might have partly been caused by the mother \u2019s influence , though not to the extent believed by the applicant . The court noted that according to the expert , the GPE ongoing quarrels had placed a great strain on the child . The court acceded to the findings of the expert that , in view of PERSON \u2019s intensive resistance against any contact with her father , enforcing such contacts might cause her serious psychological harm . The court further found that the expert opinion on the question whether it was in PERSON \u2019s best interest to have contacts with her father was exhaustive and conclusive . Accordingly , it had not been necessary to appoint a second expert or a psychiatric expert as requested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG further explained that it did not consider it suitable to limit in time the prohibition on access , as it could not be foreseen whether , if at all , PERSON might give up her resistance . Both parents were under an obligation to contribute to a change in her attitude . The main responsibility lay with PERSON \u2019s mother , who would have to overcome her own negative feelings towards the applicant in order to influence PERSON and to improve her father \u2019s image . If the applicant respected his daughter \u2019s wish to keep distance for a longer period of time , there would be a possibility to resume contacts carefully at a later stage . ORG , referring to Sections CARDINAL a \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , and CARDINAL b \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) considered that it had not been required to hear F. and her mother personally .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the applicant dated DATE , the presiding judge of ORG explained , inter alia , that PERSON \u2019s allegations that PERSON had been sexually abused by the applicant had not been addressed in the court \u2019s judgment as they had been irrelevant . Moreover , he informed the applicant that the court had refrained from hearing PERSON again pursuant to LAW b \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , of GPE . Given the lengthy and embittered dispute , the court had not considered it justifiable to subject PERSON to the strains caused by yet another hearing , as she had repeatedly expressed her will in an unequivocal manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision that the costs of the proceedings before ORG of CARDINAL ORG , which notably comprised the expenses of the expert PERSON , be borne by him . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision that CARDINAL of the costs for the expert report rendered by ORG be borne by him . Several further objections and appeals concerning the costs of the proceedings , including a motion to challenge a judge of ORG for bias , were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In the context of separate proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE for the enforcement of his right of access under the terms of the agreement of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held a hearing on DATE , with Judge S. sitting alone . Following the hearing , ORG stated that the parties had agreed that the applicant should have contact with F. on her birthday and on DATE for TIME respectively , and on DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with Judge PERSON sitting alone , granted the applicant access to PERSON for TIME on her birthday by way of an interim injunction . PERSON subsequently withdrew her appeal against this injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties that the request for enforcement of access had been settled at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeated requests for enforcement measures and for an amendment of the decision on access . The mother suggested to join the proceedings no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties that all motions concerning access be processed in the context of the proceedings no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a complaint with ORG . Referring to ORG decision of DATE in the proceedings no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL , he complained in his CARDINAL - page submissions that the suspension of access to his child violated his parental rights and was contrary to the child \u2019s well - being . He complained that the expert appointed in the appeal proceedings had been misled by PERSON and that further expertise had been necessary . He also noted that PERSON had not appeared at the court hearing . In his view , he was blamed for his lengthy struggle to secure his right of access . Subsequently , upon query , the applicant filed a further document . On DATE the applicant filed further submissions in support of his lawyer \u2019s observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint concerning his request for further information about his daughter , notably her current address . The said proceedings are the subject matter of the application no . FAC before the Court . Moreover , on DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint concerning the rejection of his renewed request for access to F. In the course of these proceedings , the applicant met his daughter once in DATE . The latter proceedings are the subject matter of the application no . CARDINAL before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE F. attained the age of majority . The applicant had not been granted a right of access to her until then .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , i.e. before the entry into force of the amended Law on Family Matters ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht ) on DATE , the relevant provision of the Civil Code concerning access to a child born in wedlock was worded as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL . A parent not having custody has the right to personal contact with the child . The parent not having custody and the person having custody must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with others or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing .", "CARDINAL . The family court can determine the scope of that right and can prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ; as long as no decision is made , the right , under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , of the parent not having custody may be exercised throughout the period of contact . The family court can restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
