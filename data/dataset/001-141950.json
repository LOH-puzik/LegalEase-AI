In DATE ORG of GPE registered a non - profit non - governmental association , \u201c The Art of Living \u201d ( hereinafter \u201c the association \u201d ) . The goals the association set out in its charter included the \u201c promotion of social adaptation \u201d , the popularisation of a healthy lifestyle , helping people in stressful situations and improving social and family relations . In practical terms the activity of the association consisted of training sessions , lectures , personal consultations and the like . Participation in the \u201c programmes \u201d of the association was offered to anyone interested and was free of charge , although participants were encouraged to make voluntary contributions to support the activities of the association . The association also issued a number of brochures containing information about its goals and basic principles . The brochures explained that the association was inspired by the teachings of PERSON , a modern NORP spiritual leader . According to CARDINAL of the brochures , participation in the programmes of the association would help its participants to fight insomnia and depression , strengthen their cardio - vascular systems , control their emotions and boost their natural defence mechanisms .", "CARDINAL . The association operated without a licence . On DATE the association applied to ORG for a licence . On an unspecified date in DATE the ORG confirmed to the association that it did not require a licence to run its programmes , stating the following :", "\u201c ... Your type of activity , [ namely ] yoga seminars with application of the postures ( asana ) of ORG , ORG , and ORG ( practising kriya pranayama , i.e. rhythmical breathing at different speeds ) does not belong to the category of sports activities or health - improving gymnastics and is not listed in ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

Participants were recommended to follow a certain diet and do exercises at home . The applicant claimed that she had been doing the exercises regularly herself since DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON and her sister started to attend daily training sessions on the premises of the association . PERSON contributed MONEY ( CARDINAL ) to the association as a gift . Upon completion of the course Ms GPE was encouraged to enrol in an advanced course called \u201c Eternity \u201d , which was run by a different instructor , PERSON", "CARDINAL . At a certain point PERSON started experiencing serious psychological problems . Her mother called the association and blamed the instructors for having turned Ms S.D. \u201c into a zombie \u201d . According to the applicant , PERSON mother was a fervent NORP and did not approve of her ORG interest in a group which the mother described as a \u201c sect \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE PERSON mother called the emergency psychiatric services for her daughter ; a doctor administered an injection , which did not help . Shortly thereafter PERSON fainted and was hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the following months PERSON was hospitalised several times . The diagnosis initially made was \u201c reactive psychosis \u201d . Later the doctors described her mental condition as a \u201c stress - related schizoid disorder \u201d .

According to the doctors at the clinic where Ms GPE was treated , her mental condition was related to her participation in the programmes of the association , which was referred to in the medical record of DATE as a \u201c sect \u201d . Later entries in her medical record also mentioned the \u201c religious \u201d character of her delusions . Following the admission of PERSON to the clinic , an internal inquiry was conducted , which concluded that her medical condition was of a \u201c religious and occult nature \u201d and had been caused by her participation in the programmes of the association .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE an investigator from the GPE Region police force questioned PERSON in connection with the events of DATE . According to her testimony , the association received payment from the participants of the programme ; the programme consisted of breathing techniques , listening to audio - recordings of the voice of the guru , and other similar practices which LOC characterised as brainwashing . Ms GPE testified that she had almost stopped eating completely during the period she was attending the courses because the teachers had told her that food was poison . She had also dropped out of her course at the university . At some point she had lost track of the events and had returned to her normal self only in the clinic .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Ms GPE was examined by a group of psychiatrists , including Dr Gul . , PERSON , and PERSON . PERSON . acted as the \u201c rapporteur \u201d for the group of experts . In report no . CARDINAL , the group concluded that PERSON had developed an \u201c acute schizoid psychotic disorder \u201d which was related to her participation in the programmes of the association . The experts concluded that after DATE Ms GPE had regained her mental health and , at the time of examination , was capable of participating in the proceedings and giving accurate testimony to the investigator and before the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from the GPE Region police department opened a criminal investigation under Article CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c Illegal medical practice \u201d ) . The investigative authorities suspected that members of the association had been involved in quackery and had dispensed medical services to PERSON ( \u201c the alleged victim \u201d ) without the necessary licences and training . However , the investigative authorities did not charge anybody with that crime when opening the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator ordered an expert examination of the activities of the association . In particular , the investigator sought to establish whether the association had been dispensing medical services to the participants of the programmes , and whether the alleged victim had suffered any damage to her health as a result of participating in those programmes . The examination was entrusted to ORG ( MFB ) of the regional ORG . An expert team was put together which consisted of PERSON . ( the president ) , PERSON . , Dr GPE . , and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigative authorities searched the applicant \u2019s house and seized documents and literature related to the activities of the association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered the first report . The report was based on an examination of the materials in the criminal case file . The report noted that the techniques used by the association in its programmes were known both in conventional ( scientific ) and alternative ( \u201c folk \u201d ) medicine circles . However , it did not answer the question as to whether those techniques were medical . It also concluded that the medical condition of the alleged victim was \u201c most probably \u201d related to her participation in the programmes of the association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator asked the MFB to carry out an \u201c additional \u201d ( dopolnitelnaya ) expert examination of the activities of the association . The ORG expert team was composed of PERSON . ( the president ) , PERSON . and Dr PERSON . Again , the experts did not examine Ms GPE in person and based their conclusions on the written materials contained in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a second report as requested by the investigator ( no . CARDINAL ) . The MFB again did not give a definite answer to the question of whether the association had been dispensing medical services . It noted that the charter of incorporation and other documents pertaining to the association did not contain any indication as to the medical nature of its programmes . In the opinion of the experts , it was important to distinguish between the \u201c Eternity \u201d programme and the other programmes of the association .", "CARDINAL . The experts also concluded that in the particular case of the alleged victim the techniques used by the association were at the origin of her mental disorder . The basic programme , referred to by the experts as \u201c The Art of Living \u201d , had weakened the alleged victim physically . Her subsequent involvement in the \u201c Eternity \u201d programme had aggravated her somatic condition with a psychiatric disorder .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the investigator in charge of the case requested the opinion of ORG concerning the activities of the association . On DATE the Acting Minister of ORG replied in the following terms :", "\u201c The practising of folk medicine ... is subject to the licensing requirement laid down in LAW DATE \u201c On the licensing of certain types of activities \u201d , Governmental Decree no .

On DATE the investigator questioned PERSON again . She largely confirmed her earlier testimony . She also explained that as a part of her participation in the \u201c programme \u201d she had had an obligation to practise special breathing techniques TIME for DATE in a row , and that she had not been allowed to eat meat or fish in any form . She described in detail the \u201c Eternity \u201d programme , which was conducted by the applicant \u2019s co - accused , PERSON , and described the effects that programme had had on her physical condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator ordered a new expert examination of the activities of the association . The examination was entrusted to PERSON , chief psychotherapist of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report was prepared on DATE . A copy of that report was submitted to ORG but is only partially legible .", "CARDINAL . The first question put to the expert concerned the licensing requirements for folk medicine . The expert replied that the licensing of folk medicine was regulated by Governmental Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The investigator further asked whether certain practices ( such as \u201c breath gymnastics \u201d , \u201c hypnotic infusion \u201c , \u201c physical exercises on the basis of yoga postures \u201d , and \u201c entrancement \u201d ) belonged to the methods of folk medicine and required a medical licence . As to \u201c yoga postures \u201d , the expert concluded that they were not \u201c medical activities \u201d and did not require a licence . Concerning \u201c breath gymnastics \u201d and \u201c hypnotic infusion \u201d , the expert confirmed that these were well - known psychotherapeutic methods , but they had not been used by the association . Elements of those programmes could be used by medical doctors as supplementary methods of psychotherapeutic treatment ; however , the \u201c Art of Living \u201d programmes , according to the expert , did not have any medical purpose , were not aimed at curing ailments and , therefore , were not \u201c medical \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator ordered a \u201c forensic and legal examination \u201d of the activities of the association . It was entrusted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr Iv . , a doctor in psychiatry and the chief psychiatrist of ORG of GPE , drew up a report in which he concluded that the activities of the association had been \u201c medical \u201d in nature and had thus required a licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally charged . She pleaded not guilty as from the first questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence obtained an expert opinion by CARDINAL doctors from ORG ( including CARDINAL professor of medicine ) . The expert team examined CARDINAL people who had participated in the \u201c Art of Living \u201d programmes for DATE . The team concluded that most of the people in the test group had observed various positive effects of the programmes , including easing of their chronic diseases , restoration of psychological balance and increased efficiency at work . The report emphasised that \u201c moderate and consistent practice of yoga within the \u2018 Art of ORG programme is not incompatible with chronic diseases or old age and can be recommended for rehabilitation after traumas , surgical operations and diseases \u201d . It is unclear whether that written opinion was added to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the investigator to carry out an additional forensic examination . From the materials in the case file it is unclear whether that examination was supposed to cover the activities of the association , the state of health of Ms GPE or another issue . On DATE the investigator replied that all the necessary expert examinations had already been carried out , that the applicant \u2019s guilt had been established , and that there was no need to carry out any new examinations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned a new expert examination on the activities of the association , which was again entrusted to Dr Iv . On DATE the defence was handed a copy of the investigator \u2019s decision to order an expert examination .", "CARDINAL . The report was produced on DATE . It was based on the written materials of the case file . Dr Iv . started by analysing the applicable legislation . LAW of LAW of DATE provided that the practising of alternative medicine ( also referred to in the law as \u201c folk medicine \u201d , \u201c traditional medicine \u201d or \u201c healing \u201d ) required a \u201c healer \u2019s diploma \u201d . LAW of LAW required a private practitioner to have a doctor \u2019s or paramedic \u2019s degree , a \u201c specialist certificate \u201d and a licence ( for example , for practising \u201c alternative medicine \u201d ) . Decree no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE provided that folk medicine was subject to the licensing requirement .", "CARDINAL . LAW of DATE ( no . CARDINAL-FZ ) and Government Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE included folk medicine in the list of activities subject to the licensing requirement .", "CARDINAL . Order of ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE contained a glossary of \u201c simple medical services \u201d , which included , amongst other activities , items ORG . PERSON ( \u201c psychotherapy \u201d ) and DATE ( \u201c hypnotherapy \u201d ) . The expert concluded that such services were covered by the licensing requirement and should be provided by specialists in the relevant fields .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , referring to Government Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the licensing of medical services , the expert indicated that a person providing medical services was required by law to have , in addition to a special degree or training , a certain amount of work experience in their specific field of medicine . Decree of ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE set out a list of what constituted \u201c medical services \u201d , which included a section on folk medicine . The Decree stipulated that a licence was required to practise folk medicine . On DATE the First Deputy Minister for ORG issued a \u201c Methodological Directive on ORG \u201d , which described certain activities as falling within the ambit of folk medicine ; the list included \u201c traditional systems of invigoration \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The expert also studied specialised medical literature . He concluded that the applicant had used psychotherapeutic methods which were described in the medical literature , such as \u201c trance inducement \u201d , \u201c breath control \u201d and \u201c therapeutic gymnastics \u201d . The latter , according to ORG recommendation no . CARDINAL of DATE , could include elements of yoga . The expert concluded that the use of such methods placed the applicant \u2019s activity within the scope of \u201c private medical practice \u201d , which needed a licence under the heads of \u201c psychotherapy \u201d and \u201c therapeutic gymnastics \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The expert referred to ORG of DATE , which characterised yoga as a \u201c traditional method of healing \u201d . The same Directive noted that \u201c traditional methods of healing \u201d , including yoga , were not officially recommended by ORG for application in medical practice , and , therefore , were not covered by a licensing regime . From that , the expert inferred that in GPE \u201c official application of traditional methods of healing \u201d was not allowed . The expert further referred to LAW DATE which warned against the use of \u201c occult practices \u201d and other non - recommended healing techniques .", "CARDINAL . The expert noted that the charter of incorporation of the association did not mention that it had been created to dispense medical services . However , the brochures issued by the association described the effects of its \u201c programmes \u201d in medical terms , for example : \u201c a complex of detoxicating dynamic exercises \u201d , \u201c improved functioning of all internal organs \u201d , \u201c harmonisation of all levels of the personality \u201d , \u201c controlled meditation and certain other techniques which guarantee deep relaxation , appeasement of emotions , and help to overcome stress \u201d , and so on . The brochures referred to cases of seriously ill individuals suffering from , inter alia , insomnia and depression , having been cured following completion of the association \u2019s programmes . The techniques used in the programmes were described as a \u201c synthesis of old wisdom and modern science \u201d . On DATE PERSON obtained patent no . CARDINAL \u201c on the breathing technique \u201d which specified that this technique could be used for medical purposes .", "CARDINAL . The expert further studied witness evidence from former participants of the programmes of the association . According to some of the participants , the instructors told them that they had medical diplomas and that the programmes were supposed to have healing effects . The participants were required by the instructors to fill in forms which contained questions about their health . The expert also analysed their description of the techniques used in the programmes , such as relaxation techniques , physical exercises , breathing techniques , meditation and so on .", "CARDINAL . To describe the activities of the association its brochures used terms such as \u201c psychological adaptation \u201d , \u201c autogenic training \u201d and \u201c relaxation \u201d which could be found in specialised medical literature and were in fact techniques of psychotherapy and psychiatric treatment . The expert compared the techniques used by the instructors of the association with \u201c holotropic therapy \u201d , which is a method used in psychotherapy , and pointed out a number of similarities .", "CARDINAL . On the strength of that evidence the expert concluded that the activities of the association could be characterised as \u201c folk medicine \u201d , which required a license . The activities of the association , in the opinion of the expert , were medical in nature .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the defence asked the investigator to question a number of witnesses in order to decide whether there was a need for a further psychiatric examination of the victim . On DATE the investigator replied in the negative , stating that the personality of the victim had already been thoroughly examined and that the investigator had obtained an expert report and questioned CARDINAL of the members of the expert team , PERSON .", "DATE . On DATE Prof . PERSON from ORG situated in GPE delivered an expert opinion at the request of the applicant \u2019s lawyer . Prof . PERSON criticised the earlier expert assessments , which had characterised the activities of the association as \u201c medical \u201d . Prof . PERSON asserted that elements of the programmes of the association could be found in many traditional practices , such as yoga , qigong and various martial arts . He also cast doubt on the conclusions of the earlier expert reports that the mental condition of ORG had been caused by her participation in the association \u2019s programmes . He supposed that her interest in the activities and ideas practised within the association could have been caused by her mental condition .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s lawyer solicited the opinion of the GPE - based ORG ( ORG ) in respect of the expert opinion of DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer provided the ORG with copies of certain materials from the criminal case file , in particular , reports ORG . CARDINAL and DATE and the witness testimony of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a group of experts from the ORG , composed of CARDINAL psychiatrists , PERSON . and PERSON . , and CARDINAL psychologist , PERSON . , delivered a written opinion . Their report criticised the methods used to carry out the expert examination of DATE which resulted in report no . MONEY ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . ) , and condemned the report as unreliable and incomplete .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was heard by Judge PERSON . of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the applicant and her co - defendant , PERSON , pleaded not guilty . They acknowledged that neither they nor the other instructors at the association had medical degrees . They also acknowledged that the alleged victim had been their apprentice and that she had had health problems after completing the CARDINAL programmes . However , they denied having caused any harm to the alleged victim and insisted that her mental disorder was related to a pre - existing condition or other life circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , they claimed that both the alleged victim and her sister had been born and raised in a very religious family , that they had both had problems fitting in at school , and that they had a difficult relationship with their mother . Several members of the alleged victim \u2019s family had a history of mental disorders , so her own problems could have been explained by a hereditary predisposition . She had started attending the programmes of the association because of her social and psychological problems .", "CARDINAL . Further , the applicant asserted that the \u201c programmes \u201d of the association could not be described as \u201c medical treatment \u201d . Since its creation the association had been inspected several times by ORG , which had not detected anything illegal in its activities .", "CARDINAL . The defence also claimed that the programmes of the association were not \u201c medical \u201d in nature , and thus did not require any special education or licence . Their purpose was to help people to attain social and psychological harmony , discover the true meaning of life , and so on . The instructors did not receive any remuneration of their work and their participation in the programmes was voluntary .", "CARDINAL . In the first round of the proceedings the court questioned several witnesses . They gave evidence about the mental and physical condition of the alleged victim before , during and after her participation in the programmes of the association . They all associated PERSON health problems with her participation in the programmes .", "CARDINAL . From the materials and explanations produced by the Government it appears that neither Ms GPE herself ( the alleged victim ) nor her twin sister , ORG , appeared in court . Thus , at the hearing of DATE Judge PERSON . stated that according to the medical certificates of DATE and DATE the doctors did not recommend that PERSON take part in the trial as it could cause a relapse .

The court heard an expert for the prosecution , Dr ORG , who had participated in the expert teams which had earlier assessed the materials of the case . Dr ORG was not categorical in her conclusions and testified that she had not been given information or materials about the alleged victim \u2019s character , social and family life or medical history , and that her conclusion about the link between the programme and the ailments of Ms GPE had been assumptive .", "CARDINAL .
