On DATE the applicant was heard as a witness .", "On DATE the applicant was charged with an attempt to defraud a creditor together with PERSON lawyer , he had allegedly tried to transfer ORG \u2019s assets to certain private companies controlled by acquaintances and had prepared documents certifying non - existent rights and obligations to the detriment of not only the creditor , a private company , C. , but also of ORG in connection with enforcement proceedings .", "A search of the applicant \u2019s home and office was carried out on CARDINAL and DATE .", "On DATE his detention was ordered under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW .

The court , having regard to the contents of the file , found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence . It stated that the applicant might influence witnesses who would have to give evidence again ( as their first examination had taken place before the applicant had been charged , which made it inapplicable to his case ) , that it appeared from a transcript of his telephone conversation with PERSON that some documents relating to the criminal proceedings might be concealed , and that he was under the threat of a heavy prison sentence and had contacts abroad , which justified the court \u2019s concern that he might abscond and avoid the criminal proceedings . Referring to the applicant \u2019s new status as an accused , the court dismissed his argument that should he have wished to abscond , he could already have done so DATE ( when PERSON had been charged ) and DATE ( when he himself had been charged ) .
