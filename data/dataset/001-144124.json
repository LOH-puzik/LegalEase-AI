The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been involved in various political organisations and local and international non - governmental organisations for DATE . In DATE he co - founded ORG ( \u201c REAL \u201d ) and in DATE was elected its chairman . He is also Director of ORG , which is part of a network of schools of political studies affiliated with ORG . He has held that position for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained a personal internet blog on which he commented on various political issues . In particular , in DATE , after the enactment of a new law by ORG introducing heavy sanctions for unauthorised public gatherings , the applicant posted a comment on his blog which he claimed was meant to insult members of ORG . Without naming any names , he went on to state , inter alia , that ORG was composed of \u201c fraudulent people \u201d and compared the entire legislative body to a zoo . Those statements were quoted in the media and elicited a number of seemingly irate responses from various ORG members . The responses , also published in the media , ranged in content from retaliatory ad hominem insults to calls for punishment and threats of suing him in court . According to the applicant , the ORG \u201c lawsuit plans were ... temporarily dropped \u201d after the calls for reprisals against the applicant were condemned by CARDINAL of the ORG of ORG , who was visiting the country at the time .", "CARDINAL . At DATE REAL announced that it would consider nominating its own candidate for the upcoming presidential election of DATE . The applicant himself announced that he was considering standing as a candidate in the election . According to the applicant , his prospective presidential candidacy was widely discussed in GPE at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE rioting broke out in the town of GPE , located to the northwest of GPE . According to media reports quoting local residents , the rioting was sparked by an incident involving V.A. , the son of ORG and nephew of the Head of ORG ( \u201c IDEA \u201d ) . It was claimed that after being involved in a car accident , V.A. had insulted and physically assaulted passengers of the other car , who were local residents . On hearing of the incident , CARDINAL ( perhaps CARDINAL ) of local residents took to the streets and destroyed a number of commercial establishments ( including ORG ) and other property in GPE thought to be owned by ORG family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG issued a joint press statement , placing the blame for the rioting on ORG , a hotel manager , and his relative PERSON , who had allegedly been drunk and who , it was claimed , had committed acts of hooliganism by damaging local ORG property and inciting people to riot .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the Head of IDEA , V.A. \u2019s uncle , publicly denied that ORG belonged to his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant travelled to GPE to get a firsthand account of the events . On DATE he described his impressions from the trip on his blog . The entire post read as follows :", "\u201c DATE TIME I spent a little longer than TIME in GPE , together with [ another member ] of our GPE [ REAL ] and our media coordinator ... First , here is [ the summary of ] what I wrote on ORG during TIME using my phone :", "- We have entered the town .", "- There is a lot of police and their number is growing . The protesters gather TIME or CARDINAL and make speeches . We are in front of the building of the [ Ismayilli District ] Executive Authority . There are around QUANTITY police officers in this area .", "- The cause of the events is the general tension arising from corruption and insolence [ of public officials ] . In short , people have had enough . We are having conversations with local residents .", "- The [ ethnic ] NORP of the village of GPE are also fed up ; they tried to come to [ GPE ] to support the protest , but the road was blocked and they were sent back .", "- Everybody is preparing for the night .", "- We are leaving ORG , returning to GPE . The matter is clear to us . PERSON was the first call . PERSON is the second . After the third call , the show will begin .", "We came back after having fully investigated the situation in GPE . I wrote that clashes would again take place in the evening , by posting \u2018 everybody is preparing for the ORG [ on ORG ] . People there had been saying \u2018 We \u2019ll give them hell in TIME ; we have procured supplies\u2019 ( meaning the fuel for Molotov cocktails had been bought ) . People are angry . There are also those who do not care and who are afraid , but those who are not afraid are very exasperated and will continue the protest at TIME . This is no longer a political situation where we could stay there and try to change something ; this is already a situation of disorderly crisis which requires conciliatory steps by the ORG to be resolved .", "No one should fool oneself or others . The events in GPE were not and are not a calm peaceful protest , it is an extremely violent but just protest and the responsibility for it lies with PERSON .", "As it is with all revolutionary processes , in the beginning the political initiative is still in the hands of the President , but by not taking action he is gradually losing this initiative . When [ such leaders ] begin to react to the situation , it is usually too late and their actions have no effect . PERSON , PERSON , and all others have gone this way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant posted more information on his blog concerning the events , citing the official websites of ORG and ORG and publishing screenshots of those sites . In particular , he noted that , according to those sources and to information posted on GPE \u2019s ORG account , ORG was actually owned by V.A. This directly contradicted the earlier denial by the Head of IDEA . The information cited by the applicant was removed from the aforementioned Government websites and GPE \u2019s ORG page within TIME of the applicant publishing his blog entry . However , the blog entry itself was extensively quoted in the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG issued a new joint press statement concerning the events in GPE . It noted that QUANTITY people had been charged with criminal offences in connection with the events of DATE , and had been detained pending trial . In addition , CARDINAL people had been arrested in connection with their participation in \u201c actions causing a serious breach of public order \u201d ; some of them had been convicted of \u201c administrative offences \u201d and sentenced to a few days\u2019 \u201c administrative detention \u201d or a fine , while others had been released . The statement further noted that \u201c lately , biased and partial information has been deliberately disseminated , distorting the true nature of the mentioned events resulting from hooliganism \u201d , including information about large numbers of injured people and the disappearance of CARDINAL individual . The statement refuted that information , noting that CARDINAL people had been admitted to the regional hospital with injuries and that no one had disappeared . It further stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c Following the carrying out of inquiries , it has been established that on DATE the Deputy Chairman of ORG , PERSON , and the Cochairman of ORG , PERSON , went to ORG and made appeals to local residents aimed at social and political destabilisation , such as calls to resist the police , not to obey officials and to block roads . Their illegal actions , which were calculated to inflame the situation in the country , will be fully and thoroughly investigated and receive legal assessment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commented on that statement on his blog . He noted that the Government had taken a decision to \u201c punish and frighten \u201d him , and that there were several reasons for that : firstly , the applicant \u2019s blog posting of CARDINAL DATE , which had revealed facts embarrassing the Government ; secondly , the fact that REAL had raised a public debate on the DATE legislative amendments aimed at keeping secret information concerning shareholders in companies , creating \u201c a more clandestine environment for stealing the oil money \u201d ; thirdly , the applicant \u2019s earlier criticism of ORG , in which he compared it to \u201c a zoo \u201d , following enactment of the legislation placing \u201c severe limitations on the freedom of assembly \u201d by \u201c introducing unjustifiably high monetary penalties for attending unauthorised demonstrations \u201d ; and lastly , ORG \u201c quickly accumulating strength \u201d prior to the presidential election , becoming a \u201c serious barrier in the eyes of the traditional [ political ] players \u201d and threatening \u201c to spoil the repeat of the election farce performed DATE year \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a phone call from ORG of ORG and was orally invited to the department for questioning as a witness . Although that did not constitute a formal summons , the applicant went to ORG and was questioned .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of the questioning , the applicant stated that he had arrived in GPE in a car driven by another member of REAL at around TIME on DATE . After entering the town , they stopped from time to time and spoke to local residents without getting out of the car , in order to receive first - hand information about the events that had taken place up to that time . When they arrived at the central square where the IDEA building was located , they met a number of journalists and saw a large number of police and law - enforcement officers . At the square , the applicant spoke only to the journalists ; he did not speak to any local residents . No violent clashes were happening at the square at that time . While at the square , the applicant saw PERSON , who was also visiting the town , but separately from the applicant . They stopped to greet each other and immediately went their separate ways . The applicant and his colleague from REAL spent TIME at the square . The applicant , his colleague from REAL , and CARDINAL of the journalists then spent some time in a nearby teahouse . After a while , the CARDINAL of them returned to LOC . On their way out of GPE , they again stopped a few times and , from inside the car , spoke to passers - by about the situation in the town .", "CARDINAL . During the questioning , the investigator informed the applicant that it had been established from \u201c the material in the criminal case file \u201d that at TIME , while standing near the building of ORG , the applicant and Mr PERSON had been inciting local residents to cause disorder , disobey the police , block roads and throw stones at the police . The applicant was asked to comment on that . He replied that that information was false and a calumny against him .", "CARDINAL . After the questioning had ended , the applicant went home .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant received another telephone call asking him to come in for further questioning .", "CARDINAL . In TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant voluntarily appeared at ORG . First , from CARDINAL to TIME a face - to - face confrontation was held between the applicant and ORG , described in the record of the confrontation as a resident of the PERSON village of LOC . According to a copy of that record ( submitted by ORG to the ORG as a separate document enclosed with their observations ) , ORG stated that on DATE he had been in GPE where he had seen many police officers , as well as a number of young people slowly gathering in groups of CARDINAL . He heard people discussing the events of DATE . Among them , he saw PERSON and the applicant . He did not know the applicant \u2019s identity until he inquired about it and someone told him . He heard the applicant and PERSON telling people to throw stones at the police and to capture the IDEA building . Following this , people started throwing stones at the police .", "CARDINAL . According to the record , in reply , the applicant stated that everything that ORG had said was false and a laughable fabrication , and that it was an attempt to frame him and pressure him for political reasons .", "CARDINAL . After the questioning ended at TIME , the applicant was not allowed to leave the building .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL to CARDINAL p.m. another face - to - face confrontation was held , this time with another GPE Region resident , GPE According to the record of the questioning ( also submitted by the ORG to the ORG as a separate document enclosed with their observations ) , GPE stated that on DATE he had been in GPE and had seen lots of young people gathering . There were also many police officers . Protesters were throwing stones at the police . Then he saw CARDINAL persons standing near the ORG building and telling protesters to throw stones , not to be afraid , and to capture the IDEA building . Having inquired from the bystanders who those QUANTITY persons were , he was told that they were PERSON and the applicant . Then he saw and heard QUANTITY police officers named PERSON and PERSON tell the applicant and PERSON to calm down , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . According to the record , in reply , the applicant stated that GPE \u2019s statement was a fabrication and that \u201c everything happening in this room \u201d amounted to political sabotage against him and the NORP people . The applicant also noted in the record , in handwriting , that he had not been allowed to leave the building during the period of TIME between the CARDINAL face - to - face confrontations , despite his wish to the contrary .", "CARDINAL . The above face - to - face confrontations were not specifically mentioned in the official charges against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or the prosecution \u2019s subsequent requests for a judicial order on the applicant \u2019s remand in custody or an extension of the detention period , and the names of ORG and GPE were not otherwise mentioned in either of the above or in any other official document made available to the ORG by the parties and relating to the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention and the criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . After the second confrontation , the applicant was again denied permission to leave . At TIME , following the arrival of his defence lawyer , the applicant was charged with criminal offences under ORG CARDINAL ( organising or actively participating in actions causing a breach of public order ) and CARDINAL ( resistance to or violence against public officials , posing a threat to their life or health ) of LAW . The specific acts attributed to the applicant were described as follows :", "\u201c Beginning at TIME on DATE , PERSON ,", "having taken advantage of the fact that from TIME on DATE a group of persons in the town of ORG had engaged in acts of malicious hooliganism causing a serious breach of public order , had deliberately burned , in a publicly dangerous manner , property belonging to various persons [ including ] ORG , CARDINAL cars , CARDINAL mopeds and scooters , and an auxiliary building located in the yard of a private residential house , and had committed acts of violence against Government officials ,", "having , in his false way of thinking , considered [ the above events ] as a \u2018 ORG ,", "aiming to make the above acts develop and acquire a continuous character in order to create artificial tension and to violate the social and political stability in the country ,", "being a resident of GPE , arrived in GPE and , together with Tofiq PERSON Yaqublu and with the active participation of others , [ committed the following : ]", "organised , as an active participant , acts causing a serious breach of public order , by means of openly and repeatedly inciting town residents [ ORG ] , [ M.A. ] and others , who had gathered at the square near the administrative building of ORG located on the Nariman FAC opposite to the administrative building of [ the IDEA ] , [ to do the following : ]", "[ i ] to enter in masses into the area in front of the building of [ the IDEA ] , which is the competent body of the executive power of GPE , and by doing so to create difficulties for the movement of traffic and pedestrians , [ ii ] to disobey the lawful demands to disperse , made by Government officials wanting to stop their illegal behaviour , [ iii ] to resist uniformed police officers protecting the public order , by way of committing violent acts posing danger to [ police ORG ] life and health , using various objects , [ iv ] to disrupt the normal functioning of [ the IDEA ] , ORG enterprises , bodies and organisations , as well as public - catering , commercial and public - service facilities , by way of refusing to leave , for DATE , the areas where the acts seriously breaching the public order were being committed , and [ v ] to stop the movement of traffic , by way of blocking the central avenue and GPE , and", "was finally able to achieve that , at TIME in the town of GPE , a group of persons consisting of [ ORG ] , [ GPE ] and others had marched in masses from the mentioned square in the direction of the administrative building of [ the IDEA ] and had thrown stones at officers of the relevant bodies of ORG who were preventing [ this march ] in accordance with the requirements of the law .", "By these actions , PERSON committed the criminal offences under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . From TIME , the applicant was questioned again , this time as an accused . During the interview he gave essentially the same statement as during the interview of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was taken to ORG . The Deputy Prosecutor General lodged an application with ORG asking it to order the applicant \u2019s remand in custody . The application was essentially a copy of the text of the decision to charge the applicant with the criminal offences ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It was followed by a note stating that it was necessary to remand the applicant in custody because of the gravity and publicly dangerous character of the offences committed , because they carried a sanction of over CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , and because there were \u201c sufficient reasons \u201d to believe that , if released , the applicant would abscond or obstruct the investigation by unlawfully influencing persons participating in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court hearing commenced at TIME in the presence of the applicant , his lawyers , a member of the investigation team , and CARDINAL of the prosecutors working in ORG of ORG . According to the applicant , and not disputed by the Government , the prosecution did not submit the case file or the records of the applicant \u2019s questioning to the court .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , the applicant and his lawyers submitted that the accusation against the applicant was groundless and was not supported by any evidence . As for the applicant \u2019s conduct , they pointed out that he had voluntarily appeared before the prosecution as soon as requested to do so and that , therefore , there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond or interfere with the investigation . They argued that , for those reasons , his detention was not justified .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s remand in custody for DATE ( until DATE ) . The part of the decision containing the court \u2019s reasoning read as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the [ prosecution \u2019s ] application and enclosed documents and having heard the oral submissions of the parties , and taking into account the existence of sufficient grounds to believe that , if released , the accused PERSON would abscond from the investigation or disrupt the normal course of the investigation by unlawfully influencing persons involved in the proceedings , the publicly dangerous character and gravity of the criminal offence committed , and the fact that he is charged with a criminal offence carrying a sanction of over DATE imprisonment , the court considers that the preventive measure of remanding him in custody must be applied in his respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , claiming that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty during the period from TIME to TIME on DATE . His complaint was rejected on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . He argued that he had been detained in breach of the domestic law and LAW . He complained that , although the introductory part of the detention order stated that the court had reviewed preliminary evidence collected by the prosecution , no evidence or any other information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence had been presented by the prosecution to the first - instance court . The court had issued the order solely on the basis of the decision to charge the applicant with the criminal offences and the prosecution \u2019s request to order his remand in custody , without independently verifying whether there was a reasonable suspicion against him . He further complained that the court had not provided relevant and sufficient reasons to justify his detention by finding that he might abscond from the investigation or attempt to obstruct the proceedings . As for his conduct prior to arrest , he had been cooperative with the authorities and , on CARDINAL occasion , had appeared for questioning after a simple phone call , even without having been formally summoned . Other factors , such as the fact that he had a wife and a small child , a permanent residence and a job in GPE , his personality , social status and professional occupation , his affiliation with ORG programmes , no prior criminal record , and so on , also showed that he was very unlikely to abscond and should have been taken into account by the court . In his appeal , as well as relying on the relevant domestic law , the applicant also relied extensively on ORG case - law and cited a number of its judgments concerning LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG observations on the transcript of that court \u2019s hearing of CARDINAL DATE , to be included in the case file . The observations mainly concerned the prosecutor \u2019s inability and refusal to answer questions posed by the defence during the oral hearing . Those questions concerned the prosecution \u2019s failure to produce any evidence on which its suspicions against the applicant were based or to identify the specific circumstances which had led it to believe that the applicant , if released , would abscond or obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG hearing was scheduled to be held on DATE . The hearing was delayed for TIME , awaiting ORG examination of the applicant \u2019s observations on the transcript of the hearing and the request to include them in the documents related to his pre - trial detention , which had been forwarded to ORG . During the delay , ORG took a decision refusing to incorporate the applicant \u2019s observations into the transcript of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , and not disputed by the ORG , as at the first - instance hearing , the prosecution \u2019s case materials were not made available to the court at the appellate hearing .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG detention order of CARDINAL DATE , finding as follows :", "\u201c Taking into account the personality of PERSON , the publicly dangerous character and gravity of the criminal offences in question , the fact that [ those offences ] belong to the category of less serious crimes , that [ the applicant ] , if released , could abscond and would disrupt the objectivity of the investigation by unlawfully influencing persons involved in the criminal proceedings , the court considers that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ordering the applicant \u2019s remand in custody is lawful and justified and must be upheld . ...", "In ORG v. the GPE [ ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . FAC ] , ORG noted that the right to a fair trial required that a court should give reasons for its decisions . This does not mean , however , that a detailed answer should be given to every argument raised by the parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having provided the above reasoning , ORG did not address any of the specific arguments raised by the applicant against the necessity of detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG to change the preventive measure of remand in custody to house arrest . He argued that his previous conduct had showed that he did not intend to avoid the investigation . Furthermore , his personal circumstances ( his family situation , the fact that he had a permanent job and a permanent place of residence , his active political career in GPE , and so on ) made it very unlikely that he would abscond . Lastly , in his case , \u201c persons involved in the criminal proceedings \u201d lived in GPE , and not in GPE where he resided . Therefore , it was unlikely that he would unlawfully influence them .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the prosecution submitted that the request was \u201c groundless \u201d and reiterated that there was a risk that if the applicant were not detained , he would abscond or disrupt the investigation . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . The reasoning provided by the court was as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the counsel \u2019s request , having heard the persons participating in the hearing , and having examined the case material , the court considers that the request can not be granted because the grounds for detaining the accused person have not ceased to exist . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision . On DATE his appeal was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the prosecution requested an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention ( originally authorised until DATE ) , noting that , despite the fact that a number of investigative measures had been taken , the case was complex and more time was needed to complete the investigation . According to the applicant , and undisputed by the ORG , apart from that request , the prosecution did not submit to the court any other material relating to the criminal case . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE concerning the extension request , the prosecution gave no answer to the defence \u2019s questions as to what specific evidence served as grounds for suspecting the applicant of having committed a criminal offence , what specific investigative measures had been taken so far and what further measures needed to be taken . Following the hearing , the applicant \u2019s lawyer formally requested that the judge include the above questions and the ( lack of ) answers in the transcript of the hearing , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention by DATE ( until DATE ) , providing the following reasoning :", "\u201c Taking into account the fact that the accused is charged with offences belonging to the category of less serious crimes , the complexity of the criminal proceedings , the need for more time to complete the investigation , and the necessity to carry out a number of investigative measures , the court considers that [ the prosecution \u2019s ] request must be granted and the period of the accused \u2019s detention extended ... to DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating in detail all the arguments against his detention that he had previously raised before the courts . He also argued that it was not permissible , under the domestic law and the Convention , to justify prolonging his pre - trial detention on the ground that the prosecution needed more time to do its job . Again , he cited a number of relevant judgments of ORG concerning various issues relating to pretrial detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding the extension decision of CARDINAL DATE and providing the same reasoning as the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for bail , reiterating his previous arguments against his detention . On DATE ORG rejected his request , finding that the grounds justifying his detention , as specified in its decision of DATE , \u201c had not ceased to exist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating in detail his arguments for release . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE .", "DATE .

In essence , the charge under LAW , which carried a much heavier sentence ( DATE imprisonment ) , replaced the previous charge under LAW . No changes were made in the original description of the accusations against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the effects of the new charge under LAW was that the applicant could no longer apply for bail , because the law did not permit individuals accused of deliberately committing \u201c serious criminal offences \u201d to be released on bail ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY below ) . Moreover , as a person charged with a \u201c serious criminal offence \u201d , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention could now be extended for a longer overall period ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .
