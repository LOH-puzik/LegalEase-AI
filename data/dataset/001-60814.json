Until recently , his presentation during our meetings gave no cause for concern . However , he now reports that he had been less than honest about the changes in his functioning as he feared a recall to prison , particularly given his initial stability and progress . In addition to his now admitted drug use , it would appear that [ the applicant \u2019s ] anxieties about his future are limited to : ( a ) his previous unsafe sexual practices and the possible consequences of this on his health ; ( b ) his wish to have a long - term and supportive monogamous relationship ; ( c ) his growing sense of loneliness and isolation despite a wide social network ... and ( d ) a sense of stagnation about the course of his life , particularly in finding alternative employment to date , despite extensive efforts . These issues , alongside [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour over DATE , clearly indicate that he is vulnerable and that close monitoring of his situation at this time is crucial . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The area of risk to the public stems from his relationship with a minor . \u201d", "She noted that there had been an openness about long - standing problems and some degree of insight coming out of the crisis of DATE that suggested that the applicant could work on them .

In spite of the considerable attempts by ORG to enforce [ the applicant \u2019s ] licence , his behaviour in DATE demonstrates that he is at risk not just to himself but to other members of the community . Irrespective of whether [ the applicant ] is convicted of an offence , he has admitted extensive illegal drug abuse and the concerns about his sexual involvement with a minor were sufficient to merit a case conference . Furthermore , the incidents of self harm indicate the need for thorough psychiatric assessment . It is in the interests of public safety and [ the applicant \u2019s ] longer term well being that the recall be confirmed . A full assessment of the factors underlying the breakdown of the licence needs to be made , together with plans to tackle what appears to be deep rooted problems of drug abuse and social isolation .", "The ORG noted that [ the applicant ] has shown a willingness to co - operate with Probation and has demonstrated an ability to comply with the terms of his licence .

Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law , in contrast to discretionary life sentences which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences ( e.g. manslaughter , rape or robbery ) .

Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate in order that \u201c the prisoner \u2019s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large \u201d ( R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . Rep. CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The notion of detention during Her Majesty \u2019s Pleasure had its origins in an Act of DATE for \u201c the safe custody of insane persons charged with offence \u201d . Section CARDINAL provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder , treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in \u201c strict custody until His Majesty \u2019s pleasure \u201d and described their custody as being \u201c during His [ Majesty \u2019s ] pleasure \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In the case of ex parte PERSON on DATE , PERSON in ORG held as follows in respect of detention during Her ORG Pleasure :", "\u201c At the time of sentencing , the detention orders under LAW were mandatory . It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder . But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive ( retribution and deterrence ) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied . The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period : see NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex . p. Doody & others [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL and GPE v. GPE ( DATE ) . The order for detention under section DATE is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate : it provides for detention \u2018 during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure\u2019 . ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which expressly authorised the Secretary of ORG to discharge the detainee on licence \u2018 at any time\u2019 was repealed by ORG provisions of LAW DATE , but this does not , in my judgment , alter the nature of the sentence in any material respect . ) I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that , notwithstanding ORG practice , the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether ORG rather than ORG governs his case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court accordingly held that the applicant in that case , who was detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure , should be afforded the same opportunity , as would be given a discretionary life prisoner , to see the material before ORG when it decided upon whether he should be released after his recall to prison on revocation of his licence .", "CARDINAL . Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment , custody for life and those detained during Her ORG have a \u201c tariff \u201d set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence .

Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change in DATE , in particular , following the coming into force on DATE of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under the relevant provisions of LAW DATE , the regime applying to the release of discretionary and mandatory life prisoners was the same . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act provided inter alia that :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG may , if recommended to do so by ORG , release on licence a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life or custody for life or a person detained under LAW DATE ( young offenders convicted of grave crimes ) , but shall not do so in the case of a person sentenced to imprisonment for life or custody for life or to detention during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure or for life except after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of GPE and the trial judge if available . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

DATE ; PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I , at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
