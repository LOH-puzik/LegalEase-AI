GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant started working as a shop assistant in DATE . From DATE until her dismissal on DATE she was employed as a shop assistant and cashier in a supermarket in GPE . She has been unemployed since then .", "The applicant 's employer noted in DATE that there were irregularities concerning the accounts in the drinks department of that supermarket , in that the sum of the till receipts for empty deposit bottles which had been printed out exceeded the total value of empty deposit bottles received by the supermarket . It suspected the applicant and another employee of having manipulated the accounts .", "DATE and DATE the applicant 's employer , with the help of a detective agency , carried out covert video surveillance of the supermarket 's drinks department . The camera covered the area behind the cash desk including the till , the cashier and the area immediately surrounding the cash desk . The detective agency made a video and examined the data obtained . It drew up a written report and produced several photos from the recording , which it sent to the applicant 's employer together with CARDINAL copies of the video ( CARDINAL concerning the applicant and CARDINAL concerning the other employee monitored ) .", "On DATE the applicant 's employer dismissed the applicant without notice for theft . The applicant was accused of having manipulated the accounts in the drinks department of the supermarket and of having taken money ( CARDINAL euros during the period in which she had been filmed ) from the tills for herself which she had hidden in her clothes .", "On DATE the applicant , who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings , brought an action in ORG against her employer , requesting that the court find her dismissal invalid . She further claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage she had suffered as a result of the covert video surveillance and requested to be given the videotapes , including all copies made thereof . She was granted legal aid for these proceedings .", "The applicant contested having manipulated the tills or having stolen money and submitted that she had only put tips she had received from customers into her pockets . In accordance with the supermarket 's practice , she had later put these tips into a separate till where all tips received by supermarket staff were collected . She further objected to the use of the covert video surveillance , arguing that this surveillance had breached her right to protection of her privacy .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's action , having held a hearing in which it heard as witnesses the CARDINAL staff members of the defendant party involved in the applicant 's video surveillance and dismissal and having watched the video tapes submitted by the defendant party .", "ORG found that the defendant party had been entitled to dismiss the applicant without notice . It considered that the defendant party had been authorised to observe the applicant by means of covert video surveillance and to use the recording obtained thereby . The losses discovered in the drinks department during stocktaking and the irregularities between the amount of money paid out for returned empty deposit bottles and the value of the full bottles sold in the market during the applicant 's working time had constituted sufficient grounds for the defendant party to order her surveillance . The defendant party 's property rights had been seriously interfered with .", "In such circumstances , the video observation of an employee was lawful , as had been confirmed by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( file no . CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL , see ' Relevant domestic law and practice ' below ) . In case of the covert video surveillance of an employee on suspicion of theft , the employer 's fundamental right to respect for his property rights had to be weighed against the employee 's fundamental right to privacy vis - \u00e0 - vis third persons , including his employer or his colleagues . Special circumstances were necessary to justify an interference with the employee 's right to privacy , which had to be proportionate .", "Weighing these competing interests in the present case , ORG found that the defendant party had been entitled to put the applicant under covert video surveillance . Having regard to the organisation of work in the drinks department of the supermarket , there were no other means to protect the defendant party 's property rights . The surveillance had not been random , but carried out following suspicions of theft against CARDINAL employees . The video records obtained had been used by the management staff of the defendant party and had been submitted to the court in order to justify the applicant 's dismissal without notice . There was no risk of the records being used in a different manner . Therefore , the applicant neither had a right to non - pecuniary damage nor to be given the video tapes .", "ORG , having regard to the evidence before it including the information obtained by examining the video tapes in question , found that the defendant party had had sufficient grounds to conclude that the applicant had repeatedly committed offences against its property during the relevant period . The applicant had not proven that the money she had undeniably taken from the till had been tips . In any event , it had not been necessary to hear the witnesses named by the applicant to prove that the money concerned had been tips because such tips were , in any event , also the property of the defendant party according to the work regulations in place .", "On DATE the GPE ORG , which had granted the applicant legal aid , dismissed the applicant 's appeal and refused to grant her leave to appeal on points of law .", "ORG , referring to the case - law of ORG ( judgment of DATE , file no . CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL , see ' Relevant domestic law and practice ' below ) , endorsed ORG finding that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance of the cash desk area of the drinks department . Her dismissal without notice had been justified as , following the examination of the videotapes in the proceedings , the applicant had stopped contesting that she had taken money from the till on several occasions .", "The covert video surveillance of the applicant had complied with section CARDINAL of ORG ( Bundesdatenschutzgesetz , see ' Relevant domestic law and practice ' below ) , which transferred Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EG into domestic law . The workplace of a cashier behind the cash desk was not an area in the supermarket accessible to the public . Therefore , video surveillance thereof did not have to be made visible under section CARDINAL LAW . In any event , a cashier whose surveillance had been justified could not rely on the fact that the video surveillance had also covered customers who were standing at the cash desk and in respect of whom the covert video surveillance had not been permitted .", "ORG further considered that it had not been necessary to take further evidence in the proceedings , in particular to play the videotapes , after the applicant had stopped contesting having taken money from the till and having put it in her pockets on several occasions . As this fact alone justified the applicant 's dismissal without notice , the use of the impugned videotapes as evidence in the proceedings had not been necessary . Even assuming that the defendant party had illegally obtained knowledge of the fact that the applicant had taken money from the till and even if this evidence were excluded , the defendant party had not been prevented from alleging this issue and the applicant had been obliged to reply truthfully .", "Moreover , it had not been necessary to take further evidence in order to verify whether the applicant had taken only tips from the till which she had later put into another till designated for tips . An employer could not be expected to further employ a cashier who put money from the till into her pockets without keeping any records on where the money was to be found . The witnesses named by the applicant to prove that there had been a separate till for tips and that the applicant had put money into that till would not be sufficient to prove that all the money taken from the till in the drinks department had been tips and had been put into the till designated for tips .", "ORG finally found that , at least at that stage of the proceedings , the applicant could not ask for the videotapes to be erased . The defendant party had a right to keep the videotapes at least until a final decision was given in the court proceedings brought by the applicant and until the admissibility and necessity of the tapes as evidence was no longer at issue ( compare section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint about the refusal of ORG to grant her leave to appeal . It further dismissed the applicant 's request for legal aid as her complaint had not had reasonable prospects of success .", "ORG found , in particular , that ORG had not diverged from ORG case - law . In any event , ORG had left open whether the video surveillance of the applicant had been lawful and whether the evidence obtained thereby should have been used in the proceedings before the labour courts . It had instead based its judgment on facts uncontested between the parties . As it had considered the applicant 's dismissal lawful , it had also considered her claim for damages ill - founded . The lawfulness of the video surveillance had therefore been irrelevant to the outcome of the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . She argued , in particular , that her right to privacy ( allgemeines ORG ) had been breached by the unlawful covert video surveillance , by the processing of the data obtained thereby and by their use in the proceedings before the labour courts , which had refused to order the destruction of the video recording . Moreover , she submitted that her right to a fair trial and to be heard had been violated in that the labour courts had failed to take relevant evidence . She further submitted that ORG refusal to grant her legal aid had breached her right of equal access to court .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint and dismissed the applicant 's request to be granted legal aid ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the applicant 's complaint had no prospects of success as there was nothing to indicate that her fundamental rights had been violated by the decisions of the labour courts .", "Provisions aimed at protecting individuals against infringements of their right to privacy as a result of the way in which their personal data are handled are contained in ORG . Changes to that LAW entered into force in DATE in order to implement Directive CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG contains rules on the monitoring of publicly accessible areas with optic - electronic devices . Such video surveillance is lawful only in so far as it is necessary , in particular , to pursue legitimate aims for specifically defined purposes and if there are no indications of overriding the legitimate interests of the data subject PERSON ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ) . Suitable measures shall be taken to make it visible that the area is being monitored and to identify the controller ( section CARDINAL LAW ) . The data shall be erased as soon as they are no longer needed to achieve the purpose or if further storage would conflict with the legitimate interests of the data subject ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE a new section CARDINAL of ORG entered into force . It codifies ( see judgment of ORG of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) the previously developed case - law of ORG on video surveillance at the workplace ( see below ) . Under paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , an employee 's personal data may be collected , processed or used for employment - related purposes where necessary for decisions regarding hiring or , after hiring , for carrying out or terminating the employment contract . Employees ' personal data may be collected , processed or used to investigate criminal offences only under the following circumstances : if there is a documented , factual reason to believe that the data subject has committed a criminal offence in the course of his work ; if the collection , processing or use of such data is necessary to investigate the criminal offence ; if the employee does not have an overriding legitimate interest in ruling out the possibility of the collection , processing or use of such data , and , in particular , if the type and extent are not disproportionate to the aim pursued .", "On DATE ORG rendered a leading judgment on the lawfulness of covert video surveillance in the workplace ( file no . CARDINAL AZR CARDINAL ) .", "ORG , upholding the judgment rendered by ORG on DATE ( file no . CARDINAL Sa CARDINAL b/CARDINAL ) , found that the covert video surveillance of an employee by his employer interfered with the employee 's fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed by LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , which also had to be respected in the relationship between private persons , including employment relations . This right had to be weighed against the employer 's interest in securing evidence for his claim , having regard to the necessity of an effective judicial system required by the rule of law .", "However , such an interference with the employee 's right to privacy was justified and did not entail an exclusion of the evidence obtained thereby in subsequent court proceedings if there was a substantiated suspicion that the employee had committed an offence or was guilty of other serious misconduct towards his employer , if less intrusive means to examine the suspicion had been exhausted , if the video surveillance was , in practice , the only means which remained to verify the suspicion and if it was not as a whole disproportionate .", "ORG confirmed this judgment in several subsequent decisions ( see the decision of ORG of DATE , ORG file no . QUANTITY ; decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; and decision of CARDINAL DATE , file no . CARDINAL ABR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
