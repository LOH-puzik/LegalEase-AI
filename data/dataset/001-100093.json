By a letter dated DATE the NORP Ombudsman referred the applicants ' complaints to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the NORP Ombudsman \u201d ) . The latter conducted an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the applicants ' deportation . To that end , she requested ORG to forward written statements from the applicants ; she also considered , inter alia , the submissions and documents sent by the immigration and police authorities ( including the documents referred to in DATE and CARDINAL above ) and files from ORG , and met the applicants ' lawyer .", "In her report of CARDINAL DATE the NORP Ombudsman came to the following conclusions :", "( i ) There were no legal grounds for the issuing of the deportation orders against the applicants . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(k ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON , an immigrant was considered a \u201c prohibited immigrant \u201d if he entered or resided in the LOC contrary to the above statute and the relevant Regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . From the evidence before her it emerged that the applicants had never entered or resided in GPE illegally and that there had never been any report of a violation of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON or the LAW . The applicants had been residing on a ship flying the NORP flag and moored in FAC , which suggested that for legal purposes they had been residing on NORP territory . According to LAW ( b ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ship crew members who remained in a port of the Republic were not considered as residing in the Republic . The fact that the applicants had been coming ashore on a DATE basis after being granted a landing permit did not affect this . Given that for a deportation order to be issued , an alien had to be physically present in the country , the question that had to be asked was what were the true reasons behind the issue of the deportation orders against the applicants , bearing in mind that what had actually been sought was the departure of the applicants from the NORP ship , not from GPE .", "( ii ) Neither the captain 's letter to the authorities nor the relevant police reports contained evidence to substantiate the allegations of disobedience on the part of the applicants vis - \u00e0 - vis the local port authorities , the police or the law . The captain 's letter described the crew 's behaviour in a very general and broad manner . Although the possibility that the crew had committed disciplinary offences could not be excluded , there had been no mention of their having committed specific criminal offences which , under NORP law , would justify the involvement of the local authorities . Furthermore , in its decision of DATE , ORG had not ordered the applicants ' deportation but had merely required the food supplies to be stopped to all but CARDINAL of the crew members , practical travel arrangements to be made for the applicants ' repatriation and the relevant sums to be paid . ORG decision indicated that it had not excluded the possibility that the crew might not accept repatriation and had therefore ordered that their upkeep was to be terminated after DATE .", "( iii ) The manner in which the deportation orders had been executed had violated the applicants ' rights to access to information , to be heard and to seek court or out - of - court protection ( see , in particular section PERSON ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON , and the Convention \u2013 paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The letters of DATE concerning the deportation orders had not been served on the applicants and they had therefore been unaware until DATE that their deportation was pending . The applicants had never been informed in writing of the decision of CARDINAL DATE to deport them , in breach of section PERSON ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON [ and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ] .", "( iv ) Knowing that they had no right to board the vessel , the police had assembled the applicants at the immigration police office under the false pretence that photographs would be taken to enable their landing permits to be renewed . This had amounted to deception , given that from the moment the applicants were assembled they had been arrested and treated in a degrading manner as if they were common criminals . ORG had no doubt that the applicants had not been allowed to contact their lawyer , their ORG or any other person , despite their requests , and that it had been for this reason that their mobile phones had been taken away from them . She observed that it appeared that they had been immediately transferred to the airport in degrading conditions DATE especially for the men \u2013 having being handcuffed and placed in a vehicle with bars on the windows , in order to be returned to their own country , with only the clothes they were wearing .", "( v ) The police had admitted using violence against the first applicant but had claimed that this had been justified , as he had reacted violently to his arrest , injuring CARDINAL police officers . However , in view of the first applicant 's absence abroad and the lack of a medical report concerning any injuries , ORG stated that she had been unable to reach any objective or safe conclusion on whether the violence used against him had been necessary . In any event , she observed that what had taken place was wrong and that the decision to issue deportation orders which had no legal foundation had violated the applicants ' fundamental rights to prior information , to be heard , to be treated with dignity , to be given time to collect their personal belongings , and to be deported to their native country or to a country of their choice ( in the case of the tenth applicant only ) . It was for this reason that the applicants had reacted by resisting arrest and this had inevitably led to the use of violence by the police in order to arrest and deport them .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG expressed reservations as to whether the applicants had been allowed to take their personal belongings and other documents from the ship prior to their deportation as the police had claimed . The fact that the applicants ' arrest had taken place TIME before the departure of the flight on which they were put led her to conclude that , with the exception of the fourth applicant , PERSON , who had been permitted to take certain things for her child and personal documents , none of the members of the crew had been allowed to take any of their personal belongings with them .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG ( PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended ) , ORG decided to refer the applicants ' case to the Attorney - General , whom she requested to examine the possibility of taking legal action . She indicated in this connection that she had no power to grant compensation for any damage incurred as a result of maladministration , as this came solely within the jurisdiction of the courts .", "CARDINAL . Amongst other documents , copies of CARDINAL written statements given by the first , second and fourth applicants on DATE , the third and ninth applicants on DATE and the sixth and eighth applicants on DATE were attached to her report .", "In her statement the fourth applicant claimed that she had been taken to the ship by the authorities to collect her marriage certificate .

She was only allowed to take milk for the baby .
