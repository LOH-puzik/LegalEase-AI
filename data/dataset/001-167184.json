The judge , therefore , allowed the jury to separate for TIME , giving them instructions not to consider any news source , whether on the internet , on television or in the newspapers .", "CARDINAL .

He rejected the defence \u2019s application to discharge the jury , concluding that he was satisfied that no juror had communicated the jury \u2019s deliberations either deliberately or accidentally to anyone else , and therefore questions of bias did not arise . The judge observed that the jury \u2019s notes indicated that they were adopting a \u201c perfectly reasonable , logical and unbiased approach to the evidence . \u201d He did not believe that a message could have been communicated by a juror to the outside during deliberations .

At this time , the judge was also informed of additional posts on a ORG group called \u201c Infidels of GPE \u201d that included threatening comments toward the jury if they were to acquit . The judge determined that there was no evidence that the jurors had seen these posts or had felt intimidated by them .", "CARDINAL .

Facebook and ORG did not co - operate by disclosing the data relating to the accounts used , and the ORG concluded that , even if the data were disclosed , it would be unlikely to shed light on the source of the information posted on the internet .", "CARDINAL . The ORG detailed the measures taken to ensure the security of jury deliberations , including the seclusion of the jury in the jury suite at court . All toilet and refreshment facilities were in the suite . Meals were provided from the canteen and smoking breaks were escorted . The jury room was kept locked . The jury had been asked to hand over all mobile phones , laptops and electronic devices , which were locked in a safe and returned to them at the end of each day . They were not searched . As part of general security measures during the trial , the jury had been picked up and dropped by a coach at a designated meeting point some distance from the court . During the journey to and from court the jurors were accompanied by an usher . The ORG took statements from the court clerk and usher . Both stated that they did not see or hear anything suspicious during the trial . The usher added that the jury had been really professional and a pleasure to look after .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded :", "\u201c It would appear , therefore , that the only opportunity for a member of the jury to have communicated with a third party during their deliberations would have been if they had wilfully retained a mobile phone or communications device , despite having been asked to hand in all such items . Even in those circumstances ... and although access to private toilet facilities was apparently provided from the jury room , it would seem unlikely that a juror could have conducted such a clandestine operation without being noticed by fellow jurors . Nothing has emerged from the enquiries which have been conducted pursuant to the ORG \u2019s directions which suggest to the ORG that any member of the jury or security staff engaged in any inappropriate activity as regards the disclosure of the jury \u2019s verdicts or otherwise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At a directions hearing on DATE ORG refused to order any further investigation , for example by interviewing individual jurors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG , Mr Justice PERSON , refused the applicant and his co - defendants leave to appeal . He found that the trial judge had not erred in refusing to discharge the jury . As regards the alleged bias on the part of the jury , PERSON found that , as a result of the ORG \u2019s investigation , no misconduct had been uncovered . There was , for instance , no indication that a \u201c rogue \u201d juror had been in communication with a far - right organisation .", "CARDINAL . Regard had to be given to the manner in which the jury had deliberated , he observed :", "\u201c It is important that although , in the first batch of verdicts on DATE , there were indeed verdicts of guilty against CARDINAL of the CARDINAL defendants , there was a unanimous verdict of not guilty against PERSON ( on count CARDINAL , rape ) . It follows ( on the hypothesis of a juror in communication with a far - right organisation ) that the supposed \u2018 rogue\u2019 juror had subscribed to an acquittal . The jury had reached no verdicts on count CARDINAL or count CARDINAL ( the conspiracy counts ) . This suggests that they were following the judge \u2019s advice to work through the substantive counts before considering the conspiracy counts .", "When on DATE May ( a bank holiday intervened ) the next batch of unanimous verdicts where returned , they included a verdict of not guilty against [ GPE ] on count CARDINALB. Again the supposed \u2018 rogue\u2019 had subscribed to an acquittal . Following a majority direction , further not guilty verdicts were returned : count CARDINAL ( PERSON , rape ) , count CARDINAL ( PERSON , rape ) , counts CARDINAL and DATE ( GPE , rape ) . These may , of course , have been by a majority . [ ]", "Accordingly , it is clear that the jury were considered the case carefully and analytically . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Of the defendants , only the applicant renewed his application for leave to appeal before the full court . On DATE , following a hearing , ORG refused permission to appeal : [ CARDINAL ] PERSON CARDINAL . It found :", "\u201c CARDINAL . We have carefully considered the material facts and the results of the ORG \u2019s investigation .", "CARDINAL . We agree with the conclusions of the ORG . In our judgment , it is not possible to draw the inference from the material before us that a juror deliberately communicated information about the jury \u2019s deliberations to someone outside the jury whilst at court . The ORG investigation shows that extensive precautions were taken to protect the integrity of the jury in this trial which made it extremely difficult for jurors to communicate in secret with anyone outside the jury room . It is fanciful to imagine that a juror was covertly signalling from the window or that a juror was able to make clandestine telephone calls on a hidden mobile phone , from the toilet or elsewhere , without being overheard or detected by other jurors or court staff . The court clerk and usher , who had worked with the jury for DATE , found no reason to suspect any juror of impropriety or unusual behaviour .", "CARDINAL . The Judge apparently accepted the ORG \u2019s submission that the information posted on the internet could have derived from discussions amongst those at court trying to guess the state of the jury \u2019s deliberations , perhaps from the sequence of jury notes . In our view , it is improbable that guesswork could have resulted in such an accurate prediction of the jury \u2019s guilty verdicts . We do , however , accept that the information in Mr PERSON \u2019s final tweet at CARDINAL on CARDINALrd May ( \u2018 jury still out on CARDINAL and others will be sentenced next GPE ) , most probably originated from someone connected to the prosecution or defence teams , or the interpreters . The court was sitting in private ; the jury had only just left court after indicating that they had found CARDINAL defendants guilty ; and sentencing dates were not known to the jury and had not been mentioned at any stage in open court .", "CARDINAL . We accept it is possible that \u2018 loose ORG by jurors outside the jury room resulted in information about the jury \u2019s deliberations being disclosed to outsiders . It is quite possible that the jury had decided upon guilty verdicts in respect of CARDINAL defendants by the time they separated on TIME May. Jury deliberations are , of course , confidential , and jurors are routinely warned not to discuss the case outside the jury room , whether with fellow jurors or anyone else , including members of their family .", "CARDINAL . Such conduct , even if inadvertent , would amount to a jury irregularity . However , we do not consider that it would be sufficient to render the convictions unsafe . In our view , taken on its own , disclosure of the jury \u2019s progress on the counts would not have compromised the jury \u2019s independence or impacted on the jury \u2019s ability to remain faithful to their oath or affirmation to \" faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence \" ( see Criminal Practice Direction CARDINALM.CARDINAL ) . The Judge , legal representatives and court staff were unanimous in the view that , throughout the lengthy trial , the jury had participated appropriately in the trial process and appeared to be assessing the evidence conscientiously .", "CARDINAL . The Applicant alleges apparent bias on the part of the jury , because the information was disseminated by far - right organisations hostile to the defendants . We have applied the test set out in Re Medicaments [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , as amended in PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , namely , whether , on an objective appraisal , the material facts give rise to a legitimate fear that the jury might not have been impartial , asking ourselves whether a fair - minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that the jury was biased . A similar test applies under LAW , namely , whether there are sufficient guarantees to exclude any objectively justified or legitimate doubts as to the impartiality of the jury : see PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . There was ample evidence to support the Judge \u2019s view that the jury was adopting a \u2018 perfectly reasonable , logical and unbiased approach to the evidence\u2019 . Judging from the content of the jury notes and the sequence of the verdicts , they progressed through the counts in the order recommended by the Judge , and carefully considered the evidence in relation to each count . The verdicts , taken as a whole , appeared rational and consistent with the evidence . The Judge observed at the end of the trial that the jury had performed their task with \" painstaking care \" .", "CARDINAL . The jurors had all completed questionnaires confirming that they were not associated with the ORG or ORG and there was no evidence to suggest that any juror had withheld information about such an association . The fact that the jury returned unanimous \u2018 not guilty\u2019 verdicts on CARDINAL counts on CARDINALrd May was at odds with the allegation that there was one or more racially biased supporter of a farright organisation on the jury , as such a person would presumably not have been party to any \u2018 not guilty\u2019 verdict .", "CARDINAL . Like the Judge , we have concluded that there was simply no evidential link established between the jury and the far - right organisations which posted the information on the internet . Therefore we do not consider that , on the material facts , a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that the jury was biased , nor that there were any objectively justified or legitimate doubts about the impartiality of the jury .", "CARDINAL . No criticism can be made of the careful and fair manner in which the Judge conducted the necessary enquiries . He was not permitted to ask the jury about the content of its deliberations ; only to investigate any irregularity . We agree with his conclusion that it was not necessary to discharge the jury and we consider that he gave appropriate directions to the jury throughout the trial regarding their conduct .", "CARDINAL . We do not accept [ Counsel for the applicant \u2019s ] criticism of the ORG \u2019s investigations as inadequate . In our view , there was nothing more that the ORG could reasonably have done .", "CARDINAL .

They know that it is integral to their responsibility . It is , when all is said and done , their birthright ; it is shared by each CARDINAL of them with the defendant . They guard it faithfully . The integrity of the jury is an essential feature of our trial process . Juries follow the directions which the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence and to ignore anything they may have heard or read out of court . No doubt in this case [ the judge ] will give appropriate directions , tailor - made to the individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing hearing , after hearing submissions from counsel for the defendants . We can not too strongly emphasise that the jury will follow them , not only because they will loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given by the judge , but also because the directions themselves will appeal directly to their own instinctive and fundamental belief in the need for the trial process to be fair . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
