A report drawn up by the ORG police on DATE stated that in connection with the investigation opened following the applicants\u2019 criminal complaint , police officers had visited the NORP , where they had interviewed PERSON and the director .

CARDINAL . In the alternative , she sought MONEY for non - pecuniary damage if the adoption order was not revoked . Submitting that she had never met the first applicant DATE her adoptive parents DATE either before or after the date on which the adoption order had been made , she stated that she had seen them only once , on DATE , when they had come to try to take her away from the NORP against her will , accompanied by their lawyer and the bailiff .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , to which the case had been referred by ORG , dismissed PERSON \u2019s action as being ill - founded . On the basis of the written evidence submitted by the parties , the court considered that it was in the claimant \u2019s interests for the adoption order not to be revoked . It noted that she had not in any way established , through her guardian , that her adoptive parents had shown a lack of interest in her ; on the contrary , it appeared from the evidence that they had taken numerous steps for her to be able to join them in GPE . The court accordingly rejected the statements by PERSON and FAC , who had given evidence in support of the child in their respective capacities as her \u201c substitute \u201d \u201c mother \u201d and \u201c aunt \u201d at the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the adoption order had satisfied the relevant statutory requirements and pointed out that ORG , which , under section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL , had exercised parental rights on the date on which the application for adoption had been lodged with the court , had found the adoption to be in the child \u2019s interests and had given its approval .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was upheld on an appeal by the claimant in a final judgment delivered by ORG on DATE after a public hearing which PERSON had attended , represented by counsel and by her guardian .", "CARDINAL . In an unappealable decision of DATE , ORG dismissed an application by PERSON to set aside its final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , relying on section CARDINAL of Ordinance no .

At the hearing on DATE , PERSON stated in the presence of her guardian that she did not know her adoptive parents and did not wish to move to a different country as she was satisfied with her life at the GPE , where the conditions were good .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the court allowed her application , relying in particular on the statements by her \u201c mothers \u201d and \u201c aunts \u201d at the NORP , who confirmed that she had been residing there since DATE and was being provided with a sound education and good living conditions . Noting that there was no evidence of the emotional ties that should have formed between the adoptive parents and the child after the final decision of DATE , the court revoked the order for LOC \u2019s adoption by the second applicant couple and decided that the child should revert to the name she had used before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although an appeal lay against that judgment , the defendants did not avail themselves of that possibility , and the judgment thus became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the C. association requested ORG to revoke its decision to place the children in the care of the NORP . On DATE the ORG informed it that as a result of the final orders of DATE for the adoption of the children by the applicants , the decision on their placement had been implicitly revoked and that any such request would be superfluous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in reply to a request from the applicants , informed them that it was not empowered to take the necessary steps for the children to be returned to them . It indicated that it had ceased to have any powers in the matter on the date on which the certificate attesting that the adoption order conformed to the relevant national and international rules had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with the ORG committee responsible for examining administrative abuses , on account of the NORP authorities\u2019 failure to execute final decisions .", "CARDINAL .

They regularly sent the girls letters in NORP and presents , encouraging them to write back in NORP as they had learnt the language while waiting to see them again , and telling them that their greatest wish was to have them by their side to give them love and affection .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the observations submitted by the parties that the ORG , where the children are resident , is a private institution licensed by ORG and entrusted with the tasks of providing a home for orphans or abandoned children , taking care of them and giving them an education .", "CARDINAL . Reports by the national authority responsible for monitoring the activities of welfare institutions attest to the following : the material and sanitary conditions at the NORP are good ; medical assistance is provided there in the form of regular check - ups by doctors and permanent supervision by the medical staff ; the centre runs special programmes including educational , sports and recreational activities for the children in its care ; the children attend schools in the area around the centre and are integrated into the ORG education system ; children at the centre demonstrating particular sporting and artistic abilities are encouraged to develop them ; numerous practical activities are arranged ; the centre is structured into groups of CARDINAL children who are closely supervised by employees assigned to act as \u201c substitute parents \u201d ; and the centre employs a full - time psychologist .", "CARDINAL .

A number of articles in the ORG local newspaper PERSON reported that after her visit to the NORP on DATE , Baroness PERSON , rapporteur for ORG , had expressed the view that children in the centre \u2019s care should not travel abroad to join their adoptive families because the ORG had formed a genuine family in which the children received a good upbringing and education . The articles also reported that Mr PERSON , the ORG \u2019s founder , had stated that none of the children would be leaving the centre as they had all become members of his family and that it was time to stop \u201c exporting \u201d NORP children .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the evidence produced by the parties that LOC and GPE regularly go to school , visit their close acquaintances and travel abroad on trips organised by the NORP .

A video recording submitted by the ORG and produced with the assistance of a psychologist at the centre where the children are living indicates that they have not received any detailed practical information about the ongoing proceedings for their adoption or about the identity of their adoptive parents .
