ORG of ORG ( \u201c the CJEU \u201d ) has recognised the non bis in idem principle as a fundamental principle of Community law ( ORG ) and ORG of ORG , Joined Cases C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P , CCARDINAL/CARDINAL P , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P to C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P and CCARDINAL/CARDINAL P , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) :", "\u201c ... the principle of non bis in idem , which is a fundamental principle of Community law also enshrined in LAW No .

Under that principle , therefore , the same person can not be sanctioned more than once for a single unlawful course of conduct designed to protect the same legal asset . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The CJEU \u2019s case - law on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters is based on a different interpretation of \u201c idem \u201d ( PERSON , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the first place , however , the wording of LAW ORG , \u2018 the same acts\u2019 , shows that that provision refers only to the nature of the acts in dispute and not to their legal classification .", "CARDINAL . It must also be noted that the terms used in that Article differ from those used in other international treaties which enshrine the ne bis in idem principle . Unlike LAW of the ORG , LAW use the term \u2018 offence\u2019 , which implies that the criterion of the legal classification of the acts is relevant as a prerequisite for the applicability of the ne bis in idem principle which is enshrined in those treaties .", "...", "CARDINAL . There is a necessary implication in the ne bis in idem principle , enshrined in that Article , that GPE have mutual trust in their criminal justice systems and that each of them recognises the criminal law in force in the other GPE even when the outcome would be different if its own national law were applied ( [ Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] GPE and GPE [ [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL ] , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows that the possibility of divergent legal classifications of the same acts in CARDINAL different Contracting States is no obstacle to the application of LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . For the same reasons , the criterion of the identity of the protected legal interest can not be applicable since that criterion is likely to vary from CARDINAL ORG to another .", "CARDINAL . The above findings are further reinforced by the objective of LAW ORG , which is to ensure that no one is prosecuted for the same acts in several ORG on account of his having exercised his right to freedom of movement ( GPE and GPE , paragraph CARDINAL , and Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL GPE [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As pointed out by ORG in point CARDINAL of his Opinion , that right to freedom of movement is effectively guaranteed only if the perpetrator of an act knows that , once he has been found guilty and served his sentence , or , where applicable , been acquitted by a final judgment in a member ORG , he may travel within the LOC territory without fear of prosecution in another member ORG on the basis that the legal system of that member ORG treats the act concerned as a separate offence .", "CARDINAL . Because there is no harmonisation of national criminal laws , a criterion based on the legal classification of the acts or on the protected legal interest might create as many barriers to freedom of movement within the GPE territory as there are penal systems in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In those circumstances , the only relevant criterion for the application of LAW of the ORG is identity of the material acts , understood in the sense of the existence of a set of concrete circumstances which are inextricably linked together .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... the definitive assessment in that regard belongs ... to the competent national courts which are charged with the task of determining whether the material acts at issue constitute a set of facts which are inextricably linked together in time , in space and by their subject matter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG confirmed and developed this approach in the most recent case concerning the application of the non bis in idem principle ( PERSON , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... it should be noted that the ORG has already held that the only relevant criterion for the application of LAW ORG is identity of the material acts , understood as the existence of a set of concrete circumstances which are inextricably linked together ( see PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL ; Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG and Others [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ; and Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to assess whether such a set of concrete circumstances exists , the competent national courts must determine whether the material acts in the CARDINAL proceedings constitute a set of facts which are inextricably linked together in time , in space and by their subject matter ( see , to that effect , PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL ; ORG and Others , paragraph CARDINAL ; and PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows that the starting - point for assessing the notion of \u2018 same acts\u2019 within the meaning of LAW ORG is to consider the specific unlawful conduct which gave rise to the criminal proceedings before the courts of GPE as a whole . Thus , LAW ORG can become applicable only where the court dealing with the second criminal prosecution finds that the material acts , by being linked in time , in space and by their subject matter , make up an inseparable whole .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , if the material acts do not make up such an inseparable whole , the mere fact that the court before which the second prosecution is brought finds that the alleged perpetrator of those acts acted with the same criminal intention does not suffice to indicate that there is a set of concrete circumstances which are inextricably linked together covered by the notion of \u2018 same acts\u2019 within the meaning of LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . As ORG in particular pointed out , a subjective link between acts which gave rise to criminal proceedings in CARDINAL different ORG does not necessarily mean that there is an objective link between the material acts in question which , consequently , could be distinguished in time and space and by their nature .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... it is for the competent national courts to assess whether the degree of identity and connection between all the factual circumstances that gave rise to those criminal proceedings against the same person in GPE is such that it is possible to find that they are \u2018 the same acts\u2019 within the meaning of LAW ORG .", "...", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , the answer to the first question must therefore be that LAW ORG is to be interpreted as meaning that :", "\u2013 the relevant criterion for the purposes of the application of that Article is identity of the material acts , understood as the existence of a set of facts which are inextricably linked together , irrespective of the legal classification given to them or the legal interest protected ;", "\u2013 different acts consisting , in particular , first , in holding in CARDINAL ORG the proceeds of drug trafficking and , second , in the exchanging at exchange bureaux in another Contracting State of sums of money also originating from such trafficking should not be regarded as \u2018 the same acts\u2019 within the meaning of LAW ORG merely because the competent national court finds that those acts are linked together by the same criminal intention ;", "\u2013 it is for that national court to assess whether the degree of identity and connection between all the facts to be compared is such that it is possible , in the light of the said relevant criterion , to find that they are \u2018 the same acts\u2019 within the meaning of LAW of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c An accused person acquitted by a non - appealable judgment shall not be subjected to a new trial for the same cause . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG gave the following interpretation of that provision ( PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series C No . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c This principle is intended to protect the rights of individuals who have been tried for specific facts from being subjected to a new trial for the same cause . Unlike the formula used by other international human rights protection instruments ( for example , ORG , LAW ) , which refers to the same \u2018 crime\u2019 ) , LAW uses the expression \u2018 the same cause\u2019 , which is a much broader term in the victim \u2019s favour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE the double - jeopardy rule arises out of LAW to the LAW , the relevant clause of which reads :", "\u201c ... nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG , CARDINAL U.S. CARDINAL ( DATE ) , in which the defendant had sold drugs not in the original package and without a written order of the purchaser , and where the sale had been characterised as CARDINAL statutory offences , ORG adopted the following interpretation :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL of LAW creates the offense of selling any of the forbidden drugs except in or from the original stamped package ; and LAW creates the offense of selling any of such drugs not in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom the drug is sold . Thus , upon the face of the statute , CARDINAL distinct offenses are created . Here there was but CARDINAL sale , and the question is whether , both sections being violated by the same act , the accused committed CARDINAL offenses or CARDINAL .", "...", "Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element . The applicable rule is that , where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of CARDINAL distinct statutory provisions , the test to be applied to determine whether there are CARDINAL offenses or CARDINAL is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not ... [ T]his court quoted from and adopted the language of ORG in GPE , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL : \u2018 A single act may be an offense against CARDINAL statutes ; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not , an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , which concerned \u201c vehicular homicide \u201d by the defendant Mr PERSON , ORG developed a different approach :", "\u201c ... [ A ] technical comparison of the elements of the CARDINAL offenses as required by Blockburger does not protect defendants sufficiently from the burdens of multiple trials . This case similarly demonstrates the limitations of the Blockburger analysis . If PERSON constituted the entire double - jeopardy inquiry in the context of successive prosecutions , the ORG could try PERSON in CARDINAL consecutive trials : for failure to keep right of the median , for driving while intoxicated , for assault , and for homicide . The ORG could improve its presentation of proof with each trial , assessing which witnesses gave the most persuasive testimony , which documents had the greatest impact , which opening and closing arguments most persuaded the jurors . PERSON would be forced either to contest each of these trials or to plead guilty to avoid the harassment and expense .", "Thus , a subsequent prosecution must do more than merely survive the PERSON test . As we suggested in PERSON , the double - jeopardy clause bars any subsequent prosecution in which the government , to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution , will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted . ... The critical inquiry is what conduct the ORG will prove , not the evidence the ORG will use to prove that conduct ... [ A ] ORG can not avoid the dictates of the double - jeopardy clause merely by altering in successive prosecutions the evidence offered to prove the same conduct ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , in the case of GPE v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) , ORG returned to the PERSON test :", "\u201c The double - jeopardy clause \u2019s protection attaches in non - summary criminal contempt prosecutions just as it does in other criminal prosecutions . In the contexts of both multiple punishments and successive prosecution , the double - jeopardy bar applies if the CARDINAL offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried can not survive the \u2018 same elements\u2019 or \u2018 Blockburger\u2019 test . ... That test inquires whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other ; if not , they are the \u2018 same offense\u2019 within the clause \u2019s meaning , and double jeopardy bars subsequent punishment or prosecution . ...", "Although prosecution [ in the present case ] would undoubtedly be barred by the PERSON \u2018 same - conduct\u2019 test , PERSON must be overruled because it contradicted an unbroken line of decisions ... and has produced confusion . ... Moreover , the PERSON rule has already proved unstable in application , see GPE v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE ...
