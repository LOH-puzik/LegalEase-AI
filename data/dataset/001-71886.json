{"ITEMID": "001-71886", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "OTTO v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in GPE ( GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is a member of the political party \u201c the NORP \u201d ( ORG PERSON , in the following PERSON ) . The party is considered as populist and right - wing and has therefore been under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of the constitution ( PERSON ) in various GPE ( L\u00e4nder ) . In the general elections in DATE , PERSON achieved PERCENT of the votes . The party has not been declared unconstitutional by ORG in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The applicant stood for the party as a candidate in local elections in DATE and as a substitute candidate in regional elections in the State ( Land ) GPE in DATE . Moreover , he contributed to activities of the party \u2019s county association on a regular basis .", "The applicant had been employed as a civil servant with the ORG police since DATE . He was promoted several times , lastly in DATE to the position of detective superintendent ( PERSON ) . He retired in DATE .", "Although the applicant received above - average appraisals at work , he was not considered for a further promotion to chief inspector ( GPE ) despite the fact that there were such openings as from DATE . Following his inquiry about the reasons for not having been promoted , ORG informed the applicant in a letter dated DATE that promotions were generally based on suitability , capabilities and professional qualifications . Regarding his suitability , ORG expressed severe doubts due to his active membership of ORG , a party which was suspected to pursue anti - constitutional goals . Therefore , his promotion process had been stayed until further instructions by GPE of the interior would be received regarding the matter .", "The applicant subsequently instituted proceedings against the lack of promotion to the position of chief inspector . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim , finding that the decision not to promote the applicant had been lawful . The court noted that public servants were generally not entitled to a promotion which was subject to the employer \u2019s discretion with regard to suitability , capabilities and professional qualifications . The employer enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this respect . That margin had not been overstepped by basing unsuitability for promotion of a public servant on active membership in a political party seeking to undermine the free democratic constitutional system . Having regard to a judgment by GPE of DATE , the court considered Die ORG as a party with unconstitutional goals . Both before and during the proceedings , the applicant had failed to dissociate himself from right - wing fundamentalist utterances of party officials . Moreover , the fact that only ORG could declare a prohibition of a political party with unconstitutional goals ( and had not yet done so with regard to PERSON ) was no obstacle . Whereas the NORP constitution granted every citizen the right to work the free democratic constitutional system as a member of a party which is not prohibited , the duty of loyalty required from public servants ( which is laid down in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) would demand that every public servant defend this order . Lastly , the court found that the judgment of ORG in the case of GPE v. GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) would not require a different ruling . That case concerned the dismissal of a public servant as opposed to non - promotion in the present case . Hence the question of proportionality had to be considered differently .", "On DATE , GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law . The court found that the applicant \u2019s employer had not overstepped his margin of appreciation as the suitability of public servants could lawfully be assessed with regard to their duty of loyalty . Membership in a party which pursued goals which were not in accordance with the free democratic constitutional system was sufficient to cast doubt on whether a public servant was a suitable candidate for promotion . Since the party in question had been scrutinised by various offices for the protection of the constitution in GPE , and this scrutiny had been found lawful by numerous ORG in GPE , the court did not itself have to establish whether or not the activities of PERSON were unconstitutional . With regard to the proportionality of the decision not to promote the applicant , the court found that the judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( above - mentioned ) did not demand a different ruling since the applicant in the present case had already been promoted several times and had not been deprived of his professional and economic basis by the decision not to promote him further .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It held that the administrative courts\u2019 assessment concerning the unconstitutional goals of ORG was in line with the jurisprudence of various ORG in different GPE ( L\u00e4nder ) . The courts had rightly granted the employer a margin of appreciation when assessing the applicant \u2019s suitability for promotion . ORG found that the domestic authorities and courts had lawfully taken into account the applicant \u2019s political activities even though it had not yet itself declared PERSON an unconstitutional party in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "The relevant provisions of LAW are worded as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL .
