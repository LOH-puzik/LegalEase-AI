The first applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE . The second and third applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are daughters of the first applicant and they were born in GPE in DATE and DATE , respectively . These children live with their mother in GPE and they are NORP nationals . The applicants were represented before the ORG by successive firms of solicitors and , latterly , by ORG , a law firm practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant and her husband lived with their son ( born in DATE ) in GPE , GPE . The first applicant is a Yoruba NORP from GPE . After second level education , she attended secretarial courses , before working for DATE in a travel agency and in an international bank . She gave up working in or around DATE as her husband travelled a lot on business . Her husband is a businessman in GPE and was born in LOC . In later proceedings ( her affidavit of CARDINAL DATE , paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the first applicant underlined that they had a comfortable life in GPE : they were financially secure , she was happily married , they had a CARDINAL bedroom villa , the use of CARDINAL cars and they employed a maid . The first applicant has CARDINAL brothers living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants arrived in GPE on DATE and DATE the first applicant applied for asylum on her own behalf and on behalf of her daughters claiming that she could not protect the second and third applicants from female genital mutilation ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) if they were returned to GPE . The first applicant submitted as follows . Her first daughter , PERSON , was born on DATE . On DATE this child was subjected to ORG carried out by an elder in the first applicant \u2019s mother - in - law \u2019s house . Neither the first applicant nor her husband had agreed to this procedure but they ultimately succumbed to it in view of alleged pressure from the latter \u2019s family . The first applicant \u2019s mother also strongly disagreed with ORG . On DATE the child was rushed to hospital and died on DATE as a result of complications from the ORG procedure . The first applicant did not report this death to the police because , allegedly , the NORP police would not interfere with a family tradition . Following the births of the second and third applicants , her husband \u2019s family wished ORG to be carried out on them and threatened to do so , including by attempting to abduct them to that end . She and her husband were opposed to the procedure , not least because of what had happened to their first daughter . Pressure from the family - in - law became so strong that the first applicant and her husband considered that the only way to protect their daughters was for the applicants to leave GPE . The first applicant stressed that she had not left GPE to improve their economic circumstances as she and her husband enjoyed good lives there . They left the country using an agent and on false passports . The first applicant \u2019s husband and their son remained in GPE . The applicants travelled via GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Documents later supplied by GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) immigration authorities to the NORP Minister for Justice , LAW ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) showed that the first applicant , her husband as well as the second and third applicants ( not the son ) had been granted various visas to visit the GPE but that those visas had been revoked following the applicants\u2019 claim for asylum in GPE . The applicants did not travel to the GPE , the first applicant maintaining in the asylum application in GPE that she could not protect her daughters from her family - in - law even in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were legally represented throughout the domestic proceedings outlined below , apart from certain short periods during the appeal to ORG in the \u201c subsidiary protection \u201d proceedings , when the applicants changed solicitors .", "CARDINAL . By ORG dated DATE an officer of the ORG opined that the applicants had submitted neither credible evidence of a well - founded fear of persecution in GPE nor sufficient evidence that they would encounter persecution should they return or that state protection would be withheld ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , as amended , \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Considering the country of origin information from various international and ORG reports to be \u201c contrasting \u201d , an assessment of the first applicant \u2019s credibility was necessary and was done on \u201c the balance of probabilities \u201d . The ORG found that her fears were not credible given , inter alia , the passing of the federal PERSON banning PERSON through the lower house of the NORP national assembly , the banning of ORG in CARDINAL of LOC including GPE from where the first applicant \u2019s husband originated , that ORG was declining in large urban areas ( including therefore GPE ) , that the first applicant had reported neither her first daughter \u2019s death nor any threats from her family - in - law to the police whereas research showed that the police were alive to their duties and responsibilities and , given that she was in a privileged position , socially , enabling her to afford protection to her children . Finally , the report concluded that internal flight was a material possibility in GPE . On DATE the applicants were notified of the ORG recommendation to refuse refugee status .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to the RAT . The ORG allowed them time to furnish additional documents ( \u201c the applicants\u2019 RAT documents \u201d ) which the applicants had sought to submit . These included :", "( a ) a \u201c Medical Certificate of Cause of Death \u201d dated DATE signed by PERSON of ORG . He was ORG who , according to the applicants , had delivered PERSON and who had previously refused the mother - in - law \u2019s request to carry out ORG on PERSON and who had treated her upon admission to hospital on DATE . The Certificate recorded the primary cause of PERSON \u2019s death as being \u201c cardio - pulmonary collapse \u201d and the secondary cause as \u201c profuse bleeding \u201d ;", "( b ) a Doctor \u2019s Report , also signed by PERSON and dated DATE , which recorded PERSON \u2019s normal birth , urgent admission to hospital with a \u201c history of weakness and pallor which possibly resulted from profuse bleeding after patient had undergone the traditional female circumcision \u201d and death from \u201c circulatory collapse \u201d ;", "( c ) a Death Certificate of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) dated DATE ; and", "( d ) a Certificate for Burial stamped by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following an oral hearing before the RAT the ORG appeal was rejected by decision of DATE . The ORG was satisfied that they had not demonstrated to a reasonable degree of likelihood a well - founded fear of persecution . There was no concrete foundation for the concern which had induced the applicants to seek refugee status . The first applicant had failed to seek the assistance of PERSON , her parents ( her father was a civil servant opposed to ORG ) or of any family member including her siblings . Despite the experience with the first child , the real question was whether there was a prospect of serious harm upon return for which the receiving ORG could be accountable . The ORG considered similar country of origin information as before the ORG and found that ORG protection and/or ORG supported protection would have been available to the applicants in GPE . It also found that the first applicant \u2019s credibility was undermined by a partial account of how she had travelled to and arrived in GPE , by a lack of a reasonable explanation as to why she had not claimed asylum immediately on arrival and by her failure to furnish formal identity documents or \u201c reliable documentation in support of her claim \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not seek leave to apply for judicial review of the ORG or RAT decisions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant \u2019s husband was stopped by the NORP police travelling from GPE to GPE without an entry visa for GPE . He had documentation in his name showing an address in the GPE ( bank cards , a store card , a library card and a gas payment card ) . He was removed to the GPE and , from there , to GPE on DATE . He returned DATE to the GPE on a visitor \u2019s visa .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , relying on the RAT decision , the Minister refused the applicants a declaration of refugee status . On DATE he notified them of his proposal to make deportation orders and of their entitlement to apply , within DATE , for leave to remain within the ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW , \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The applicants so applied . ORG reviewed their submissions and , thereafter , recommended that the Minister sign the deportation orders . That Unit considered that their deportation would not breach the prohibition of refoulement . The ORG relied on country of origin information including a ORG on a Joint NORP - Danish Fact - finding ORG DATE which Report recorded the view of BAOBAB ( a NORP Women \u2019s rights\u2019 non - governmental organisation \u2013 \u201c NGO \u201d ) that ORG was not a genuine ground for seeking asylum given ORG and non - State protection for women and the re - location option . The ORG also considered that no issue arose under section CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG Convention Against Torture ) Act CARDINAL ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) or in respect of the humanitarian factors listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act or under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c DATE LAW ) . The Minister signed the deportation orders on DATE . The applicants were served with those orders and with ORG reasons and were directed to attend the police immigration bureau on DATE to facilitate their deportation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants made further submissions about , inter alia , ORG in GPE and they queried the credentials of BAOBAB . Having analysed those submissions , ORG recommended confirmation of the deportation orders . The Minister accepted that recommendation . On DATE the law firm representing the applicants received the deportation orders and requested further time to consider the position . The applicants did not report to the police immigration bureau . On DATE the first applicant absconded from her accommodation to avoid arrest and the second and third applicants were taken into care . On DATE the first applicant was arrested by the police and placed in prison to facilitate deportation .", "CARDINAL . By e - mail dated DATE to the applicants , ORG denied the stance which had been attributed to them and relied upon by ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied for an extension of time and for leave to apply for judicial review . On DATE the Minister gave an undertaking not to expel the applicants pending that application and the applicant was released from detention . On DATE ORG granted the extension of time and leave because the applicants had established \u201c substantial grounds \u201d for challenging the deportation orders .", "CARDINAL . The High Court hearing on the substantive application took place on DATE . The applicants argued that the Minister should have identified the principal reasons why he had concluded that none of the applicants was at risk of torture on return and , further , that ORG should take into account , in determining the risk alleged , CARDINAL new affidavits including CARDINAL of PERSON dated DATE , which confirmed in detail the matters covered by the same doctor \u2019s documents of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was delivered on DATE . As to the applicants\u2019 first argument , ORG found that , while section CARDINAL of LAW required the Minister to consider representations made , including satisfying himself on the refoulement issue , there was no obligation to give reasons for his decision in that respect since the Minister was not carrying out an inquisitorial process ( already completed by the ORG and the RAT ) but rather exercising ORG discretion . As to the request for a re - assessment of risk by the High Court based on the new affidavit evidence , ORG held that the breadth of its review of an exercise of a ORG discretion ( as opposed to its review of decisions of the ORG and RAT ) was more limited as was , accordingly , any re - assessment of risk . Applying this level of review , ORG noted that a deportation order could be challenged in CARDINAL special circumstances : if the Minister had not considered whether section CARDINAL of LAW applied ( principle of refoulement ) ; if the Minister could not reasonably have come to the view which he did ; if an applicant had not been afforded a statutory entitlement to make representations on \u201c humanitarian grounds \u201d ; and if the Minister had failed to consider such representations within the terms of the statute or the factors set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . However , none of those circumstances applied in the present case . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to the Minister to exercise his discretion to allow them to apply for \u201c subsidiary protection \u201d under ORG Regulations DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Regulations \u201d ) . The applicants\u2019 grounds were substantially the same as their judicial review application . By letter of DATE the applicants were notified of the rejection of their application . Since the deportation orders were issued before LAW came into effect ( DATE ) , the applicants were not automatically entitled to apply for subsidiary protection . While the Minister had a discretion to consider their application if they had \u201c identified new facts or circumstances \u201d demonstrating a change of position from the date of the deportation orders ( ORG v. Minister for ORG , LAW ( [ DATE ] IEHC CARDINAL ) , they had not demonstrated grounds enabling him to exercise that discretion . Attached to the ORG letter was an analysis of the applicants\u2019 submissions by ORG : new documents submitted concerning the birth and death of PERSON were not a material change since the Minister had not challenged the cause of her death .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the Minister \u2019s refusal of subsidiary protection .", "CARDINAL . By judgment dated DATE ORG refused to grant an interlocutory injunction stopping the applicants\u2019 deportation finding , inter alia , that there was no \u201c fair question \u201d to be tried : the Minister reasonably found that there were no new facts and circumstances since the applicants had raised , on subsidiary protection , the very same fear of ORG and the very same set of circumstances that had been previously raised , examined and rejected .", "CARDINAL . Further to the ORG request , on DATE the President of ORG of this Court applied Rule CARDINAL , which application was later extended by the ORG until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the substantive judicial review application came on for hearing before the same ORG judge who had heard the injunction application . That judge acceded to the ORG request to recuse himself and a different High Court judge then heard and rejected the substantive judicial review application by judgment of DATE . The application for subsidiary protection was found not to disclose a significant change to the material circumstances pertaining on the date of the deportation orders , so that there was nothing irrational about the Minister \u2019s decision that there were no grounds for him to exercise his discretion under LAW . The applicants appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , towards DATE , and given substantial domestic publicity surrounding the applicants\u2019 case , the Minister re - opened previous investigations in GPE into the ORG claims about the birth and death of PERSON , the results of which were received after the delivery of the High Court judgment of DATE . On DATE the Minister filed CARDINAL affidavits with ORG which testified to the fact that the applicants\u2019 RAT documents ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as well as PERSON affidavit of DATE ( paragraph QUANTITY above ) , concerning he birth and death of PERSON were forgeries . Disputing the ORG claims about a child known as GPE , the Minister requested the dismissal of the appeal as an abuse of process . Those affidavits were from :", "( a ) an official of ORG in GPE who described his visit to an ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) registration office , an official of which had produced the register , had confirmed that the registration number on the alleged NPC Death Certificate of DATE did not exist and had certified that that ORG was not authentic . ORG official also met PERSON who attested to the matters included in his affidavit noted below ;", "( b ) a Detective Inspector of the NORP police who described how he had met PERSON and requested him to give his evidence by way of a sworn affidavit , which he did as noted immediately below ;", "( c ) Dr Unokanjo ( dated DATE ) . He testified to the fact that he was ORG in GPE ; that he had not signed any documents concerning PERSON ( neither a ORG dated DATE nor an affidavit of DATE ) ; that no other PERSON worked or had ever worked at the hospital ; that he recognised the first applicant from photographs shown to him ; that the hospital records ( also exhibited ) indicated that he had treated the first applicant when she delivered her first child in DATE ( those records of DATE note \u201c CARDINAL \u201d after the title \u201c FAC \u201d and the title \u201c Dead Children \u201d is left blank ) ; and that he had not delivered or subsequently treated a child called PERSON . He further testified to the fact that the first applicant had telephoned him DATE previously requesting him to issue a death certificate in respect of a deceased child of hers to enable her to be given asylum in GPE and that he had refused so to do since she had neither had any baby before DATE nor had she lost CARDINAL ; and", "( d ) an official of ORG who outlined the history of the applicants\u2019 immigration applications and claims .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant responded to the Government \u2019s affidavits of DATE by her affidavit dated DATE . She maintained her position as regards PERSON \u2019s birth and death . She admitted that the documents purportedly signed by PERSON were forgeries but she claimed that her husband who obtained them had not told her . It had never been her wish to abuse the NORP legal process .", "CARDINAL . In the same affidavit , the first applicant furnished a second set of documents purporting to certify PERSON \u2019s birth and death following ORG , which had been recently obtained by her brother and by NORP solicitors . She also claimed to be in fear for her own safety on return given the attention her case in GPE had received and the critical comments reported on NORP television and radio about her by the NORP Ambassador to GPE and the NORP Attorney General : if she was harmed , she could not protect her children in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Minister engaged CARDINAL law firms in GPE to verify the authenticity of this second set of documents of the applicants . Both firms reported that CARDINAL of those documents were not authentic :", "( a ) The affidavit of the first applicant \u2019s brother dated DATE was considered not authentic because the name of the Commissioner for Oaths appearing on it had been confirmed to be a fabrication by ORG of ORG ; and", "( b ) A \u201c Medical Certificate of Cause of Death \u201d of PERSON purportedly completed by a PERSON as well as a letter entitled \u201c Verification of Death Certificate \u201d both purportedly of ORG were considered not authentic because the Chief Medical Director of the same hospital confirmed that PERSON was not on the staff and that neither document was from the hospital .", "CARDINAL firm also found that certain documents could not be relied upon and the other firm qualified its authentication of those documents as they were not given sight of the relevant Death Register . While another document of the second set of documents ( an ORG document ) was certified as authentic by the CARDINAL firms retained by the Minister , they both pointed out that the information contained in that document was based on other documents which had not been certified as authentic . In DATE this material was filed in ORG by the Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant responded with a brief affidavit . She had requested a firm of solicitors in GPE and her brother to obtain the second set of documents attesting to the birth and death of PERSON . Those documents were obtained by her in \u201c good faith \u201d and \u201c in the belief that they were genuine \u201d . She underlined that , in seeking to obtain documentation through legitimate channels in GPE , one could unknowingly fall victim to touts issuing forged documents . If any of the documents filed were forged , the applicants apologised for that .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on the preliminary issue of whether the Minister had jurisdiction to entertain an application for subsidiary protection from persons in respect of whom deportation orders had been made before the CARDINAL Regulations came into force , on DATE ORG ( by a majority ) found that the Minister had no discretion to do so . Consequently , the substantive application did not proceed and thus no factual findings were made as regards the Minister \u2019s allegations of forgery .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the PERSON wrote to ORG expressing grave concern . Whilst not wishing to prejudge the applicants\u2019 case , the PERSON drew the ORG \u2019s attention to a number of international instruments and requested them to outline the initial steps taken to guarantee the applicants\u2019 right under those instruments and to clarify a number of matters . On DATE the ORG replied detailing the various procedures and protections available to the applicants and the history of the ORG proceedings as well as noting the present application before this ORG . In her Report of DATE , the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women responded to ORG by expressing her thanks for their reply . Nothing further issued from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides that a \u201c refugee \u201d includes a person who , owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted , is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . Section CARDINAL contains the prohibition of refoulement :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person shall not be expelled from the ORG or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where , in the opinion of the Minister , the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The reasons prohibiting the Minister from making a deportation order under LAW are virtually identical to the qualification for refugee status under LAW ( PERSON v. the Minister for Justice , ORG and Another , unreported , ORG , PERSON , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Persons seeking asylum may apply to the Minister for a declaration recognising their status as refugees . The matter is referred , for investigation , to the ORG , who may interview the candidates and prepare a report on those interviews and on the investigations carried out . The ORG delivers a recommendation which may be appealed by an unsuccessful applicant to the RAT . The RAT shall affirm the ORG \u2019s recommendation unless it is satisfied , having considered relevant matters , that the applicant is a refugee . Applicants are notified of the RAT \u2019s decision . The Minister is then notified of the RAT \u2019s decision . If the RAT \u2019s decision upholds a ORG \u2019s recommendation to refuse refugee status , the Minister may refuse to give the applicant a declaration of refugee status . A person can challenge the above series of decisions , including the Minister \u2019s decision , through a request for leave to apply for judicial review , the scope of , and procedure for , which is set down in section CARDINAL of LAW , DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act confers on the Minister the power to make a deportation order but only once he has considered and rejected the \u201c humanitarian \u201d factors listed in LAW and satisfied himself that the deportation would not breach the prohibition of refoulement ( contained in LAW ) . In Baby O v. the Minister for ORG , LAW ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL I.R. CARDINAL ) ORG found , per PERSON , that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act simply required the Minister to satisfy himself as to the refoulement issue before making a deportation order and that there was no obligation on the Minister to set out detailed reasons for so satisfying himself .", "CARDINAL .
