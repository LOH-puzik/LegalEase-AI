After the death of PERSON , the action was pursued by his heirs , PERSON and PERSON . The applicants sought a declaration that they were the rightful owners of the house and appurtenant land that the ORG had , in their opinion , wrongfully seized in DATE . They claimed that , under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , property belonging to persons in certain social categories was not subject to nationalisation , and that they fell within such a category . In their view , the nationalisation of the house in question had therefore been improper and unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG Instance dismissed the applicants ' action , refusing to rule on the merits on the ground that they could not obtain redress for the damage they had sustained until the enactment of special legislation introducing reparation measures . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The applicants appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the tenants of the flats making up the house applied to purchase them , relying on Law no . CARDINAL . ORG informed the NORP company that a dispute was pending concerning the title to the house and instructed it not to pursue the sale of the flats in question .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Mr and PERSON applied to intervene in ORG proceedings on the ground that they had been the owners of flat no . CARDINAL since its sale on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further to the couple 's application to intervene , the applicants requested the court to find that the sale of flat no . CARDINAL was null and void . In their view , as the nationalisation had been improper and unlawful , the ORG could not have been the rightful owner of the property and thus could not lawfully have sold any part of it . The applicants relied in particular on LAW , whereby an undertaking entered into on an erroneous or unlawful basis could not produce any useful effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the nationalisation of the house had been unlawful and that the applicants were therefore the rightful owners .

It partly allowed the applicants ' appeal in so far as it found the nationalisation to have been unlawful and acknowledged that they had remained the rightful owners of the property . However , it dismissed the appeal as regards the rescission of the sale of flat no . CARDINAL , considering that the ORG had been presumed to be the owner of the property at the time of the sale , in spite of the dispute over the property that was pending in the courts . It moreover relied on the fact that PERSON no . LANGUAGE , which had formed the statutory basis for the sale of the property , did not provide for any penalty in respect of property sold when the title to it was in dispute before the courts . ORG did not address the applicants ' argument relating to the principle of unjust enrichment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

Under NORP law , an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property . Such action is not governed per se by statute but has emerged from case - law . An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it . The main outcome of such an action , if successful , is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant 's title to the property , with retrospective effect , thus obliging the defendant to return the property . If physical restitution is no longer possible , that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum ( see , for example , PERSON , ORG \u015fi dezmembr\u0103mintele sale ( Ownership and its Attributes ) , PERSON , ORG , pp .

CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In legal systems derived from NORP law there is an equitable rule that when a person has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another , the latter may claim compensation in the amount by which that person has been enriched ( see PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , Droit civil : les obligations ( Civil Law : Obligations ) , ORG , CARDINALth edition , DATE , pp . DATE , and PERSON , ORG civil : PERSON general\u0103 a obliga\u0163iilor ( Civil Law : General theory of obligations ) , PERSON , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Whilst an action for tortious liability enables the injured party to claim exact reparation for the loss sustained as a result of negligence on the part of an enriched person , in an action for unjust enrichment the claimant can only seek an amount corresponding to the other party 's gain , provided that some pecuniary benefit has been obtained , without just cause , at the expense of the claimant ( see GPE , PERSON and GPE , op . cit . , p.
