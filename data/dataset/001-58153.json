{"ITEMID": "001-58153", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GRC", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1998, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF HORNSBY v. GREECE (ARTICLE 50)", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Damage - financial award;Costs and expenses - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "John Freeland;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG allowed in part the ORG claims in the action for damages against the ORG , brought on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the principal judgment ) . It held inter alia :", "\u201c It appears from the documents in the file and particularly from the accounts \u2026 of the limited partnership \u2018 NORP and PERSON and Co\u2019 that during the whole of the period concerned the plaintiffs \u2026 were running a private foreign language school , despite the defendant \u2019s refusal to grant them the relevant authorisation . It is therefore not possible to prove the damage they alleged they had sustained in the form of loss of profit , particularly the school fees they would have expected to receive had it not been for the defendant \u2019s unlawful conduct , since they were in fact carrying on the activity for which the relevant administrative authority had refused a licence \u2026", "Regard being had to the above considerations , neither the alleged damage nor the existence of any loss of profit can be proved . For these reasons , the action must be dismissed as unfounded \u2026", "On the other hand , ORG considers that the defendant \u2019s repeated unlawful refusals to grant the GPE legitimate request \u2013 which amounts to a flagrant breach of the provisions of ORG law \u2013 and the refusal to comply with the judgments of ORG of ORG and ORG caused the plaintiffs stress over a long period . It therefore considers it appropriate to award each of them MONEY in respect of non - pecuniary damage , to which sum is to be added interest at the statutory rate from the commencement of the action , that is from DATE , when notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 application to the civil courts was served on the defendant \u2026 Lastly , the ORG request for the present judgment to be made immediately enforceable must be rejected because the conditions laid down in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL have not been satisfied in the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By an application lodged with ORG of ORG on DATE , ORG had brought an action under LAW for a declaration that , by maintaining in force the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the Minister for Education and ORG ( as subsequently amended ) , the ORG had failed to fulfil its obligations under ORG law , in particular the provisions on movement of workers within the ORG . In its judgment of DATE ORG held :", "\u201c The above - mentioned NORP provisions impose , in respect of recruitment of teachers in private foreign - language schools , more stringent conditions on foreigners , including nationals of other Member GPE , than they do on NORP nationals .", "Decision no . DATE thus provides that the recruitment of foreign teachers requires authorisation by ORG following submission of certain documents specified in the decision . Renewal of authorisation is also subject to the submission of several documents , including a medical certificate .", "Furthermore , paragraphs ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW no CARDINAL/CARDINAL provide that only persons possessing the qualifications required of teachers within public education may teach in a private school . The competent Minister may , however , decide that the qualifications of NORP nationals who do not satisfy that condition are adequate .", "\u2026", "GPE does not deny that the disputed rules are incompatible with Community law . It does , however , point out that LAW making the recruitment of nationals of other Member GPE subject to the same conditions as those required for employment of NORP nationals will be published shortly and that consequently the proceedings will serve no purpose .", "That argument can not be accepted . It is settled case - law \u2026 that amendments of national legislation are irrelevant for the purposes of giving judgment on the subject - matter of an action for failure to fulfil obligations if they have not been implemented before the expiry of the period set by the reasoned opinion .", "A declaration of failure to fulfil obligations must therefore be made in the terms sought by the Commission . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has decided to refer GPE to ORG of ORG , requesting it to impose financial penalties for failure to apply CARDINAL judgments concerning infringements of ORG rules on the recognition of qualifications , namely the requirement that persons wishing to open private foreign - language schools , or to become directors of or teachers in such schools , must pass an examination in NORP language and history ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
