On DATE the applicant was transferred from the Central prison in PERSON to serve his sentence in P\u0101rlielupe prison in GPE . According to the applicant , soon after his arrival at P\u0101rlielupe prison he began to have disagreements with the administration of the prison and with his cellmates . It appears that the primary cause of conflict was the fact that almost all of the prisoners and staff at P\u0101rlielupe prison spoke NORP . According to the applicant , their knowledge of LANGUAGE \u2013 the official language of GPE and the applicant \u2019s native language DATE was limited or non - existent . The applicant made numerous requests to be transferred to a place of imprisonment where he could freely communicate in NORP . However , all his requests to that effect were rejected .", "CARDINAL . It furthermore appears that at the relevant time the applicant frequently made dismissive and disparaging oral remarks concerning the NORP minority of GPE . Similar statements were also included in the applicant \u2019s correspondence with ORG authorities and in articles which he regularly published in an extreme right - wing magazine . As a result , other inmates became hostile towards the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from P\u0101rlielupe prison to GPE prison after the governor of P\u0101rlielupe prison had written a report in which it was noted that the applicant \u201c constantly provoke[d ] conflicts with the administration of the prison by sending unsubstantiated complaints to various NORP newspapers \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

He also pointed out that he was not receiving the same level of spiritual support as the prisoners belonging to the NORP faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to the governor of P\u0101rlielupe prison . He explained that in prison he worked as a cobbler .

He furthermore complained that in his cell he was unable to read religious writings because of his cellmates\u2019 tendency to discuss their immoral lifestyles by using countless swear words . He invoked Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and requested to be placed in a separate ( individual ) cell . It appears that he did not receive any written response .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant complained to ORG ( PERSON vietu p\u0101rvalde ) of being mocked and humiliated by the prison staff and his fellow prisoners because of his religious beliefs . He invoked Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and complained that the circumstances in his cell and the negative attitude of his cellmates prevented him from devoting himself to meditation and studies of Vaishnavism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy governor of ORG replied to the applicant by explaining that it was not appropriate to perform religious rituals in a common cell , since it might disturb other prisoners . However , the applicant was informed that the administration of the prison would set aside a specific time for him to visit the prison chapel or another appropriate space so that he would be alone for praying , reading religious literature , and meditating . According to the applicant , that never happened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy governor of ORG responded to an enquiry from ORG for information about the applicant . The letter referred to an unspecified prison where the applicant had been held and indicated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ the applicant \u2019s ] religious activities create tense situations .

During a search of the applicant \u2019s belongings at Mat\u012bsa prison on DATE a guard found and confiscated some incense sticks .

The record of the search contains a space for any objections that the prisoner might have . The applicant signed the record but the space for objections was left blank .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the president of LAW asking for an explanation of certain religious rituals that several prisoners had sought to perform in prisons . Namely , ORG wished to ascertain whether Vaishnavism required a twice - daily loud chanting of mantras for TIME . The president of the R\u012bga Chapter responded on DATE . He explained that there existed CARDINAL methods for praying to PERSON . The first \u2013 japa DATE involves the repetition of a mantra in a soft voice by using prayer beads . The second \u2013 kirtan DATE is chanting of the PERSON mantra at a regular volume . Typically kirtan is performed by a group of devotees as a form of a religious service .

Concerning the latter , members of the ORG congregation had explained to representatives of the ORG that some of the basic rituals of Vaishnavism were the burning of incense sticks , a DATE washing , a special diet , studies of religious writings , and meetings with other followers of Vaishnavism . The obligation to observe those rituals was , however , conditional . For instance , if circumstances did not permit it , the burning of incense sticks was not mandatory . According to the members of the congregation , in a prison environment it would recommendable for a follower of Vaishnavism to be placed in a single cell , since the observance of the religious rituals in a shared cell could incite a negative attitude among other prisoners . Concerning religious literature , the members of the congregation affirmed that upon request religious writings could and would be sent to inmates . Lastly , concerning the dietary requirements it was emphasised that the ban on eating meat products was particularly significant for followers of Vaishnavism .", "CARDINAL .
