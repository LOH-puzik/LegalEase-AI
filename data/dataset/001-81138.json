The first applicant requested that an extra - ordinary complaint be filed against the above decision imposing a fine for his refusal to make statement as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor at ORG dismissed the request . In his letter the public prosecutor summed up the relevant facts as follows . On DATE the first applicant had to be heard as a witness in the context of criminal proceedings K\u00daV-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL against Mr I. Those proceedings concerned an unlawful sale of bills of exchange , in DATE , which had resulted in the transfer of approximately SKK CARDINAL to the account of the company ILaS Vranov , ORG . on DATE . The offences imputed to the accused comprised also several other actions including the misuse , in DATE , of bonds issued by a company of which PERSON had been the director and transfer of that company 's assets to several persons including the applicant .

NORP The public prosecutor held that a witness could remain silent only to the extent that a specific part of his statement was susceptible of resulting in the introduction of criminal proceedings against the witness or his or her next of kin . As the first applicant had had no apparent reason for refusing to make a witness statement , and since he had given no specific reason for such a refusal , the decision imposing a procedural fine had been justified .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant filed a complaint against the decision imposing a fine on him . He argued , with reference to the record of the interview with the investigator , that he had remained silent as he had considered that a statement could give rise to criminal proceedings against him . The fine amounted to the application of psychological pressure to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Deputy Prosecutor dismissed the second applicant 's complaint . The decision stated that the applicant had not given any reason for his refusal to make a statement . Under LAW of LAW , a witness was obliged to inform the investigator why he or she refused to make a statement . Where the investigator did not accept the reasons invoked , the witness was obliged to answer the questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant petitioned ORG for a complaint in the interest of the law to be filed on his behalf . He challenged the above procedural fine . The fact that the same investigator had accused him of an offence on DATE proved that the fine had been imposed with a view to coercing the second applicant to make a statement on the relevant facts .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE a public prosecutor of ORG refused to file an extra - ordinary complaint on the second applicant 's behalf for reasons similar to those set out above in respect of the petition filed by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a different public prosecutor of ORG confirmed that conclusion . The letter stated , in particular , that the interview in question had concerned offences imputed to other persons and that the second applicant , therefore , had had no valid reason for refusing to answer the questions . The offence of which the second applicant had been accused subsequently concerned facts different from those on which he had been asked to make a witness statement .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c A witness is entitled to refuse to make a statement where such a statement would entail the risk that criminal proceedings would be brought against him , against his relative in direct line , his sibling , a person whom the witness adopted or by whom he was adopted , against the spouse or partner of such a witness or against any other person with whom the witness has family - like relations and whose harm the witness would justifiably perceive as being his own harm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The domestic authorities have held that a person who wishes to remain silent pursuant to LAW must state the reason for his or her refusal to make a statement . The decision whether or not such a person 's recourse to LAW is justified lies with the authority by whom the witness is to be heard . Where the authority concerned does not accept the reasons invoked , the witness is obliged to make a statement .", "CARDINAL . Where the refusal of a witness to make a statement is justified , an investigator can not circumvent the witness 's right to remain silent by inquiring into the reasons for such a refusal and facts related to the subject - matter of the envisaged interrogation , and by mentioning those facts subsequently in TIME of the interrogation .
