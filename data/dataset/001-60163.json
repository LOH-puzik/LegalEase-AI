The applicants are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live at GPE ) . They are married and have CARDINAL daughters : PERSON , who was born on DATE , and PERSON , who was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and their CARDINAL daughters had lived since the girls ' birth with PERSON parents and his unmarried brother on an old farm . PERSON works on a poultry farm . PERSON used to work in a factory , but since losing her job has stayed at home to look after the children and do the housework .", "The applicants had attended a special school for people with learning difficulties ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Owing to their late physical and , above all , mental development , the girls underwent a series of medical examinations . On the advice of CARDINAL of the doctors and at the applicants ' request , they received educational assistance and support from DATE . Thus , from DATE PERSON , the elder daughter , received educational assistance ( PERSON ) , while from DATE respectively , both girls attended a day - nursery school for children with special needs ( Heilp\u00e4dagogischer Kindergarten ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , PERSON , a social worker ( sozialp\u00e4dagogische PERSON ) visited the applicants ' family at home , officially for TIME a week . The applicants say that she actually spent TIME there , as the time she spent travelling had to be taken into account . Relations between her and the applicants rapidly deteriorated , which the applicants say resulted in her preparing a very negative report on them .", "CARDINAL . PERSON report to ORG ( PERSON ) did indeed emphasise negative points : the applicants ' intellectual shortcomings , conflictual relations between the family members and the contempt that , initially at least , she had been shown by the family .", "CARDINAL . Following that report ORG made an application on DATE to ORG ( Vormundschaftsgericht ) for an order withdrawing the applicants ' parental responsibility for their CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed PERSON , a psychologist , to give expert evidence . He delivered his report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing evidence from the applicants and the grandparents , ORG made an interlocutory order ( einstweilige Anordnung ) withdrawing the applicants ' rights to decide where their children should live ( Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht ) or to take decisions regarding the children 's health ( ORG zur GPE \u00fcber \u00e4rztliche PERSON ) , notably on the ground that \u201c [ the applicants did ] not have the intellectual capacity required to bring up their children properly \u201d ( \u201c die Kindeseltern sind intellektuell nicht in PERSON , ihre NORP ordnungsgem\u00e4ss zu erziehen \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the girls were placed in the care of the assessment team ( PERSON ) of a private association at Meppen ( PERSON f\u00fcr familienorientierte PERSON ) , which was part of ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr familienorientierte Sozialp\u00e4dagogik ) .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated CARDINAL and DATE , the chairwoman of the executive board of the society , PERSON , also requested that the applicants ' parental responsibility be withdrawn on the ground that , while the children 's IQ was expected to decrease , a new home would afford them a chance to enjoy a relationship that would stimulate the development of their social skills and intelligence ( eine Verflachung des IQ 's ist vorprogrammiert , eine Chance haben die NORP durch eine neue GPE , in der \u00fcber die LAW f\u00fcr die Sozial- und FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing further evidence from the applicants and the grandparents , ORG withdrew the applicants ' parental rights ( PERSON ) over their CARDINAL children . It relied notably on the finding in the psychologist 's report that the applicants were not fit to bring up their children , not through any fault of their own ( unverschuldet erziehungsunf\u00e4hig ) , but because they did not possess the requisite intellectual capacity .", "ORG found that the applicants lacked the necessary awareness to answer their children 's needs . Moreover , they were opposed to receiving any support from social services and , far from being genuine , the consent they had now given to the measures that had been taken was merely a reaction to the pressure they had felt as a result of the proceedings .", "ORG added that the children 's development was so retarded that it could not be corrected by the grandparents or support from social services . Only a foster home DATE and in PERSON 's case this would have to be a professional foster home ( professionelle PERSON ) DATE could help the QUANTITY children , as any less radical measures would be inadequate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL girls were placed with separate , unidentified ( IncognitoPflege ) foster parents ( PERSON ) on the register held by ORG , which had produced a report on CARDINAL and DATE requesting that the applicants ' parental responsibility for their children be withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . In letters of DATE , DATE and DATE the applicants ' family doctors said that they considered that the children should be returned to the applicants ' care .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( Landgericht ) against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE PERSON attended a course to qualify as a childminder ( Qualifizierungskurs f\u00fcr PERSON ) ; she completed the course and received a certificate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert in psychology from ORG ( Deutscher Kinderschutzbund ) , a private organisation from which the applicants had sought help , also expressed the view that the children should be returned to their family and receive extra educational support from social services .", "CARDINAL . After these views had been expressed , ORG appointed Mr Trennheuser as a second expert witness in psychology on DATE . He delivered his report on DATE . ORG also heard evidence from the applicants , the grandparents , the relevant authority and the expert witness .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal on the ground that the relevant provisions of LAW ( Articles DATE and DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) governing the protection of children 's interests were satisfied .", "ORG referred to the CARDINAL reports by the experts in psychology .", "According to the first report , which had been lodged with ORG on DATE , the applicants were incapable of bringing up their children because of their own deficiencies and because they felt out of their depth . Bringing in persons from outside the family circle to assist would merely exacerbate existing tensions between the parents and their daughters and the applicants ' sense of insecurity . The family was dominated by the grandparents and the applicants were unable to project an image of authority for their children . Moreover , the grandparents , who were incapable of offering support to their own children ( the applicants ) , were no more capable of remedying the intellectual deficiencies presented by their grandchildren .", "According to the second expert report \u2013 the CARDINAL delivered on DATE \u2013 the girls were DATE behind in their general development , a factor that was discernible in particular from their speech , which consisted of stammering . Had they not benefited from DATE of support from the educational and social services , they would probably have ended up in a special school for the mentally disabled and would have been unable to develop normally or lead a normal adult life . The applicants were incapable of helping their daughters to develop their personalities , as they were ill - equipped to understand them or to treat them in an appropriate manner . Scientific studies had shown that parents with deficiencies of that type prevented the development of emotional ties between them and their children . In particular , the knowledge and skills acquired at school were in danger of being stifled in the family environment . The applicants had done no more than to tend to the children 's basic needs . There was a risk that in the future the parents would become increasingly aggressive towards their children . Regard being had to all those considerations , separating the children from the family was the only way of eliminating all danger to the children 's welfare ( Gef\u00e4hrdung des Kindeswohls ) .", "ORG noted that the expert witnesses had reached the same conclusion following a thorough analysis . The second expert witness had had due regard to the fact that the applicants had contacted ORG and that PERSON had attended a childminding course . However , those factors were not sufficient to enable ORG to rule out all risk of the children 's development being harmed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicants ' appeal , holding that there had been no breach of the law . The courts concerned had heard representations from the parties , relied on reports by CARDINAL expert witnesses and had taken into account the educational assistance measures that had already been implemented , the expert psychological report lodged by ORG on behalf of the applicants and the opinion of the family doctors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - member committee of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) dismissed an appeal by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Riedl , a professor of educational sciences and Director of ORG at ORG , lodged a report as an expert witness appointed on behalf of the applicants in which he concluded that the children 's welfare was not in danger and that the applicants were entirely fit to bring up their children , both emotionally and intellectually . He said in particular that the family provided a successful example of cohabitation DATE that was desired , planned and well - organised in satisfactory material conditions and in circumstances that permitted both individual and social fulfilment ( \u201c die PERSON bietet somit ein gegl\u00fccktes ORG f\u00fcr das gewollte , geplante und wohlorganisierte PERSON in geordneten wirtschaftlichen ORG und unter positiven individuellen PERSON \u201d ) . He added that additional measures of educational support could largely compensate for the ground the children would have to make up at school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , also at the request of that association , Mr Giese , a professor of law at ORG for the Assessment of Physical and Mental Damage ( NORP f\u00fcr GPE ) , produced a further expert report on behalf of the applicants , in which he concluded that the procedure followed by the NORP courts in the instant case had contravened Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . As the children had been placed in unidentified foster homes , the applicants were unable to see them for DATE .", "CARDINAL . They then made an application to ORG , which on DATE granted them visiting rights of TIME a month despite opposition from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to what had been ordered by ORG , visits were conducted in the presence of CARDINAL representatives from various social services departments and associations . Subsequently , their number decreased , but ORG insisted on visits being accompanied ( begleitetes PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicants made various attempts to obtain permission to see their children at DATE or at the start of their eldest daughter 's school year , but ORG refused . The applicants applied to ORG and were granted permission to see their eldest daughter at the beginning of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made a fresh application to the ORG seeking the right to visit their children for TIME at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed their application . It sought a further report from another psychologist , PERSON , in order to establish to what extent and to whom further visiting rights should be granted .", "CARDINAL . DATE Additional information supplied by the parties after the ORG had delivered its admissibility decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) indicates that in her report of CARDINAL DATE PERSON recommended that the applicants ' visiting rights should be increased to TIME a month and that the grandparents should also be permitted to take part in visits once DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the ORG requested the parties to indicate whether they accepted the psychologist 's proposal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG said that the applicants would be granted visiting rights in accordance with the arrangements proposed by the psychologist .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the applicants asked ORG to issue a decision on the merits .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG took formal note that an agreement had been reached between the parties concerning the applicants ' rights to visit their children and held that it was unnecessary to determine the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the applicants asked PERSON , who as the ORG representative acted as the children 's guardian , to meet them in order to discuss various issues such as the children 's physical and psychological development , arrangements for visiting rights , and a christening ceremony that had been arranged in their home village .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON declined such a meeting in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , saying that the applicants could observe their children 's progress for themselves during visits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote to ORG requesting it to terminate ORG appointment as guardian and to name an independent expert in its place .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE PERSON rejected the criticism directed at him by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . In a reply of CARDINAL DATE the applicants said that ORG had systematically sought to separate them from their children for good , whereas the opinion of the majority of the experts had been that separation could only be temporary and that the children needed their family of origin . They added that if the experts considered that contact of TIME a month under strict supervision was sufficient , then the expert evidence was of little value . Lastly , Ms Sperschneider had spent in TIME with the applicants and had shown no interest in what they really thought .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE a court clerk ( PERSON ) replied to the applicants , informing them that ORG had rejected their application .", "CARDINAL .
