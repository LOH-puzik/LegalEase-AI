The first applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in CARDINAL ... and lives in GPE . The second applicant , PERSON , a NORP national , is his common - law wife who was born in CARDINAL .... The other CARDINAL applicants are their minor children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , once active in a drug - trafficking mafia run by NORP in a NORP country and subsequently in hiding in GPE under a false identity , was apprehended by the NORP police . It is disputed whether he turned himself in or was arrested . He admitted to various offences he had committed and gave information , secretly , about the activities of the mafia in question , enabling prosecution against it . He was offered a plea bargain which he accepted . Subsequently the NORP prosecution , despite his complaints , joined his own case to the one conducted against the criminals he had been informing about . This required him to appear in open court , disclose his identity and act publicly as a collaborator of justice .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since this event apparently resulted in the applicants being exposed to vengeance from the NORP mafia , the family was enrolled in ORG Scheme on DATE . The agreement on their enrolment contained a clause to the effect that if it was cancelled on account of a breach of the rules of the Scheme by the first applicant , the whole family would be excluded from the Scheme .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the Scheme , the following measures of special protection were introduced , in compliance with section DATE ) of Act no . ORG of DATE on ORG for Participants in Criminal Proceedings and Collaborators of Justice ( \u201c LAW DATE \u201d ) . The applicants were issued with new personal documents as part of providing them with new identities .", "PERSON and the children were accommodated in a CARDINAL - room , then in a CARDINAL - room \u2018 safe flat\u2019 and finally in a CARDINAL - room family house . The CARDINAL elder children attended school , while the youngest child \u2013 who suffers from medium - grade autism \u2013 attended a cr\u00e8che providing special care , then a kindergarten . The applicants submitted that , in any case , no adequate care was provided in respect of this child \u2019s condition DATE an assertion disputed by the Government . They further alleged that during this time the Scheme \u2019s operatives insisted that the first and second applicant should break up their relationship .", "CARDINAL . On or some time after their admission to the Scheme , the family \u2013 having otherwise no regular income in excess of the various welfare allowances due under the law \u2013 started to receive a DATE subsistence allowance . Their rent , public utility bills , health care and schooling costs ( including those related to the situation of the youngest child , in particular the fee of a teacher specialised in developing pedagogy ) were wholly or partly paid by the Scheme . Resources were allotted to the children \u2019s clothing , the maintenance of the family \u2019s car and their travel costs incurred when visiting the first applicant , who was in detention . The latter also received a sort of allowance with regard to his participation in the Scheme . The amounts of these disbursements were raised several times .", "CARDINAL . During this time , the first applicant was imprisoned in an unspecified jail . As to his contact history during the programme , the Government submitted that the family had kept regular contact with him through emailing , phone calls and in the form of DATE visits ( TIME as per the witness protection agreement ) . If a visit was , for some reason , omitted , it was substituted either by another occasion or by prolonging the next visit . The last time the first applicant and his family met while the programme was running was on DATE . The next visit , scheduled for DATE , was cancelled due to the illness of the youngest child . Arrangements for a substitute visit could not be made , since on CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was found in the possession of prohibited articles ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and subjected to a DATE , then a DATE confinement ; and on DATE the applicants\u2019 enrolment in the programme was cancelled altogether .", "DATE after his enrolment in the Scheme in DATE , the first applicant \u2019s whereabouts were communicated to his lawyer ; the latter subsequently attended several of his meetings with operatives of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted that during his trial his mother was assaulted at her home in GPE and the perpetrators made it clear to him , in an unknown manner , that the assault was in connection with him being a collaborator of justice . He emphasised that he did not change his mind about becoming a collaborator of justice although a significant sum of \u2018 blood money\u2019 had been set by the NORP mafia on his head because of this , and his parents had been \u2013 and still were \u2013 being harassed by the NORP authorities and the mafia .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the operatives of the Scheme carried out , as is the standard practice , a careful assessment of potential threats to the applicants , including interviewing some of the first applicant \u2019s relatives . However , although the first applicant repeatedly mentioned the setting of \u2018 blood CARDINAL of CARDINAL on his head by NORP mafia men , no evidence corroborated this allegation in the eyes of the authorities . In the applicants\u2019 view , the gathering of information in this respect was insufficient .", "CARDINAL . After numerous hearings held DATE and DATE , on DATE ORG convicted the first applicant , as a member of a criminal organisation consisting of another QUANTITY persons , of aggravated abuse of narcotics and of firearms and other offences and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment . In the reasoning of its CARDINAL-page judgment , ORG relied inter alia on testimonies given by numerous experts and witnesses , including that of the first applicant , physical evidence , documents and information obtained through secret surveillance .", "On DATE ORG reduced the first applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE .", "On DATE ORG aggravated the first applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE .", "Some of the persons who , in the authorities\u2019 perception , represented a threat to the applicants were convicted in the same proceedings .", "CARDINAL . During his ensuing detention , on CARDINAL DATE a laptop computer and a mobile internet device , held without authorisation , were found by the guards in his cell . He was caught in the act of communication using a voice - over - internet service . It could not be established how the prohibited devices had been smuggled into the penitentiary . The identities of the person or persons the first applicant had communicated with could not be determined with certainty either . The authorities nevertheless deduced from the first applicant \u2019s oral statements and the circumstances that he might have maintained contacts with criminal circles .", "CARDINAL . As a sanction , the entire family was excluded from the Scheme on DATE . This was explained by the fact that , by carrying out illicit communications , the first applicant had seriously breached the clauses of the agreement with the Scheme . It was found that , by virtue of this exposure , he had become a source of danger in the first place for his family and also for the operatives of the Scheme . It was also recalled that the co - operation between him and the Scheme operatives had gradually become very difficult , since he had kept complaining about various matters and demanded advantages not provided in the protection agreement or their better implementation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Scheme \u2019s operatives visited PERSON and informed her about the termination of the programme and of the protection measures , and about the fact that their original identities would simultaneously be restored .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the agreement with the first applicant had been cancelled because of him having repeatedly breached its provisions , rather than because the threat to him and his family had diminished . In any case , in their view , this threat had indeed decreased on account of the apprehension of those persons who represented a danger for the applicants . The applicants contested this view , submitting that , despite these incarcerations , the criminal organisation which was after the first applicant was still active and posing a real threat .", "CARDINAL . The Government further submitted that after the applicants\u2019 exclusion from the programme , another scheme called \u201c personal protection \u201d had been put in place for them , in application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Government Decree no . CARDINAL . ( II.CARDINAL . ) . They had continued benefiting from the house , the car , the telephone line and the computer and other items as well as the allowances during the transitional period of DATE or so . ORG Scheme had arranged for returning their original documents and the withdrawal of cover documents , and taken the requisite steps with regard to the maintenance , under their original names , of the family \u2019s health and social care and the children \u2019s schooling . The family \u2019s public utility bills due for DATE had been paid by the Scheme , which had also assisted them in moving house , including the provision of free transport and free temporary storage facilities . For the first applicant , \u201c personal protection \u201d consisted of his relocation to the strict - regime department of PERSON which is physically separated from the rest of the institution . Here , he has been placed in a cell of QUANTITY ; the view from the window is blocked ; he is entitled to have an open - air walk once a day for an hour .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that , the programme having been terminated irrespective of the persistent threat , no real care had been taken of Ms ORG and the children . The latter were bound to return to school under their real names ; and , inevitably , the fact that the family had been in witness protection for DATE must have been revealed as a consequence of this . The measures of \u201c special protection \u201d had included nothing but an emergency phone number available to PERSON and scarce visits paid to the family by police officers enquiring if anything was wrong . The family \u2019s personal particulars and whereabouts became accessible to anyone .", "CARDINAL . Act no .
